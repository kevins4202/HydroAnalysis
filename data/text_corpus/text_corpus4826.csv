24130,a set of nine regional ocean model simulations at various horizontal from 1 to 9 km and vertical from 25 to 150 layers resolutions with different vertical mixing parameterizations is carried out to examine the transport and mixing of a passive tracer released near the ocean bottom over the continental slope in the northern gulf of mexico the release location is in proximity to the deepwater horizon oil well that ruptured in april 2010 horizontal and diapycnal diffusivities are calculated and their dependence on the model set up and on the representation of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations is discussed horizontal and vertical resolutions play a comparable role in determining the modeled horizontal diffusivities vertical resolution is key to a proper representation of passive tracer propagation and in the case of the gulf of mexico contributes to both confining the tracer along the continental slope and limiting its vertical spreading the choice of the tracer advection scheme is also important with positive definiteness in the tracer concentration being achieved at the price of spurious mixing across density surfaces in all cases however the diapycnal mixing coefficient derived from the model simulations overestimates the observed value indicating an area where model improvement is needed keywords near bottom circulation continental slope vertical resolution horizontal resolution roms gulf of mexico 1 introduction in 2010 the blowout of the deepwater horizon dwh well at the macondo prospect mississippi canyon block 252 mc 252 in the de soto canyon about 70 km offshore the southeast coast of louisiana caused a massive release of oil estimated between 6 and 8 10 5 tons joye et al 2011 mcnutt et al 2012 the uniqueness of the spill was not only the amount but also its depth as it occurred in the open ocean approximately 1500 m below the surface while the majority of the released oil rose to the surface about a third remained confined in an underwater plume found between 1000 and 1300 m kleindienst et al 2015 joye et al 2011 about six weeks after the blowout the deep plume extended over an area at least 35 km long and 2 km wide camilli et al 2010 from a modeling perspective the deepwater horizon disaster presented opportunities and challenges it was realized that on one hand a realistic representation of mesoscale structures did not guarantee an adequate forecasting of surface oil trajectories even for an enclosed sea such as the gulf of mexico gom joye et al 2016 and on the other our understanding of the modeling requirements to properly simulate transport and mixing both at the ocean surface and along the continental shelf was limited liu et al 2011 mariano et al 2011 at the ocean surface images of oil slicks in spring 2010 pointed to the prevalence of structures in the submesoscale range 0 1 10 km hours to few days that control mixing in the northern gulf not only during january and february when the mixed layer is deepest callies et al 2015 mensa et al 2013 but also in june august when the freshwater from the spring maximum riverine outflow reaches offshore luo et al 2016 at depth the dwh incident challenged our understanding of the transport and mixing processes along the continental slope and our ability to properly represent them in ocean circulation models observations of the deep water plume that resulted from various campaigns immediately following the rupture of the wellhead in 2010 allowed the mapping of the oil directionality but were insufficient to determine lateral and diapycnal mixing rates camilli et al 2010 diercks et al 2010 to gain such information in august 2012 the gulf of mexico integrated spill response gisr consortium http research gulfresearchinitiative org research awards projects pid 137 injected a passive dye nearby the spill site at approximately 1100 m a depth comparable to that of the dwh deep oil plume the tracer was then followed over twelve months with a first cruise four months since its release ledwell et al 2016 this experiment revealed that diapycnal mixing along the complex continental slope of the northern gulf of mexico was generally greater than observed in a handful of previous open ocean studies e g ledwell et al 1993 1998 polzin and ferrari 2004 sundermeyer and price 1998 sundermeyer et al 2005 and comparable to values found in portions of the drake passage mashayek et al 2017 a key motivation of this research is to establish modeling requirements that allow a representation of dispersion as reliably as possible in the event of future release of oil and gas into the gulf at depth several modeling studies have focused on the factors that affected the time oil stayed in the water column from microbial decay adcroft et al 2010 to oil droplet size variable oil flow rates from the wellhead vertical current velocity and biodegradation lindo atichati et al 2016 north et al 2015 but less attention has been placed on evaluating how the configuration of the circulation model may impact the overall dispersion in this paper we will therefore explore the role of vertical and horizontal resolutions and vertical mixing parameterizations as well as tracer advection schemes in the representation of tracer dispersion intended here as tracer transport and mixing along the continental slope in the northern gulf we will focus on the representation of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations in the different configurations their vertical confinement along the continental slope and how they impact tracer dispersion recently stewart et al 2017 investigated vertical grid requirements to best suit horizontal resolution capabilities and found that at least 50 vertical levels are needed to resolve the first baroclinic mode with an additional 25 levels per subsequent mode stewart and coauthors however focused their evaluation on the representation of sea surface height overturning streamfunction and barotropic and baroclinic kinetic energy the impacts of horizontal and vertical resolution on the representation of tracer transport and mixing along the continental slope in ocean models remain relatively unexplored this is due in part to the fact that measurements of lateral and diapcynal dispersion in the deep oceans are quite rare e g kunze et al 2006 polzin et al 1997 waterhouse et al 2014 and in the gulf are limited to the study by ledwell et al 2016 nevertheless modeling tracer dispersion along continental slopes is relevant to a variety of applications from predicting pathways of pollutants and the mixing of sediments and nutrients into the water column to projections of ocean oxygen and carbon storage in coastal areas we shall show that both vertical and horizontal resolutions are important in realistic simulations of tracer dispersion with the former playing a greater role in determining how diapycnal mixing is modeled 2 gulf of mexico circulation to a first approximation the circulation in the gulf is that of a two layer system the upper layer extends to about 800 1200 m depth and its most prominent features are the anticyclonic loop current lc and the rings or loop eddies that detach from the lc at irregular intervals vukovich 2012 in contrast the mean circulation of the bottom layer is cyclonic off the continental slope or south of 26 n cardona and bracco 2016 dehaan and sturges 2005 hamilton 1990 weatherly 2004 and vertically coherent hamilton 2009 while it is characterized by numerous closed recirculations along the slope fig 1 these recirculations are predominantly but not exclusively cyclonic generated by the interaction of the flow with the complex bathymetry bracco et al 2016 along the continental slope topographic rossby waves trws and vortex stretching contribute to the local in time and space intensification of the currents dehaan and sturges 2005 dukhovskoy et al 2009 hamilton 2009 kolodziejczyk et al 2012 pérez brunius et al 2013 numerical simulations at submesoscale permitting resolution have shown that mesoscale and submesoscale eddies also form along the slope bracco et al 2016 the largest eddy found in the northern portion is a bottom intensified cyclone with a diameter of approximately 70 km and is generated by vortex stretching over the mississippi fan submesoscale eddies whenever resolved result from instabilities of near bottom lateral shear layers and shear layers generated by current bottom drag on the continental slope as also found along the california slope molemaker et al 2015 numerical simulations have also revealed that the deep portion of the de soto canyon located to the east of the mississippi fan where both the dwh wellhead and the dye release by ledwell and collaborators took place is characterized by weak currents cyclonic in their time average and limited mesoscale or submesoscale variability compared to the rest of the slope bracco et al 2016 overall dispersion in the de soto canyon is lesser than in the region to the west of the fan and material is transported mostly in the along slope direction through narrow boundary currents 3 modeling set up the ocean model in this study is the regional ocean modelling system roms haidvogel et al 2008 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 which is a primitive equation free surface split explicit oceanic model roms implements a z sigma or s vertical coordinate lemarié et al 2012 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 and horizontal curvilinear coordinates to solve the three dimensional hydrostatic equations all configurations in this study use biharmonic horizontal mixing of momentum and coare 3 0 bulk formulation fairall et al 2003 for surface forcing vertical mixing is based on either the k profile parameterization kpp scheme large et al 1994 or the mellor and yamada 1982 my scheme with level 2 5 closure and the galperin et al 1988 modification this commonly adopted modification assumes that sources and sinks of turbulent kinetic energy balance each other in the stability functions of the my scheme and accounts for the physically inappropriate dependence of the stability functions on the fluid prandtl number as originally formulated the three dimensional advection of tracers is obtained using either the second order accurate multidimensional positive definite advection transport algorithm mpdata scheme margolin and smolarkiewicz 1998 or in one case the rotated split upstream biased 3rd order transport scheme splitup proposed by marchesiello et al 2009 mpdata calculates an anti diffusive velocity derived from the truncation error of the upstream advection scheme in order to reduce iteratively excessive diffusion it is computationally efficient and commonly used by the biogeochemical community liu and xue 2009 in the splitup run tracer diffusion is split from advection and is represented by a rotated biharmonic diffusion scheme along geopotential with flow dependent hyperdiffusivity vertical and horizontal tracer advection is achieved through a centered advection scheme of fourth order spatial accuracy the use of splitup has the advantage of minimizing spurious diapycnal mixing but does not guarantee positivity of tracer concentrations the splitup integration was run only for 120 days the model domain covers the entire gulf of mexico fig 1 with a closed boundary to the west the open boundaries on three other sides use a combination of radiation and nudging schemes for both three dimensional velocities and tracers chapman 1985 and flather 1976 schemes are used for the free surface and two dimensional velocities respectively model initial and boundary conditions are extracted from the 6 h 1 25 resolution hindcast performed with the gulf of mexico hybrid coordinate ocean model gom hycom version 31 0 http www hycom org atmospheric forcing is from the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 we use 6 hourly fields for momentum and heat fluxes and daily data for precipitation the model bathymetry is derived from the 2 minute gridded global relief data collection topography etopo2 sandwell and smith 1997 interpolated at the horizontal resolution of the experiments this is different than in bracco et al 2016 where the bathymetry was interpolated at 5 km the lowest resolution adopted and no new small scale topographic features were added whenever the grid was refined in this work we consider three horizontal resolutions 9 km or mesoscale permitting 3 km or mesoscale resolving and 1 km or submesoscale permitting state of the art eddy resolving ocean global models are currently run at about 1 10 resolution comparable to the lowest horizontal resolution case investigated submesoscale circulations are only partially resolved even at 1 km a recent study in the same area and focused on the surface ocean boundary layer showed no sign of convergence comparing runs at 1 5 0 5 and 0 15 km horizontal resolution barkan et al 2017 bearing in mind the limitations of hydrostatic models that do not include physical dispersion of internal waves due to nonhydrostasy and especially of solitary waves and following the analysis of vitousek and fringer 2011 we consider 1 km horizontal resolution a safe compromise at which a hydrostatic model such as roms can be considered reliable in representing dynamics along a continental slope with a complex bathymetry more recently the same horizontal resolution 1 km has been shown to reproduce with sufficient accuracy the submesoscale vertical pump of an anticyclonic eddy underneath the ocean surface zhong et al 2017 at the more conservative 3 km horizontal resolution we also explored the role of vertical discretization in four different roms configurations with 25 50 80 and 150 layers the lowest vertical resolution is at the lower limit of what adopted in the last coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 about 50 layers are commonly used in regional and global mesoscale resolving applications 80 layers are at the upper limit of what adopted in regional simulations and 150 layers is the target set in this work to verify the existence of convergence for increasing vertical resolution according to the analysis in stewart et al 2017 in a z coordinate global ocean model in 1 10 configuration 50 levels are required to resolve the first baroclinic mode with an additional 25 for each subsequent higher mode we are therefore representing the first and second mode in the 80 layers case and the first five modes at the highest vertical resolution the interpolated bathymetry is modified to reduce horizontal pressure gradient errors associated with sigma coordinates using the sikiric et al 2009 method with maximum slope factor rx0 for any two adjacent grid point of 0 25 and maximum hydrostatic inconsistency number rx1 or haney number of 15 though rx1 7 is recommended for numerical stability see discussions in sikiric et al 2009 we did not experience instability problems with rx1 15 for this grid the choice of the rx1 value was motivated by the significant smoothing of the topography nearby the tracer release location found for rx1 7 that would have impacted the realism of the set up the vertical structure of the s coordinate layers is determined by the degree of stretching at the surface and at the bottom set by parameters θ s and θ b respectively and by the surface bottom layer width tcline where the stretching takes place we used θ s 10 θ b 2 and tcline 400 m for the 50 80 and 150 layers cases and θ s 12 θ b 3 and tcline 300 m for the 25 layers case θ s or θ b greater than 1 implies resolution amplification near the surface or bottom and θ b 1 5 ensures good bottom resolution for gravity flows the changes in the stretching parameters in the lowest vertical resolution case guarantee that the surface layer resolution is no greater than the recommended 10 m without significantly altering the bottom one around the tracer deployment site 1 1 in the 25 layers case the chosen stretching parameters imply a vertical resolution at the tracer injection site of 222 m against the 212 m that would have resulted from using the ones adopted in all other runs the model bathymetry is kept the same for all 3 km experiments regardless of number of vertical layers quadratic bottom drag with coefficient c d 0 003 is used to damp turbulence at the bottom the experiments performed are summarized in table 1 all experiments have been run freely and from the same initial conditions interpolated onto the different grids in two phases from 19 jul 2012 00 00 00 to 28 jul 2012 00 00 00 without passive tracer and from 28 jul 2012 00 00 00 onward with a passive tracer integrations terminate on 31 jan 2013 00 00 00 or earlier the first phase serves as a brief spin up and has the goal to limit the impact of the initial conditions on the simulation of the passive tracer field the passive tracer is released once on a single model grid point close to the dwh location 88 37 w 28 74 n and at the s layer whose depth is at 1060 m the density structures averaged over the integration period are nearly identical among the runs with the largest differences found in the 1kmsplit case amounting to less than 10 at intermediate depths 300 700 m and about 4 in the 700 1200 m range that is most relevant in this study the vertical and horizontal extension of the tracer at deployment varies with the horizontal and vertical resolution considered the choice for our tracer configuration is most relevant to the conditions of the gisr field experiment that we are aiming at duplicating the day and location of the release match as well that of the field experiment ledwell et al 2016 the amount of initial passive tracer is identical across integrations and normalized accordingly whenever horizontal or vertical resolutions are modified one hour averages of model variables and tracer concentrations are saved for analysis 4 results 4 1 eulerian fields we first present a comparison of the velocity and vorticity fields relevant to the interpretation of the dispersion estimates in six of the nine integrations the runs at 1 km horizontal resolution differ only in the scheme used for the passive tracer advection and the 3kmkpp and 9kmkpp integrations are not shown because nearly identical to their my2 5 counterparts we focus on the representation of vorticity and velocity field components at the depth of the tracer injection and along the continental slope and more specifically on the representation of the mesoscale and submesoscale variability in both the horizontal and vertical planes submesoscale circulations can indeed develop whenever a vertical boundary is present and therefore interest the continental slope dynamics vorticity snapshots from early november and the zoom over the northern portion of the domain figs 2 and 3 reveal that numerous eddies both cyclonic and anticyclonic are generated along the whole perimeter of the continental slope the mesoscale features in the lower layer of the gom are by and large coherent through the water column up to about 1000 m as shown in cardona and bracco 2016 but uncorrelated with the surface mesoscale features except at the south west corner of the sigsbee deep located to the south of the sigsbee escarpment in fig 1 and along the continental slope underneath the eastern part of the loop current where the anticyclonic vorticity extends to about 1200 m in the portion of the domain visited by the dye in 2012 and by the dwh deep plume in 2010 bracco et al 2016 found that bottom intensified cyclones with a diameter of 60 70 km form by vortex stretching at irregular intervals over the mississippi fan one such cyclone can be seen in figs 2c and 3b the strength of the eddies increases with horizontal resolution as discussed in bracco et al 2016 numerous eddies of about 10 km in diameter form along the slope in the 3 km resolution runs but those structures have the characteristics of numerical noise in the 9 km simulations fig 3a while smaller submesoscale eddies populate the slope in the 1 km cases fig 3b noticeably when varying the vertical resolution in the 3 km set the vorticity structures of approximately 10 km scale appear in greater numbers in the 25 layers case than in the 50 or 80 and 150 layers integrations and they are more intense across the whole lower layer the number and strength of mesoscale and submesoscale eddies in the various runs are reflected in the standard deviation std of vorticity fig 4 that increases along the slope of the whole basin for increasing horizontal resolution fig 4a c and decreasing vertical resolution fig 4d f the submesoscale eddies that form along the northern portion of the domain west of the mississippi fan in the runs with 1 and 3 km horizontal resolution are dissipated within weeks preferentially over the central slope and the western portion of the sigsbee escarpment through interactions with the complex bathymetry while those generated in the de soto canyon are fewer but live the longest up to 4 months being isolated from strong shear currents bracco et al 2016 the vorticity variance is also high north of the yucatan channel and along the campeche escarpment where the variability is associated to the loop current movement furthermore for identical horizontal resolution the vertical extension of the mesoscale and submesoscale structures and their confinement along the z direction depend strongly on the layer distribution near the ocean bottom as suggested by the instantaneous relative vorticity field across a transect at 27 n shown in fig 5 for three of the cases 3km80 and 3km150 are nearly identical as also shown by fig 3 and confirmed by the relative vorticity standard deviation across the same transect during the integration period fig 6 the eddy generation mechanisms along the continental slope were investigated in bracco et al 2016 submesoscale eddies form through instabilities of near bottom lateral and vertical shear layers in this work near bottom layer indicates the s layer immediately above the bottom one but in the real ocean the turbulent bottom boundary layer extends to approximately 50 m from the bottom generated either by the current bottom drag on the continental slope molemaker et al 2015 or most frequently in this basin by the juxtaposition of along slope frontal currents that are highly variable in both speed and direction bracco et al 2016 in both cases the width and strength of the shear layers are sensitive to horizontal resolution as shown in bracco et al 2016 with consequent increase in eddy formation along the slope for increasing horizontal resolution fig 2 through 6 in this work indicate that the potential for eddy forming instabilities along the continental slope is also sensitive to the number of vertical layers and imply that the shear layers near the ocean floor can be unrealistically strong and variable if too few layers are used fig 7 displays the std of vertical velocity shear in the 3km25 3km50 and 3km150 runs relevant to the mechanism of submesoscale generation proposed by molemaker et al 2015 vertical shear is greater in 3km25 in the turbulent bottom boundary layer and in the water column especially in the region comprised between the de soto canyon and the central slope and more generally to the east of 92 w where most of the tracer remains confined as shown later the northwest slope on the other hand has slightly greater vertical velocity shear in the case with 150 layers that in 3km25 the increased variability of the zonal shear layers can be quantified by the standard deviation of the near bottom zonal velocity shown in fig 8 again in the 3km25 case and for 50 or 150 layers for identical horizontal resolution averaged over the domain portion north of 26 n where most of the dye in the gisr experiments was observed and as we will see later most of the tracer in the simulations is found the mean std grows from 0 043 in 3km150 to 0 044 in 3km80 not shown 0 047 in 3km and to 0 052 in 3km25 the zonal velocity std intensification for decreasing vertical resolution in turn is linked to differences in the modelled vertical diffusivity coefficients in the near bottom boundary layer fig 9 in the layer or layers for the most resolved case immediately above the bottom where the strength and variance of shear currents determine submesoscale eddy generation being the presence of a boundary layer a pre requisite for it lévy et al 2012 bracco et al 2016 the roms vertical mixing coefficients increase with increasing vertical resolution in most of the basin between 5 and 50 times so that modeled shear layers are stronger and more variable in the 3km25 than in 3km150 case the underestimation of vertical mixing coefficients in the bottom turbulent boundary layer with respect to the 3km150 run is maintained to the east of 94 w when 50 layers are used but mostly eliminated with 80 layers not shown the representation of w the vertical velocity component is also modified by the presence absence of submesoscale structures near the bottom the time mean vertical velocity field is only moderately sensible to horizontal resolution with increasing values from 9 km to 1 km and is not impacted by the vertical discretization choice not shown its variability on the other hand increases significantly across runs as shown in fig 10 the standard deviation increases for increasing horizontal and decreasing vertical resolution in line with vorticity jing and chang 2016 investigated the high small scale vertical velocity variance reported in submesoscale resolving simulations e g zhong and bracco 2013 and found that it is linked to the interactions between near inertial and super inertial internal waves in regions governed by elevated divergence or convergence of the near inertial flow since the super inertial waves that give rise to the intensified vertical motions have very small wavelengths 10 km they can only be resolved when high horizontal resolution is used in summary horizontal and vertical resolutions impact the representation of submesoscale circulations that form along the bottom slopes and therefore of vorticity and vertical velocity we found no evidence for dependence of the representation of dynamical quantities on the choice of vertical mixing scheme at least with 50 layers at both 3 km and 9 km horizontal resolution this results in nearly identical tracer behavior using kpp or my as later quantified in terms of submesoscale circulations the differences in vorticity and vertical velocities between 3 and 1 km horizontal resolution runs suggest that convergence has not been yet achieved this is in agreement with an investigation of convergence at the ocean surface where horizontal resolutions of 1500 m 500 m and 150 m have been explored but no indication of convergence has been found barkan et al 2017 the exploration of vertical resolution dependence for the 3 km runs on the other hand indicates that most dynamical fields have comparable time mean and standard deviations whenever 80 or 150 layers are used while differences are still significant between the 3km and 3km80 runs the analysis here taken together with results in stewart et al 2017 suggests that at 3 km horizontal resolution it is sufficient to resolve the second baroclinic mode for a reliable representation of the dynamical processes at play with best possible computational efficiency we will further quantify convergence when considering the tracer statistics 4 2 tracer statistics 4 2 1 horizontal diffusivities the depth integrated tracer concentration is shown using a logarithmic scale two weeks and four months after release in figs 11 and 12 respectively for six of the nine runs again runs using kpp do not differ from their my counterparts at identical resolution and thus are not shown no significant differences are also found in the tracer distribution in 3km80 and 3km150 this is shown in fig 11 panel e and f in fig 12 panel e is therefore used to portrait the 3km case initially the tracer remains confined in an along slope filament with a center of mass moving westward in all runs the filament width depends predominantly on the model horizontal resolution as to be expected but an increase in filament width is also evident in the 3km25 case fig 11d filament width 0 52 0 03 compared to runs with 80 or 150 layers fig 11e and f filament widths 0 40 0 02 and 0 37 0 02 respectively after two weeks the patch in 1kmsplit is more diffused than in 1 km due to numerical dispersion errors discussed in more detail further below it also spreads more effectively into the de soto canyon this however does not depend on the tracer advection scheme but it is associated with the details of the mesoscale circulation in this realization see bracco et al 2016 for a quantification of internal variability in this region quantified through lagrangian experiments the shape of the patch and its location are broadly in agreement with the deep plume mapped through dissolved oxygen anomalies in camilli et al 2010 after four months the differences in the deep mesoscale circulation among different integrations are reflected in the presence or absence of tracer in the de soto canyon the tracer release location is near the eastern edge of the mississippi fan where mesoscale advection can provide a fast but not always available escape route towards the central slope bracco et al 2016 additionally even if the mean along slope velocities are westward instantaneous fields are highly variable in direction as a result while in all runs the center of mass of the tracer remains along the continental slope in all but 3km and 3km150 simulations the highest concentrations are found over the central slope at approximately 91 w fig 12a c and d as in the 2012 gisr deep release experiment ledwell et al 2016 in the 3km and 3km150 runs fig 12e and f instead the tracer spreads more effectively along the continental slope in the de soto canyon in the 9km runs the whole continental slope of the northern half of the gom contains some tracer over time the tracer continues spreading with regions of higher concentrations maintained over the slope when model resolution is higher vertically or horizontally as also noticed in bracco et al 2016 using an ensemble of lagrangian integrations the details of the mesoscale circulation can induce sensible differences in pathways among runs comparable to those seen between for example 1km and 3km150 horizontal diffusivity is estimated using the second moments of the vertically integrated concentrations c x y fig 13 following okubo s work okubo 1971 horizontal scale dependent diffusivity is therefore determined as k i j l i j 1 4 σ i j 2 t t fitting gaussian ellipses to the concentration of the patch as it evolves in time okubo 1971 poje et al 2014 here σ i j t 2 σ i σ j σ i and σ j are the major and minor axes of the ellipses and lij is the separation length kij lij is obtained by assuming a fixed value for it and integrating to k i j l i j 1 4 σ i j 2 t t where lij 3σ ij poje et al 2014 the horizontal diffusivities shown in fig 13 are calculated from the second moments of the integrated concentration in the zonal and meridional directions in the zonal direction σ x 2 x x c 2 c x y d x d y c x y d x d y with x c x c x y d x d y c x y d x d y a corresponding expression follows for the meridional one

y x σ y where σ x y 2 σ y x 2 x x c y y c c x y d x d y c x y d x d y peeters et al 1996 expectedly overall diffusivity estimates increase for decreasing resolution both vertical and horizontal fig 13 1kmsplit represents the exception due to the negative concentrations set to zero in all diffusivity calculations that are prominent in the first month of this integration where their space integrated value can be as high as 50 of the positive integrated ones initially the spreading of the patch in 1kmsplit is therefore strongly affected by numerical artifacts while the coefficients become in line with the 1km case at scales of 300 km and above when the tracer gradients are sufficiently smooth for the space integrated negative concentrations to decrease to about 15 of the positive ones differences across simulations are significant for scales up to 100 km and remain large above 100 km only for the 9 km resolution cases and 3km25 kij and its dominant contributor kx displays a systematic horizontal resolution dependence with 1km having the lowest diffusivities for small scales increasing vertical layers also causes kij and kx to decrease but convergence is achieved and no significant differences are found between 3km80 and 3km150 the zonal diffusivities are for most runs slightly flatter than the classical richardson obukhov kij r r4 3 scaling richardson 1926 over the whole range for example the best fit for the 1km case is kij r r1 1 and for 3km150 kij r r1 05 in the 9 km horizontal resolution cases however the 4 3 slope represents a good approximation over most scales in the meridional direction diffusivities are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than those along the slope and ky curves show a reasonably close fit to the 4 3 scaling with jumps seen for distances between 50 and to 200 km possibly attributable to the mesoscale circulation and in particular to the contribution to off shore advection of the cyclonic eddy formed over the mississippi fan we note that the diffusivity continues to increase in most runs 9km and 3km25 being the exceptions beyond the largest eddy scale that is of order 100 km and a constant value is not achieved this behavior is likely due to the shear between the transient along slope near bottom currents and it has been observed also for surface diffusivity in the southern ocean where different jets in the antarctic circumpolar current dominate the dynamics van sebille et al 2015 4 2 2 diapycnal diffusivities in the following we discuss the diapycnal diffusivities evaluated from the simulated tracer we also compare them with those of ledwell et al 2016 estimated from the time progression of the distribution of the tracer in density space 4 months post release ledwell and collaborators applied a 1 dimensional diffusion model to the change from the initial mean profile to the mean interior and boundary profiles for the 4 month survey that consisted in 122 stations following the method outlined in ledwell et al 1998 kz was therefore given by k z 1 2 σ f 2 σ i 2 δ t where σ f 2 and σ i 2 are the standard deviation of the vertical spread obtained from the gaussian fit at the final and initial time profiles the corresponding vertical profiles of tracer concentrations from six of the model simulations calculated using all grid points available are shown in fig 14 they are plotted as a function of neutral density and mapped from density onto depth using the mean depth of isopycnals calculated over an area covering the tracer four months after release for all subsequent calculations we choose to plot 3kmkpp and 3km to show at least once their strong similarity and we did not include 3km80 which bears close resemblance to 3km150 a strong dependence on the horizontal resolution is apparent when moving from 9 km to 3 km while changes from 3 km to 1 km are small especially between 1 and 4 months black curves broadly in agreement with the analysis in bracco et al 2016 in the first month the 1 km cases overestimate the diffusivity compared to the 3 km runs due to the chosen initial conditions for the tracer that covers only one grid point and therefore is subject to greater spurious mixing when the resolution is higher these results further support the conclusion reached by ilicak et al 2012 using idealized configuration and different models that the lateral grid reynolds number controls spurious diapycnal mixing while also pointing to the difficulty of diagnosing it when using a passive tracer released in a configuration that includes local extrema the representation of tracer dispersion across isopycnals is insensitive to the choice of vertical mixing scheme both at 3 plots b and e and 9 km shown in table 2 and fig 15 horizontal resolution increasing the number of vertical layers on the other hand strongly modifies the vertical distribution of the tracer with better confinement achieved in 3km150 fig 15 displays the diapycnal diffusivities calculated for the nine integrations following the methodology outlined in ledwell et al 1998 and using the second moments of the concentrations given by σ z 2 z z c 2 c x y z d x d y d z c x y z d x d y d z where z c z c x y z d x d y d z c x y z d x d y d z following fisher et al 1979 diffusivities are higher when model resolution is lower vertically and horizontally at the same time the stronger dependence on the vertical resolution is confirmed together with the importance of vertical resolution fig 15 also indicates that the adoption of a tracer advection scheme that limits spurious diapycnal mixing is important as kz in 1kmsplit is nearly half of that in 1km in table 2 we summarize the diapycnal diffusivities evaluated at given fixed intervals by applying a 1 d diffusion model to the change from the initial mean profile as done in ledwell et al 2016 here the initial time is taken as day 7 avoiding the first few days during which the spreading of the tracer initially concentrated in one grid point is strongly affected by numerical diffusion estimates in fig 15 and table 2 are consistent as indicated in the figure for three of the intervals and are several times greater than the observed values kz obs 1 3 4 10 4 m2s 1 ledwell et al 2016 our model base calculation and that by ledwell and collaborators differ in the sampling roms allows for basin wide coverage of tracer concentration over a grid point in our case of variable size depending on the model realization considered while observations of the tracer can be made only through discrete sampling of physical points we verified that the overestimation of the tracer diapycnal diffusivity in the model is not simply due to considering basin wide versus discrete sampling by recalculating kz from tracer concentrations at 122 grid points distributed following the sampling strategy adopted during the deep release experiment see fig 4 in ledwell et al 2016 we stress that by doing so we are not accounting for grid wise versus point wise differences those estimates are indicated in red in table 2 in the 3kmkpp case values calculated with limited sampling are 10 40 lower than those generated using all model grid points for 3km150 the decrease in kz estimates is less substantive over the first four months but greater than 30 after that differences are however contained for the runs at 1 km horizontal resolution suggesting that sampling limitations may not affect the diapycnal mixing representation whenever submesoscale dynamics are resolved finally fig 16 shows the mean between 60 and 180 days diapycnal coefficients for the runs at 3 km horizontal resolution as function of the number of vertical layers and their standard error to further highlight that differences in the tracer spreading between 3km80 and 3km150 are limited even for the quantity that maximize them lateral diffusivities are indeed statistically indistinguishable 5 conclusions modeled horizontal and diapycnal diffusivities have been compared across nine regional simulations of a passive tracer released in the northern gulf of mexico near the dwh location and in correspondence of the 2012 deep release experiment described in ledwell et al 2016 we have shown that increasing the horizontal model resolution to partially resolve submesoscale dynamics modifies the representation of relative vorticity along the continental slope where submesoscale eddies and filaments are most prominent increasing the horizontal resolution also drastically enhances vertical velocity variance jing and chang 2016 a low vertical resolution here 25 layers insufficient to resolve the first baroclinic radius stewart et al 2017 causes excessive vertical shear variance and consequently an increase in both vorticity and vertical velocity variance on the other hand an elevated number of vertical layers here 150 but similar results are found with 80 allows for a better representation of the bottom boundary layer and of the mixing rates associated with it confining in the z direction the influence of the vorticity structures generated along the slope no differences have been found in the representation of the velocity fields and the related tracer dispersion whenever using the kpp or mellor yamada vertical mixing schemes at both 3 and 9 km horizontal resolution the model representation of passive tracer dispersion along the continental slope of the northern gulf of mexico is sensitive to both horizontal and vertical resolution the former contributes significantly when decreasing the grid size from 9 to 3 km to both vertical and horizontal tracer dispersion in agreement with previous studies at these horizontal resolutions the mesoscale field along the continental shelf is partially 9 km or fully 3 km resolved given that the nonlocal velocity field associated with the mesoscale structures effectively controls lateral dispersion taylor 1921 the tracer absolute dispersion is overestimated when the mesoscale dynamics are not fully resolved horizontal resolution shows however little impact on lateral dispersion when further increased to 1 km despite the appearance of numerous submesoscale circulations in the vorticity field the local submesoscale eddies and filaments do not contribute to the mean tracer transport and only modify mixing at small scales i e they modify the details of the tracer pattern but not its absolute dispersion as already noted in bracco et al 2016 this is further supported by the analysis in jing and chang 2016 along the vertical direction the authors indeed noted that the dramatic increase in vertical velocities and their variance for increasing high horizontal resolution once submesoscale dynamics are resolved does not lead to major transport changes because associated to super inertial gravity waves that do not modify transport unless they break vertical resolution on the other hand contributes to horizontal and diapycnal diffusivities with indications of a convergent behavior above about 80 vertical layers we found greater tracer confinement and decreasing diffusivities in all directions when the number of model layers increases from 25 to 50 and then 80 or 150 diapycnal diffusivity estimates are also very sensitive to the choice of tracer advection scheme at 1 km resolution a split tracer advection and diffusion scheme minimizes spurious diapycnal mixing reducing kz to about half of that found with a more commonly used positive definite advection algorithm the impact of the tracer advection scheme choice on kz is comparable to that of increasing the vertical resolution from 50 to 150 layers negative concentrations however are prominent in presence of steep topography such as found near the release site and deteriorate the representation of horizontal spreading space integrated negative concentrations are as large as half of the positive ones after two weeks of integration and decrease to about 15 at six months despite the adoption of splitup or of 150 vertical layers observationally estimated kz obs by ledwell et al 2016 at 4 months post release remains significantly smaller than any modeled coefficient at a comparable time this result together with the sensitivity of diffusivity estimates to the horizontal and vertical grid size raises some major concerns on the ability of regional and global models to properly simulate transport and mixing of carbon oxygen and nutrients across the water column along continental slopes while continental slopes occupy relatively small areas they are key drivers of global climate and biogeochemical cycling the outcome of our modeling analysis points to the need for resolving the bottom boundary layer with at least two layers in the lowest fifty meters based on results from the simulations at different vertical resolutions and on the similarity between the 3km80 and 3km150 runs at such resolution the representation of submesoscale circulations their vertical confinement and their influence on the above water column is consistent with that of runs with an even higher number of vertical layers near the bottom further studies on the generation and evolution of submesoscale circulations and their role on mixing in the bottom boundary layer are recommended most importantly observational studies capable of characterizing mixing processes along continental slopes are needed to better constrain modeling outputs acknowledgment this research was made possible in part by a grant from the gulf of

24130,a set of nine regional ocean model simulations at various horizontal from 1 to 9 km and vertical from 25 to 150 layers resolutions with different vertical mixing parameterizations is carried out to examine the transport and mixing of a passive tracer released near the ocean bottom over the continental slope in the northern gulf of mexico the release location is in proximity to the deepwater horizon oil well that ruptured in april 2010 horizontal and diapycnal diffusivities are calculated and their dependence on the model set up and on the representation of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations is discussed horizontal and vertical resolutions play a comparable role in determining the modeled horizontal diffusivities vertical resolution is key to a proper representation of passive tracer propagation and in the case of the gulf of mexico contributes to both confining the tracer along the continental slope and limiting its vertical spreading the choice of the tracer advection scheme is also important with positive definiteness in the tracer concentration being achieved at the price of spurious mixing across density surfaces in all cases however the diapycnal mixing coefficient derived from the model simulations overestimates the observed value indicating an area where model improvement is needed keywords near bottom circulation continental slope vertical resolution horizontal resolution roms gulf of mexico 1 introduction in 2010 the blowout of the deepwater horizon dwh well at the macondo prospect mississippi canyon block 252 mc 252 in the de soto canyon about 70 km offshore the southeast coast of louisiana caused a massive release of oil estimated between 6 and 8 10 5 tons joye et al 2011 mcnutt et al 2012 the uniqueness of the spill was not only the amount but also its depth as it occurred in the open ocean approximately 1500 m below the surface while the majority of the released oil rose to the surface about a third remained confined in an underwater plume found between 1000 and 1300 m kleindienst et al 2015 joye et al 2011 about six weeks after the blowout the deep plume extended over an area at least 35 km long and 2 km wide camilli et al 2010 from a modeling perspective the deepwater horizon disaster presented opportunities and challenges it was realized that on one hand a realistic representation of mesoscale structures did not guarantee an adequate forecasting of surface oil trajectories even for an enclosed sea such as the gulf of mexico gom joye et al 2016 and on the other our understanding of the modeling requirements to properly simulate transport and mixing both at the ocean surface and along the continental shelf was limited liu et al 2011 mariano et al 2011 at the ocean surface images of oil slicks in spring 2010 pointed to the prevalence of structures in the submesoscale range 0 1 10 km hours to few days that control mixing in the northern gulf not only during january and february when the mixed layer is deepest callies et al 2015 mensa et al 2013 but also in june august when the freshwater from the spring maximum riverine outflow reaches offshore luo et al 2016 at depth the dwh incident challenged our understanding of the transport and mixing processes along the continental slope and our ability to properly represent them in ocean circulation models observations of the deep water plume that resulted from various campaigns immediately following the rupture of the wellhead in 2010 allowed the mapping of the oil directionality but were insufficient to determine lateral and diapycnal mixing rates camilli et al 2010 diercks et al 2010 to gain such information in august 2012 the gulf of mexico integrated spill response gisr consortium http research gulfresearchinitiative org research awards projects pid 137 injected a passive dye nearby the spill site at approximately 1100 m a depth comparable to that of the dwh deep oil plume the tracer was then followed over twelve months with a first cruise four months since its release ledwell et al 2016 this experiment revealed that diapycnal mixing along the complex continental slope of the northern gulf of mexico was generally greater than observed in a handful of previous open ocean studies e g ledwell et al 1993 1998 polzin and ferrari 2004 sundermeyer and price 1998 sundermeyer et al 2005 and comparable to values found in portions of the drake passage mashayek et al 2017 a key motivation of this research is to establish modeling requirements that allow a representation of dispersion as reliably as possible in the event of future release of oil and gas into the gulf at depth several modeling studies have focused on the factors that affected the time oil stayed in the water column from microbial decay adcroft et al 2010 to oil droplet size variable oil flow rates from the wellhead vertical current velocity and biodegradation lindo atichati et al 2016 north et al 2015 but less attention has been placed on evaluating how the configuration of the circulation model may impact the overall dispersion in this paper we will therefore explore the role of vertical and horizontal resolutions and vertical mixing parameterizations as well as tracer advection schemes in the representation of tracer dispersion intended here as tracer transport and mixing along the continental slope in the northern gulf we will focus on the representation of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations in the different configurations their vertical confinement along the continental slope and how they impact tracer dispersion recently stewart et al 2017 investigated vertical grid requirements to best suit horizontal resolution capabilities and found that at least 50 vertical levels are needed to resolve the first baroclinic mode with an additional 25 levels per subsequent mode stewart and coauthors however focused their evaluation on the representation of sea surface height overturning streamfunction and barotropic and baroclinic kinetic energy the impacts of horizontal and vertical resolution on the representation of tracer transport and mixing along the continental slope in ocean models remain relatively unexplored this is due in part to the fact that measurements of lateral and diapcynal dispersion in the deep oceans are quite rare e g kunze et al 2006 polzin et al 1997 waterhouse et al 2014 and in the gulf are limited to the study by ledwell et al 2016 nevertheless modeling tracer dispersion along continental slopes is relevant to a variety of applications from predicting pathways of pollutants and the mixing of sediments and nutrients into the water column to projections of ocean oxygen and carbon storage in coastal areas we shall show that both vertical and horizontal resolutions are important in realistic simulations of tracer dispersion with the former playing a greater role in determining how diapycnal mixing is modeled 2 gulf of mexico circulation to a first approximation the circulation in the gulf is that of a two layer system the upper layer extends to about 800 1200 m depth and its most prominent features are the anticyclonic loop current lc and the rings or loop eddies that detach from the lc at irregular intervals vukovich 2012 in contrast the mean circulation of the bottom layer is cyclonic off the continental slope or south of 26 n cardona and bracco 2016 dehaan and sturges 2005 hamilton 1990 weatherly 2004 and vertically coherent hamilton 2009 while it is characterized by numerous closed recirculations along the slope fig 1 these recirculations are predominantly but not exclusively cyclonic generated by the interaction of the flow with the complex bathymetry bracco et al 2016 along the continental slope topographic rossby waves trws and vortex stretching contribute to the local in time and space intensification of the currents dehaan and sturges 2005 dukhovskoy et al 2009 hamilton 2009 kolodziejczyk et al 2012 pérez brunius et al 2013 numerical simulations at submesoscale permitting resolution have shown that mesoscale and submesoscale eddies also form along the slope bracco et al 2016 the largest eddy found in the northern portion is a bottom intensified cyclone with a diameter of approximately 70 km and is generated by vortex stretching over the mississippi fan submesoscale eddies whenever resolved result from instabilities of near bottom lateral shear layers and shear layers generated by current bottom drag on the continental slope as also found along the california slope molemaker et al 2015 numerical simulations have also revealed that the deep portion of the de soto canyon located to the east of the mississippi fan where both the dwh wellhead and the dye release by ledwell and collaborators took place is characterized by weak currents cyclonic in their time average and limited mesoscale or submesoscale variability compared to the rest of the slope bracco et al 2016 overall dispersion in the de soto canyon is lesser than in the region to the west of the fan and material is transported mostly in the along slope direction through narrow boundary currents 3 modeling set up the ocean model in this study is the regional ocean modelling system roms haidvogel et al 2008 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 which is a primitive equation free surface split explicit oceanic model roms implements a z sigma or s vertical coordinate lemarié et al 2012 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2009 and horizontal curvilinear coordinates to solve the three dimensional hydrostatic equations all configurations in this study use biharmonic horizontal mixing of momentum and coare 3 0 bulk formulation fairall et al 2003 for surface forcing vertical mixing is based on either the k profile parameterization kpp scheme large et al 1994 or the mellor and yamada 1982 my scheme with level 2 5 closure and the galperin et al 1988 modification this commonly adopted modification assumes that sources and sinks of turbulent kinetic energy balance each other in the stability functions of the my scheme and accounts for the physically inappropriate dependence of the stability functions on the fluid prandtl number as originally formulated the three dimensional advection of tracers is obtained using either the second order accurate multidimensional positive definite advection transport algorithm mpdata scheme margolin and smolarkiewicz 1998 or in one case the rotated split upstream biased 3rd order transport scheme splitup proposed by marchesiello et al 2009 mpdata calculates an anti diffusive velocity derived from the truncation error of the upstream advection scheme in order to reduce iteratively excessive diffusion it is computationally efficient and commonly used by the biogeochemical community liu and xue 2009 in the splitup run tracer diffusion is split from advection and is represented by a rotated biharmonic diffusion scheme along geopotential with flow dependent hyperdiffusivity vertical and horizontal tracer advection is achieved through a centered advection scheme of fourth order spatial accuracy the use of splitup has the advantage of minimizing spurious diapycnal mixing but does not guarantee positivity of tracer concentrations the splitup integration was run only for 120 days the model domain covers the entire gulf of mexico fig 1 with a closed boundary to the west the open boundaries on three other sides use a combination of radiation and nudging schemes for both three dimensional velocities and tracers chapman 1985 and flather 1976 schemes are used for the free surface and two dimensional velocities respectively model initial and boundary conditions are extracted from the 6 h 1 25 resolution hindcast performed with the gulf of mexico hybrid coordinate ocean model gom hycom version 31 0 http www hycom org atmospheric forcing is from the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 we use 6 hourly fields for momentum and heat fluxes and daily data for precipitation the model bathymetry is derived from the 2 minute gridded global relief data collection topography etopo2 sandwell and smith 1997 interpolated at the horizontal resolution of the experiments this is different than in bracco et al 2016 where the bathymetry was interpolated at 5 km the lowest resolution adopted and no new small scale topographic features were added whenever the grid was refined in this work we consider three horizontal resolutions 9 km or mesoscale permitting 3 km or mesoscale resolving and 1 km or submesoscale permitting state of the art eddy resolving ocean global models are currently run at about 1 10 resolution comparable to the lowest horizontal resolution case investigated submesoscale circulations are only partially resolved even at 1 km a recent study in the same area and focused on the surface ocean boundary layer showed no sign of convergence comparing runs at 1 5 0 5 and 0 15 km horizontal resolution barkan et al 2017 bearing in mind the limitations of hydrostatic models that do not include physical dispersion of internal waves due to nonhydrostasy and especially of solitary waves and following the analysis of vitousek and fringer 2011 we consider 1 km horizontal resolution a safe compromise at which a hydrostatic model such as roms can be considered reliable in representing dynamics along a continental slope with a complex bathymetry more recently the same horizontal resolution 1 km has been shown to reproduce with sufficient accuracy the submesoscale vertical pump of an anticyclonic eddy underneath the ocean surface zhong et al 2017 at the more conservative 3 km horizontal resolution we also explored the role of vertical discretization in four different roms configurations with 25 50 80 and 150 layers the lowest vertical resolution is at the lower limit of what adopted in the last coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 about 50 layers are commonly used in regional and global mesoscale resolving applications 80 layers are at the upper limit of what adopted in regional simulations and 150 layers is the target set in this work to verify the existence of convergence for increasing vertical resolution according to the analysis in stewart et al 2017 in a z coordinate global ocean model in 1 10 configuration 50 levels are required to resolve the first baroclinic mode with an additional 25 for each subsequent higher mode we are therefore representing the first and second mode in the 80 layers case and the first five modes at the highest vertical resolution the interpolated bathymetry is modified to reduce horizontal pressure gradient errors associated with sigma coordinates using the sikiric et al 2009 method with maximum slope factor rx0 for any two adjacent grid point of 0 25 and maximum hydrostatic inconsistency number rx1 or haney number of 15 though rx1 7 is recommended for numerical stability see discussions in sikiric et al 2009 we did not experience instability problems with rx1 15 for this grid the choice of the rx1 value was motivated by the significant smoothing of the topography nearby the tracer release location found for rx1 7 that would have impacted the realism of the set up the vertical structure of the s coordinate layers is determined by the degree of stretching at the surface and at the bottom set by parameters θ s and θ b respectively and by the surface bottom layer width tcline where the stretching takes place we used θ s 10 θ b 2 and tcline 400 m for the 50 80 and 150 layers cases and θ s 12 θ b 3 and tcline 300 m for the 25 layers case θ s or θ b greater than 1 implies resolution amplification near the surface or bottom and θ b 1 5 ensures good bottom resolution for gravity flows the changes in the stretching parameters in the lowest vertical resolution case guarantee that the surface layer resolution is no greater than the recommended 10 m without significantly altering the bottom one around the tracer deployment site 1 1 in the 25 layers case the chosen stretching parameters imply a vertical resolution at the tracer injection site of 222 m against the 212 m that would have resulted from using the ones adopted in all other runs the model bathymetry is kept the same for all 3 km experiments regardless of number of vertical layers quadratic bottom drag with coefficient c d 0 003 is used to damp turbulence at the bottom the experiments performed are summarized in table 1 all experiments have been run freely and from the same initial conditions interpolated onto the different grids in two phases from 19 jul 2012 00 00 00 to 28 jul 2012 00 00 00 without passive tracer and from 28 jul 2012 00 00 00 onward with a passive tracer integrations terminate on 31 jan 2013 00 00 00 or earlier the first phase serves as a brief spin up and has the goal to limit the impact of the initial conditions on the simulation of the passive tracer field the passive tracer is released once on a single model grid point close to the dwh location 88 37 w 28 74 n and at the s layer whose depth is at 1060 m the density structures averaged over the integration period are nearly identical among the runs with the largest differences found in the 1kmsplit case amounting to less than 10 at intermediate depths 300 700 m and about 4 in the 700 1200 m range that is most relevant in this study the vertical and horizontal extension of the tracer at deployment varies with the horizontal and vertical resolution considered the choice for our tracer configuration is most relevant to the conditions of the gisr field experiment that we are aiming at duplicating the day and location of the release match as well that of the field experiment ledwell et al 2016 the amount of initial passive tracer is identical across integrations and normalized accordingly whenever horizontal or vertical resolutions are modified one hour averages of model variables and tracer concentrations are saved for analysis 4 results 4 1 eulerian fields we first present a comparison of the velocity and vorticity fields relevant to the interpretation of the dispersion estimates in six of the nine integrations the runs at 1 km horizontal resolution differ only in the scheme used for the passive tracer advection and the 3kmkpp and 9kmkpp integrations are not shown because nearly identical to their my2 5 counterparts we focus on the representation of vorticity and velocity field components at the depth of the tracer injection and along the continental slope and more specifically on the representation of the mesoscale and submesoscale variability in both the horizontal and vertical planes submesoscale circulations can indeed develop whenever a vertical boundary is present and therefore interest the continental slope dynamics vorticity snapshots from early november and the zoom over the northern portion of the domain figs 2 and 3 reveal that numerous eddies both cyclonic and anticyclonic are generated along the whole perimeter of the continental slope the mesoscale features in the lower layer of the gom are by and large coherent through the water column up to about 1000 m as shown in cardona and bracco 2016 but uncorrelated with the surface mesoscale features except at the south west corner of the sigsbee deep located to the south of the sigsbee escarpment in fig 1 and along the continental slope underneath the eastern part of the loop current where the anticyclonic vorticity extends to about 1200 m in the portion of the domain visited by the dye in 2012 and by the dwh deep plume in 2010 bracco et al 2016 found that bottom intensified cyclones with a diameter of 60 70 km form by vortex stretching at irregular intervals over the mississippi fan one such cyclone can be seen in figs 2c and 3b the strength of the eddies increases with horizontal resolution as discussed in bracco et al 2016 numerous eddies of about 10 km in diameter form along the slope in the 3 km resolution runs but those structures have the characteristics of numerical noise in the 9 km simulations fig 3a while smaller submesoscale eddies populate the slope in the 1 km cases fig 3b noticeably when varying the vertical resolution in the 3 km set the vorticity structures of approximately 10 km scale appear in greater numbers in the 25 layers case than in the 50 or 80 and 150 layers integrations and they are more intense across the whole lower layer the number and strength of mesoscale and submesoscale eddies in the various runs are reflected in the standard deviation std of vorticity fig 4 that increases along the slope of the whole basin for increasing horizontal resolution fig 4a c and decreasing vertical resolution fig 4d f the submesoscale eddies that form along the northern portion of the domain west of the mississippi fan in the runs with 1 and 3 km horizontal resolution are dissipated within weeks preferentially over the central slope and the western portion of the sigsbee escarpment through interactions with the complex bathymetry while those generated in the de soto canyon are fewer but live the longest up to 4 months being isolated from strong shear currents bracco et al 2016 the vorticity variance is also high north of the yucatan channel and along the campeche escarpment where the variability is associated to the loop current movement furthermore for identical horizontal resolution the vertical extension of the mesoscale and submesoscale structures and their confinement along the z direction depend strongly on the layer distribution near the ocean bottom as suggested by the instantaneous relative vorticity field across a transect at 27 n shown in fig 5 for three of the cases 3km80 and 3km150 are nearly identical as also shown by fig 3 and confirmed by the relative vorticity standard deviation across the same transect during the integration period fig 6 the eddy generation mechanisms along the continental slope were investigated in bracco et al 2016 submesoscale eddies form through instabilities of near bottom lateral and vertical shear layers in this work near bottom layer indicates the s layer immediately above the bottom one but in the real ocean the turbulent bottom boundary layer extends to approximately 50 m from the bottom generated either by the current bottom drag on the continental slope molemaker et al 2015 or most frequently in this basin by the juxtaposition of along slope frontal currents that are highly variable in both speed and direction bracco et al 2016 in both cases the width and strength of the shear layers are sensitive to horizontal resolution as shown in bracco et al 2016 with consequent increase in eddy formation along the slope for increasing horizontal resolution fig 2 through 6 in this work indicate that the potential for eddy forming instabilities along the continental slope is also sensitive to the number of vertical layers and imply that the shear layers near the ocean floor can be unrealistically strong and variable if too few layers are used fig 7 displays the std of vertical velocity shear in the 3km25 3km50 and 3km150 runs relevant to the mechanism of submesoscale generation proposed by molemaker et al 2015 vertical shear is greater in 3km25 in the turbulent bottom boundary layer and in the water column especially in the region comprised between the de soto canyon and the central slope and more generally to the east of 92 w where most of the tracer remains confined as shown later the northwest slope on the other hand has slightly greater vertical velocity shear in the case with 150 layers that in 3km25 the increased variability of the zonal shear layers can be quantified by the standard deviation of the near bottom zonal velocity shown in fig 8 again in the 3km25 case and for 50 or 150 layers for identical horizontal resolution averaged over the domain portion north of 26 n where most of the dye in the gisr experiments was observed and as we will see later most of the tracer in the simulations is found the mean std grows from 0 043 in 3km150 to 0 044 in 3km80 not shown 0 047 in 3km and to 0 052 in 3km25 the zonal velocity std intensification for decreasing vertical resolution in turn is linked to differences in the modelled vertical diffusivity coefficients in the near bottom boundary layer fig 9 in the layer or layers for the most resolved case immediately above the bottom where the strength and variance of shear currents determine submesoscale eddy generation being the presence of a boundary layer a pre requisite for it lévy et al 2012 bracco et al 2016 the roms vertical mixing coefficients increase with increasing vertical resolution in most of the basin between 5 and 50 times so that modeled shear layers are stronger and more variable in the 3km25 than in 3km150 case the underestimation of vertical mixing coefficients in the bottom turbulent boundary layer with respect to the 3km150 run is maintained to the east of 94 w when 50 layers are used but mostly eliminated with 80 layers not shown the representation of w the vertical velocity component is also modified by the presence absence of submesoscale structures near the bottom the time mean vertical velocity field is only moderately sensible to horizontal resolution with increasing values from 9 km to 1 km and is not impacted by the vertical discretization choice not shown its variability on the other hand increases significantly across runs as shown in fig 10 the standard deviation increases for increasing horizontal and decreasing vertical resolution in line with vorticity jing and chang 2016 investigated the high small scale vertical velocity variance reported in submesoscale resolving simulations e g zhong and bracco 2013 and found that it is linked to the interactions between near inertial and super inertial internal waves in regions governed by elevated divergence or convergence of the near inertial flow since the super inertial waves that give rise to the intensified vertical motions have very small wavelengths 10 km they can only be resolved when high horizontal resolution is used in summary horizontal and vertical resolutions impact the representation of submesoscale circulations that form along the bottom slopes and therefore of vorticity and vertical velocity we found no evidence for dependence of the representation of dynamical quantities on the choice of vertical mixing scheme at least with 50 layers at both 3 km and 9 km horizontal resolution this results in nearly identical tracer behavior using kpp or my as later quantified in terms of submesoscale circulations the differences in vorticity and vertical velocities between 3 and 1 km horizontal resolution runs suggest that convergence has not been yet achieved this is in agreement with an investigation of convergence at the ocean surface where horizontal resolutions of 1500 m 500 m and 150 m have been explored but no indication of convergence has been found barkan et al 2017 the exploration of vertical resolution dependence for the 3 km runs on the other hand indicates that most dynamical fields have comparable time mean and standard deviations whenever 80 or 150 layers are used while differences are still significant between the 3km and 3km80 runs the analysis here taken together with results in stewart et al 2017 suggests that at 3 km horizontal resolution it is sufficient to resolve the second baroclinic mode for a reliable representation of the dynamical processes at play with best possible computational efficiency we will further quantify convergence when considering the tracer statistics 4 2 tracer statistics 4 2 1 horizontal diffusivities the depth integrated tracer concentration is shown using a logarithmic scale two weeks and four months after release in figs 11 and 12 respectively for six of the nine runs again runs using kpp do not differ from their my counterparts at identical resolution and thus are not shown no significant differences are also found in the tracer distribution in 3km80 and 3km150 this is shown in fig 11 panel e and f in fig 12 panel e is therefore used to portrait the 3km case initially the tracer remains confined in an along slope filament with a center of mass moving westward in all runs the filament width depends predominantly on the model horizontal resolution as to be expected but an increase in filament width is also evident in the 3km25 case fig 11d filament width 0 52 0 03 compared to runs with 80 or 150 layers fig 11e and f filament widths 0 40 0 02 and 0 37 0 02 respectively after two weeks the patch in 1kmsplit is more diffused than in 1 km due to numerical dispersion errors discussed in more detail further below it also spreads more effectively into the de soto canyon this however does not depend on the tracer advection scheme but it is associated with the details of the mesoscale circulation in this realization see bracco et al 2016 for a quantification of internal variability in this region quantified through lagrangian experiments the shape of the patch and its location are broadly in agreement with the deep plume mapped through dissolved oxygen anomalies in camilli et al 2010 after four months the differences in the deep mesoscale circulation among different integrations are reflected in the presence or absence of tracer in the de soto canyon the tracer release location is near the eastern edge of the mississippi fan where mesoscale advection can provide a fast but not always available escape route towards the central slope bracco et al 2016 additionally even if the mean along slope velocities are westward instantaneous fields are highly variable in direction as a result while in all runs the center of mass of the tracer remains along the continental slope in all but 3km and 3km150 simulations the highest concentrations are found over the central slope at approximately 91 w fig 12a c and d as in the 2012 gisr deep release experiment ledwell et al 2016 in the 3km and 3km150 runs fig 12e and f instead the tracer spreads more effectively along the continental slope in the de soto canyon in the 9km runs the whole continental slope of the northern half of the gom contains some tracer over time the tracer continues spreading with regions of higher concentrations maintained over the slope when model resolution is higher vertically or horizontally as also noticed in bracco et al 2016 using an ensemble of lagrangian integrations the details of the mesoscale circulation can induce sensible differences in pathways among runs comparable to those seen between for example 1km and 3km150 horizontal diffusivity is estimated using the second moments of the vertically integrated concentrations c x y fig 13 following okubo s work okubo 1971 horizontal scale dependent diffusivity is therefore determined as k i j l i j 1 4 σ i j 2 t t fitting gaussian ellipses to the concentration of the patch as it evolves in time

integrating to k i j l i j 1 4 σ i j 2 t t where lij 3σ ij poje et al 2014 the horizontal diffusivities shown in fig 13 are calculated from the second moments of the integrated concentration in the

1kmsplit represents the exception due to the negative concentrations set to zero in all diffusivity calculations that are prominent in the first month of this integration where their space integrated value can be as high as 50 of the positive integrated ones initially the spreading of the patch in 1kmsplit is therefore strongly affected by numerical artifacts while the coefficients become in line with the 1km case at scales of 300 km and above when the tracer gradients are sufficiently smooth for the space integrated negative concentrations to decrease to about 15 of the positive ones differences across simulations are significant for scales up to 100 km and remain large above 100 km only for the 9 km resolution cases and 3km25 kij and its dominant contributor kx displays a systematic horizontal resolution dependence with 1km having the lowest diffusivities for small scales increasing vertical layers also causes kij and kx to decrease but convergence is achieved and no significant differences are found between 3km80 and 3km150 the zonal diffusivities are for most runs slightly flatter than the classical richardson obukhov kij r r4 3 scaling richardson 1926 over the whole range for example the best fit for the 1km case is kij r r1 1 and for 3km150 kij r r1 05 in the 9 km horizontal resolution cases however the 4 3 slope represents a good approximation over most scales in the meridional direction diffusivities are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than those along the slope and ky curves show a reasonably close fit to the 4 3 scaling with jumps seen for distances between 50 and to 200 km possibly attributable to the mesoscale circulation and in particular to the contribution to off shore advection of the cyclonic eddy formed over the mississippi fan we note that the diffusivity continues to increase in most runs 9km and 3km25 being the exceptions beyond the largest eddy scale that is of order 100 km and a constant value is not achieved this behavior is likely due to the shear between the transient along slope near bottom currents and it has been observed also for surface diffusivity in the southern ocean where different jets in the antarctic circumpolar current dominate the dynamics van sebille et al 2015 4 2 2 diapycnal diffusivities in the following we discuss the diapycnal diffusivities evaluated from the simulated tracer we also compare them with those of ledwell et al 2016 estimated from the time progression of the distribution of the tracer in density space 4 months post release ledwell and collaborators applied a 1 dimensional diffusion model to the change from the initial mean profile to the mean interior and boundary profiles for the 4 month survey that consisted in 122 stations following the method outlined in ledwell et al 1998 kz was therefore given by k z 1 2 σ f 2 σ i 2 δ t where σ f 2 and σ i 2 are the standard deviation of the vertical spread obtained from the gaussian fit at the final and initial time profiles the corresponding vertical profiles of tracer concentrations from six of the model simulations calculated using all grid points available are shown in fig 14 they are plotted as a function of neutral density and mapped from density onto depth using the mean depth of isopycnals calculated over an area covering the tracer four months after release for all subsequent calculations we choose to plot 3kmkpp and 3km to show at least once their strong similarity and we did not include 3km80 which bears close resemblance to 3km150 a strong dependence on the horizontal resolution is apparent when moving from 9 km to 3 km while changes from 3 km to 1 km are small especially between 1 and 4 months black curves broadly in agreement with the analysis in bracco et al 2016 in the first month the 1 km cases overestimate the diffusivity compared to the 3 km runs due to the chosen initial conditions for the tracer that covers only one grid point and therefore is subject to greater spurious mixing when the resolution is higher these results further support the conclusion reached by ilicak et al 2012 using idealized configuration and different models that the lateral grid reynolds number controls spurious diapycnal mixing while also pointing to the difficulty of diagnosing it when using a passive tracer released in a configuration that includes local extrema the representation of tracer dispersion across isopycnals is insensitive to the choice of vertical mixing scheme both at 3 plots b and e and 9 km shown in table 2 and fig 15 horizontal resolution increasing the number of vertical layers on the other hand strongly modifies the vertical distribution of the tracer with better confinement achieved in 3km150 fig 15 displays the diapycnal diffusivities calculated for the nine integrations following the methodology outlined in ledwell et al 1998 and using the second moments of the concentrations given by σ z 2 z z c 2 c x y z d x d y d z c x y z d x d y d z where z c z c x y z d x d y d z c x y z d x d y d z following fisher et al 1979 diffusivities are higher when model resolution is lower vertically and horizontally at the same time the stronger dependence on the vertical resolution is confirmed together with the importance of vertical resolution fig 15 also indicates that the adoption of a tracer advection scheme that limits spurious diapycnal mixing is important as kz in 1kmsplit is nearly half of that in 1km in table 2 we summarize the diapycnal diffusivities evaluated at given fixed intervals by applying a 1 d diffusion model to the change from the initial mean profile as done in ledwell et al 2016 here the initial time is taken as day 7 avoiding the first few days during which the spreading of the tracer initially concentrated in one grid point is strongly affected by numerical diffusion estimates in fig 15 and table 2 are consistent as indicated in the figure for three of the intervals and are several times greater than the observed values kz obs 1 3 4 10 4 m2s 1 ledwell et al 2016 our model base calculation and that by ledwell and collaborators differ in the sampling roms allows for basin wide coverage of tracer concentration over a grid point in our case of variable size depending on the model realization considered while observations of the tracer can be made only through discrete sampling of physical points we verified that the overestimation of the tracer diapycnal diffusivity in the model is not simply due to considering basin wide versus discrete sampling by recalculating kz from tracer concentrations at 122 grid points distributed following the sampling strategy adopted during the deep release experiment see fig 4 in ledwell et al 2016 we stress that by doing so we are not accounting for grid wise versus point wise differences those estimates are indicated in red in table 2 in the 3kmkpp case values calculated with limited sampling are 10 40 lower than those generated using all model grid points for 3km150 the decrease in kz estimates is less substantive over the first four months but greater than 30 after that differences are however contained for the runs at 1 km horizontal resolution suggesting that sampling limitations may not affect the diapycnal mixing representation whenever submesoscale dynamics are resolved finally fig 16 shows the mean between 60 and 180 days diapycnal coefficients for the runs at 3 km horizontal resolution as function of the number of vertical layers and their standard error to further highlight that differences in the tracer spreading between 3km80 and 3km150 are limited even for the quantity that maximize them lateral diffusivities are indeed statistically indistinguishable 5 conclusions modeled horizontal and diapycnal diffusivities have been compared across nine regional simulations of a passive tracer released in the northern gulf of mexico near the dwh location and in correspondence of the 2012 deep release experiment described in ledwell et al 2016 we have shown that increasing the horizontal model resolution to partially resolve submesoscale dynamics modifies the representation of relative vorticity along the continental slope where submesoscale eddies and filaments are most prominent increasing the horizontal resolution also drastically enhances vertical velocity variance jing and chang 2016 a low vertical resolution here 25 layers insufficient to resolve the first baroclinic radius stewart et al 2017 causes excessive vertical shear variance and consequently an increase in both vorticity and vertical velocity variance on the other hand an elevated number of vertical layers here 150 but similar results are found with 80 allows for a better representation of the bottom boundary layer and of the mixing rates associated with it confining in the z direction the influence of the vorticity structures generated along the slope no differences have been found in the representation of the velocity fields and the related tracer dispersion whenever using the kpp or mellor yamada vertical mixing schemes at both 3 and 9 km horizontal resolution the model representation of passive tracer dispersion along the continental slope of the northern gulf of mexico is sensitive to both horizontal and vertical resolution the former contributes significantly when decreasing the grid size from 9 to 3 km to both vertical and horizontal tracer dispersion in agreement with previous studies at these horizontal resolutions the mesoscale field along the continental shelf is partially 9 km or fully 3 km resolved given that the nonlocal velocity field associated with the mesoscale structures effectively controls lateral dispersion taylor 1921 the tracer absolute dispersion is overestimated when the mesoscale dynamics are not fully resolved horizontal resolution shows however little impact on lateral dispersion when further increased to 1 km despite the appearance of numerous submesoscale circulations in the vorticity field the local submesoscale eddies and filaments do not contribute to the mean tracer transport and only modify mixing at small scales i e they modify the details of the tracer pattern but not its absolute dispersion as already noted in bracco et al 2016 this is further supported by the analysis in jing and chang 2016 along the vertical direction the authors indeed noted that the dramatic increase in vertical velocities and their variance for increasing high horizontal resolution once submesoscale dynamics are resolved does not lead to major transport changes because associated to super inertial gravity waves that do not modify transport unless they break vertical resolution on the other hand contributes to horizontal and diapycnal diffusivities with indications of a convergent behavior above about 80 vertical layers we found greater tracer confinement and decreasing diffusivities in all directions when the number of model layers increases from 25 to 50 and then 80 or 150 diapycnal diffusivity estimates are also very sensitive to the choice of tracer advection scheme at 1 km resolution a split tracer advection and diffusion scheme minimizes spurious diapycnal mixing reducing kz to about half of that found with a more commonly used positive definite advection algorithm the impact of the tracer advection scheme choice on kz is comparable to that of increasing the vertical resolution from 50 to 150 layers negative concentrations however are prominent in presence of steep topography such as found near the release site and deteriorate the representation of horizontal spreading space integrated negative concentrations are as large as half of the positive ones after two weeks of integration and decrease to about 15 at six months despite the adoption of splitup or of 150 vertical layers observationally estimated kz obs by ledwell et al 2016 at 4 months post release remains significantly smaller than any modeled coefficient at a comparable time this result together with the sensitivity of diffusivity estimates to the horizontal and vertical grid size raises some major concerns on the ability of regional and global models to properly simulate transport and mixing of carbon oxygen and nutrients across the water column along continental slopes while continental slopes occupy relatively small areas they are key drivers of global climate and biogeochemical cycling the outcome of our modeling analysis points to the need for resolving the bottom boundary layer with at least two layers in the lowest fifty meters based on results from the simulations at different vertical resolutions and on the similarity between the 3km80 and 3km150 runs at such resolution the representation of submesoscale circulations their vertical confinement and their influence on the above water column is consistent with that of runs with an even higher number of vertical layers near the bottom further studies on the generation and evolution of submesoscale circulations and their role on mixing in the bottom boundary layer are recommended most importantly observational studies capable of characterizing mixing processes along continental slopes are needed to better constrain modeling outputs acknowledgment this research was made possible in part by a grant from the gulf of

24131,geothermal heating is increasingly recognised as an important factor affecting ocean circulation with modelling studies suggesting that this heat source could lead to first order changes in the formation rate of antarctic bottom water as well as a significant warming effect in the abyssal ocean where it has been represented in numerical models however the geothermal heat flux into the ocean is generally treated as an entirely conductive flux despite an estimated one third of the global geothermal flux being introduced to the ocean via hydrothermal sources a modelling study is presented which investigates the sensitivity of the geothermally forced circulation to the way heat is supplied to the abyssal ocean an analytical two dimensional model of the circulation is described which demonstrates the effects of a volume flux through the ocean bed a simulation using the nemo numerical general circulation model in an idealised domain is then used to partition a heat flux between conductive and hydrothermal sources and explicitly test the sensitivity of the circulation to the formulation of the abyssal heat flux our simulations suggest that representing the hydrothermal flux as a mass exchange indeed changes the heat distribution in the abyssal ocean increasing the advective heat transport from the abyss by up to 35 compared to conductive heat sources consequently we suggest that the inclusion of hydrothermal fluxes can be an important addition to course resolution ocean models keywords abyssal circulation ocean modelling hydrothermal geothermal heating heat flux 1 introduction geothermal fluxes through the ocean floor have only recently been considered as a significant factor influencing ocean circulation the global average of the geothermal heat flux into the oceans is estimated by davies and davies 2010 to be 105 4 mw m 2 at first glance it seems that neglecting these fluxes could be justified as net heat fluxes at the surface can be a thousand times greater in magnitude however this is not an entirely meaningful comparison the conductive component of the geothermal heat flux is always directed upwards e g adcroft et al 2001 hofmann and morales maqueda 2009 emile geay and madec 2009 whereas the surface fluxes can be positive or negative leading to cancellations on a global scale additionally the dense water masses acted upon by geothermal fluxes are rarely in contact with the surface of the ocean the surface area of outcropping antarctic bottom water for example is about one thousand times less than the seabed contact area thus making surface integrals of heat fluxes at the upper and lower boundaries comparable emile geay and madec 2009 an increasing interest in the impact of geothermal heating on the large scale circulation in recent years has led to the process being modelled at the global scale it had previously been studied at regional and basin scales e g stommel 1982 joyce and speer 1987 speer 1989 thompson and johnson 1996 but the companion papers of adcroft et al 2001 and scott et al 2001 were the first to consider geothermal heat fluxes as an influence on the global circulation their modelling experiments using a uniform seabed heat flux of 50 mw m 2 showed average abyssal temperature rising by 0 3 c and a 25 increase in the pacific meridional overturning this result is reinforced by consistent findings in the experiments of hofmann and morales maqueda 2009 emile geay and madec 2009 urakawa and hasumi 2009 mashayek et al 2013 and downes et al 2016 hofmann and morales maqueda 2009 used spatially varying geothermal heat fluxes based on the dataset of pollack et al 1993 to obtain an average abyssal temperature rise of about 0 4 c and a 33 increase in the formation rate of antarctic bottom water emile geay and madec 2009 followed a different method using the formula of stein and stein 1992 relating heat flow to crustal age and the high resolution dataset of crustal age from müller et al 1997 to produce similar results in another modelling study piecuch et al 2015 found that inclusion of geothermal heating raised the global mean sea level trend showing that its effects can be seen throughout the entire water column the geothermal heat flux into the ocean has two components conductive and advective or hydrothermal there is compelling modelling evidence to suggest that geothermal heating is an important contributor to global circulation but all of the experiments mentioned above employ an entirely conductive heat flux this is a potentially serious shortcoming since hydrothermal fluxes have a far from negligible contribution to the geothermal heating of the global ocean the global flow of hydrothermal fluids in and out of the crust has been estimated at up to 0 35 sv elderfield and schultz 1996 this is equivalent to one third of the global ocean s freshwater input from rivers and surface runoff a process which like hydrothermal activity has a strong buoyancy signature towards the young crust on the flanks of mid ocean ridges there is a discrepancy between predicted and observed geothermal heating anderson and hobart 1976 known as the heat flow anomaly as the observational methods measure conductive heat this discrepancy can be explained by the co existence of conductive heating and hydrothermal circulations the latter being dominant in areas where the crust is highly permeable and pathways exist which allow water to flow in and out of the ocean through the seabed e g harris and chapman 2004 stein and stein 1994 compare the heat flow model of stein and stein 1992 to observations and by studying the heat flow anomaly conclude that more than half of the geothermal heat flux through 10 million year old crust is advective in nature i e hydrothermal and that the proportion increases as the crust becomes younger they estimate that 34 of global heat flow is hydrothermal which is in agreement with the earlier estimate of sclater et al 1980 that one third of the total heat entering the ocean from below does so hydrothermally it seems reasonable to conjecture that this amount of advective flux must have an impact on the abyssal circulation different from that of a purely conductive heat flux the purpose of the work presented here is to gain understanding in a modelling context of the importance of hydrothermal flows in geothermally driven circulations at the scale of an ocean basin to this end we have introduced a physically consistent formulation of hydrothermal fluxes in the primitive equation ocean model nemo madec 2008 and conducted a number of numerical experiments to characterise the relative importance of hydrothermal and conductive heat fluxes to our knowledge this is the first time such hydrothermal flows have been implemented in an ocean circulation model of this type the rest of the paper is organised as follows in section 2 we present an analytical model used to assess the impact of a neutrally buoyant flux through the seabed on an otherwise motionless bottom layer we then move on to more complex but still idealised formulations that include heat fluxes in section 3 in this section we describe the implementation of conductive and hydrothermal fluxes in the nemo model and how the net geothermal flux is partitioned between the two in section 4 results from a series of numerical experiments are presented and interpreted with a focus on the differences between the two extremes where the heat source is either entirely conductive or entirely hydrothermal in nature in section 5 we discuss the findings of our experiments their relevance to the real world and what implications our results may have on future modelling 2 motivation circulation driven by vertical volume fluxes through the seabed mass or volume flux through the seabed has not been implemented in ocean modelling to date so it is important to detail this process here we take a simple first look at the effects of adding a flux of volume imposed as a velocity per unit length through the seabed using the linearised steady state shallow water equations we assume that all properties in the y direction are constant so y 0 in the vertical z 0 coincides with a flat seabed and the undisturbed free surface of the abyssal mixed layer is located at z h so that the thickness of the abyssal mixed layer is in general h x h η x where η x is a small perturbation the system is then described by the frictional geostrophic equations 1a f v r u g h x 1b f u r v 1c u x w z 0 with boundary conditions 2a w x h x u h x 2b w x 0 w b 2c u η 0 as x where u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z directions respectively the constants r and g are a rayleigh friction coefficient and the reduced gravity in the layer respectively the prescribed function wb x describes the distribution of the vertical fluid velocities through the seabed boundary and should be constructed so as to ensure that the domain conserves its volume i e that the integral of wb across the whole domain is zero since the problem is linear we arrive at the solutions for u v h and w being 3a u x x w b ξ d ξ h x 3b v x f r u x 3c h x h 2 2 f 2 r 2 r g x ζ w b ξ d ξ d ζ 3d w x z w b x w b x f 2 r 2 u 2 r g z h this solution shows that the flow u along the x direction results from the horizontal divergence caused by the discharge and recharge of water through the seabed 3a while the horizontal cross flow v is a balance between the components of friction and the coriolis force in the y direction 3b since we assume there is no stratification within the bottom mixed layer the horizontal flow is vertically uniform from the taylor proudman theorem and the vertical velocity varies linearly from its value at the seabed wb to that at the top of the mixed layer which is in general non zero to ensure that there is no flow across this interface the shape of the interface itself is determined by the shape of the velocity function wb to illustrate the resulting solutions we choose the function wb to be symmetric with an upwards flow centred at x 0 flanked by two areas of downward flow this is designed to mimic a hydrothermal vent field surrounded by porous seabed through which the water re enters the crust to avoid discontinuity in the boundary function and ensure volume is conserved we set 4 w b w 0 l 1 l 2 l 1 sin π x l 1 l 2 l 1 if l 2 x l 1 w 0 cos π x 2 l 1 if l 1 x l 1 w 0 l 1 l 2 l 1 sin π x l 1 l 2 l 1 if l 1 x l 2 0 otherwise where w 0 is the maximum velocity of the discharge chosen to be 10 7 m s 1 in line with the numerical simulations that will be presented in section 3 the distances from the centre of the discharge l 1 and l 2 are chosen to be 69 km and 347 km 5 8 and 25 8 degrees of latitude respectively near the equator and h 1000 m we also choose r 10 10 s 1 f 7 63 10 6 s 1 and g 0 029 m s 2 using these parameters we obtain a fountain shaped overturning flow shown in fig 1 with an upward displacement of the layer surface above the water discharge area the discharged flow extends vertically through the entire unstratified layer which in our example is meant to represent the mixed layer of the abyssal ocean 3 geothermally driven circulations with both conductive and hydrothermal heat fluxes having discussed the circulation which could arise from volume fluxes alone we will now investigate the effects of adding heat into the system both through the hydrothermal fluxes in which the temperature of the discharge is typically higher than that of the abyssal water and via conduction the calculations involved are far more complex than those above and thus require a numerical model to this end we have created a configuration of the nemo nucleus for european modelling of the ocean modelling framework madec 2008 which allows the partitioning of the heat flux between conductive and hydrothermal input at the seabed our configuration uses a tvd total variance dissipation advection scheme that implements the method of zalesak 1979 lateral eddy diffusion and transport are parameterised through isopycnic redi redi 1982 and gent mcwilliams gent and mcwilliams 1990 diffusion with uniform diffusivities of 30 m2 s 1 for both processes this is smaller than lateral diffusivities that might be used higher up in the water column but the abyssal currents are relatively small and we do not wish to have them masked by diffusive effect a lower lateral diffusivity allows us to better observe the impacts of advective processes in the vertical we use a uniform diapycnal diffusivity of 1 2 10 5 m2 s 1 except when the water column becomes hydrostatically unstable in which case the vertical diffusion is ramped up to 100 m2 s 1 in order to parameterise vertical convection the introduction of conductive fluxes through the seabed uses the paramaterisation of emile geay and madec 2009 hydrothermal fluxes are formulated by prescribing a field of vertical velocities at the seabed representing the net hydrothermal volume exchange per unit area between the oceanic crust and the abyssal ocean these vertical velocities enter as a bottom boundary condition in the continuity equation thus ensuring that volume is conserved nemo uses the boussinesq approximation and that the barotropic mode is solved correctly we use the fully non linear free surface formulation of the barotropic mode implemented in nemo the advective flux of hydrothermal properties e g temperature and salinity across the ocean bottom is calculated using an upstream transport approach namely waters flowing upwards from the crust into the ocean have prescribed properties while waters flowing downwards into the crust leave the ocean with the properties of the deepest oceanic model cell at each horizontal location the volume flux formulation was tested in an unstratified rectangular basin matching that of our analytical model solutions from the two were compared in order to verify that our new configuration operates as intended similar circulation patterns were created and all three velocity fields showed the same general behaviour in both cases our model configuration reflects the basic features of the panama basin in the equatorial east pacific fig 2 this basin is entirely enclosed below about 2000 m except for the saddle of the carnegie ridge which does not extend deeper than 2500 m and the ecuador trench which allows water to be exchanged with the southern pacific along the edge of the south american continental shelf at a depth of about 2700 m thus the abyssal panama basin is almost entirely isolated from the rest of the pacific ocean the region is of interest due to the known importance of geothermal heating in its circulation as evidenced by several surveys of the region in the 1970s the area has not been heavily studied since but has recently become the focus for interdisciplinary research into interactions between the ocean and solid earth observations suggest that vertical mixing in the basin is negligible laird 1971 which would mean that the conditions in the abyss are mostly due to seabed processes an estimate based on inflow measured at the ecuador trench gives a relatively fast vertical advection averaging 17 m yr 1 lonsdale 1977 the renewal of bottom water in the basin requires a driving force and calculations based on a theoretical heat flow driving the circulation are consistent with observations of the oxygen consumption rate laird 1971 detrick et al 1974 the idealised model domain is two dimensional in keeping with the previous analytical problems this prevents extra complexities such as eddy formation and allows us simpler solutions in this first step towards understanding the effects of differing heat fluxes this is achieved in nemo by using only one grid cell in the x direction and applying cyclical boundary conditions the resolution is 1 8 13 875 km in the horizontal spanning the region from 2 s to 8 n and there are 60 vertical levels chosen to give greater resolution to the deepest parts of the ocean ranging almost linearly from 10 m thick at the bottom of the domain to 100 m thick at the top the configuration is designed to crudely represent a north south cross section through the panama basin as displayed in fig 3 the north side of the model domain is a solid wall representing the coastline of central america at the other side south of 1 s the hydrography is restored with a time scale of one year to a climatological profile of temperature and salinity in the area taken from the world ocean atlas locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 this relaxation tries to represent in a simple way the effects of the flow through the ecuador trench restoring is also used at the surface in the top 100 m of the domain with a time scale of one month as a proxy for surface heat and freshwater fluxes this leaves the abyssal ocean in our model free to evolve in response to geothermal forcing and the restoring at the boundaries in a preliminary set of experiments we show simulations in a symmetrical basin with a solid wall either side to better compare the results with our analytical flow solution heat fluxes are introduced into the ocean across an area of the seabed at the centre of the domain distributed according to a cosine function as in the analytical model influenced by the fact that more heat enters the abyssal ocean closer to the spreading centres of mid ocean ridges such as those in the middle of the panama basin at either side are areas of hydrothermal recharge which allow water to flow out of the system at such a rate as to conserve the total volume just as in the analytical model we apply an average total geothermal heat flux of g over the length of the domain lg this is partitioned into a conductive heat flux of c applied over a length ℓ1 and a hydrothermal flux with a given temperature and discharge velocity a hydrothermal discharge with temperature t 1 and average velocity v 1 is applied over ℓ1 the recharge occurs over a length ℓ2 half at either side of the discharge with temperature t 2 being equal to that of the bottom water as calculated by the model averaged over the area of recharge and average velocity v 2 v 1 ℓ 1 ℓ 2 in order to conserve volume the heat fluxes h 1 and h 2 associated with the hydrothermal flows are h i v i t i ρ c p where ρ is a reference density and cp is a specific heat capacity we use the values ρ 1035 kg m 3 and c p 4000 j kg 1 k 1 to have heating take place over the same width as a mid ocean ridge we choose ℓ 1 5 4 10 grid cells approximately 139 km we choose ℓ 2 5 40 grid cells 555 km larger than ℓ1 to ensure that the recharge velocity is less vigorous than the discharge in all our experiments we enforce g 105 4 mw m 2 based on the davies and davies 2010 global average heat flow value this heat input is partitioned between hydrothermal and conductive fluxes by use of the term 0 αh 1 a measure of the proportion of the heat flux which is introduced hydrothermally partitioning the heat flux in this way and uniformly for the entire length of the seabed gives us the relations 5a 1 α h g l g c ℓ 1 5b α h g l g h 1 ℓ 1 h 2 ℓ 2 the hydrothermal fluxes must be prescribed in the model either by their temperature t 1 or their discharge rate v 1 and then to preserve the prescribed net heat flux the unprescribed variable is calculated using either 6a v 1 α h g l g t 1 t 2 ℓ 1 ρ c p 6b or t 1 α h g l g v 1 ℓ 1 ρ c p t 2 we have made the choice of prescribing t 1 as t 1 t b δ t where tb is the average ocean bottom temperature over the discharge area and δt is a prescribed positive anomaly which we vary from one experiment to the next thus allowing us to also explore a range of values of v 1 via 6a for each temperature difference δt a set of five simulations were run with α h 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 the model was integrated until it reached a near steady state at which the maximum temperature change below 2500 m was smaller than 0 001 c over a decade 4 results 4 1 symmetric experiments before embarking upon our main set of experiments we carried out simulations with no lateral restoring as an intermediate step between our analytical model and the experiments inspired by the panama basin the initial stratification in these experiments was as in the panama basin simulations and restoring was applied only at the surface solid boundaries are on both sides of the domain the hydrothermal discharge and conductive heating were applied between 2 875 n and 4 125 n two experiments were run to near steady state one with a high velocity purely hydrothermal flux α h 1 δ t 0 01 and one with a purely conductive flux αh 0 the streamlines in fig 4 show that the two types of heat flux cause rather different circulations the flow induced by the conductive flux fig 4 a shows simple overturning cells where water that is heated and rises is replaced via a lateral flow in the hydrothermal case fig 4 b we see a fountain shape reminiscent of that seen in the analytical solutions although with extra complexities introduced by the hydrothermal source including heat in addition to just volume indeed while in the analytical study the horizontal flow is directed away from the discharge area at all depths in the numerical simulations there is horizontal convergence as relatively cold water is advected towards the source area at depths below about 3000 m to replace the warmer water convecting upwards the upper extent of the main overturning circulations in each case is around 2600 m this suggests that the upwelling water above the heat source reaches neutral buoyancy at the same depth in both cases indicating little difference in the temperature of the water at that point after reaching this maximum height the flows spread outwards the hydrothermal source induces a wider reaching circulation as the downward flow at the bottom boundary causes streamlines to terminate in the recharge zones on the seabed rather than circulating back around to the centre again in reality the hydrothermal circulation continues under the surface of the oceanic crust outside of the model domain closer to the source the streamlines in the hydrothermal case are drawn towards the centre before eventually ending up in the seabed this suggests that the hydrothermal inflow is heating the surrounding abyssal water and causing a greater upwelling than can be balanced by the prescribed inflow alone as in the conductive case some water needs to flow in from the sides to replace that which becomes more buoyant and rises 4 2 panama basin experiments the only difference between the symmetrical experiments and our panama basin setup is in the lateral restoring field these experiments implement restoring down one side to mimic the inflow through the ecuador trench as shown schematically in fig 3 our results show several differences in circulation and temperature distribution between experiments the hydrothermal flux regime seems to be more effective at evacuating heat from the abyssal ocean than the conductive regime as would be expected this difference becomes more pronounced as the value of αh increases and the heat flux becomes more dominated by its hydrothermal component the evolution of the average temperature in the abyssal ocean varies fairly linearly with αh as is shown in fig 5 due to the formulation of our fluxes as described in section 3 a lower temperature difference between the hydrothermal discharge and bottom waters necessitates a larger mass flux the choice of δt makes a big difference to the impacts of a hydrothermal heat flux where δ t 10 c the conductive and hydrothermal cases are almost indistinguishable in both heat distribution and circulation dynamics as δt decreases and the velocity of the discharge increases much larger differences are seen between the two cases the differences in the circulation and heat distribution are intrinsically linked so where larger differences in the average abyssal temperature are seen in fig 5 we also see larger differences in the circulation the comparisons we make throughout the rest of this section are between a purely conductive flux and a high velocity hydrothermal flux the two extreme cases among our sets of experiments the reality will lie somewhere between the two extremes but this comparison allows us to clearly investigate the different effects these two types of heat flux have on the abyssal ocean the effect of applying a lateral restoring on the southern flank of the domain is the creation of an asymmetric circulation on the north side of the basin where there is simply a wall the abyssal ocean is well mixed but on the south side a strong stratification with slanted isotherms is maintained as can be seen in fig 6 the area in which lateral restoring is applied does not appear in any of the figures as it is not intended to represent any part of the interior of the basin only to mimic the effects of flow through the ecuador trench looking at the distribution of temperature differences throughout the basin between the purely hydrothermal and the purely conductive cases fig 6 e we find that while the average temperature is lower in the former the temperature is higher at the southern side of the basin near the seabed this temperature difference of up to 0 3 c occurs just above the southern recharge zone plotting the streamlines of the two different flows helps us to understand how differences in circulation are linked to the different temperature distributions fig 7 the effect of the lateral boundary restoring is seen again with a strong circulation maintained throughout the southern half of the basin and comparatively little flow at the northern side the hydrothermal fluxes also produce a relatively strong horizontal flow from the area of discharge to the area of recharge along the very bottom level of the ocean domain the conductive case is in contrast exhibiting a weak horizontal flow in the other direction i e towards the centre of the basin as water from the sides replaces the warmer water which rises due to buoyancy looking more closely at the heat flux throughout the water column we can try to determine further effects of the two different processes of geothermal heating by calculating different components of the heat flux we can investigate more precisely how the geothermal fluxes alter heat exchanges through the ocean consider a slab of the domain comprised between the seabed and a depth z d and between 1 s y s and 8 n y n where there is no restoring the rate of change in the total heat content q for this slab is due to the contributions of several heat transport processes as illustrated in fig 8 the main contributions are from geothermal heating f geo lateral advection f lat vertical advection f adv and vertical diffusion f dif the eddy parameterisation fluxes of the model are included when calculating the advection and diffusion the residual is given the shorthand f res and includes all unaccounted for numerical contributions to q t such as spurious dispersion from the model s tvd advection scheme which is not included in the method of calculating advection below it also includes the effects of lateral diffusion which were not of great importance to our analysis we write the heat content relationship mathematically as 7 q t f geo f lat f adv f dif f res where 8a q μ 0 d y s y n t y z d y d z 8b f geo g 8c f lat μ 0 d v y s z t y s z d z 8d f adv μ y s y n w y h t y h d y 8e f dif μ y s y n κ y h t y h z d y in the expressions above μ ρ c p y n y s is the multiplication factor which ensures that these values are heat fluxes into the specified slab with units of wm 2 to remain consistent with our model s prescribed boundary condition additionally ρ is a reference density cp is heat capacity t is temperature g is average geothermal heat flux v and w are meridional and vertical velocity and κ is vertical diffusivity these calculations are performed at each level interface by changing the value of d we then have information about the average heat fluxes of each type in slabs of increasing thickness fig 9 compiles the information into depth profiles of the average heat fluxes from the seabed up to a given depth we ignore data from above 500 m depth as the surface restoring distorts the results we can see that the changes caused by altering the heat flux at the seabed are confined to the deep ocean and that above 1500 m depth there is almost no difference between the hydrothermal and conductive cases importantly the difference is also confined to the advective components of the heat flux while changes in the vertical diffusive heat flux are negligible not unexpectedly using a hydrothermal flux increases the strength of the advective components of the heat flux in the abyssal ocean the vertical and lateral advective fluxes act to almost balance each other irrespective of the value of αh with heat being evacuated from the abyss by the vertical advective flux and being replenished via lateral advection through the ecuador trench in the hydrothermal case the magnitude of the vertical advective flux in the abyssal ocean increases by up to 35 compared to the conductive case being 21 greater on average between 2500 m depth and the seabed the lateral advection increases by an even greater amount up to 45 with an average change in the abyssal ocean of 28 the strong vertical advection reaches a little further up the water column with a conductive source so that above about 2350 m the advective fluxes are actually smaller in the hydrothermal case 5 discussion from the experiments we have run it appears that introducing a portion of the geothermal heat flux hydrothermally makes an important contribution to circulation in the abyssal ocean our analytical solution was the first indicator of the importance of these flows before even considering the effects of heating the existence of a volume flux through the seabed which has not been implemented in large scale modelling before contributes to the abyssal circulation in the absence of other processes the flow induced by these volume fluxes permeates the entire bottom mixed layer and causes a vertical displacement of its top interface in our numerical model we see many differences between the circulations and the distribution and transportation of heat induced by hydrothermal and conductive heat fluxes with a hydrothermal flux as opposed to a conductive one the advective heat transport in the abyssal ocean is increased by up to 35 in the vertical and up to 45 laterally through the side of the basin due to our boundary conditions this represents an increased flow though the ecuador trench meanwhile there is no appreciable change in the basin averaged diffusive heat flux except at depths a few tens of metres above the seabed so in the purely hydrothermal simulation we see the same effect as a conductive flux plus the additional advection caused by a velocity boundary condition this was seen in our symmetrical model which showed the streamlines of the hydrothermally driven flow moving in towards the heat source just as those of the conductive flow do before turning back downwards to terminate in the seabed in the panama basin setup the increased vertical advection drives through continuity the increase in lateral advection through the side it has previously been proposed based on observational data that flow through the ecuador trench is partly driven by upwelling in the basin interior caused by geothermal heating lonsdale 1977 this theory agrees with the relationship we see between the vertical and lateral advective fluxes in our model when entering into this work we wanted to determine whether the use of hydrothermal as opposed to purely conductive fluxes in ocean models was a necessary addition to better represent the abyssal circulation and under which circumstances it would be relevant if so we have found that the impacts on circulation and heat distribution of a high velocity hydrothermal flux are significant at basin scales in the abyssal ocean but unlikely to make any noticeable difference in the upper ocean so the usefulness of including these fluxes in ocean models very much depends on what one is interested in investigating for future modelling of the abyssal circulation in the panama basin it will be worth including hydrothermal boundary conditions in addition to conductive heat fluxes since the panama basin has an average heat flux of 270 mw m 2 calculated from the formula of stein and stein 1992 together with the crustal age data of müller et al 1997 this is about 2 5 times the global average used in our model and so the differences between the two extreme model cases in the region could be even more significant than those we have seen in our results we previously noted that the abyssal temperature and circulation in our model results are sensitive to the choice of δt the difference in temperature between the hydrothermal flow and the bottom water the extreme case we focused on was δ t 0 01 c but with larger values the differences between the circulations caused are less pronounced while fluids from individual vents have been recorded at stable temperatures above 400 c koschinsky et al 2008 these are extremely small points when put in the context of a basin scale model since our lateral grid resolution is 1 8 we must use values which represent the average δt over a large area at this scale taking into account the spacially sparce and scattered nature of hydrothermal venting and the fact that much of it occurs at much lower temperatures a fraction of a degree celcius seems a reasonable value for the average δt in the ocean using a simple approach to this modelling was important in order to provide a clear first look at the processes but it does come with some limitations it is likely that areas of hydrothermal discharge and recharge are distributed in a far more disorderly manner than the symmetric boundary condition we implemented creating far more complex flow patterns than in our simulations as competing regions of upward and downward velocity interact the scales of realistic flows would likely be smaller in that case additionally the conductive portion of the heat flux will be present throughout the entire basin rather than only at the centre although the distribution of heat will be more heavily weighted towards the mid ocean ridges which is the justification for our idealised boundary condition 6 conclusion our idealised models have shown that the hydrothermal component of the global heat flux can affect the abyssal circulation in ways which a purely conductive heat flux cannot compared to the conductive case the advective heat flux in our experiments is increased by up to 45 in the abyssal ocean while the water below 2500 m is only slightly cooler on average the heat is distributed differently such that there are localised patches which see temperatures change by up to 0 3 c it remains to be seen however whether the effects seen in our results will be present to the same degree of significance in a more realistic model this is something we plan on investigating in further experiments with a full 3d regional model of the panama basin and using observational data from the area to help interpret the results there could be complications in taking this method forward to more realistic modelling experiments as creating realistic boundary conditions will not necessarily be a simple task at coarser resolutions the models of stein and stein 1992 will suffice but for more detailed regional models observational data would be preferable however there are not many observations concerning the distribution of hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor in particular how widespread or concentrated areas of discharge and recharge may be conducting a statistical study on the relative frequency of hydrothermal activity baker and german 2004 only had enough data to have a reasonable degree of confidence in their estimates for about 10 of the global ocean ridges nevertheless hydrothermal boundary conditions will be considered in our future modelling studies of the area for more general usage the importance of including the hydrothermal boundary condition will vary depending on the scales involved in the model and the focus of the modelling project for the upper ocean we see no discernible difference between using conductive or hydrothermal heat fluxes so it would not be a worthwhile addition for projects with their focus here deeper down we see important differences in the heat distribution but some of these occur only over small areas and may lose significance in lower resolution models in particular our configuration designed to emphasise changes in the abyss contains a much finer resolution in the abyssal ocean than standard ocean circulation models we would not expect to see such significant differences between the two types of heat flux when using standard vertical layers with resolutions often in the hundreds of metres in the abyss the average abyssal temperature difference is under 0 04 c but our high resolution brings out areas where the temperature changes by up to 0 3 c between the two cases as such we would recommend a high vertical resolution in this part of the ocean for any experiments involving geothermal heating at low resolutions the introduction of hydrothermal boundary conditions will be less worthwhile our findings have implications not only for the panama basin but for other partially enclosed basins containing hydrothermal sources examples of such basins can be found across the globe including the scotia sea cayman trough red sea sea of japan and the arctic ocean simple models of the type we have been using could be adapted to take on the features of these other ocean basins and produce representative values for the components of their heat fluxes quite possibly revealing higher advective transport in the same way as our results have for the panama basin it seems that the question of whether or not to include hydrothermal fluxes in models needs to be addressed on a case by case basis taking into account the above considerations for any work with a focus on the abyssal ocean at a reasonably high resolution it will certainly be a very useful addition to the modelling process acknowledgements this work is

24131,geothermal heating is increasingly recognised as an important factor affecting ocean circulation with modelling studies suggesting that this heat source could lead to first order changes in the formation rate of antarctic bottom water as well as a significant warming effect in the abyssal ocean where it has been represented in numerical models however the geothermal heat flux into the ocean is generally treated as an entirely conductive flux despite an estimated one third of the global geothermal flux being introduced to the ocean via hydrothermal sources a modelling study is presented which investigates the sensitivity of the geothermally forced circulation to the way heat is supplied to the abyssal ocean an analytical two dimensional model of the circulation is described which demonstrates the effects of a volume flux through the ocean bed a simulation using the nemo numerical general circulation model in an idealised domain is then used to partition a heat flux between conductive and hydrothermal sources and explicitly test the sensitivity of the circulation to the formulation of the abyssal heat flux our simulations suggest that representing the hydrothermal flux as a mass exchange indeed changes the heat distribution in the abyssal ocean increasing the advective heat transport from the abyss by up to 35 compared to conductive heat sources consequently we suggest that the inclusion of hydrothermal fluxes can be an important addition to course resolution ocean models keywords abyssal circulation ocean modelling hydrothermal geothermal heating heat flux 1 introduction geothermal fluxes through the ocean floor have only recently been considered as a significant factor influencing ocean circulation the global average of the geothermal heat flux into the oceans is estimated by davies and davies 2010 to be 105 4 mw m 2 at first glance it seems that neglecting these fluxes could be justified as net heat fluxes at the surface can be a thousand times greater in magnitude however this is not an entirely meaningful comparison the conductive component of the geothermal heat flux is always directed upwards e g adcroft et al 2001 hofmann and morales maqueda 2009 emile geay and madec 2009 whereas the surface fluxes can be positive or negative leading to cancellations on a global scale additionally the dense water masses acted upon by geothermal fluxes are rarely in contact with the surface of the ocean the surface area of outcropping antarctic bottom water for example is about one thousand times less than the seabed contact area thus making surface integrals of heat fluxes at the upper and lower boundaries comparable emile geay and madec 2009 an increasing interest in the impact of geothermal heating on the large scale circulation in recent years has led to the process being modelled at the global scale it had previously been studied at regional and basin scales e g stommel 1982 joyce and speer 1987 speer 1989 thompson and johnson 1996 but the companion papers of adcroft et al 2001 and scott et al 2001 were the first to consider geothermal heat fluxes as an influence on the global circulation their modelling experiments using a uniform seabed heat flux of 50 mw m 2 showed average abyssal temperature rising by 0 3 c and a 25 increase in the pacific meridional overturning this result is reinforced by consistent findings in the experiments of hofmann and morales maqueda 2009 emile geay and madec 2009 urakawa and hasumi 2009 mashayek et al 2013 and downes et al 2016 hofmann and morales maqueda 2009 used spatially varying geothermal heat fluxes based on the dataset of pollack et al 1993 to obtain an average abyssal temperature rise of about 0 4 c and a 33 increase in the formation rate of antarctic bottom water emile geay and madec 2009 followed a different method using the formula of stein and stein 1992 relating heat flow to crustal age and the high resolution dataset of crustal age from müller et al 1997 to produce similar results in another modelling study piecuch et al 2015 found that inclusion of geothermal heating raised the global mean sea level trend showing that its effects can be seen throughout the entire water column the geothermal heat flux into the ocean has two components conductive and advective or hydrothermal there is compelling modelling evidence to suggest that geothermal heating is an important contributor to global circulation but all of the experiments mentioned above employ an entirely conductive heat flux this is a potentially serious shortcoming since hydrothermal fluxes have a far from negligible contribution to the geothermal heating of the global ocean the global flow of hydrothermal fluids in and out of the crust has been estimated at up to 0 35 sv elderfield and schultz 1996 this is equivalent to one third of the global ocean s freshwater input from rivers and surface runoff a process which like hydrothermal activity has a strong buoyancy signature towards the young crust on the flanks of mid ocean ridges there is a discrepancy between predicted and observed geothermal heating anderson and hobart 1976 known as the heat flow anomaly as the observational methods measure conductive heat this discrepancy can be explained by the co existence of conductive heating and hydrothermal circulations the latter being dominant in areas where the crust is highly permeable and pathways exist which allow water to flow in and out of the ocean through the seabed e g harris and chapman 2004 stein and stein 1994 compare the heat flow model of stein and stein 1992 to observations and by studying the heat flow anomaly conclude that more than half of the geothermal heat flux through 10 million year old crust is advective in nature i e hydrothermal and that the proportion increases as the crust becomes younger they estimate that 34 of global heat flow is hydrothermal which is in agreement with the earlier estimate of sclater et al 1980 that one third of the total heat entering the ocean from below does so hydrothermally it seems reasonable to conjecture that this amount of advective flux must have an impact on the abyssal circulation different from that of a purely conductive heat flux the purpose of the work presented here is to gain understanding in a modelling context of the importance of hydrothermal flows in geothermally driven circulations at the scale of an ocean basin to this end we have introduced a physically consistent formulation of hydrothermal fluxes in the primitive equation ocean model nemo madec 2008 and conducted a number of numerical experiments to characterise the relative importance of hydrothermal and conductive heat fluxes to our knowledge this is the first time such hydrothermal flows have been implemented in an ocean circulation model of this type the rest of the paper is organised as follows in section 2 we present an analytical model used to assess the impact of a neutrally buoyant flux through the seabed on an otherwise motionless bottom layer we then move on to more complex but still idealised formulations that include heat fluxes in section 3 in this section we describe the implementation of conductive and hydrothermal fluxes in the nemo model and how the net geothermal flux is partitioned between the two in section 4 results from a series of numerical experiments are presented and interpreted with a focus on the differences between the two extremes where the heat source is either entirely conductive or entirely hydrothermal in nature in section 5 we discuss the findings of our experiments their relevance to the real world and what implications our results may have on future modelling 2 motivation circulation driven by vertical volume fluxes through the seabed mass or volume flux through the seabed has not been implemented in ocean modelling to date so it is important to detail this process here we take a simple first look at the effects of adding a flux of volume imposed as a velocity per unit length through the seabed using the linearised steady state shallow water equations we assume that all properties in the y direction are constant so y 0 in the vertical z 0 coincides with a flat seabed and the undisturbed free surface of the abyssal mixed layer is located at z h so that the thickness of the abyssal mixed layer is in general h x h η x where η x is a small perturbation the system is then described by the frictional geostrophic equations 1a f v r u g h x 1b f u r v 1c u x w z 0 with boundary conditions 2a w x h x u h x 2b w x 0 w b 2c u η 0 as x where u v and w are the velocities in the x y and z directions respectively the constants r and g are a rayleigh friction coefficient and the reduced gravity in the layer respectively the prescribed function wb x describes the distribution of the vertical fluid velocities through the seabed boundary and should be constructed so as to ensure that the domain conserves its volume i e that the integral of wb across the whole domain is zero since the problem is linear we arrive at the solutions for u v h and w being 3a u x x w b ξ d ξ h x 3b v x f r u x 3c h x h 2 2 f 2 r 2 r g x ζ w b ξ d ξ d ζ 3d w x z w b x w b x f 2 r 2 u 2 r g z h this solution shows that the flow u along the x direction results from the horizontal divergence caused by the discharge and recharge of water through the seabed 3a while the horizontal cross flow v is a balance between the components of friction and the coriolis force in the y direction 3b since we assume there is no stratification within the bottom mixed layer the horizontal flow is vertically uniform from the taylor proudman theorem and the vertical velocity varies linearly from its value at the seabed wb to that at the top of the mixed layer which is in general non zero to ensure that there is no flow across this interface the shape of the interface itself is determined by the shape of the velocity function wb to illustrate the resulting solutions we choose the function wb to be symmetric with an upwards flow centred at x 0 flanked by two areas of downward flow this is designed to mimic a hydrothermal vent field surrounded by porous seabed through which the water re enters the crust to avoid discontinuity in the boundary function and ensure volume is conserved we set 4 w b w 0 l 1 l 2 l 1 sin π x l 1 l 2 l 1 if l 2 x l 1 w 0 cos π x 2 l 1 if l 1 x l 1 w 0 l 1 l 2 l 1 sin π x l 1 l 2 l 1 if l 1 x l 2 0 otherwise where w 0 is the maximum velocity of the discharge chosen to be 10 7 m s 1 in line with the numerical simulations that will be presented in section 3 the distances from the centre of the discharge l 1 and l 2 are chosen to be 69 km and 347 km 5 8 and 25 8 degrees of latitude respectively near the equator and h 1000 m we also choose r 10 10 s 1 f 7 63 10 6 s 1 and g 0 029 m s 2 using these parameters we obtain a fountain shaped overturning flow shown in fig 1 with an upward displacement of the layer surface above the water discharge area the discharged flow extends vertically through the entire unstratified layer which in our example is meant to represent the mixed layer of the abyssal ocean 3 geothermally driven circulations with both conductive and hydrothermal heat fluxes having discussed the circulation which could arise from volume fluxes alone we will now investigate the effects of adding heat into the system both through the hydrothermal fluxes in which the temperature of the discharge is typically higher than that of the abyssal water and via conduction the calculations involved are far more complex than those above and thus require a numerical model to this end we have created a configuration of the nemo nucleus for european modelling of the ocean modelling framework madec 2008 which allows the partitioning of the heat flux between conductive and hydrothermal input at the seabed our configuration uses a tvd total variance dissipation advection scheme that implements the method of zalesak 1979 lateral eddy diffusion and transport are parameterised through isopycnic redi redi 1982 and gent mcwilliams gent and mcwilliams 1990 diffusion with uniform diffusivities of 30 m2 s 1 for both processes this is smaller than lateral diffusivities that might be used higher up in the water column but the abyssal currents are relatively small and we do not wish to have them masked by diffusive effect a lower lateral diffusivity allows us to better observe the impacts of advective processes in the vertical we use a uniform diapycnal diffusivity of 1 2 10 5 m2 s 1 except when the water column becomes hydrostatically unstable in which case the vertical diffusion is ramped up to 100 m2 s 1 in order to parameterise vertical convection the introduction of conductive fluxes through the seabed uses the paramaterisation of emile geay and madec 2009 hydrothermal fluxes are formulated by prescribing a field of vertical velocities at the seabed representing the net hydrothermal volume exchange per unit area between the oceanic crust and the abyssal ocean these vertical velocities enter as a bottom boundary condition in the continuity equation thus ensuring that volume is conserved nemo uses the boussinesq approximation and that the barotropic mode is solved correctly we use the fully non linear free surface formulation of the barotropic mode implemented in nemo the advective flux of hydrothermal properties e g temperature and salinity across the ocean bottom is calculated using an upstream transport approach namely waters flowing upwards from the crust into the ocean have prescribed properties while waters flowing downwards into the crust leave the ocean with the properties of the deepest oceanic model cell at each horizontal location the volume flux formulation was tested in an unstratified rectangular basin matching that of our analytical model solutions from the two were compared in order to verify that our new configuration operates as intended similar circulation patterns were created and all three velocity fields showed the same general behaviour in both cases our model configuration reflects the basic features of the panama basin in the equatorial east pacific fig 2 this basin is entirely enclosed below about 2000 m except for the saddle of the carnegie ridge which does not extend deeper than 2500 m and the ecuador trench which allows water to be exchanged with the southern pacific along the edge of the south american continental shelf at a depth of about 2700 m thus the abyssal panama basin is almost entirely isolated from the rest of the pacific ocean the region is of interest due to the known importance of geothermal heating in its circulation as evidenced by several surveys of the region in the 1970s the area has not been heavily studied since but has recently become the focus for interdisciplinary research into interactions between the ocean and solid earth observations suggest that vertical mixing in the basin is negligible laird 1971 which would mean that the conditions in the abyss are mostly due to seabed processes an estimate based on inflow measured at the ecuador trench gives a relatively fast vertical advection averaging 17 m yr 1 lonsdale 1977 the renewal of bottom water in the basin requires a driving force and calculations based on a theoretical heat flow driving the circulation are consistent with observations of the oxygen consumption rate laird 1971 detrick et al 1974 the idealised model domain is two dimensional in keeping with the previous analytical problems this prevents extra complexities such as eddy formation and allows us simpler solutions in this first step towards understanding the effects of differing heat fluxes this is achieved in nemo by using only one grid cell in the x direction and applying cyclical boundary conditions the resolution is 1 8 13 875 km in the horizontal spanning the region from 2 s to 8 n and there are 60 vertical levels chosen to give greater resolution to the deepest parts of the ocean ranging almost linearly from 10 m thick at the bottom of the domain to 100 m thick at the top the configuration is designed to crudely represent a north south cross section through the panama basin as displayed in fig 3 the north side of the model domain is a solid wall representing the coastline of central america at the other side south of 1 s the hydrography is restored with a time scale of one year to a climatological profile of temperature and salinity in the area taken from the world ocean atlas locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 this relaxation tries to represent in a simple way the effects of the flow through the ecuador trench restoring is also used at the surface in the top 100 m of the domain with a time scale of one month as a proxy for surface heat and freshwater fluxes this leaves the abyssal ocean in our model free to evolve in response to geothermal forcing and the restoring at the boundaries in a preliminary set of experiments we show simulations in a symmetrical basin with a solid wall either side to better compare the results with our analytical flow solution heat fluxes are introduced into the ocean across an area of the seabed at the centre of the domain distributed according to a cosine function as in the analytical model influenced by the fact that more heat enters the abyssal ocean closer to the spreading centres of mid ocean ridges such as those in the middle of the panama basin at either side are areas of hydrothermal recharge which allow water to flow out of the system at such a rate as to conserve the total volume just as in the analytical model we apply an average total geothermal heat flux of g over the length of the domain lg this is partitioned into a conductive heat flux of c applied over a length ℓ1 and a hydrothermal flux with a given temperature and discharge velocity a hydrothermal discharge with temperature t 1 and average velocity v 1 is applied over ℓ1 the recharge occurs over a length ℓ2 half at either side of the discharge with temperature t 2 being equal to that of the bottom water as calculated by the model averaged over the area of recharge and average velocity v 2 v 1 ℓ 1 ℓ 2 in order to conserve volume the heat fluxes h 1 and h 2 associated with the hydrothermal flows are h i v i t i ρ c p where ρ is a reference density and cp is a specific heat capacity we use the values ρ 1035 kg m 3 and c p 4000 j kg 1 k 1 to have heating take place over the same width as a mid ocean ridge we choose ℓ 1 5 4 10 grid cells approximately 139 km we choose ℓ 2 5 40 grid cells 555 km larger than ℓ1 to ensure that the recharge velocity is less vigorous than the discharge in all our experiments we enforce g 105 4 mw m 2 based on the davies and davies 2010 global average heat flow value this heat input is partitioned between hydrothermal and conductive fluxes by use of the term 0 αh 1 a measure of the proportion of the heat flux which is introduced hydrothermally partitioning the heat flux in this way and uniformly for the entire length of the seabed gives us the relations 5a 1 α h g l g c ℓ 1 5b α h g l g h 1 ℓ 1 h 2 ℓ 2 the hydrothermal fluxes must be prescribed in the model either by their temperature t 1 or their discharge rate v 1 and then to preserve the prescribed net heat flux the unprescribed variable is calculated using either 6a v 1 α h g l g t 1 t 2 ℓ 1 ρ c p 6b or t 1 α h g l g v 1 ℓ 1 ρ c p t 2 we have made the choice of prescribing t 1 as t 1 t b δ t where tb is the average ocean bottom temperature over the discharge area and δt is a prescribed positive anomaly which we vary from one experiment to the next thus allowing us to also explore a range of values of v 1 via 6a for each temperature difference δt a set of five simulations were run with α h 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 the model was integrated until it reached a near steady state at which the maximum temperature change below 2500 m was smaller than 0 001 c over a decade 4 results 4 1 symmetric experiments before embarking upon our main set of experiments we carried out simulations with no lateral restoring as an intermediate step between our analytical model and the experiments inspired by the panama basin the initial stratification in these experiments was as in the panama basin simulations and restoring was applied only at the surface solid boundaries are on both sides of the domain the hydrothermal discharge and conductive heating were applied between 2 875 n and 4 125 n two experiments were run to near steady state one with a high velocity purely hydrothermal flux α h 1 δ t 0 01 and one with a purely conductive flux αh 0 the streamlines in fig 4 show that the two types of heat flux cause rather different circulations the flow induced by the conductive flux fig 4 a shows simple overturning cells where water that is heated and rises is replaced via a lateral flow in the hydrothermal case fig 4 b we see a fountain shape reminiscent of that seen in the analytical solutions although with extra complexities introduced by the hydrothermal source including heat in addition to just volume indeed while in the analytical study the horizontal flow is directed away from the discharge area at all depths in the numerical simulations there is horizontal convergence as relatively cold water is advected towards the source area at depths below about 3000 m to replace the warmer water convecting upwards the upper extent of the main overturning circulations in each case is around 2600 m this suggests that the upwelling water above the heat source reaches neutral buoyancy at the same depth in both cases indicating little difference in the temperature of the water at that point after reaching this maximum height the flows spread outwards the hydrothermal source induces a wider reaching circulation as the downward flow at the bottom boundary causes streamlines to terminate in the recharge zones on the seabed rather than circulating back around to the centre again in reality the hydrothermal circulation continues under the surface of the oceanic crust outside of the model domain closer to the source the streamlines in the hydrothermal case are drawn towards the centre before eventually ending up in the seabed this suggests that the hydrothermal inflow is heating the surrounding abyssal water and causing a greater upwelling than can be balanced by the prescribed inflow alone as in the conductive case some water needs to flow in from the sides to replace that which becomes more buoyant and rises 4 2 panama basin experiments the only difference between the symmetrical experiments and our panama basin setup is in the lateral restoring field these experiments implement restoring down one side to mimic the inflow through the ecuador trench as shown schematically in fig 3 our results show several differences in circulation and temperature distribution between experiments the hydrothermal flux regime seems to be more effective at evacuating heat from the abyssal ocean than the conductive regime as would be expected this difference becomes more pronounced as the value of αh increases and the heat flux becomes more dominated by its hydrothermal component the evolution of the average temperature in the abyssal ocean varies fairly linearly with αh as is shown in fig 5 due to the formulation of our fluxes as described in section 3 a lower temperature difference between the hydrothermal discharge and bottom waters necessitates a larger mass flux the choice of δt makes a big difference to the impacts of a hydrothermal heat flux where δ t 10 c the conductive and hydrothermal cases are almost indistinguishable in both heat distribution and circulation dynamics as δt decreases and the velocity of the discharge increases much larger differences are seen between the two cases the differences in the circulation and heat distribution are intrinsically linked so where larger differences in the average abyssal temperature are seen in fig 5 we also see larger differences in the circulation the comparisons we make throughout the rest of this section are between a purely conductive flux and a high velocity hydrothermal flux the two extreme cases among our sets of experiments the reality will lie somewhere between the two extremes but this comparison allows us to clearly investigate the different effects these two types of heat flux have on the abyssal ocean the effect of applying a lateral restoring on the southern flank of the domain is the creation of an asymmetric circulation on the north side of the basin where there is simply a wall the abyssal ocean is well mixed but on the south side a strong stratification with slanted isotherms is maintained as can be seen in fig 6 the area in which lateral restoring is applied does not appear in any of the figures as it is not intended to represent any part of the interior of the basin only to mimic the effects of flow through the ecuador trench looking at the distribution of temperature differences throughout the basin between the purely hydrothermal and the purely conductive cases fig 6 e we find that while the average temperature is lower in the former the temperature is higher at the southern side of the basin near the seabed this temperature difference of up to 0 3 c occurs just above the southern recharge zone plotting the streamlines of the two different flows helps us to understand how differences in circulation are linked to the different temperature distributions fig 7 the effect of the lateral boundary restoring is seen again with a strong circulation maintained throughout the southern half of the basin and comparatively little flow at the northern side the hydrothermal fluxes also produce a relatively strong horizontal flow from the area of discharge to the area of recharge along the very bottom level of the ocean domain the conductive case is in contrast exhibiting a weak horizontal flow in the other direction i e towards the centre of the basin as water from the sides replaces the warmer water which rises due to buoyancy looking more closely at the heat flux throughout the water column we can try to determine further effects of the two different processes of geothermal heating by calculating different components of the heat flux we can investigate more precisely how the geothermal fluxes alter heat exchanges through the ocean consider a slab of the domain comprised between the seabed and a depth z d and between 1 s y s and 8 n y n where there is no restoring the rate of change in the total heat content q for this slab is due to the contributions of several heat transport processes as illustrated in fig 8 the main contributions are from geothermal heating f geo lateral advection f lat vertical advection f adv and vertical diffusion f dif the eddy parameterisation fluxes of the model are included when calculating the advection and diffusion the residual is given the shorthand f res and includes all unaccounted for numerical contributions to q t such as spurious dispersion from the model s tvd advection scheme which is not included in the method of calculating advection below it also includes the effects of lateral diffusion which were not of great importance to our analysis we write the heat content relationship mathematically as 7 q t f geo f lat f adv f dif f res where 8a q μ 0 d y s y n t y z d y d z 8b f geo g 8c f lat μ 0 d v y s z t y s z d z 8d f adv μ y s y n w y h t y h d y 8e f dif μ y s y n κ y h t y h z d y in the expressions above μ ρ c p y n y s is the multiplication factor which ensures that these values are heat fluxes into the specified slab with units of wm 2 to remain consistent with our model s prescribed boundary condition additionally ρ is a reference density cp is heat capacity t is temperature g is average geothermal heat flux v and w are meridional and vertical velocity and κ is vertical diffusivity these calculations are performed at each level interface by changing the value of d we then have information about the average heat fluxes of each type in slabs of increasing thickness fig 9 compiles the information into depth profiles of the average heat fluxes from the seabed up to a given depth we ignore data from above 500 m depth as the surface restoring distorts the results we can see that the changes caused by altering the heat flux at the seabed are confined to the deep ocean and that above 1500 m depth there is almost no difference between the hydrothermal and conductive cases importantly the difference is also confined to the advective components of the heat flux while changes in the vertical diffusive heat flux are negligible not unexpectedly using a hydrothermal flux increases the strength of the advective components of the heat flux in the abyssal ocean the vertical and lateral advective fluxes act to almost balance each other irrespective of the value of αh with heat being evacuated from the abyss by the vertical advective flux and being replenished via lateral advection through the ecuador trench in the hydrothermal case the magnitude of the vertical advective flux in the abyssal ocean increases by up to 35 compared to the conductive case being 21 greater on average between 2500 m depth and the seabed the lateral advection increases by an even greater amount up to 45 with an average change in the abyssal ocean of 28 the strong vertical advection reaches a little further up the water column with a conductive source so that above about 2350 m the advective fluxes are actually smaller in the hydrothermal case 5 discussion from the experiments we have run it appears that introducing a portion of the geothermal heat flux hydrothermally makes an important contribution to circulation in the abyssal ocean our analytical solution was the first indicator of the importance of these flows before even considering the effects of heating the existence of a volume flux through the seabed which has not been implemented in large scale modelling before contributes to the abyssal circulation in the absence of other processes the flow induced by these volume fluxes permeates the entire bottom mixed layer and causes a vertical displacement of its top interface in our numerical model we see many differences between the circulations and the distribution and transportation of heat induced by hydrothermal and conductive heat fluxes with a hydrothermal flux as opposed to a conductive one the advective heat transport in the abyssal ocean is increased by up to 35 in the vertical and up to 45 laterally through the side of the basin due to our boundary conditions this represents an increased flow though the ecuador trench meanwhile there is no appreciable change in the basin averaged diffusive heat flux except at depths a few tens of metres above the seabed so in the purely hydrothermal simulation we see the same effect as a conductive flux plus the additional advection caused by a velocity boundary condition this was seen in our symmetrical model which showed the streamlines of the hydrothermally driven flow moving in towards the heat source just as those of the conductive flow do before turning back downwards to terminate in the seabed in the panama basin setup the increased vertical advection drives through continuity the increase in lateral advection through the side it has previously been proposed based on observational data that flow through the ecuador trench is partly driven by upwelling in the basin interior caused by geothermal heating lonsdale 1977 this theory agrees with the relationship we see between the vertical and lateral advective fluxes in our model when entering into this work we wanted to determine whether the use of hydrothermal as opposed to purely conductive fluxes in ocean models was a necessary addition to better represent the abyssal circulation and under which circumstances it would be relevant if so we have found that the impacts on circulation and heat distribution of a high velocity hydrothermal flux are significant at basin scales in the abyssal ocean but unlikely to make any noticeable difference in the upper ocean so the usefulness of including these fluxes in ocean models very much depends on what one is interested in investigating for future modelling of the abyssal circulation in the panama basin it will be worth including hydrothermal boundary conditions in addition to conductive heat fluxes since the panama basin has an average heat flux of 270 mw m 2 calculated from the formula of stein and stein 1992 together with the crustal age data of müller et al 1997 this is about 2 5 times the global average used in our model and so the differences between the two extreme model cases in the region could be even more significant than those we have seen in our results we previously noted that the abyssal temperature and circulation in our model results are sensitive to the choice of δt the difference in temperature between the hydrothermal flow and the bottom water the extreme case we focused on was δ t 0 01 c but with larger values the differences between the circulations caused are less pronounced while fluids from individual vents have been recorded at stable temperatures above 400 c koschinsky et al 2008 these are extremely small points when put in the context of a basin scale model since our lateral grid resolution is 1 8 we must use values which represent the average δt over a large area at this scale taking into account the spacially sparce and scattered nature of hydrothermal venting and the fact that much of it occurs at much lower temperatures a fraction of a degree celcius seems a reasonable value for the average δt in the ocean using a simple approach to this modelling was important in order to provide a clear first look at the processes but it does come with some limitations it is likely that areas of hydrothermal discharge and recharge are distributed in a far more disorderly manner than the symmetric boundary condition we implemented creating far more complex flow patterns than in our simulations as competing regions of upward and downward velocity interact the scales of realistic flows would likely be smaller in that case additionally the conductive portion of the heat flux will be present throughout the entire basin rather than only at the centre although the distribution of heat will be more heavily weighted towards the mid ocean ridges which is the justification for our idealised boundary condition 6 conclusion our idealised models have shown that the hydrothermal component of the global heat flux can affect the abyssal circulation in ways which a purely conductive heat flux cannot compared to the conductive case the advective heat flux in our experiments is increased by up to 45 in the abyssal ocean while the water below 2500 m is only slightly cooler on average the heat is distributed differently such that there are localised patches which see temperatures change by up to 0 3 c it remains to be seen however whether the effects seen in our results will be present to the same degree of significance in a more realistic model this is something we plan on investigating in further experiments with a full 3d regional model of the panama basin and using observational data from the area to help interpret the results there could be complications in taking this method forward to more realistic modelling experiments as creating realistic boundary conditions will not necessarily be a simple task at coarser resolutions the models of stein and stein 1992 will suffice but for more detailed regional models observational data would be preferable however there are not many observations concerning the distribution of hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor in particular how widespread or concentrated areas of discharge and recharge may be conducting a statistical study on the relative frequency of hydrothermal activity baker and german 2004 only had enough data to have a reasonable degree of confidence in their estimates for about 10 of the global ocean ridges nevertheless hydrothermal boundary conditions will be considered in our future modelling studies of the area for more general usage the importance of including the hydrothermal boundary condition will vary depending on the scales involved in the model and the focus of the modelling project for the upper ocean we see no discernible difference between using conductive or hydrothermal heat fluxes so it would not be a worthwhile addition for projects with their focus here deeper down we see important differences in the heat distribution but some of these occur only over small areas and may lose significance in lower resolution models in particular our configuration designed to emphasise changes in the abyss contains a much finer resolution in the abyssal ocean than standard ocean circulation models we would not expect to see such significant differences between the two types of heat flux when using standard vertical layers with resolutions often in the hundreds of metres in the abyss the average abyssal temperature difference is under 0 04 c but our high resolution brings out areas where the temperature changes by up to 0 3 c between the two cases as such we would recommend a high vertical resolution in this part of the ocean for any experiments involving geothermal heating at low resolutions the introduction of hydrothermal boundary conditions will be less worthwhile our findings have implications not only for the panama basin but for other partially enclosed basins containing hydrothermal sources examples of such basins can be found across the globe including the scotia sea cayman trough red sea sea of japan and the arctic ocean simple models of the type we have been using could be adapted to take on the features of these other ocean basins and produce representative values for the components of their heat fluxes quite possibly revealing higher advective transport in the same way as our results have for the panama basin it seems that the question of whether or not to include hydrothermal fluxes in models needs to be addressed on a case by case basis taking into account the above considerations for any work with a focus on the abyssal ocean at a reasonably high resolution it will certainly be a very useful addition to the modelling process acknowledgements this work is

24132,to explore the impacts of sea surface salinity sss on the interannual variability of upper ocean state we compare two 10 year runs of an eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ogcm in one sss is strongly restored toward a monthly climatology world ocean atlas 98 and in the other toward the sss of a monthly gridded argo product the inclusion of the argo sss generally improves the interannual variability of the mixed layer depth particularly so in the western tropical pacific where so called barrier layers are reproduced when the argo sss is included the upper ocean subsurface salinity variability is also improved in the tropics and subtropics even below the mixed layer to understand the reason for the latter improvement we separate the salinity difference between the two runs into its dynamical and spiciness components the dynamical component is dominated by small scale noise due to the chaotic nature of mesoscale eddies the spiciness difference indicates that as expected from the upper ocean general circulation sss variability in the mixed layer is subducted into the thermocline in subtropics this signal is generally advected downward equatorward and westward in the equator side of the subtropical gyre the sss signal subducted in the subtropical north pacific appears to enter the indian ocean through the indonesian throughflow although this signal is weak and probably insignificant in our model keywords sea surface salinity eddy resolving ogcm argo subduction 1 introduction 1 1 uncertainty in sss freshwater flux into the ocean mostly precipitation river discharge and sea ice melt is one of the least constrained parameters because the temporal or spatial scales of these phenomena are small boutin et al 2016 and hence accurate global measurements are difficult in numerical ocean models uncertainty in freshwater flux translates to that in sea surface salinity sss sea surface temperature sst has similar uncertainty due to that in heat flux but error in sst tends to be countered by anomalous heat flux of opposite sign e g bryan 1986 killworth et al 2000 whereas no such negative feedback exists for error in sss because sss has little impact upon freshwater input or evaporation e g bryan 1986 for this reason sea surface freshwater flux is often adjusted to avoid salinity drift in stand alone ocean general circulation models ogcms or in the oceanic components of coupled general circulation models either by directly modifying the flux itself or by restoring sss to some observed values e g johns et al 1997 gordon et al 2000 masumoto et al 2004 oke et al 2013 storto et al 2016 for global or basin scale simulations this adjustment has in turn suffered from the paucity of sss observation especially before the argo array gould et al 2004 the best one can do has usually been to use a climatological sss map based on in situ observations such as the world ocean atlas e g antonov et al 1998a locarnini et al 2013 as a result interannual sss variability is dampened or eliminated which potentially causes inconsistency with the sst field or error in subsurface salinity the potential impacts of this deficiency in climate prediction simulations are a concern one approach to improve the realism of the salinity field in ocean hindcast simulations reanalyses is to assimilate four dimensional salinity observations such as those from the argo array e g huang et al 2008 such ocean reanalyses are valuable resources for climate studies they however require large human and computer resources to produce and maintain e g stammer et al 2016 in addition many assimilation schemes break conservation properties or dynamical balances e g stammer et al 2016 rendering them less suitable for certain types of analysis than free model runs moreover long integrations of global eddy resolving ocean models are increasingly common and have been proved to be useful e g sasaki et al 2004 oke et al 2013 but data assimilation that conserves scalars and maintains dynamical balances is a challenge for eddy resolving ocean models that is obvious with respect to computer resources from the fact that most long term assimilation products are on coarse grids for these reasons free eddy resolving ogcms forced only from boundaries are useful tools for such models accurate sea surface conditions are necessary 1 2 potential impacts of sss sss impacts upon local surface density affecting the local mixed layer depth de boyer montégut et al 2004 liu et al 2009 the mixed layer depth change can in turn alter local sst it can also generate dynamical responses such as rossby and kelvin waves either through the density change itself or through its impact upon the vertical distribution of wind forcing these waves can propagate and affect ocean state elsewhere another potential impact of sss is on the t s relation watermass properties in the mixed layer both these processes can influence the circulation and watermass properties in thermohaline overturning circulations such as those associated with the north atlantic deep water antarctic bottom water and sea of okhotsk dense shelf water matsuda et al 2015 and references therein 1 2 1 subtropical cells the wind driven subduction stommel 1979 nurser and marshall 1991 marshall et al 1993 is another mechanism by which the mixed layer watermass properties impacts upon subsurface salinity in the subtropical gyres of the south indian north and south pacific and north and south atlantic where the ekman pumping is generally downward surface water is subducted into the pycnocline advected in the north or south equatorial current nec or sec of each ocean and typically upwelled to the surface in the equatorial region forming what is often called the subtropical cell mccreary and lu 1994 gu and philander 1997 johnson and mcphaden 1999 zhang et al 2003 schott et al 2004 pacific in the north and south pacific the subducted water flows to the western boundary while part of the subducted water reaches the equator in the south pacific before it arrives at the western boundary lu and mccreary 1995 and references therein at the western boundary the flow bifurcates equatorward and poleward both branches form a western boundary current the equatorward branch joining the equatorial undercurrent euc and the poleward branch joining to the subtropical gyre lu and mccreary 1995 and references therein see also the review paper by schott et al 2004 the equatorial upwelling of the upper part of the euc is a major sink of the subducted water mccreary and lu 1994 schott et al 2004 part of the equatorward western boundary current in north pacific the mindanao current enters the indian ocean via the indonesian throughflow e g gordon 1986 mccreary et al 2007 sprintall et al 2014 atlantic in the atlantic the subducted water flows in the nec or sec in the southern hemisphere much as in the pacific the sec bifurcates poleward and equatorward at the western boundary and its equatorward branch the north brazilian coastal current feeds into the atlantic euc metcalf and stalcup 1967 schott et al 1998 2004 in the north atlantic most of the subducted water returns poleward along the western boundary because of the presence of the atlantic deep meridional overturning circulation known as the atlantic moc or amoc schott et al 2004 indian subtropical subduction is non existent or weak in the north indian ocean whereas it occurs in the south indian much in the same way as in the pacific schott et al 2004 permanent equatorial upwelling or euc does not exist in the indian ocean however and the subducted water crosses the equator in the western boundary current and upwells in the northern hemisphere mainly at the coast of somalia and in an interior thermocline ridge in the northern hemisphere schott et al 2004 2009 1 2 2 subtropical water masses various subtropical water masses have been found to be advected in the subtropical gyres of the north and south pacific north and south atlantic and south indian oceans a subtropical mode water is a thick low pv water mass found in the pycnocline of the subtropics it is formed at a deep mixed layer subducted into the pycnoline and advected by the flow associated with the subtropical gyre there are numerous papers studying mode waters see talley 1999 or hanawa and talley 2001 for an overview and references therein for details the variability of the subtropical mode water has also been extensively studied see below more recently another type of water mass generally called subtropical underwater or tropical water has attracted some attention it is lighter and hence is formed more equatorward than subtropical mode waters it does not form a particularly thick low pv layer is associated with a salinity maximum and is also subducted to the upper pycnocline and advected in the subtropical cell o connor et al 2005 the north pacific tropical water nptw e g qu et al 1999 katsura et al 2013 and south pacific tropical water e g tsuchiya and talley 1996 o connor et al 2002 qu and gao 2017 both exist on the 24 0 25 0 σθ isopycnal surfaces the nptw is found to enter the indonesian seas fine et al 1994 and then the indian ocean ffield and gordon 1992 along the indonesian throughflow pathway described above ffield and gordon 1992 point out the watermass characteristics are diluted by mixing during the water s passage through the indonesian seas in the tropical and subtropical atlantic where surface density is generally higher than in the pacific the corresponding high salinity waters the north and south atlantic underwaters are identified on the 25 0 26 0 σθ isopycnal surfaces e g zhang et al 2003 qu et al 2016 in the south indian ocean the sss maximum exists further poleward than in the other oceans and the underwater is formed on 25 5 σθ isopycnals o connor et al 2005 1 2 3 variability carried by the subtropical cells two mechanisms are possible to generate variability in subducted salinity in one interannual sss variability directly translates to the local subsurface salinity variability via subduction in the other interannual variability in heat flux changes the location of the outcrop of an isopycnal surface altering the sss that the isopycnal surface is exposed to and leading to salinity variability on the isopycnal nonaka and sasaki 2007 there have been extensive discussion on the generation of salinity anomalies in the pycnocline see for example bindoff and mcdougall 1994 johnson 2006 yeager and large 2007 laurian et al 2009 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2013 and kolodziejczyk et al 2015 there are also studies on the variability of sss maxima which is the source water of the tropical water or underwater see for example o connor et al 2002 and qu et al 2011 once salinity signal is brought to subsurface it is advected in the pycnocline leading to the interannual variability of subsurface salinity nonaka and sasaki 2007 sasaki et al 2010 katsura et al 2013 and potentially impacting on remote in time and space ocean state gu and philander 1997 schneider et al 1999a 1999b lazar et al 2001 schneider 2004 isopycnal and diapycnal diffusion spreads and weakens this signal sato and suga 2009 sasaki et al 2010 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 the next subsection reviews past studies that examined salinity variability in the pycnocline 1 3 past studies of subsurface salinity variability there are numerous studies on salinity related variability in the bottom deep and intermediate thermohaline overturning here we review results most relevant to our present study those on the interannual variability of salinity in the topical subtropical pycnocline since the subtropical cells carries waters from subtropical mixed layers to their tropical upwelling regions see above variabilities in the sea surface fluxes of heat freshwater and momentum winds in the subduction regions cause salinity and temperature variabilities in the main pycnocline at interannual to decadal timescales gu and philander 1997 schneider et al 1999a 1999b lazar et al 2001 schneider 2004 it has been argued that such variabilities upwell into the mixed layer again in the tropical upwelling regions of the subtropical cells impacting upon climate through surface heat flux gu and philander 1997 schneider et al 1999a 1999b lazar et al 2001 2002 schneider 2004 the t s variability can be classified into two forms one is the vertical displacement of the pycnocline and the other is the density compensating change in temperature and salinity dynamical and spiciness variabilities respectively bindoff and mcdougall 1994 schneider et al 1999b schneider 2000 yeager and large 2004 analyzed a 40 year 1958 1997 non eddy resolving ocean hindcast identified the generation of spiciness anomalies in the subduction regions of all ocean basins and also found westward and equatorward advection of spiciness anomaly by the subtropical cells at interannual to decadal timescales in the north and south pacific nonaka and sasaki 2007 analyzed the same eddy resolving ogcm as we use section 2 and found a propagation of interannaul salinity variability in the south pacific on the 25 3 σθ surface by the sec similarly sasaki et al 2010 analyzed a gridded argo product in the north pacific and identified the propagation of interannual variability of salinity by the nec see above on the 25 25 5 σθ surfaces one of the mode waters in the north pacific kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 and li et al 2012 extended this line of work to describe and explain the propagation of interannual spiciness anomalies in gridded argo datasets on the 25 5 σθ surface kolodziejczyk and gaillard or between the 25 and 25 5 σθ surfaces li et al both in the north and south pacific they also found that the spiciness anomalies reach the equator kolodziejczyk et al 2014 found similar processes in the south atlantic many of these studies noted the weakening of the signals as they propagate away from the subduction region probably because of some vertical or isopycnal mixing katsura et al 2013 on the other hand tracked the interannual variability of salinity on shallower density surfaces 24 σθ north pacific tropical water in a gridded argo dataset and again found a westward propagation of salinity variability by the nec at interannual timescales likewise zhang and qu 2014 analyzed a gridded hydrographic dataset to explore the interannual variability of the south pacific tropical water spiciness anomalies generated at the surface are subducted and advected westward in the south equatorial current they also suggested that shifts in the velocity field sometimes alter generate spiciness anomalies as the water flows westward qu et al 2016 estimated the production rate of the north atlantic subtropical underwater from a gridded argo dataset and quantified its interannual variability but they did not detect the westward propagation of the interannual variability even though there have been studies on the mean flow of the south pacific subtropical underwater e g zhang et al 2003 there do not seem to our knowledge to be studies on its interannual variability in the south indian ocean li and wang 2015 showed the westward advection of interannual spiciness anomaly by the sec on the 24 0 25 0 σθ surfaces although this water is lighter than the south indian underwater and does not correspond to the sss maximum its pattern of propagation is similar to those of the pacific tropical waters and atlantic subtropical underwaters the mean flow of the south indian subtropical underwater is described by o connor et al 2005 but its variability has not been studied to our knowledge all these works are concerned about the temporal variability of subsurface salinity anomaly from a mean state in a single timeseries i e temporal salinity anomaly on a particular isopycnal surface or in a particular regional water mass as such one limitation is that it is not always straightforward to separate the contribution of sss to the subsurface salinity variability such problems can be addressed if there are two parallel model runs one of which is the control run and the other an anomaly run williams et al 2006 used an atmosphere ocean coupled model and compared two runs in one of which the sea surface fresh water flux is shut off to elucidate the role of salinity in the mean subtropical cells in the pacific köhl et al 2014 used their non eddy resolving ocean data assimilation system to explore the impacts of the sss observation from the smos satellite as an additional data to be assimilated over 2010 2011 by comparing two runs of an eddy permitting model furue et al 2015 looked at the propagation of temperature salinity anomaly generated by a sudden change in vertical diffusivity they tracked among other things the propagation of salinity anomalies originating from the pycnocline in the subtropical north pacific to the indian ocean through the indonesian seas see above 1 4 present study the purpose of the present paper is to describe the impacts of interannual sss variability on ocean state the argo system gould et al 2004 has made available sss data that includes interannual variability and is of higher spatial and temporal resolution than traditional hydrographic maps we utilize this data as follows we use an existing semi global eddy resolving ogcm after it was spun up it has been integrated from 1950 to the end of 2014 under surface forcings based on a re analysis product except that its sss is strongly restored toward a monthly climatology to avoid salinity drift from 2005 we replace the reference salinity with the sss from an argo product and integrate the model up to the end of 2014 by comparing these two parallel runs over 2005 2014 we examine how the observed sss improves subsurface salinity and explore how the sss signals are propagated we will not address the interaction of salinity with sea ice because neither our model or the argo array covers high latitude regions where sea ice is crucial our approach is unique in that we track differences between the two model runs instead of temporary anomalies in a single timeseries see above thereby isolating the impacts of sss variability our results will help estimate the uncertainty of the model state due to error in sss it will also help understand the nature of the uncertainty this information will be useful to assess errors due to surface flux adjustments in future climate simulations and deficiencies in free non data assimilated ogcm simulations with climatological sss restoration e g sasaki et al 2004 oke et al 2013 they will also contribute to assessing the impacts of the sss observations from the more recent aquarius le vine et al 2015 and smos reul et al 2014 satellites when they are assimilated into climate models this paper is organized as follows the next section discusses the methodology it first describes our ogcm and experimental design explains how we construct the reference sss from argo briefly describes the argo sss interannual variability and then presents our methods of data analysis section 2 first explores how observed sss improves the interannual variability of the mixed layer depth and subsurface salinity field and to understand the improvements it then examines differences between the two model runs finally section 4 provides a summary of the results and discusses their implications 2 methods 2 1 description of the numerical model the numerical oceanic general circulation model ogcm we use is that of masumoto et al 2004 and sasaki et al 2006 2008 here we first describe the ogcm and its basic configuration we then discuss the forcings and our experimental design 2 1 1 configuration parameterizations and numerics our ogcm is called ofes for ogcm for the earth simulartor which is a variant of mom3 pacanowski and griffies 2000 modified to run efficiently on the earth simulator https www jamstec go jp es en a vector parallel supercomputer at the japan agency for marine earth science and technology jamstec the computational domain extends from 75 s to 75 n with a horizontal grid spacing of 1 10 there are 54 levels in the vertical with the grid spacing increasing from 5 m at the sea surface to 330 m at the maximum depth of 6065 m the upper ocean is fairly well resolved with 20 levels in the top 200 m the horizontal mixing is parameterized with the two dimensional biharmonic operator its coefficient consisting of a background constant value 27 109 m4 s 1 or 9 109 m4 s 1 for momentum or scalar and a term that varies like the cube of the zonal grid spacing smith et al 2000 the vertical mixing is parameterized with the kpp scheme large et al 1994 with background viscosity and diffusivity due to the unresolved internal wave breaking of 10 4 m2 s 1 and 0 respectively the advection of scalars is discretized with a second order centered difference scheme pacanowski and griffies 2000 2 1 2 forcings spin up and experimental design throughout all model runs the model temperature and salinity are restored at all depths within 3 of the artificial boundaries at 75 s and 75 n toward the monthly climatology of the world ocean atlas 1998 woa98 antonov et al 1998a 1998b 1998c boyer et al 1998a 1998b 1998c the strength of the restoration linearly decreases from 1 1 day to 0 within the width 3 of this sponge layer the model was first spun up for 50 years from a state of rest with the annual mean temperature and salinity fields from woa98 under monthly climatological windstress and precipitation from the ncep ncar reanalysis over 1950 1999 kalnay et al 1996 and under heat flux and evaporation calculated with the bulk formulae of rosati and miyakoda 1988 using the monthly climatological variables from the ncep ncar reanalysis in addition to avoid salinity drift the sea surface salinity sss is restored toward the monthly climatology of woa98 at a timescale of six days over the topmost model layer of 5 m thickness for a 50 m thick mixed layer for instance the effective timescale is 60 days the ncep run described in detail by sasaki et al 2008 starts from this spun up state and is integrated from 1950 to 2014 under daily mean forcings derived from the ncep ncar reanalysis in the same manner as for the spin up run the sss is still restored toward the monthly climatology of woa98 although in the present paper it would be clearer to term this run woa98 sss run to contrast it to the run described next we choose the name ncep run because we have been using the latter in other papers such as sasaki et al 2006 2008 the argo sss run branches out from the ncep run at the beginning of year 2005 its only difference from the ncep run is that the reference sss for restoration is based on the argo observation the next section describes this sss field 2 2 the argo sss 2 2 1 construction of the sss data we use the 1 1 grid interpolated monthly salinity dataset based on argo developed at the asia pacific data research center apdrc and the international pacific research center iprc at the university of hawai i http apdrc soest hawaii edu projects argo the data is defined for the upper 2000 m at depth levels of 0 5 10 20 30 50 75 100 125 150 200 250 and 300 m after that the grid interval is constant at 100 m up to 1500 m depth and is then increased to 250 m for the rest of the depth range as for the horizontal interpolation of argo profiles onto the gridpoints see lebedev 2016 who uses the same variational method as for the apdrc iprc product this method does not include a single prescribed horizontal smoothing scale but an estimation indicates a scale of roughly 2 n a maximenko and k v lebedev 2017 personal communication this dataset is defined from 63 s to 65 n and starts from 2005 when the argo float coverage became reasonably good first we construct a monthly climatological sss field over 2005 2013 note that we did not extend the period to 2014 simply because we had started our model runs before the 2014 product came out we then compute monthly anomaly from this climatology for 2005 2014 where the gridded data is not defined because of the scarcity or lack of argo observation as in marginal seas and coastal areas and outside the latitude band of definition white areas in fig 1 b the sss anomaly is initially defined to be zero to avoid jumps across the edges of these regions we next diffuse argo values into these regions by applying 10 times a two dimensional moving average with the cressman 1959 weight function with a radius of 500 km over these regions this moving average is designed not to mix values across landmasses finally this argo based sss interannual anomaly is added to the sss monthly climatology of woa98 to be the reference monthly sss for the argo sss run the raw argo sss field is not used to avoid mean salinity biases between the argo sss and ncep runs the latter using the woa98 monthly climatological sss the two runs thus differ just by the additional sss interannual anomaly in the reference sss for restoration 2 2 2 description of the sss data fig 1 shows the sss interannual anomaly during january 2005 as an example and its standard deviation over the data period 2005 2014 the jan 2005 anomaly field fig 1a is patchy except for the large scale features in the western equatorial tropical pacific and tropical subtropical central pacific the blue patches in fig 1a the other months are similar in this respect not shown even those patchy looking anomalies however seem to be part of large scale patterns as the standard deviation field fig 1b suggests generally the interannual variability is large in low latitudes suggesting that it is dominated by variability in freshwater input the bay of bengal 90 e 20 n for instance is known for large precipitation as well as large river runoff e g shetye et al 1996 in addition the variability in the pacific equatorial region seems to be dominated by enso the sss in the western equatorial pacific where its variability is maximum fig 1b appears to be dominated by 2 4 yr variability not shown it is indeed anti correlated with the sst from the same monthly gridded product apdrc iprc argo product with correlation coefficients of 0 60 and 0 84 for the raw interannual variability and for the interannual variability smoothed with a 13 month moving average respectively over the region 140 170 e 3 s 3 n whereas interannual temperature variability in this region is mainly due to enso discussed later this is consistent with delcroix and hénin 1991 and delcroix et al 2011 for example who argued that the interannual variability of observed sss in the western tropical pacific can be explained as resulting from the known precipitation variability associated with enso where higher lower sst leads to higher lower precipitation and hence to lower higher sss another type of variability is associated with the variability in the position or intensity of the strong oceanic fronts in fig 1b variabilities near the gulf stream brazil current oyashio in northwest pacific and the northern edge of the antarctic circumpolar current in the indian sector are conspicuous 2 3 methods of analysis processing of the data to analyze the ogcm output we smooth the ogcm variables by mapping them onto a 3 3 grid by a simple bin average and by computing their monthly averages when mixed layer depths are compared or when otherwise necessary see below the monthly argo data is vertically interpolated onto the ogcm gridpoints and bin averaged onto the same 3 3 grid so that the coarse gridded ogcm data and the argo observation share the same four dimensional grid when we compute correlations between the ogcm and argo observation at interannual timescales in section 3 1 we first lowpass filter the above data both argo or coarse gridded ogcm using a 13 month boxcar moving average with a half width of 6 points this temporal smoothing together with the spatial smoothing described above will increase the signal to noise ratio by weakening mesoscale variability which is more or less random and tends to obscure slow large scale signals section 3 a monthly climatology is then computed over 2005 2014 and subtracted from the lowpass filtered data to obtain the interannual anomalies we compared correlations over detrended and non detrended timeseries and found that the detrended correlation is higher in some regions and lower in others not shown although statistically non significant a positive correlation between trends captures the fact that the model has a similar trend with the observation because our conclusions are not much affected by the statistical significance of correlation coefficients and because the detrended correlation fields do not differ qualitatively not shown we decided to show non detrended correlation coefficients below in section 3 1 differences between model runs we also calculate differences of the argo sss run from the ncep run which we generally denote by δ as in δ s t x y z s argo run t x y z s ncep run t x y z and for which we also use the coarse gridded monthly mean fields described above note that monthly mean fields still include significant mesoscale variability and as is seen below this pointwise difference includes mesoscale noise because mesoscale eddies and jets shift their positions owing to their chaotic nature as in schneider et al 1999a doney et al 2003 yeager and large 2004 taguchi and schneider 2014 and furue et al 2015 it is useful to separate the salinity and temperature differences into their dynamical or heave and spiciness components see appendix for details the dynamical component being the local temperature or salinity change due to the vertical displacement of isopycnals and the spiciness component the density compensating temperature and salinity change on individual isopycnals the dynamical anomaly can be generated by any difference in density between the two runs and is propagated by rossby and kelvin waves while the spiciness anomaly is approximately governed by 1 δ s t u o δ s δ u s o isopycnal and diapycnal diffusion where the subscript o denotes a reference state which in our case is the ncep run see the discussion of eq a 1 without velocity anomaly the spiciness anomaly behaves like a passive tracer advected on isopycnals by the background flow u o 3 results in this section we first briefly discuss the mean state of our control run ncep run comparing it with the argo observation next we examine the impacts of the observed sss focusing on how it improves interannual variability in the upper ocean finally to understand the reasons for the improvements we explore how differences between the two model runs are propagated 3 1 comparison with observations 3 1 1 climatological states general comparisons of the spin up run and the ncep run with observations are found in masumoto et al 2004 and sasaki et al 2008 respectively here we compare features that are most relevant to the present study of the upper ocean climatological state in the ncep run with observations fig 2 compares the salinity fields from the ncep run with that from the gridded argo dataset along a representative meridional section of salinity in the pacific this section is located to the west of the outcrops of the 24 5 σθ surface which we study in great detail below sea surface salinity is particularly high in the 30 10 s and 15 30 n bands not shown because of high evaporation and this high salinity water is subducted to the pycnocline and advected westward in the sec and nec section 1 2 forming the subsurface tongues of high salinity both in the southern and northern hemispheres wyrtki and kilonsky 1984 fig 2 as they flow westward both these waters also extend equatorward in the south pacific some of this water directly reaches the equator whereas most of it flows to the western boundary in the north pacific section 1 2 this is the reason that the high salinity tongue stops at about 10 n in the northern hemisphere fig 2 the salinity value for the southern tongue is also much higher because the sss is higher in the southern hemisphere not shown the 24 5 σθ surface lies near the center of these high salinity tongues fig 2 note that the cores of the high salinity waters lie below the deepest mixed layer during the year fig 2 thick red lines suggesting that their salinities should be largely conserved and advected by the ambient flow or diffused along isopycnals by mesoscale eddies not only this pattern of salinity distribution is similar between the model and the observation but also the salinity values are similar the most conspicuous difference is that the salinity and density fields are much smoother in the gridded argo dataset this difference is likely due to the horizontal smoothing that went into the gridding of argo observations to produce the argo product http apdrc soest hawaii edu projects argo the global mean horizontal smoothing scale is estimated to be 2 but it varies from region to region depending on the number of profiles around the gridpoint see section 2 2 1 the model field better preserves small scale meridional structures associated with the euc and the tsuchiya jets such as the downward and upward bulges of the isopycnals below and above the euc and the weak local salinity maximum below 160 m at the equator below the core of the euc both of which have been seen in high resolution meridional sections johnson et al 2002 although they seem to be exaggerated in our model we briefly compared these salinity and density sections with those from the roemmich gilson gridded argo dataset roemmich and gilson 2009 and found that the above equatorial features are somewhat more visible in there not shown than in the argo product we use in this study another difference is that the mixed layer is somewhat deeper in the model between 30 and 15 s probably because sst is lower up to 1 c in this region during the austral winter and spring not shown in the argo sss run sss is of course closer to the gridded argo data but the sea surface density is still much larger and the mixed layer is deeper than in the argo data not shown the similarity and difference between the observation and model are also similar in the south indian and north and south atlantic oceans to those in the pacific 3 1 2 temperature correlations fig 3 shows temperature anomaly correlations at z 0 and z 150 m between the argo sss run and the gridded argo data those for the ncep run not shown are very similar to fig 3 that is there is little improvement in model temperature interannual variability due to the argo sss forcing the sea surface temperature sst correlation is generally high and most of the regions with lower correlation values are located where mesoscale eddies are strong in our ogcm masumoto et al s 2004 fig 3 sasaki et al s 2008 fig 10 3 such as in western boundary currents and their extensions near the northern edge of the antarctic circumpolar current and near the eastern equatorial pacific and atlantic because of tropical instability waves this disagreement is likely a manifestation of chaos due to mesoscale variability or to strong nonlinear currents in these regions even if statistical properties of modeled eddies are realistic it is unlikely that the phases of eddies agree with the reality moreover the positions and intensities of the strong frontal currents are fairly chaotic see taguchi et al 2007 and nonaka et al 2016 for the chaotic nature of the kuroshio extension for example this chaotic variance obscures interannual signal in our relatively short integration 10 yrs low correlations are however found also in regions where eddy activity is low all these low correlation regions exist also in the correlation between ncep run and the argo observation not shown this deficiency must be due to inaccuracy in forcings model dynamics or parameterizations in the model for example the correlation is very low along the west coast of africa south of the equator whereas eddy activity is low there not shown it is possible that inaccuracy in the wind field that forces our model leads to the inaccuracy in the sst interannual variability in this coastal upwelling region small et al 2015 the correlation is also low west of india northwest of indonesia and in a band extending northeastward from the caribbean sea but again eddy activity is not particularly high in these regions not shown the low correlation region west of hawaii is also much broader in the meridional direction than the eddy train associated with the hawaiian lee countercurrent e g sasaki and nonaka 2006 at z 150 m fig 3b correlation is lower in much broader areas because the ocean state is less constrained by surface fluxes than at the sea surface except in regions where the mixed layer reaches this depth interannual temperature variability is mainly governed by wind forcing and model dynamics for example the high correlation in the western tropical pacific is due mainly to enso e g wang and picaut 2004 within the gridded argo dataset the djf mean temperature at z 150 m averaged over 160 e 180 5 s 5 n is anti correlated with the niño 3 4 sst e g trenberth 1997 with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 conversely the lower correlation is a result mainly of various errors in the model and forcings 3 1 3 salinity correlations fig 4 a shows the sss anomaly correlation between the ncep run and the gridded argo data which is of course much worse than the sst correlation fig 3a because the model sss is restored to climatology the subsurface correlation fig 4b is also worse than the corresponding temperature correlation not shown it is interesting that interannual correlation still exists even under the strong restoration to climatological sss in particular sss correlation is high in the western tropical pacific and in the zonal band south of the equator in the indian ocean fig 4a such correlation must ultimately come from interannual variability in external forcing such as precipitation and winds if strong enough variability in precipitation will give variability to local sss against the sss restoration likewise variability in winds can lead to sss variability for example winds can change the pycnocline depth through wave propagation which in turn would affect sss where the pycnocline is shallow the above correlation in the tropical pacific and indian is likely due the interannual variability in the precipitation data that forces our model in these regions both the mean precipitation and the interannual variability of precipitation are particularly high not shown suggesting that precipitation is more influential to sss variability in these regions than in others in the western tropical pacific the interannual variability in sss is indeed known to be dominated by enso related variability in precipitation e g delcroix et al 2011 the inclusion of the argo sss of course much improves the sss correlation fig 4c it is interesting however that like the sst field fig 3a the sss correlation is still low in eddy rich regions such as along the aleutian arc in the kuroshio extension and gulfstream off the east coast of india off the arabian pensinsula in the agulhas leakage extending northwestward from the southern tip of africa and along the equatorward edge of the antarctic circumpolar current acc see masumoto et al 2004 sasaki et al 2008 despite the restoration toward the argo sss the inclusion of the argo sss also improves subsurface salinity fig 4d to see where the improvements are we plot difference in the correlation coefficients at z 150 m fig 5 the correlation of the argo sss run is higher to the south of the kuroshio extension and gulf stream in the far northern north atlantic in the subtropical south atlantic in the regions north of new zealand and northeast of australia and in a band along the northern edge of the antarctic circumpolar current acc extending westward from the southern tip of south america to the central indian ocean these regions coincide with those where the winter mixed layer penetrates deeper than 150 m fig 9 all of them except for the one northeast of australia seem to correspond to the formation regions of subtropical subpolar or subantarctic mode waters talley 1999 the improvements therefore are likely due to the improved salinity values of the mode waters in contrast the deepest winter mixed layer is shallower than 150 m and still the salinity correlation is improved in zonally elongated bands in the subtropics namely those in the low latitude north atlantic 20 n in north pacific extending westward from hawaii toward the philippines in south pacific from chile between 40 s and 20 s and in south indian from the west coast of australia toward madagascar as shown in section 3 2 these improvements are most likely due to the subsurface spreading of subducted waters which are formed in winter mixed layers and spread equatorward westward and downward on isopycnals these waters do not correspond to mode waters talley 1999 the patches in the low latitude north atlantic are consistent with the sinking and spreading of the north atlantic underwater 25 5 σθ e g qu et al 2016 see also section 1 2 the band in the north pacific the spreading of the north pacific tropical water 24 0 24 5 σθ e g katsura et al 2013 see also section 1 2 and the one in the south indian the water discussed by li and wang 2015 24 0 25 0 σθ in the two regions west of south america between 40 and 20 s where the subsurface correlation is improved fig 5 the maximum mixed layer is largely shallower than 150 m although it reaches 150 m at some spots fig 9 this region corresponds to the formation region of the light mode water in the south pacific 25 5 σθ south pacific eastern subtropical mode water talley 1999 hanawa and talley 2001 we trace the spreading of each signal in section 3 2 in subpolar regions except near iceland where the north atlantic subpolar mode water forms talley 1999 the subsurface correlation is weak fig 4b and d and improves very little fig 5 the subpolar region is characterized by upward ekman pumping see wyrtki 1961 for ekman upwelling in the southern ocean and therefore sss cannot influence subsurface salinity locally through advection see section 4 2 2 for further discussion along the equator within 5 in the indian and pacific there are patches of high correlation at z 150 m even without the internannual anomaly in the argo sss fig 4b and it improves little by the restoration toward the argo sss fig 5 this feature suggests that the variabilities in wind forcing or heat flux partly controls subsurface salinity variability through dynamics waves etc in these regions to further examine the sub mixed layer correlation improvements we examine interannual salinity anomaly on the 24 5 σθ isopycnal surface that is the spiciness anomaly which picks up the low latitude signals in the north and south pacific and south indian mentioned above compared with the gridded argo product fig 6 a the ncep run fig 6b misses all the most prominent tongues of high variability which are emanating from outcrops in the north and south pacific and south indian in the argo sss run fig 6c the variability becomes closer to the argo observation in all the three tongues although the variability is still weaker in the north pacific and south indian tongues similarly the variability is increased in the atlantic in the argo sss run although it becomes larger than the observation this increase in variability from the ncep run to argo sss run together with the spatial patterns of these tongues is consistent with the idea that the interannual signals imparted by sss are subducted at the outcrops of the isopycnal and advected in the respective subtropical cells section 1 2 fig 7 a and b show the correlations of spiciness anomaly on this isopycnal between the model runs and the gridded argo product the increase in the correlation from the ncep run to the argo sss run fig 7c is consistent with the advection of the subducted signal it is interesting that the correlation is already relatively high in the ncep run along 10 s fig 7a and increases only modestly in the argo sss run fig 7c suggesting that part of the interannual salinity anomaly is generated by other forcings than sss perhaps by a similar mechanism to the one discussed by nonaka and sasaki 2007 see also section 1 2 3 1 4 mixed layer depth correlations interannual variability in sss can affect not only the water mass properties but also dynamics through changes in density and mixed layer depth mld fig 8 shows the correlation coefficients of mld anomaly between the model runs and the gridded argo data and the difference in the correlation coefficients the correlation is generally higher in both model runs than the sss correlation in the ncep run fig 4a suggesting that sst is generally more influential on mld recall that the sst correlation does not change much between the two model runs as in the discussion of fig 3a the difference field fig 8c is mostly positive i e argo sss run improving it is more patchy than the difference in salinity correlations for example fig 5 perhaps because local vertically one dimensional processes are more influential to determine the mld field than the salinity field for which horizontal isopycnal advection plays a larger role improvements are found in the northern north atlantic low latitude subtropical north pacific and north atlantic western equatorial pacific low latitude subtropical south indian and the northern part of the bay of bengal barely seen in the plot and along the northern edge of the acc in the indian sector the improvements in mld in the northern north atlantic and in the acc may be understood as a direct consequence of the improved sss correlation fig 4a and c suggesting that the influence of salinity on sea surface density is larger in these regions than in others see also section 3 2 1 in the southern side of the western equatorial pacific mld averaged over 5 s eq 160 e 160 w is about 40 m and the difference argo sss run minus ncep run varies between about 15 m and 10 m not shown even though the difference is small the mld correlation with observation is much improved in the western equatorial pacific fig 8c suggesting that the influence of salinity on mld is large in this region because of large precipitation lukas and lindstrom 1991 as a clear example on january 2010 when the difference in mld between the two runs is largest at about 15 m both salinity and temperature are vertically uniform in the mixed layer in the ncep run whereas in the argo sss run low near surface salinity as much as 0 3 psu lower than in the ncep run creates a shallow mixed layer with a halocline at its bottom within a thicker isothermal layer e g lindstrom et al 1987 lukas and lindstrom 1991 maes et al 2005 forming a barrier layer the layer between the bottoms of the mixed layer and isothermal layer sprintall and tomczak 1992 liu et al 2009 it is interesting that sss correlation is already high in this region in the ncep run and the inclusion of argo sss does not improve the correlation compare fig 4a with fig 4c the difference map is not shown why then is the mld better represented in the argo sss run we have visually inspected the timeseries of sss in this particular region and found that although the sss correlation with argo observation is high in both runs the amplitude of interannual variability is much closer to that of the argo observation in the argo sss run the bay of bengal is known to receive a large amount of fresh water in the form of precipitation and river runoff e g shetye et al 1996 and as a result is one of the areas having largest interannual sss anomaly fig 1 it is known that p e and river runoff in this region significantly impact upon the mld han et al 2001 rao and sivakumar 2003 li et al 2017 the interannual variability of the mld is accordingly somewhat improved by the inclusion of the argo sss fig 8c see sss correlations in fig 4a note that sst hardly differs between the runs not shown it is noteworthy that the climatological annual cycle of sss is very different between woa98 and the apdrc iprc argo product in the bay of bengal not shown as a result the model climatological sss which is restored toward woa98 section 2 and hence is close to it is also very different from argo observation for example the climatological sss 2005 2014 averaged over 83 95 e 16 22 n is minimum in october and january at 31 6 psu in the gridded argo dataset whereas it is minimum in october at 27 0 and 26 9 psu in the ncep and argo sss runs respectively the cause of this large difference between woa98 and the apdrc iprc argo product is not clear 3 2 difference between the two runs to understand how the interannual sss signal affects the ocean state we next compare the ncep and argo sss runs we first examine how the mixed layer depth section 3 2 1 differs between the two model runs followed by differences in temperature and salinity section 3 2 2 to understand the latter we separate the difference fields into their dynamical and spiciness components and explore how the spiciness difference is propagated into the subtropical and tropical pycnocline section 3 2 3 3 2 1 mixed layer depth because of the sss interannual variability that of mld is also generally larger in argo sss run than in ncep run not shown fig 9 shows the maximum mld during year 2008 in the ncep run and the difference in the maximum mld between the argo sss and ncep runs the difference field is significantly different from year to year not shown but generally the amplitude is largest in the acc and in the northern north atlantic for the figure this particular year is chosen simply because both anomalies are clearly visible generally the deeper the mixed layer is the larger the difference is the regions of large difference in the acc and in the northern north atlantic roughly coincide with those of improved correlation fig 8c except to the west of the southern tip of south america suggesting that the improvements occur because sss is influential to mixed layer density in these high latitude regions where stratification due to temperature is weaker than in mid and low latitudes interestingly the difference field is dominated by small scale features in eddy rich regions indicating the influence of mesoscale eddies on local mld 3 2 2 temperature and salinity fig 10 plots temperature and salinity differences at z 150 m and z 400 m averaged over year 2014 the difference fields are hardly systematic with small scale patches and streaks of both signs this is a natural consequence of the chaotic nature of mesoscale eddies even when the statistical properties of eddies hardly change their phases can appreciably change leading to the point wise difference shown in the figure likewise the small scale streaks in the difference field can be a slight shift in eddy driven striations furue et al 2015 impacts of the argo sss penetrate deeper than the depths where correlations with the observation are significant far deeper than can be affected by pure advection indicating that these changes are due to changes in pressure and in velocity through geostrophy to extract more systematic signals we separate the difference fields into their dynamical and spiciness components section 2 3 fig 11 shows the two components of the salinity difference between the argo sss and ncep runs on the 24 5 σθ surface averaged over the first and second years of integration years 2005 and 2006 this isopycnal is chosen mostly because interannual variability happens to be clearest on it this surface happens to be near the center of the pacific salinity maximum layers fig 2 section 3 1 and corresponds to the pacific tropical waters section 1 2 but the significance of this correspondence is not clear the light gray regions indicate where the isopycnal surface does not exist in any month during the year while the thick black lines indicate maximum outcropping such that on the equator side of them the isopycnal stays subsurface throughout the year poleward of the maximum outcrop lines therefore the isopycnal is exposed to the sea surface some time during the year and hence gets salinity variability directly from the argo sss data in contrast equatorward of the maximum outcrop lines the variability must be propagated by waves or advection this isopycnal deepens toward the equator to 120 160 m in the central pacific fig 2 the dynamical signal upper panels is much weaker than the spiciness one lower panels note the difference in contour intervals and the spatial structure of the dynamical signal is noisy visually similar to the salinity and temperature differences in fig 10 it is dominated by small scale features of both signs a reflection of the mesoscale point wise difference discussed above in principle the dynamical component should also include rossby and kelvin waves forced by density changes due to the sss anomaly furue et al 2015 density changes alter pressure and they also alter the mixed layer depth which in turn alters the vertical distribution of wind forcing it is however difficult to extract that signal because forcing is everywhere fig 1 and because it is masked by the chaotic variability to solve the former problem would require confining the imposed sss interannual anomaly in a small region to solve the latter problem would require an ensemble of runs in striking contrast the spiciness field is dominated by smoother anomalies equatorward of the maximum outcrop lines strongly suggesting that this feature represents the subduction of sss anomalies at the outcrops and their subsequent advection by the large scale mean flow section 1 2 the direction of the propagation indeed generally agrees with the geostrophic streamfunction thin blue lines in the lower panels of fig 11 there are three prominent subducted signals negative anomaly in the eastern and central north pacific and positive anomalies in the eastern south indian and south pacific these centers of anomalies correspond to the tongues of high salinity variability fig 6a and the main regions where correlations with observation is improved in the argo sss run fig 7c signals are less clear in the north and south atlantic fig 11 but they may also explain the correlation change fig 7c in this region where variability is relatively high fig 6a as time goes on the spiciness anomaly starts to show small scale noise of both signs not shown likely because of the mesoscale velocity differences generate corresponding spiciness signal through the last term of eq 1 3 2 3 subduction north pacific the propagation of this subducted signal is most clear in the pacific fig 12 a is a longitude time plot of spiciness anomaly on 24 5 σθ averaged over 10 15 n where the core of the westward flowing north equatorial current nec resides before computing the spiciness anomaly the isopycnic salinity field of each model run is low pass filtered using a 13 month moving average to damp the mesoscale noise mentioned above the negative anomaly generated at the outcrop near 25 n 120 w is first advected southward and westward and then due westward in the north equatorial current nec fig 11 thin blue contours in the latter half of the experiment positive anomaly is propagated similarly fig 12a another source of signal exists at about 170 w and this signal seems to be more influential on the variability to the west note that the signal is coherent from 170 w westward in fig 12a and that the improvement in the correlation of spiciness anomaly with the argo data spreads from 170 w in fig 7c katsura et al 2013 reported a generation and westward advection of a negative salinity anomaly on a somewhat shallower isopycnal 24 σθ near 160 e from late 2004 to mid 2009 and a positive anomaly from mid 2009 to the end of their analysis mid 2011 in a gridded argo dataset our result for the 24 5 σθ surface is very similar except that the generation of the signals is farther east on this isopycnal sasaki et al 2010 and li et al 2012 on the other hand traced interannual salinity anomalies on deeper isopycnals 25 25 5 σθ in the argo observation the subduction on this density range occurs further north near 35 n in our spiciness field this signal is not visible not shown likely because our spiciness is defined in terms of the difference between the two model runs which fails to capture interannual anomalies due to other factors like winds than sss kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 argues that the generation of spiciness anomalies on the 25 5 σθ surface during 2004 2011 in their study is due to the migration of the outcrop line if so the weakness of spiciness anomaly on that isopycnal surface in our spiciness field suggests that the migration of the outcrop line is mainly due to variability in winds or heat flux not to sss but to confirm that would require further analysis indonesian throughflow upon reaching the western boundary the philippines the nec bifurcates into northward and southward western boundary currents and part of this southern branch the mindanao current bends westward south of mindanao island 5 n 125 e into the indonesian seas section 1 2 see sprintall et al s fig 1 for a schematic representation of the flow pattern in the indonesian seas subsequently it first flows southwestward and then southward in the passage 119 e between the islands of kalimantan and sulawesi it then bends eastward its southward pathway being largely blocked by the zonal island chain along 8 7 s before entering the indian ocean through deep passages further east 130 e there are narrow channels through the island chain most notable among them is the lombok strait 115 e which allows for a small fraction of the mean volume transport e g sprintall et al 2014 this pathway of pacific water into the indian ocean is the indonesian throughflow itf section 1 2 on the 24 5 σθ surface this pathway is clearly visible in the mean velocity field of our model not shown the spiciness anomaly above therefore should in principle enter the indian ocean through the indonesian seas fig 12b is a time latitude plot of spiciness anomaly in the mindanao current averaged over 122 128 e negative signals start to appear during 2007 when the first negative signals in the nec reach the western boundary region and the sign of the signals starts to turn positive during 2011 when the signal in the nec generally turns positive fig 12a fig 12c shows the spiciness anomaly averaged over 118 122 e which includes the main southward passage of itf between kalimantan and sulawesi if one extends this hovmöller diagram further north one sees that these signals tend to start at 5 n not shown the latitude of the itf entrance except for the large negative anomaly near the equator 1 1 the visual inspection of spiciness anomaly maps not shown suggests that these anomalies may be mesoscale noise associated with strong eddies just outside the indonesian seas spanning 2009 2014 the signs of the signals are generally consistent with those in the nec fig 12a and their propagation speeds are not inconsistent with the mean advection speed indicated by the thick red line segment the zonal island chain of indonesia blocks the signals at 8 s this fact is mostly obscured in the coarse regridded ogcm data fig 12d is a time longitude plot of spiciness anomaly on the indian side of the island chain an average over 11 5 8 5 s the negative signals during 2008 2011 and the positive signal during 2011 2014 near the right edge of the plot 120 130 e may be a reflection of the corresponding pacific signals but the connection is not clear the positive signal is much weaker on the indian side of the island chain where small scale noise is dominant it is interesting that stronger signals tend to start from 115 e and propagate westward where some fraction of the itf enters the indian ocean across the island chain through the lombok strait as stated above large seasonal and intraseasonal variability of this transport sometimes reverses the flow through the strait e g susanto et al 2007 however probably contributing to the intermittency of this signal the speed of the mean westward flow in this latitude band red line is about 7 cm s 1 smaller than the typical speed of propagation of the signals about 10 cm s 1 in fig 12d the mean meridional shear u y is large in this region and the propagation speed of the signals is more similar to the maximum speed of the sec in this latitude band not shown to further explore the possibility of salinity advection from the pacific to the indian we examined correlations of monthly mean salinity on the 24 5 σθ surface averaged over two boxes located on the main itf pathway at the entrance into and exit from the indonesian seas not shown the main signal we show above has a half period of 4 yr fig 12a and b and statistically meaningful correlation cannot be obtained for it in our 10 year dataset we instead looked at correlations of 13 month highpass filtered time series of those box averaged salinity values because if the advection of signals is significant it should be seen at the advection times scales which are estimated as 7 mon residence time koch larrouy et al 2008 there was however no significant correlation we did the same analysis for the salinity difference between the two runs but did not find significant correlation either we therefore conclude that even if there is advection of high frequency signal from the pacific to the indian that signal is overwhelmed by other variability a longer dataset would be necessary to conclude whether or not significant salinity signal is advected from the pacific to the indian ocean at longer timescales south indian in the south indian ocean sio the south equatorial current sec entrains waters from the itf and carries them westward and therefore its northern part potentially carries spiciness anomalies originated in the north pacific fig 12d in the southern part of the sec anomalies are originated from the sio fig 13 a shows spiciness anomaly on the 24 5 σθ surface averaged over 19 13 s similar to the north and south pacific oceans figs 12a and 13 b anomalies generated at the outcrop for example the positive anomalies in sio in fig 11 are first advected equatorward and westward and then due westward in the sec 19 13 s near 100 e see also fig 7c at madagascar the anomalies appear to split northward and southward not shown in the western boundary currents on madagascar the northeast and southeast madagascar currents see schott and mccreary 2001 or schott et al 2009 for a description of the near surface current system in the indian ocean south pacific similarly to the north pacific the positive spiciness anomaly generated near 15 s 120 w is advected westward in the sec 14 s 8 s on this isopycnal in the model as indicated in fig 13 b it is interesting that this spiciness anomaly reaches the equator within two years fig 11 the subsurface geostrophic flow having an equatorward branch in the southern hemisphere lu and mccreary 1995 the rest of the signal continues to flow westward and reaches the western boundary despite this clear signal the correlation of the modeled salinity anomaly with the gridded argo dataset is not improved west of 170 w in argo sss run fig 7c the interannual salinity variability on this isopycnal is small west of 170 w in the argo field fig 6a whereas it remains large in argo sss run fig 6c this discrepancy suggests that the interannual spiciness variability is advected westward farther west in the argo sss run than in observation which could be due to weaker diffusion in the model the fate of this signal is not clear on deeper isopycnals such as 25 5 σθ not shown corresponding signals appear to turn equatorward in the western boundary current and then flow eastward into the equatorial undercurrent euc this feature is consistent with the pathway of the thermocline water section 1 2 and with a past study that examined salinity anomalies in a similar way to ours furue et al 2015 atlantic the maximum outcrop in the north atlantic occurs near 10 n fig 11 and the salinity anomaly generated there is generally advected eastward in the north equatorial countercurrent necc as such the sss does not seem to have much remote impact on this isopycnal on the 25 σθ and 25 5 σθ surfaces the nec advects salinity signals westward similarly to the north pacific nec not shown in the south atlantic sss signal is weaker and much less systematic on all of the 24 5 25 and 25 5 σθ surfaces not shown 4 summary and discussion 4 1 summary to explore the impacts of sea surface salinity sss on the interannual variability of upper ocean state we have compared two 10 year runs of an eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ogcm in one sss is restored toward a monthly climatology woa98 and in the other it is restored toward the monthly sss of a gridded argo product to avoid mean drift monthly interannual anomaly is extracted from the argo data and added to woa98 to be used as the reference sss in both runs the interannual variability of the temperature field in the upper ocean agrees well with that of the argo observation and the argo sss brings about little improvement to the temperature field discussion of fig 3 indicating that the variability of the temperature field is dominated by that of winds and heat fluxes on the other hand the inclusion of the argo sss does improve the subsurface salinity variability not only where the mixed layer is deep enough to reach the depth but also below the mixed layer in the tropics and subtropics figs 4 7 the interannual variability of the mixed layer is also improved in the subpolar north atlantic and near the northern bound of the acc fig 8 where sss tends to be more influential in determining sea surface density than in lower latitudes on the other hand the mixed layer depth is also improved where the influence of precipitation is significant fig 8 in the western tropical pacific where the so called barrier layer is reproduced when the argo sss is included and in the bay of bengal where precipitation is large to understand the reason for the improvements in subsurface salinity we next examined the difference field between the two runs the difference at fixed depths is dominated by small scale features due to the chaotic nature of eddies and nonlinear jets fig 10 the spiciness difference however reveals the advection of salinity signals fig 11 as expected from the upper ocean general circulation sss variability in the mixed layer is subducted into the pycnocline in subtropical regions where the ekman pumping is downward by definition this signal is advected downward equatorward and westward in the north or south equatorial current nec or sec of the pacific indian or atlantic oceans figs 12 and 13 in principle part of the subducted signal in the subtropical north pacific should enter the indian ocean through the indonesian seas but this potential propagation is not clear fig 12 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 chaotic responses in addition to small scale noise due changes in the phases of eddies there are streak like features in the difference field between the argo sss and ncep runs fig 10 these streaks are sometimes called zonal jets or striations nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 maximenko et al 2008 if they are wind forced responses qiu et al 2013 or they are anchored by coastal geometry or bottom topography it is possible that their locations are more or less fixed most of them are however probably a result of eddy mean flow interaction nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 and hence their phases are random for this reason these streak like features in our difference fields fig 10 are likely just due to changes in phases of random variability and hence are not dynamically significant this noise makes it harder to trace advective signals section 3 2 and almost impossible to detect proper dynamical signals such as rossby waves an ensemble of runs would be necessary to improve the signal to noise ratio the difference between the ncep and argo sss runs is particularly large in and near strong jets right panels of fig 10 the annual mean zonal velocity in the kuroshio extension ke region averaged over the top 700 m is different by as much as 20 cm s 1 between the ncep and argo sss runs at several points in a coarse gridded 1 1 field during the last year of our model integrations not shown the spatial pattern of the difference is visually similar to those found between ensemble members by nonaka et al 2016 not shown this change may be of a different kind from the random shift of striations discussed above the ke is hypothesized to be a nonlinear dynamical system with multiple equilibria chao 1984 cessi and ierley 1995 if so a small kick of any kind can lead to an interannual to decadal change of the annual mean ke position shape and strength taguchi et al s 2007 analysis suggests that the decadal variability of the ke includes this type of oscillation it is not clear whether the ke change due to the sss interannual variability in our experiments is of this type 4 2 2 subpolar regions in subpolar regions except near iceland where the north atlantic subpolar mode water forms talley 1999 the interannual variability of subsurface salinity is not well correlated with the argo observation fig 4b and is improved very little by observed sss figs 4d and 5 this is likely because the subpolar region is characterized by upward ekman pumping and therefore sss cannot influence subsurface salinity locally through advection the subsurface salinity in subpolar regions is determined rather by upwelling long range horizontal isopycnal advection or horizontal and vertical mixing making it harder for the model to reproduce correctly the subpolar circulation is indeed complicated for example in the western north pacific subpolar gyre subsurface temperature and salinity are strongly affected by the advection of the warm and salty kuroshio water wagawa et al 2014 but the detailed flow field in this region is not very well reproduced in our ogcm not shown perhaps because some of the near surface currents are driven indirectly by eddies mitsudera et al 2017 submitted miyama et al 2017 submitted and the resolution of 0 1 is not sufficient for subpolar eddies where the first mode radius of deformation is 20 km chelton et al 1998 the north pacific subpolar region has another mechanism by which subsurface salinity is affected by sea surface conditions part of subpolar surface water enters the sea of okhotsk through gaps in the kuril island chain and becomes denser by surface cooling and brine rejection from sea ice formation to form the dense shelf water e g uehara et al 2014 and references therein it then sinks to the intermediate layer 300 1000 m and goes back to the north pacific through the gaps where it is partially mixed with lighter waters by strong tidal mixing nakamura et al 2004 2006 tanaka et al 2010 before spreading to the entire north pacific as the north pacific intermediate water npiw yasuda 1997 recent studies reported that changes in the north pacific moc are associated with significant subsurface salinity variability uehara et al 2014 matsuda et al 2015 nakanowatari et al 2015 in the subpolar ocean where density change is dominated by salinity change a slight change in salinity on an isopycnal surface leads to a large temperature change indeed large spiciness variability due to decadal scale latitudinal fluctuations of north pacific subarctic frontal zone is found in the ncep run and an ocean analysis data which contributes to upper ocean heat transport along the subpolar subtropical gyre boundary taguchi and schneider 2014 taguchi et al 2017 in our study we did not pay attention to the interannual variabilities of the subpolar north pacific moc because argo observation is lacking in the sea of okhotsk fig 1b hydrographic observation is indeed scarce there e g uehara et al 2014 the modeling of water exchange through the narrow gaps and strong tidal mixing there is also a challenge nakamura et al 2006 tanaka et al 2010 4 2 3 sss observation finally marginal seas where argo data is not available bring about some uncertainty for example we did not have argo sss in the indonesian seas since the vertical mixing in our model is very weak below the mixed layer section 2 their impacts are not likely to be significant on the pycnocline salinity in reality however vertical mixing is likely significant e g sprintall et al 2014 nagai and hibiya 2015 ray and susanto 2016 and if so the local sss should impact upon the pycnocline salinity it is also argued that sss within the indonesian seas directly affects the itf transport through pressure gradients it creates hu and sprintall 2016 the aquarius le vine et al 2015 and smos reul et al 2014 satellites would be helpful to mitigate this

manuscript we wish to acknowledge use of the ferret program for analysis and graphics in this paper ferret is a product of noaa s pacific marine environmental laboratory information is available at http ferret pmel noaa gov ferret appendix a the separation of salinity anomaly into its dynamical and spiciness components this appendix defines the separation of salinity anomaly into its dynamical and spiciness components more details of the separation are found in furue et al 2015 and the usefulness of spiciness anomaly in interpreting large scale variability in the thermocline is nicely summarized in the introduction of kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 this appendix also includes a very brief review of variant definitions of spiciness we use the most common straightforward traditional definition of spiciness which is simply the distribution of salinity or potential temperature on a single isopycnal potential density surface schneider 2000 doney et al 2003 yeager and large 2004 sasaki et al 2010 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 and many other papers that is spiciness is salinity as a function of potential density s ρ x y t where ρ is potential density and the other symbols are traditional if a reference state s o ρ r is defined a spiciness anomaly can be defined as δ s ρ r s ρ r s o ρ r where r x y t for convenience the symbol δ is introduced to indicate that the difference is taken at constant density not at constant depth in most past studies the reference state was a temporal average in contrast ours as well as furue et al s 2015 is a control run of the numerical model the spiciness can be related to the difference at constant depth by δ s z r s z r s o z r s ρ z r r s o ρ o z r r s ρ o z r r s ρ ρ o z r r δ ρ z r s o ρ o z r r δ s ρ o z r r δ s z r where s denotes the functional form of s in density coordinates when such distinction is necessary and δ s z r s ρ ρ o z r r δ ρ z r is the dynamical or heave component of the salinity difference e g doney et al 2003 schneider 2004 these components can be plotted either in depth or density coordinates using the coordinate transformation by ρ ρ o z r all above expressions hold if salinity is substituted with potential temperature there have been various formulations but the definition of the spiciness anomaly is essentially the same as that shown above in most past studies that use spiciness anomalies to interpret large scale variability in the main thermocline e g schneider 2000 doney et al 2003 yeager and large 2004 sasaki et al 2010 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 an interesting extension to the above spiciness anomaly is proposed by taguchi and schneider 2014 in the above the local at x y z t salinity change is interpreted as a superposition of isopycnal advection and a component due the vertical migration of isopycnal surfaces taguchi and schneider 2014 and taguchi et al 2017 separate it into isopycnal advection and a component due to the migration of the isopycnal in the direction of ρ o spiciness has also been discussed from another angle the water property is commonly characterized for each p by the pair t s but it is sometimes useful to describe the water property by a different pair ρ π where π is defined to be orthogonal to ρ e g stommel 1962 veronis 1972 huang 2011 the latter variable is spiciness see huang 2011 and mcdougall and krzysik 2015 and references therein for details spiciness behaves like a passive tracer e g stommel 1962 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 and its anomaly is approximately governed by a 1 δ s t u o δ s δ u s o isopycnal and diapycnal diffusion where u is horizontal velocity denotes horizontal gradient in density coordinates and the subscript o denotes a reference state kilpatrick et al 2011 furue et al 2015 taguchi et al 2017 the spiciness and dynamical components are defined only where the isopycnal surface exists both in the reference state and in the state we focus on therefore neither component is defined where the isopycnal outcrops in one or both of the states note that the spiciness component of the salinity difference is approximately proportional to that of the temperature difference with a nearly constant coefficient of proportionality on the basis of the linearization of the equation of state around typical sst and sss values and a 0 3 of temperature anomaly corresponds to about 0 1 psu of salinity anomaly in the upper tropical and subtropical regions 
24132,to explore the impacts of sea surface salinity sss on the interannual variability of upper ocean state we compare two 10 year runs of an eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ogcm in one sss is strongly restored toward a monthly climatology world ocean atlas 98 and in the other toward the sss of a monthly gridded argo product the inclusion of the argo sss generally improves the interannual variability of the mixed layer depth particularly so in the western tropical pacific where so called barrier layers are reproduced when the argo sss is included the upper ocean subsurface salinity variability is also improved in the tropics and subtropics even below the mixed layer to understand the reason for the latter improvement we separate the salinity difference between the two runs into its dynamical and spiciness components the dynamical component is dominated by small scale noise due to the chaotic nature of mesoscale eddies the spiciness difference indicates that as expected from the upper ocean general circulation sss variability in the mixed layer is subducted into the thermocline in subtropics this signal is generally advected downward equatorward and westward in the equator side of the subtropical gyre the sss signal subducted in the subtropical north pacific appears to enter the indian ocean through the indonesian throughflow although this signal is weak and probably insignificant in our model keywords sea surface salinity eddy resolving ogcm argo subduction 1 introduction 1 1 uncertainty in sss freshwater flux into the ocean mostly precipitation river discharge and sea ice melt is one of the least constrained parameters because the temporal or spatial scales of these phenomena are small boutin et al 2016 and hence accurate global measurements are difficult in numerical ocean models uncertainty in freshwater flux translates to that in sea surface salinity sss sea surface temperature sst has similar uncertainty due to that in heat flux but error in sst tends to be countered by anomalous heat flux of opposite sign e g bryan 1986 killworth et al 2000 whereas no such negative feedback exists for error in sss because sss has little impact upon freshwater input or evaporation e g bryan 1986 for this reason sea surface freshwater flux is often adjusted to avoid salinity drift in stand alone ocean general circulation models ogcms or in the oceanic components of coupled general circulation models either by directly modifying the flux itself or by restoring sss to some observed values e g johns et al 1997 gordon et al 2000 masumoto et al 2004 oke et al 2013 storto et al 2016 for global or basin scale simulations this adjustment has in turn suffered from the paucity of sss observation especially before the argo array gould et al 2004 the best one can do has usually been to use a climatological sss map based on in situ observations such as the world ocean atlas e g antonov et al 1998a locarnini et al 2013 as a result interannual sss variability is dampened or eliminated which potentially causes inconsistency with the sst field or error in subsurface salinity the potential impacts of this deficiency in climate prediction simulations are a concern one approach to improve the realism of the salinity field in ocean hindcast simulations reanalyses is to assimilate four dimensional salinity observations such as those from the argo array e g huang et al 2008 such ocean reanalyses are valuable resources for climate studies they however require large human and computer resources to produce and maintain e g stammer et al 2016 in addition many assimilation schemes break conservation properties or dynamical balances e g stammer et al 2016 rendering them less suitable for certain types of analysis than free model runs moreover long integrations of global eddy resolving ocean models are increasingly common and have been proved to be useful e g sasaki et al 2004 oke et al 2013 but data assimilation that conserves scalars and maintains dynamical balances is a challenge for eddy resolving ocean models that is obvious with respect to computer resources from the fact that most long term assimilation products are on coarse grids for these reasons free eddy resolving ogcms forced only from boundaries are useful tools for such models accurate sea surface conditions are necessary 1 2 potential impacts of sss sss impacts upon local surface density affecting the local mixed layer depth de boyer montégut et al 2004 liu et al 2009 the mixed layer depth change can in turn alter local sst it can also generate dynamical responses such as rossby and kelvin waves either through the density change itself or through its impact upon the vertical distribution of wind forcing these waves can propagate and affect ocean state elsewhere another potential impact of sss is on the t s relation watermass properties in the mixed layer both these processes can influence the circulation and watermass properties in thermohaline overturning circulations such as those associated with the north atlantic deep water antarctic bottom water and sea of okhotsk dense shelf water matsuda et al 2015 and references therein 1 2 1 subtropical cells the wind driven subduction stommel 1979 nurser and marshall 1991 marshall et al 1993 is another mechanism by which the mixed layer watermass properties impacts upon subsurface salinity in the subtropical gyres of the south indian north and south pacific and north and south atlantic where the ekman pumping is generally downward surface water is subducted into the pycnocline advected in the north or south equatorial current nec or sec of each ocean and typically upwelled to the surface in the equatorial region forming what is often called the subtropical cell mccreary and lu 1994 gu and philander 1997 johnson and mcphaden 1999 zhang et al 2003 schott et al 2004 pacific in the north and south pacific the subducted water flows to the western boundary while part of the subducted water reaches the equator in the south pacific before it arrives at the western boundary lu and mccreary 1995 and references therein at the western boundary the flow bifurcates equatorward and poleward both branches form a western boundary current the equatorward branch joining the equatorial undercurrent euc and the poleward branch joining to the subtropical gyre lu and mccreary 1995 and references therein see also the review paper by schott et al 2004 the equatorial upwelling of the upper part of the euc is a major sink of the subducted water mccreary and lu 1994 schott et al 2004 part of the equatorward western boundary current in north pacific the mindanao current enters the indian ocean via the indonesian throughflow e g gordon 1986 mccreary et al 2007 sprintall et al 2014 atlantic in the atlantic the subducted water flows in the nec or sec in the southern hemisphere much as in the pacific the sec bifurcates poleward and equatorward at the western boundary and its equatorward branch the north brazilian coastal current feeds into the atlantic euc metcalf and stalcup 1967 schott et al 1998 2004 in the north atlantic most of the subducted water returns poleward along the western boundary because of the presence of the atlantic deep meridional overturning circulation known as the atlantic moc or amoc schott et al 2004 indian subtropical subduction is non existent or weak in the north indian ocean whereas it occurs in the south indian much in the same way as in the pacific schott et al 2004 permanent equatorial upwelling or euc does not exist in the indian ocean however and the subducted water crosses the equator in the western boundary current and upwells in the northern hemisphere mainly at the coast of somalia and in an interior thermocline ridge in the northern hemisphere schott et al 2004 2009 1 2 2 subtropical water masses various subtropical water masses have been found to be advected in the subtropical gyres of the north and south pacific north and south atlantic and south indian oceans a subtropical mode water is a thick low pv water mass found in the pycnocline of the subtropics it is formed at a deep mixed layer subducted into the pycnoline and advected by the flow associated with the subtropical gyre there are numerous papers studying mode waters see talley 1999 or hanawa and talley 2001 for an overview and references therein for details the variability of the subtropical mode water has also been extensively studied see below more recently another type of water mass generally called subtropical underwater or tropical water has attracted some attention it is lighter and hence is formed more equatorward than subtropical mode waters it does not form a particularly thick low pv layer is associated with a salinity maximum and is also subducted to the upper pycnocline and advected in the subtropical cell o connor et al 2005 the north pacific tropical water nptw e g qu et al 1999 katsura et al 2013 and south pacific tropical water e g tsuchiya and talley 1996 o connor et al 2002 qu and gao 2017 both exist on the 24 0 25 0 σθ isopycnal surfaces the nptw is found to enter the indonesian seas fine et al 1994 and then the indian ocean ffield and gordon 1992 along the indonesian throughflow pathway described above ffield and gordon 1992 point out the watermass characteristics are diluted by mixing during the water s passage through the indonesian seas in the tropical and subtropical atlantic where surface density is generally higher than in the pacific the corresponding high salinity waters the north and south atlantic underwaters are identified on the 25 0 26 0 σθ isopycnal surfaces e g zhang et al 2003 qu et al 2016 in the south indian ocean the sss maximum exists further poleward than in the other oceans and the underwater is formed on 25 5 σθ isopycnals o connor et al 2005 1 2 3 variability carried by the subtropical cells two mechanisms are possible to generate variability in subducted salinity in one interannual sss variability directly translates to the local subsurface salinity variability via subduction in the other interannual variability in heat flux changes the location of the outcrop of an isopycnal surface altering the sss that the isopycnal surface is exposed to and leading to salinity variability on the isopycnal nonaka and sasaki 2007 there have been extensive discussion on the generation of salinity anomalies in the pycnocline see for example bindoff and mcdougall 1994 johnson 2006 yeager and large 2007 laurian et al 2009 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2013 and kolodziejczyk et al 2015 there are also studies on the variability of sss maxima which is the source water of the tropical water or underwater see for example o connor et al 2002 and qu et al 2011 once salinity signal is brought to subsurface it is advected in the pycnocline leading to the interannual variability of subsurface salinity nonaka and sasaki 2007 sasaki et al 2010 katsura et al 2013 and potentially impacting on remote in time and space ocean state gu and philander 1997 schneider et al 1999a 1999b lazar et al 2001 schneider 2004 isopycnal and diapycnal diffusion spreads and weakens this signal sato and suga 2009 sasaki et al 2010 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 the next subsection reviews past studies that examined salinity variability in the pycnocline 1 3 past studies of subsurface salinity variability there are numerous studies on salinity related variability in the bottom deep and intermediate thermohaline overturning here we review results most relevant to our present study those on the interannual variability of salinity in the topical subtropical pycnocline since the subtropical cells carries waters from subtropical mixed layers to their tropical upwelling regions see above variabilities in the sea surface fluxes of heat freshwater and momentum winds in the subduction regions cause salinity and temperature variabilities in the main pycnocline at interannual to decadal timescales gu and philander 1997 schneider et al 1999a 1999b lazar et al 2001 schneider 2004 it has been argued that such variabilities upwell into the mixed layer again in the tropical upwelling regions of the subtropical cells impacting upon climate through surface heat flux gu and philander 1997 schneider et al 1999a 1999b lazar et al 2001 2002 schneider 2004 the t s variability can be classified into two forms one is the vertical displacement of the pycnocline and the other is the density compensating change in temperature and salinity dynamical and spiciness variabilities respectively bindoff and mcdougall 1994 schneider et al 1999b schneider 2000 yeager and large 2004 analyzed a 40 year 1958 1997 non eddy resolving ocean hindcast identified the generation of spiciness anomalies in the subduction regions of all ocean basins and also found westward and equatorward advection of spiciness anomaly by the subtropical cells at interannual to decadal timescales in the north and south pacific nonaka and sasaki 2007 analyzed the same eddy resolving ogcm as we use section 2 and found a propagation of interannaul salinity variability in the south pacific on the 25 3 σθ surface by the sec similarly sasaki et al 2010 analyzed a gridded argo product in the north pacific and identified the propagation of interannual variability of salinity by the nec see above on the 25 25 5 σθ surfaces one of the mode waters in the north pacific kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 and li et al 2012 extended this line of work to describe and explain the propagation of interannual spiciness anomalies in gridded argo datasets on the 25 5 σθ surface kolodziejczyk and gaillard or between the 25 and 25 5 σθ surfaces li et al both in the north and south pacific they also found that the spiciness anomalies reach the equator kolodziejczyk et al 2014 found similar processes in the south atlantic many of these studies noted the weakening of the signals as they propagate away from the subduction region probably because of some vertical or isopycnal mixing katsura et al 2013 on the other hand tracked the interannual variability of salinity on shallower density surfaces 24 σθ north pacific tropical water in a gridded argo dataset and again found a westward propagation of salinity variability by the nec at interannual timescales likewise zhang and qu 2014 analyzed a gridded hydrographic dataset to explore the interannual variability of the south pacific tropical water spiciness anomalies generated at the surface are subducted and advected westward in the south equatorial current they also suggested that shifts in the velocity field sometimes alter generate spiciness anomalies as the water flows westward qu et al 2016 estimated the production rate of the north atlantic subtropical underwater from a gridded argo dataset and quantified its interannual variability but they did not detect the westward propagation of the interannual variability even though there have been studies on the mean flow of the south pacific subtropical underwater e g zhang et al 2003 there do not seem to our knowledge to be studies on its interannual variability in the south indian ocean li and wang 2015 showed the westward advection of interannual spiciness anomaly by the sec on the 24 0 25 0 σθ surfaces although this water is lighter than the south indian underwater and does not correspond to the sss maximum its pattern of propagation is similar to those of the pacific tropical waters and atlantic subtropical underwaters the mean flow of the south indian subtropical underwater is described by o connor et al 2005 but its variability has not been studied to our knowledge all these works are concerned about the temporal variability of subsurface salinity anomaly from a mean state in a single timeseries i e temporal salinity anomaly on a particular isopycnal surface or in a particular regional water mass as such one limitation is that it is not always straightforward to separate the contribution of sss to the subsurface salinity variability such problems can be addressed if there are two parallel model runs one of which is the control run and the other an anomaly run williams et al 2006 used an atmosphere ocean coupled model and compared two runs in one of which the sea surface fresh water flux is shut off to elucidate the role of salinity in the mean subtropical cells in the pacific köhl et al 2014 used their non eddy resolving ocean data assimilation system to explore the impacts of the sss observation from the smos satellite as an additional data to be assimilated over 2010 2011 by comparing two runs of an eddy permitting model furue et al 2015 looked at the propagation of temperature salinity anomaly generated by a sudden change in vertical diffusivity they tracked among other things the propagation of salinity anomalies originating from the pycnocline in the subtropical north pacific to the indian ocean through the indonesian seas see above 1 4 present study the purpose of the present paper is to describe the impacts of interannual sss variability on ocean state the argo system gould et al 2004 has made available sss data that includes interannual variability and is of higher spatial and temporal resolution than traditional hydrographic maps we utilize this data as follows we use an existing semi global eddy resolving ogcm after it was spun up it has been integrated from 1950 to the end of 2014 under surface forcings based on a re analysis product except that its sss is strongly restored toward a monthly climatology to avoid salinity drift from 2005 we replace the reference salinity with the sss from an argo product and integrate the model up to the end of 2014 by comparing these two parallel runs over 2005 2014 we examine how the observed sss improves subsurface salinity and explore how the sss signals are propagated we will not address the interaction of salinity with sea ice because neither our model or the argo array covers high latitude regions where sea ice is crucial our approach is unique in that we track differences between the two model runs instead of temporary anomalies in a single timeseries see above thereby isolating the impacts of sss variability our results will help estimate the uncertainty of the model state due to error in sss it will also help understand the nature of the uncertainty this information will be useful to assess errors due to surface flux adjustments in future climate simulations and deficiencies in free non data assimilated ogcm simulations with climatological sss restoration e g sasaki et al 2004 oke et al 2013 they will also contribute to assessing the impacts of the sss observations from the more recent aquarius le vine et al 2015 and smos reul et al 2014 satellites when they are assimilated into climate models this paper is organized as follows the next section discusses the methodology it first describes our ogcm and experimental design explains how we construct the reference sss from argo briefly describes the argo sss interannual variability and then presents our methods of data analysis section 2 first explores how observed sss improves the interannual variability of the mixed layer depth and subsurface salinity field and to understand the improvements it then examines differences between the two model runs finally section 4 provides a summary of the results and discusses their implications 2 methods 2 1 description of the numerical model the numerical oceanic general circulation model ogcm we use is that of masumoto et al 2004 and sasaki et al 2006 2008 here we first describe the ogcm and its basic configuration we then discuss the forcings and our experimental design 2 1 1 configuration parameterizations and numerics our ogcm is called ofes for ogcm for the earth simulartor which is a variant of mom3 pacanowski and griffies 2000 modified to run efficiently on the earth simulator https www jamstec go jp es en a vector parallel supercomputer at the japan agency for marine earth science and technology jamstec the computational domain extends from 75 s to 75 n with a horizontal grid spacing of 1 10 there are 54 levels in the vertical with the grid spacing increasing from 5 m at the sea surface to 330 m at the maximum depth of 6065 m the upper ocean is fairly well resolved with 20 levels in the top 200 m the horizontal mixing is parameterized with the two dimensional biharmonic operator its coefficient consisting of a background constant value 27 109 m4 s 1 or 9 109 m4 s 1 for momentum or scalar and a term that varies like the cube of the zonal grid spacing smith et al 2000 the vertical mixing is parameterized with the kpp scheme large et al 1994 with background viscosity and diffusivity due to the unresolved internal wave breaking of 10 4 m2 s 1 and 0 respectively the advection of scalars is discretized with a second order centered difference scheme pacanowski and griffies 2000 2 1 2 forcings spin up and experimental design throughout all model runs the model temperature and salinity are restored at all depths within 3 of the artificial boundaries at 75 s and 75 n toward the monthly climatology of the world ocean atlas 1998 woa98 antonov et al 1998a 1998b 1998c boyer et al 1998a 1998b 1998c the strength of the restoration linearly decreases from 1 1 day to 0 within the width 3 of this sponge layer the model was first spun up for 50 years from a state of rest with the annual mean temperature and salinity fields from woa98 under monthly climatological windstress and precipitation from the ncep ncar reanalysis over 1950 1999 kalnay et al 1996 and under heat flux and evaporation calculated with the bulk formulae of rosati and miyakoda 1988 using the monthly climatological variables from the ncep ncar reanalysis in addition to avoid salinity drift the sea surface salinity sss is restored toward the monthly climatology of woa98 at a timescale of six days over the topmost model layer of 5 m thickness for a 50 m thick mixed layer for instance the effective timescale is 60 days the ncep run described in detail by sasaki et al 2008 starts from this spun up state and is integrated from 1950 to 2014 under daily mean forcings derived from the ncep ncar reanalysis in the same manner as for the spin up run the sss is still restored toward the monthly climatology of woa98 although in the present paper it would be clearer to term this run woa98 sss run to contrast it to the run described next we choose the name ncep run because we have been using the latter in other papers such as sasaki et al 2006 2008 the argo sss run branches out from the ncep run at the beginning of year 2005 its only difference from the ncep run is that the reference sss for restoration is based on the argo observation the next section describes this sss field 2 2 the argo sss 2 2 1 construction of the sss data we use the 1 1 grid interpolated monthly salinity dataset based on argo developed at the asia pacific data research center apdrc and the international pacific research center iprc at the university of hawai i http apdrc soest hawaii edu projects argo the data is defined for the upper 2000 m at depth levels of 0 5 10 20 30 50 75 100 125 150 200 250 and 300 m after that the grid interval is constant at 100 m up to 1500 m depth and is then increased to 250 m for the rest of the depth range as for the horizontal interpolation of argo profiles onto the gridpoints see lebedev 2016 who uses the same variational method as for the apdrc iprc product this method does not include a single prescribed horizontal smoothing scale but an estimation indicates a scale of roughly 2 n a maximenko and k v lebedev 2017 personal communication this dataset is defined from 63 s to 65 n and starts from 2005 when the argo float coverage became reasonably good first we construct a monthly climatological sss field over 2005 2013 note that we did not extend the period to 2014 simply because we had started our model runs before the 2014 product came out we then compute monthly anomaly from this climatology for 2005 2014 where the gridded data is not defined because of the scarcity or lack of argo observation as in marginal seas and coastal areas and outside the latitude band of definition white areas in fig 1 b the sss anomaly is initially defined to be zero to avoid jumps across the edges of these regions we next diffuse argo values into these regions by applying 10 times a two dimensional moving average with the cressman 1959 weight function with a radius of 500 km over these regions this moving average is designed not to mix values across landmasses finally this argo based sss interannual anomaly is added to the sss monthly climatology of woa98 to be the reference monthly sss for the argo sss run the raw argo sss field is not used to avoid mean salinity biases between the argo sss and ncep runs the latter using the woa98 monthly climatological sss the two runs thus differ just by the additional sss interannual anomaly in the reference sss for restoration 2 2 2 description of the sss data fig 1 shows the sss interannual anomaly during january 2005 as an example and its standard deviation over the data period 2005 2014 the jan 2005 anomaly field fig 1a is patchy except for the large scale features in the western equatorial tropical pacific and tropical subtropical central pacific the blue patches in fig 1a the other months are similar in this respect not shown even those patchy looking anomalies however seem to be part of large scale patterns as the standard deviation field fig 1b suggests generally the interannual variability is large in low latitudes suggesting that it is dominated by variability in freshwater input the bay of bengal 90 e 20 n for instance is known for large precipitation as well as large river runoff e g shetye et al 1996 in addition the variability in the pacific equatorial region seems to be dominated by enso the sss in the western equatorial pacific where its variability is maximum fig 1b appears to be dominated by 2 4 yr variability not shown it is indeed anti correlated with the sst from the same monthly gridded product apdrc iprc argo product with correlation coefficients of 0 60 and 0 84 for the raw interannual variability and for the interannual variability smoothed with a 13 month moving average respectively over the region 140 170 e 3 s 3 n whereas interannual temperature variability in this region is mainly due to enso discussed later this is consistent with delcroix and hénin 1991 and delcroix et al 2011 for example who argued that the interannual variability of observed sss in the western tropical pacific can be explained as resulting from the known precipitation variability associated with enso where higher lower sst leads to higher lower precipitation and hence to lower higher sss another type of variability is associated with the variability in the position or intensity of the strong oceanic fronts in fig 1b variabilities near the gulf stream brazil current oyashio in northwest pacific and the northern edge of the antarctic circumpolar current in the indian sector are conspicuous 2 3 methods of analysis processing of the data to analyze the ogcm output we smooth the ogcm variables by mapping them onto a 3 3 grid by a simple bin average and by computing their monthly averages when mixed layer depths are compared or when otherwise necessary see below the monthly argo data is vertically interpolated onto the ogcm gridpoints and bin averaged onto the same 3 3 grid so that the coarse gridded ogcm data and the argo observation share the same four dimensional grid when we compute correlations between the ogcm and argo observation at interannual timescales in section 3 1 we first lowpass filter the above data both argo or coarse gridded ogcm using a 13 month boxcar moving average with a half width of 6 points this temporal smoothing together with the spatial smoothing described above will increase the signal to noise ratio by weakening mesoscale variability which is more or less random and tends to obscure slow large scale signals section 3 a monthly climatology is then computed over 2005 2014 and subtracted from the lowpass filtered data to obtain the interannual anomalies we compared correlations over detrended and non detrended timeseries and found that the detrended correlation is higher in some regions and lower in others not shown although statistically non significant a positive correlation between trends captures the fact that the model has a similar trend with the observation because our conclusions are not much affected by the statistical significance of correlation coefficients and because the detrended correlation fields do not differ qualitatively not shown we decided to show non detrended correlation coefficients below in section 3 1 differences between model runs we also calculate differences of the argo sss run from the ncep run which we generally denote by δ as in δ s t x y z s argo run t x y z s ncep run t x y z and for which we also use the coarse gridded monthly mean fields described above note that monthly mean fields still include significant mesoscale variability and as is seen below this pointwise difference includes mesoscale noise because mesoscale eddies and jets shift their positions owing to their chaotic nature as in schneider et al 1999a doney et al 2003 yeager and large 2004 taguchi and schneider 2014 and furue et al 2015 it is useful to separate the salinity and temperature differences into their dynamical or heave and spiciness components see appendix for details the dynamical component being the local temperature or salinity change due to the vertical displacement of isopycnals and the spiciness component the density compensating temperature and salinity change on individual isopycnals the dynamical anomaly can be generated by any difference in density between the two runs and is propagated by rossby and kelvin waves while the spiciness anomaly is approximately governed by 1 δ s t u o δ s δ u s o isopycnal and diapycnal diffusion where the subscript o denotes a reference state which in our case is the ncep run see the discussion of eq a 1 without velocity anomaly the spiciness anomaly behaves like a passive tracer advected on isopycnals by the background flow u o 3 results in this section we first briefly discuss the mean state of our control run ncep run comparing it with the argo observation next we examine the impacts of the observed sss focusing on how it improves interannual variability in the upper ocean finally to understand the reasons for the improvements we explore how differences between the two model runs are propagated 3 1 comparison with observations 3 1 1 climatological states general comparisons of the spin up run and the ncep run with observations are found in masumoto et al 2004 and sasaki et al 2008 respectively here we compare features that are most relevant to the present study of the upper ocean climatological state in the ncep run with observations fig 2 compares the salinity fields from the ncep run with that from the gridded argo dataset along a representative meridional section of salinity in the pacific this section is located to the west of the outcrops of the 24 5 σθ surface which we study in great detail below sea surface salinity is particularly high in the 30 10 s and 15 30 n bands not shown because of high evaporation and this high salinity water is subducted to the pycnocline and advected westward in the sec and nec section 1 2 forming the subsurface tongues of high salinity both in the southern and northern hemispheres wyrtki and kilonsky 1984 fig 2 as they flow westward both these waters also extend equatorward in the south pacific some of this water directly reaches the equator whereas most of it flows to the western boundary in the north pacific section 1 2 this is the reason that the high salinity tongue stops at about 10 n in the northern hemisphere fig 2 the salinity value for the southern tongue is also much higher because the sss is higher in the southern hemisphere not shown the 24 5 σθ surface lies near the center of these high salinity tongues fig 2 note that the cores of the high salinity waters lie below the deepest mixed layer during the year fig 2 thick red lines suggesting that their salinities should be largely conserved and advected by the ambient flow or diffused along isopycnals by mesoscale eddies not only this pattern of salinity distribution is similar between the model and the observation but also the salinity values are similar the most conspicuous difference is that the salinity and density fields are much smoother in the gridded argo dataset this difference is likely due to the horizontal smoothing that went into the gridding of argo observations to produce the argo product http apdrc soest hawaii edu projects argo the global mean horizontal smoothing scale is estimated to be 2 but it varies from region to region depending on the number of profiles around the gridpoint see section 2 2 1 the model field better preserves small scale meridional structures associated with the euc and the tsuchiya jets such as the downward and upward bulges of the isopycnals below and above the euc and the weak local salinity maximum below 160 m at the equator below the core of the euc both of which have been seen in high resolution meridional sections johnson et al 2002 although they seem to be exaggerated in our model we briefly compared these salinity and density sections with those from the roemmich gilson gridded argo dataset roemmich and gilson 2009 and found that the above equatorial features are somewhat more visible in there not shown than in the argo product we use in this study another difference is that the mixed layer is somewhat deeper in the model between 30 and 15 s probably because sst is lower up to 1 c in this region during the austral winter and spring not shown in the argo sss run sss is of course closer to the gridded argo data but the sea surface density is still much larger and the mixed layer is deeper than in the argo data not shown the similarity and difference between the observation and model are also similar in the south indian and north and south atlantic oceans to those in the pacific 3 1 2 temperature correlations fig 3 shows temperature anomaly correlations at z 0 and z 150 m between the argo sss run and the gridded argo data those for the ncep run not shown are very similar to fig 3 that is there is little improvement in model temperature interannual variability due to the argo sss forcing the sea surface temperature sst correlation is generally high and most of the regions with lower correlation values are located where mesoscale eddies are strong in our ogcm masumoto et al s 2004 fig 3 sasaki et al s 2008 fig 10 3 such as in western boundary currents and their extensions near the northern edge of the antarctic circumpolar current and near the eastern equatorial pacific and atlantic because of tropical instability waves this disagreement is likely a manifestation of chaos due to mesoscale variability or to strong nonlinear currents in these regions even if statistical properties of modeled eddies are realistic it is unlikely that the phases of eddies agree with the reality moreover the positions and intensities of the strong frontal currents are fairly chaotic see taguchi et al 2007 and nonaka et al 2016 for the chaotic nature of the kuroshio extension for example this chaotic variance obscures interannual signal in our relatively short integration 10 yrs low correlations are however found also in regions where eddy activity is low all these low correlation regions exist also in the correlation between ncep run and the argo observation not shown this deficiency must be due to inaccuracy in forcings model dynamics or parameterizations in the model for example the correlation is very low along the west coast of africa south of the equator whereas eddy activity is low there not shown it is possible that inaccuracy in the wind field that forces our model leads to the inaccuracy in the sst interannual variability in this coastal upwelling region small et al 2015 the correlation is also low west of india northwest of indonesia and in a band extending northeastward from the caribbean sea but again eddy activity is not particularly high in these regions not shown the low correlation region west of hawaii is also much broader in the meridional direction than the eddy train associated with the hawaiian lee countercurrent e g sasaki and nonaka 2006 at z 150 m fig 3b correlation is lower in much broader areas because the ocean state is less constrained by surface fluxes than at the sea surface except in regions where the mixed layer reaches this depth interannual temperature variability is mainly governed by wind forcing and model dynamics for example the high correlation in the western tropical pacific is due mainly to enso e g wang and picaut 2004 within the gridded argo dataset the djf mean temperature at z 150 m averaged over 160 e 180 5 s 5 n is anti correlated with the niño 3 4 sst e g trenberth 1997 with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 conversely the lower correlation is a result mainly of various errors in the model and forcings 3 1 3 salinity correlations fig 4 a shows the sss anomaly correlation between the ncep run and the gridded argo data which is of course much worse than the sst correlation fig 3a because the model sss is restored to climatology the subsurface correlation fig 4b is also worse than the corresponding temperature correlation not shown it is interesting that interannual correlation still exists even under the strong restoration to climatological sss in particular sss correlation is high in the western tropical pacific and in the zonal band south of the equator in the indian ocean fig 4a such correlation must ultimately come from interannual variability in external forcing such as precipitation and winds if strong enough variability in precipitation will give variability to local sss against the sss restoration likewise variability in winds can lead to sss variability for example winds can change the pycnocline depth through wave propagation which in turn would affect sss where the pycnocline is shallow the above correlation in the tropical pacific and indian is likely due the interannual variability in the precipitation data that forces our model in these regions both the mean precipitation and the interannual variability of precipitation are particularly high not shown suggesting that precipitation is more influential to sss variability in these regions than in others in the western tropical pacific the interannual variability in sss is indeed known to be dominated by enso related variability in precipitation e g delcroix et al 2011 the inclusion of the argo sss of course much improves the sss correlation fig 4c it is interesting however that like the sst field fig 3a the sss correlation is still low in eddy rich regions such as along the aleutian arc in the kuroshio extension and gulfstream off the east coast of india off the arabian pensinsula in the agulhas leakage extending northwestward from the southern tip of africa and along the equatorward edge of the antarctic circumpolar current acc see masumoto et al 2004 sasaki et al 2008 despite the restoration toward the argo sss the inclusion of the argo sss also improves subsurface salinity fig 4d to see where the improvements are we plot difference in the correlation coefficients at z 150 m fig 5 the correlation of the argo sss run is higher to the south of the kuroshio extension and gulf stream in the far northern north atlantic in the subtropical south atlantic in the regions north of new zealand and northeast of australia and in a band along the northern edge of the antarctic circumpolar current acc extending westward from the southern tip of south america to the central indian ocean these regions coincide with those where the winter mixed layer penetrates deeper than 150 m fig 9 all of them except for the one northeast of australia seem to correspond to the formation regions of subtropical subpolar or subantarctic mode waters talley 1999 the improvements therefore are likely due to the improved salinity values of the mode waters in contrast the deepest winter mixed layer is shallower than 150 m and still the salinity correlation is improved in zonally elongated bands in the subtropics namely those in the low latitude north atlantic 20 n in north pacific extending westward from hawaii toward the philippines in south pacific from chile between 40 s and 20 s and in south indian from the west coast of australia toward madagascar as shown in section 3 2 these improvements are most likely due to the subsurface spreading of subducted waters which are formed in winter mixed layers and spread equatorward westward and downward on isopycnals these waters do not correspond to mode waters talley 1999 the patches in the low latitude north atlantic are consistent with the sinking and spreading of the north atlantic underwater 25 5 σθ e g qu et al 2016 see also section 1 2 the band in the north pacific the spreading of the north pacific tropical water 24 0 24 5 σθ e g katsura et al 2013 see also section 1 2 and the one in the south indian the water discussed by li and wang 2015 24 0 25 0 σθ in the two regions west of south america between 40 and 20 s where the subsurface correlation is improved fig 5 the maximum mixed layer is largely shallower than 150 m although it reaches 150 m at some spots fig 9 this region corresponds to the formation region of the light mode water in the south pacific 25 5 σθ south pacific eastern subtropical mode water talley 1999 hanawa and talley 2001 we trace the spreading of each signal in section 3 2 in subpolar regions except near iceland where the north atlantic subpolar mode water forms talley 1999 the subsurface correlation is weak fig 4b and d and improves very little fig 5 the subpolar region is characterized by upward ekman pumping see wyrtki 1961 for ekman upwelling in the southern ocean and therefore sss cannot influence subsurface salinity locally through advection see section 4 2 2 for further discussion along the equator within 5 in the indian and pacific there are patches of high correlation at z 150 m even without the internannual anomaly in the argo sss fig 4b and it improves little by the restoration toward the argo sss fig 5 this feature suggests that the variabilities in wind forcing or heat flux partly controls subsurface salinity variability through dynamics waves etc in these regions to further examine the sub mixed layer correlation improvements we examine interannual salinity anomaly on the 24 5 σθ isopycnal surface that is the spiciness anomaly which picks up the low latitude signals in the north and south pacific and south indian mentioned above compared with the gridded argo product fig 6 a the ncep run fig 6b misses all the most prominent tongues of high variability which are emanating from outcrops in the north and south pacific and south indian in the argo sss run fig 6c the variability becomes closer to the argo observation in all the three tongues although the variability is still weaker in the north pacific and south indian tongues similarly the variability is increased in the atlantic in the argo sss run although it becomes larger than the observation this increase in variability from the ncep run to argo sss run together with the spatial patterns of these tongues is consistent with the idea that the interannual signals imparted by sss are subducted at the outcrops of the isopycnal and advected in the respective subtropical cells section 1 2 fig 7 a and b show the correlations of spiciness anomaly on this isopycnal between the model runs and the gridded argo product the increase in the correlation from the ncep run to the argo sss run fig 7c is consistent with the advection of the subducted signal it is interesting that the correlation is already relatively high in the ncep run along 10 s fig 7a and increases only modestly in the argo sss run fig 7c suggesting that part of the interannual salinity anomaly is generated by other forcings than sss perhaps by a similar mechanism to the one discussed by nonaka and sasaki 2007 see also section 1 2 3 1 4 mixed layer depth correlations interannual variability in sss can affect not only the water mass properties but also dynamics through changes in density and mixed layer depth mld fig 8 shows the correlation coefficients of mld anomaly between the model runs and the gridded argo data and the difference in the correlation coefficients the correlation is generally higher in both model runs than the sss correlation in the ncep run fig 4a suggesting that sst is generally more influential on mld recall that the sst correlation does not change much between the two model runs as in the discussion of fig 3a the difference field fig 8c is mostly positive i e argo sss run improving it is more patchy than the difference in salinity correlations for example fig 5 perhaps because local vertically one dimensional processes are more influential to determine the mld field than the salinity field for which horizontal isopycnal advection plays a larger role improvements are found in the northern north atlantic low latitude subtropical north pacific and north atlantic western equatorial pacific low latitude subtropical south indian and the northern part of the bay of bengal barely seen in the plot and along the northern edge of the acc in the indian sector the improvements in mld in the northern north atlantic and in the acc may be understood as a direct consequence of the improved sss correlation fig 4a and c suggesting that the influence of salinity on sea surface density is larger in these regions than in others see also section 3 2 1 in the southern side of the western equatorial pacific mld averaged over 5 s eq 160 e 160 w is about 40 m and the difference argo sss run minus ncep run varies between about 15 m and 10 m not shown even though the difference is small the mld correlation with observation is much improved in the western equatorial pacific fig 8c suggesting that the influence of salinity on mld is large in this region because of large precipitation lukas and lindstrom 1991 as a clear example on january 2010 when the difference in mld between the two runs is largest at about 15 m both salinity and temperature are vertically uniform in the mixed layer in the ncep run whereas in the argo sss run low near surface salinity as much as 0 3 psu lower than in the ncep run creates a shallow mixed layer with a halocline at its bottom within a thicker isothermal layer e g lindstrom et al 1987 lukas and lindstrom 1991 maes et al 2005 forming a barrier layer the layer between the bottoms of the mixed layer and isothermal layer sprintall and tomczak 1992 liu et al 2009 it is interesting that sss correlation is already high in this region in the ncep run and the inclusion of argo sss does not improve the correlation compare fig 4a with fig 4c the difference map is not shown why then is the mld better represented in the argo sss run we have visually inspected the timeseries of sss in this particular region and found that although the sss correlation with argo observation is high in both runs the amplitude of interannual variability is much closer to that of the argo observation in the argo sss run the bay of bengal is known to receive a large amount of fresh water in the form of precipitation and river runoff e g shetye et al 1996 and as a result is one of the areas having largest interannual sss anomaly fig 1 it is known that p e and river runoff in this region significantly impact upon the mld han et al 2001 rao and sivakumar 2003 li et al 2017 the interannual variability of the mld is accordingly somewhat improved by the inclusion of the argo sss fig 8c see sss correlations in fig 4a note that sst hardly differs between the runs not shown it is noteworthy that the climatological annual cycle of sss is very different between woa98 and the apdrc iprc argo product in the bay of bengal not shown as a result the model climatological sss which is restored toward woa98 section 2 and hence is close to it is also very different from argo observation for example the climatological sss 2005 2014 averaged over 83 95 e 16 22 n is minimum in october and january at 31 6 psu in the gridded argo dataset whereas it is minimum in october at 27 0 and 26 9 psu in the ncep and argo sss runs respectively the cause of this large difference between woa98 and the apdrc iprc argo product is not clear 3 2 difference between the two runs to understand how the interannual sss signal affects the ocean state we next compare the ncep and argo sss runs we first examine how the mixed layer depth section 3 2 1 differs between the two model runs followed by differences in temperature and salinity section 3 2 2 to understand the latter we separate the difference fields into their dynamical and spiciness components and explore how the spiciness difference is propagated into the subtropical and tropical pycnocline section 3 2 3 3 2 1 mixed layer depth because of the sss interannual variability that of mld is also generally larger in argo sss run than in ncep run not shown fig 9 shows the maximum mld during year 2008 in the ncep run and the difference in the maximum mld between the argo sss and ncep runs the difference field is significantly different from year to year not shown but generally the amplitude is largest in the acc and in the northern north atlantic for the figure this particular year is chosen simply because both anomalies are clearly visible generally the deeper the mixed layer is the larger the difference is the regions of large difference in the acc and in the northern north atlantic roughly coincide with those of improved correlation fig 8c except to the west of the southern tip of south america suggesting that the improvements occur because sss is influential to mixed layer density in these high latitude regions where stratification due to temperature is weaker than in mid and low latitudes interestingly the difference field is dominated by small scale features in eddy rich regions indicating the influence of mesoscale eddies on local mld 3 2 2 temperature and salinity fig 10 plots temperature and salinity differences at z 150 m and z 400 m averaged over year 2014 the difference fields are hardly systematic with small scale patches and streaks of both signs this is a natural consequence of the chaotic nature of mesoscale eddies even when the statistical properties of eddies hardly change their phases can appreciably change leading to the point wise difference shown in the figure likewise the small scale streaks in the difference field can be a slight shift in eddy driven striations furue et al 2015 impacts of the argo sss penetrate deeper than the depths where correlations with the observation are significant far deeper than can be affected by pure advection indicating that these changes are due to changes in pressure and in velocity through geostrophy to extract more systematic signals we separate the difference fields into their dynamical and spiciness components section 2 3 fig 11 shows the two components of the salinity difference between the argo sss and ncep runs on the 24 5 σθ surface averaged over the first and second years of integration years 2005 and 2006 this isopycnal is chosen mostly because interannual variability happens to be clearest on it this surface happens to be near the center of the pacific salinity maximum layers fig 2 section 3 1 and corresponds to the pacific tropical waters section 1 2 but the significance of this correspondence is not clear the light gray regions indicate where the isopycnal surface does not exist in any month during the year while the thick black lines indicate maximum outcropping such that on the equator side of them the isopycnal stays subsurface throughout the year poleward of the maximum outcrop lines therefore the isopycnal is exposed to the sea surface some time during the year and hence gets salinity variability directly from the argo sss data in contrast equatorward of the maximum outcrop lines the variability must be propagated by waves or advection this isopycnal deepens toward the equator to 120 160 m in the central pacific fig 2 the dynamical signal upper panels is much weaker than the spiciness one lower panels note the difference in contour intervals and the spatial structure of the dynamical signal is noisy visually similar to the salinity and temperature differences in fig 10 it is dominated by small scale features of both signs a reflection of the mesoscale point wise difference discussed above in principle the dynamical component should also include rossby and kelvin waves forced by density changes due to the sss anomaly furue et al 2015 density changes alter pressure and they also alter the mixed layer depth which in turn alters the vertical distribution of wind forcing it is however difficult to extract that signal because forcing is everywhere fig 1 and because it is masked by the chaotic variability to solve the former problem would require confining the imposed sss interannual anomaly in a small region to solve the latter problem would require an ensemble of runs in striking contrast the spiciness field is dominated by smoother anomalies equatorward of the maximum outcrop lines strongly suggesting that this feature represents the subduction of sss anomalies at the outcrops and their subsequent advection by the large scale mean flow section 1 2 the direction of the propagation indeed generally agrees with the geostrophic streamfunction thin blue lines in the lower panels of fig 11 there are three prominent subducted signals negative anomaly in the eastern and central north pacific and positive anomalies in the eastern south indian and south pacific these centers of anomalies correspond to the tongues of high salinity variability fig 6a and the main regions where correlations with observation is improved in the argo sss run fig 7c signals are less clear in the north and south atlantic fig 11 but they may also explain the correlation change fig 7c in this region where variability is relatively high fig 6a as time goes on the spiciness anomaly starts to show small scale noise of both signs not shown likely because of the mesoscale velocity differences generate corresponding spiciness signal through the last term of eq 1 3 2 3 subduction north pacific the propagation of this subducted signal is most clear in the pacific fig 12 a is a longitude time plot of spiciness anomaly on 24 5 σθ averaged over 10 15 n where the core of the westward flowing north equatorial current nec resides before computing the spiciness anomaly the isopycnic salinity field of each model run is low pass filtered using a 13 month moving average to damp the mesoscale noise mentioned above the negative anomaly generated at the outcrop near 25 n 120 w is first advected southward and westward and then due westward in the north equatorial current nec fig 11 thin blue contours in the latter half of the experiment positive anomaly is propagated similarly fig 12a another source of signal exists at about 170 w and this signal seems to be more influential on the variability to the west note that the signal is coherent from 170 w westward in fig 12a and that the improvement in the correlation of spiciness anomaly with the argo data spreads from 170 w in fig 7c katsura et al 2013 reported a generation and westward advection of a negative salinity anomaly on a somewhat shallower isopycnal 24 σθ near 160 e from late 2004 to mid 2009 and a positive anomaly from mid 2009 to the end of their analysis mid 2011 in a gridded argo dataset our result for the 24 5 σθ surface is very similar except that the generation of the signals is farther east on this isopycnal sasaki et al 2010 and li et al 2012 on the other hand traced interannual salinity anomalies on deeper isopycnals 25 25 5 σθ in the argo observation the subduction on this density range occurs further north near 35 n in our spiciness field this signal is not visible not shown likely because our spiciness is defined in terms of the difference between the two model runs which fails to capture interannual anomalies due to other factors like winds than sss kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 argues that the generation of spiciness anomalies on the 25 5 σθ surface during 2004 2011 in their study is due to the migration of the outcrop line if so the weakness of spiciness anomaly on that isopycnal surface in our spiciness field suggests that the migration of the outcrop line is mainly due to variability in winds or heat flux not to sss but to confirm that would require further analysis indonesian throughflow upon reaching the western boundary the philippines the nec bifurcates into northward and southward western boundary currents and part of this southern branch the mindanao current bends westward south of mindanao island 5 n 125 e into the indonesian seas section 1 2 see sprintall et al s fig 1 for a schematic representation of the flow pattern in the indonesian seas subsequently it first flows southwestward and then southward in the passage 119 e between the islands of kalimantan and sulawesi it then bends eastward its southward pathway being largely blocked by the zonal island chain along 8 7 s before entering the indian ocean through deep passages further east 130 e there are narrow channels through the island chain most notable among them is the lombok strait 115 e which allows for a small fraction of the mean volume transport e g sprintall et al 2014 this pathway of pacific water into the indian ocean is the indonesian throughflow itf section 1 2 on the 24 5 σθ surface this pathway is clearly visible in the mean velocity field of our model not shown the spiciness anomaly above therefore should in principle enter the indian ocean through the indonesian seas fig 12b is a time latitude plot of spiciness anomaly in the mindanao current averaged over 122 128 e negative signals start to appear during 2007 when the first negative signals in the nec reach the western boundary region and the sign of the signals starts to turn positive during 2011 when the signal in the nec generally turns positive fig 12a fig 12c shows the spiciness anomaly averaged over 118 122 e which includes the main southward passage of itf between kalimantan and sulawesi if one extends this hovmöller diagram further north one sees that these signals tend to start at 5 n not shown the latitude of the itf entrance except for the large negative anomaly near the equator 1 1 the visual inspection of spiciness anomaly maps not shown suggests that these anomalies may be mesoscale noise associated with strong eddies just outside the indonesian seas spanning 2009 2014 the signs of the signals are generally consistent with those in the nec fig 12a and their propagation speeds are not inconsistent with the mean advection speed indicated by the thick red line segment the zonal island chain of indonesia blocks the signals at 8 s this fact is mostly obscured in the coarse regridded ogcm data fig 12d is a time longitude plot of spiciness anomaly on the indian side of the island chain an average over 11 5 8 5 s the negative signals during 2008 2011 and the positive signal during 2011 2014 near the right edge of the plot 120 130 e may be a reflection of the corresponding pacific signals but the connection is not clear the positive signal is much weaker on the indian side of the island chain where small scale noise is dominant it is interesting that stronger signals tend to start from 115 e and propagate westward where some fraction of the itf enters the indian ocean across the island chain through the lombok strait as stated above large seasonal and intraseasonal variability of this transport sometimes reverses the flow through the strait e g susanto et al 2007 however probably contributing to the intermittency of this signal the speed of the mean westward flow in this latitude band red line is about 7 cm s 1 smaller than the typical speed of propagation of the signals about 10 cm s 1 in fig 12d the mean meridional shear u y is large in this region and the propagation speed of the signals is more similar to the maximum speed of the sec in this latitude band not shown to further explore the possibility of salinity advection from the pacific to the indian we examined correlations of monthly mean salinity on the 24 5 σθ surface averaged over two boxes located on the main itf pathway at the entrance into and exit from the indonesian seas not shown the main signal we show above has a half period of 4 yr fig 12a and b and statistically meaningful correlation cannot be obtained for it in our 10 year dataset we instead looked at correlations of 13 month highpass filtered time series of those box averaged salinity values because if the advection of signals is significant it should be seen at the advection times scales which are estimated as 7 mon residence time koch larrouy et al 2008 there was however no significant correlation we did the same analysis for the salinity difference between the two runs but did not find significant correlation either we therefore conclude that even if there is advection of high frequency signal from the pacific to the indian that signal is overwhelmed by other variability a longer dataset would be necessary to conclude whether or not significant salinity signal is advected from the pacific to the indian ocean at longer timescales south indian in the south indian ocean sio the south equatorial current sec entrains waters from the itf and carries them westward and therefore its northern part potentially carries spiciness anomalies originated in the north pacific fig 12d in the southern part of the sec anomalies are originated from the sio fig 13 a shows spiciness anomaly on the 24 5 σθ surface averaged over 19 13 s similar to the north and south pacific oceans figs 12a and 13 b anomalies generated at the outcrop for example the positive anomalies in sio in fig 11 are first advected equatorward and westward and then due westward in the sec 19 13 s near 100 e see also fig 7c at madagascar the anomalies appear to split northward and southward not shown in the western boundary currents on madagascar the northeast and southeast madagascar currents see schott and mccreary 2001 or schott et al 2009 for a description of the near surface current system in the indian ocean south pacific similarly to the north pacific the positive spiciness anomaly generated near 15 s 120 w is advected westward in the sec 14 s 8 s on this isopycnal in the model as indicated in fig 13 b it is interesting that this spiciness anomaly reaches the equator within two years fig 11 the subsurface geostrophic flow having an equatorward branch in the southern hemisphere lu and mccreary 1995 the rest of the signal continues to flow westward and reaches the western boundary despite this clear signal the correlation of the modeled salinity anomaly with the gridded argo dataset is not improved west of 170 w in argo sss run fig 7c the interannual salinity variability on this isopycnal is small west of 170 w in the argo field fig 6a whereas it remains large in argo sss run fig 6c this discrepancy suggests that the interannual spiciness variability is advected westward farther west in the argo sss run than in observation which could be due to weaker diffusion in the model the fate of this signal is not clear on deeper isopycnals such as 25 5 σθ not shown corresponding signals appear to turn equatorward in the western boundary current and then flow eastward into the equatorial undercurrent euc this feature is consistent with the pathway of the thermocline water section 1 2 and with a past study that examined salinity anomalies in a similar way to ours furue et al 2015 atlantic the maximum outcrop in the north atlantic occurs near 10 n fig 11 and the salinity anomaly generated there is generally advected eastward in the north equatorial countercurrent necc as such the sss does not seem to have much remote impact on this isopycnal on the 25 σθ and 25 5 σθ surfaces the nec advects salinity signals westward similarly to the north pacific nec not shown in the south atlantic sss signal is weaker and much less systematic on all of the 24 5 25 and 25 5 σθ surfaces not shown 4 summary and discussion 4 1 summary to explore the impacts of sea surface salinity sss on the interannual variability of upper ocean state we have compared two 10 year runs of an eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ogcm in one sss is restored toward a monthly climatology woa98 and in the other it is restored toward the monthly sss of a gridded argo product to avoid mean drift monthly interannual anomaly is extracted from the argo data and added to woa98 to be used as the reference sss in both runs the interannual variability of the temperature field in the upper ocean agrees well with that of the argo observation and the argo sss brings about little improvement to the temperature field discussion of fig 3 indicating that the variability of the temperature field is dominated by that of winds and heat fluxes on the other hand the inclusion of the argo sss does improve the subsurface salinity variability not only where the mixed layer is deep enough to reach the depth but also below the mixed layer in the tropics and subtropics figs 4 7 the interannual variability of the mixed layer is also improved in the subpolar north atlantic and near the northern bound of the acc fig 8 where sss tends to be more influential in determining sea surface density than in lower latitudes on the other hand the mixed layer depth is also improved where the influence of precipitation is significant fig 8 in the western tropical pacific where the so called barrier layer is reproduced when the argo sss is included and in the bay of bengal where precipitation is large to understand the reason for the improvements in subsurface salinity we next examined the difference field between the two runs the difference at fixed depths is dominated by small scale features due to the chaotic nature of eddies and nonlinear jets fig 10 the spiciness difference however reveals the advection of salinity signals fig 11 as expected from the upper ocean general circulation sss variability in the mixed layer is subducted into the pycnocline in subtropical regions where the ekman pumping is downward by definition this signal is advected downward equatorward and westward in the north or south equatorial current nec or sec of the pacific indian or atlantic oceans figs 12 and 13 in principle part of the subducted signal in the subtropical north pacific should enter the indian ocean through the indonesian seas but this potential propagation is not clear fig 12 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 chaotic responses in addition to small scale noise due changes in the phases of eddies there are streak like features in the difference field between the argo sss and ncep runs fig 10 these streaks are sometimes called zonal jets or striations nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 maximenko et al 2008 if they are wind forced responses qiu et al 2013 or they are anchored by coastal geometry or bottom topography it is possible that their locations are more or less fixed most of them are however probably a result of eddy mean flow interaction nakano and hasumi 2005 richards et al 2006 and hence their phases are random for this reason these streak like features in our difference fields fig 10 are likely just due to changes in phases of random variability and hence are not dynamically significant this noise makes it harder to trace advective signals section 3 2 and almost impossible to detect proper dynamical signals such as rossby waves an ensemble of runs would be necessary to improve the signal to noise ratio the difference between the ncep and argo sss runs is particularly large in and near strong jets right panels of fig 10 the annual mean zonal velocity in the kuroshio extension ke region averaged over the top 700 m is different by as much as 20 cm s 1 between the ncep and argo sss runs at several points in a coarse gridded 1 1 field during the last year of our model integrations not shown the spatial pattern of the difference is visually similar to those found between ensemble members by nonaka et al 2016 not shown this change may be of a different kind from the random shift of striations discussed above the ke is hypothesized to be a nonlinear dynamical system with multiple equilibria chao 1984 cessi and ierley 1995 if so a small kick of any kind can lead to an interannual to decadal change of the annual mean ke position shape and strength taguchi et al s 2007 analysis suggests that the decadal variability of the ke includes this type of oscillation it is not clear whether the ke change due to the sss interannual variability in our experiments is of this type 4 2 2 subpolar regions in subpolar regions except near iceland where the north atlantic subpolar mode water forms talley 1999 the interannual variability of subsurface salinity is not well correlated with the argo observation fig 4b and is improved very little by observed sss figs 4d and 5 this is likely because the subpolar region is characterized by upward ekman pumping and therefore sss cannot influence subsurface salinity locally through advection the subsurface salinity in subpolar regions is determined rather by upwelling long range horizontal isopycnal advection or horizontal and vertical mixing making it harder for the model to reproduce correctly the subpolar circulation is indeed complicated for example in the western north pacific subpolar gyre subsurface temperature and salinity are strongly affected by the advection of the warm and salty kuroshio water wagawa et al 2014 but the detailed flow field in this region is not very well reproduced in our ogcm not shown perhaps because some of the near surface currents are driven indirectly by eddies mitsudera et al 2017 submitted miyama et al 2017 submitted and the resolution of 0 1 is not sufficient for subpolar eddies where the first mode radius of deformation is 20 km chelton et al 1998 the north pacific subpolar region has another mechanism by which subsurface salinity is affected by sea surface conditions part of subpolar surface water enters the sea of okhotsk through gaps in the kuril island chain and becomes denser by surface cooling and brine rejection from sea ice formation to form the dense shelf water e g uehara et al 2014 and references therein it then sinks to the intermediate layer 300 1000 m and goes back to the north pacific through the gaps where it is partially mixed with lighter waters by strong tidal mixing nakamura et al 2004 2006 tanaka et al 2010 before spreading to the entire north pacific as the north pacific intermediate water npiw yasuda 1997 recent studies reported that changes in the north pacific moc are associated with significant subsurface salinity variability uehara et al 2014 matsuda et al 2015 nakanowatari et al 2015 in the subpolar ocean where density change is dominated by salinity change a slight change in salinity on an isopycnal surface leads to a large temperature change indeed large spiciness variability due to decadal scale latitudinal fluctuations of north pacific subarctic frontal zone is found in the ncep run and an ocean analysis data which contributes to upper ocean heat transport along the subpolar subtropical gyre boundary taguchi and schneider 2014 taguchi et al 2017 in our study we did not pay attention to the interannual variabilities of the subpolar north pacific moc because argo observation is lacking in the sea of okhotsk fig 1b hydrographic observation is indeed scarce there e g uehara et al 2014 the modeling of water exchange through the narrow gaps and strong tidal mixing there is also a challenge nakamura et al 2006 tanaka et al 2010 4 2 3 sss observation finally marginal seas where argo data is not available bring about some uncertainty for example we did not have argo sss in the indonesian seas since the vertical mixing in our model is very weak below the mixed layer section 2 their impacts are not likely to be significant on the pycnocline salinity in reality however vertical mixing is likely significant e g sprintall et al 2014 nagai and hibiya 2015 ray and susanto 2016 and if so the local sss should impact upon the pycnocline salinity it is also argued that sss within the indonesian seas directly affects the itf transport through pressure gradients it creates hu and sprintall 2016 the aquarius le vine et al 2015 and smos reul et al 2014 satellites would be helpful to mitigate this

manuscript we wish to acknowledge use of the ferret program for analysis and graphics in this paper ferret is a product of noaa s pacific marine environmental laboratory information is available at http ferret pmel noaa gov ferret appendix a the separation of salinity anomaly into its dynamical and spiciness components this appendix defines the separation of salinity anomaly into its dynamical and spiciness components more details of the separation are found in furue et al 2015 and the usefulness of spiciness anomaly in interpreting large scale variability in the thermocline is nicely summarized in the introduction of kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 this appendix also includes a very brief review of variant definitions of spiciness we use the most common straightforward traditional definition of spiciness which is simply the distribution of salinity or potential temperature on a single isopycnal potential density surface schneider 2000 doney et al 2003 yeager and large 2004 sasaki et al 2010 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 and many other papers that is spiciness is salinity as a function of potential density s ρ x y t where ρ is potential density and the other symbols are traditional if a reference state s o ρ r is defined a spiciness anomaly can be defined as δ s ρ r s ρ r s o ρ r where r x y t for convenience the symbol δ is introduced to indicate that the difference is taken at constant density not at constant depth in most past studies the reference state was a temporal average in contrast ours as well as furue et al s 2015 is a control run of the numerical model the spiciness can be related to the difference at constant depth by δ s z r s z r s o z r s ρ z r r s o ρ o z r r s ρ o z r r s ρ ρ o z r r δ ρ z r s o ρ o z r r δ s ρ o z r r δ s z r where s denotes the functional form of s in density coordinates when such distinction is necessary and δ s z r s ρ ρ o z r r δ ρ z r is the dynamical or heave component of the salinity difference e g doney et al 2003 schneider 2004 these components can be plotted either in depth or density coordinates using the coordinate transformation by ρ ρ o z r all above expressions hold if salinity is substituted with potential temperature there have been various formulations but the definition of the spiciness anomaly is essentially the same as that shown above in most past studies that use spiciness anomalies to interpret large scale variability in the main thermocline e g schneider 2000 doney et al 2003 yeager and large 2004 sasaki et al 2010 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 an interesting extension to the above spiciness anomaly is proposed by taguchi and schneider 2014 in the above the local at x y z t salinity change is interpreted as a superposition of isopycnal advection and a component due the vertical migration of isopycnal surfaces taguchi and schneider 2014 and taguchi et al 2017 separate it into isopycnal advection and a component due to the migration of the isopycnal in the direction of ρ o spiciness has also been discussed from another angle the water property is commonly characterized for each p by the pair t s but it is sometimes useful to describe the water property by a different pair ρ π where π is defined to be orthogonal to ρ e g stommel 1962 veronis 1972 huang 2011 the latter variable is spiciness see huang 2011 and mcdougall and krzysik 2015 and references therein for details spiciness behaves like a passive tracer e g stommel 1962 kolodziejczyk and gaillard 2012 and its anomaly is approximately governed by a 1 δ s t u o δ s δ u s o isopycnal and diapycnal diffusion where u is horizontal velocity denotes horizontal gradient in density coordinates and the subscript o denotes a reference state kilpatrick et al 2011 furue et al 2015 taguchi et al 2017 the spiciness and dynamical components are defined only where the isopycnal surface exists both in the reference state and in the state we focus on therefore neither component is defined where the isopycnal outcrops in one or both of the states note that the spiciness component of the salinity difference is approximately proportional to that of the temperature difference with a nearly constant coefficient of proportionality on the basis of the linearization of the equation of state around typical sst and sss values and a 0 3 of temperature anomaly corresponds to about 0 1 psu of salinity anomaly in the upper tropical and subtropical regions 
24133,the stability of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc in ocean models depends quite strongly on the model formulation especially the vertical mixing and whether it is coupled to an atmosphere model a hysteresis loop in amoc strength with respect to freshwater forcing has been found in several intermediate complexity climate models and in one fully coupled climate model that has very coarse resolution over 40 of modern climate models are in a bistable amoc state according to the very frequently used simple stability criterion which is based solely on the sign of the amoc freshwater transport across 33 s in a recent freshwater hosing experiment in a climate model with an eddy permitting ocean component the change in the gyre freshwater transport across 33 s is larger than the amoc freshwater transport change this casts very strong doubt on the usefulness of this simple amoc stability criterion if a climate model uses large surface flux adjustments then these adjustments can interfere with the atmosphere ocean feedbacks and strongly change the amoc stability properties amoc can be shut off for many hundreds of years in modern fully coupled climate models if the hosing or carbon dioxide forcing is strong enough however in one climate model the amoc recovers after between 1000 and 1400 years recent 1 increasing carbon dioxide runs and rcp8 5 future scenario runs have shown that the amoc reduction is smaller using an eddy resolving ocean component than in the comparable standard 1 ocean climate models 1 introduction buckley and marshall 2016 have recently written a comprehensive review of atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc observations inferences and mechanisms they include a brief discussion of amoc stability in climate models but a more in depth look is instructive in light of some recent modeling results and assumptions the first assumption is that a climate model s amoc is monostable or bistable depending solely on the sign of the amoc freshwater transport across 33 s monostable means that the only stable amoc configuration is a strong overturning in the north atlantic which extends into the south atlantic often called an amoc on state as in today s climate bistable means that in addition to this amoc on state there is a stable amoc off state in which there is a deep reverse cell in the tropical atlantic and very weak overturning in the north atlantic midlatitudes fig 1 a and b shows amoc on states from control runs of the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl r30 and cm2 1 climate models and fig 1 c and d shows typical amoc off states after 81 100 years of a strong north atlantic water hosing experiment this figure is from yin and stouffer 2007 which will be discussed at length in section 5 the second assumption is the use of climate models with a large surface freshwater flux adjustment to study amoc stability under the assumption that the flux adjustment is justified because it improves the upper ocean salinity distribution in the atlantic the third assumption is that the amoc on state is too stable in nearly all modern climate models where the atmosphere and ocean resolution is about 1 this paper is not a comprehensive review of the hundreds of papers on this subject but concentrates on papers that highlight important results with respect to the three assumptions outlined above 2 stability in ocean alone models the idea that the amoc could have more than one stable state started with the paper by stommel 1961 he used a simple two vessel experiment and showed that when the salinity restoring is very weak there can be two stable states the first has temperature mainly influencing the density and flow from one vessel to the other whereas the second has reverse flow between the vessels and salinity mainly influencing the density the first study of amoc stability in a numerical ocean model was by bryan 1986 he used a 3 75 latitude 4 5 longitude ocean sector model that spanned from pole to pole and boundary conditions of restoring on sea surface temperature sst but a virtual salt flux that is symmetric about the equator and independent of the ocean surface salinity he showed that the model has three equilibrium solutions one with the overturning symmetric about the equator and two mirror image pole to pole circulations with strong overturning in the different hemispheres the model went to these different stable states depending on the initial state of the surface salinity the bryan 1986 paper sparked many stability studies in ocean alone models such as weaver and sarachik 1991 this paper nicely shows that an amoc state which is stable using boundary conditions of restoring to both sst and surface salinity can become unstable under mixed boundary conditions which are restoring to sst but a fixed freshwater flux prange et al 2003 used a coarse resolution 3 5 3 5 model forced by mixed boundary conditions they used five different profiles of vertical mixing and showed that the amoc strength had a strong dependence on the vertical diffusivity chosen they also changed the advection scheme in their model and found that this could substantially change the amoc stability properties sijp and england 2006 used a 1 8 3 6 ocean model and showed that changing the vertical mixing only in the atlantic ocean or elsewhere could quite strongly affect the amoc stability properties more recently griffies et al 2009 and danabasoglu et al 2014 found that the amoc representation varied strongly in many different ocean components of climate models which were all forced using the same mixed boundary conditions in order to prevent a drift in the salinity distribution the forcing includes a weak restoring to surface salinity and the amoc maximum value depends quite strongly on the strength of this restoring term the conclusion from this section is that the amoc strength and its stability depend rather strongly on the ocean formulation especially the vertical mixing and the boundary conditions used to force ocean alone models 3 stability in coupled models manabe and stouffer 1988 were the first to find a bistable amoc state in a coupled model they used the same 3 75 4 5 global ocean model as bryan 1986 coupled to a coarse resolution atmosphere component and large flux adjustments the model has a stable amoc on state with strong overturning in the north atlantic however if they used a different initial condition then the model could maintain a stable amoc off steady state with very weak overturning in the north atlantic in a subsequent study using the same model manabe and stouffer 1999 showed that the amoc off state could be reached in a hosing experiment by imposing a large freshwater flux between 50 n 70 n in the atlantic and that the amoc off state remained stable for the remaining 7000 year run they then repeated this run with a larger value of the upper ocean vertical mixing and found that the amoc collapsed to an off state during the hosing but then slowly recovered to its original on state over the next 1500 years this again shows that amoc stability properties strongly depend on ocean vertical mixing values manabe and stouffer 1993 also used their same model when the carbon dioxide co2 level was increased by 1 per year for 140 years and then held constant at 4 times the original value the north atlantic amoc collapsed to an off state which persisted for the rest of the 500 year run however stouffer and manabe 2003 document that they later continued this run beyond year 500 after about 1500 years the north atlantic amoc did recover to its original on state which persisted for the remainder of the 5000 year run the reason was that the warming near the surface of the north atlantic diffused down slowly over the 1500 years so that the upper 2 3 km of the ocean became less stratified and deep water formation started up again these results raise an interesting question about timescales is the manabe and stouffer model bistable because it maintains an amoc off state for 1500 years or is it monostable because it eventually returns to a stable amoc on state i will use a strict definition here and say that this amoc off state is not a stable equilibrium this model was run for several thousand years which is long enough for the ocean to reach equilibrium however modern climate models are almost never run this long because of the computational expense and the runs tend to be shorter as the model resolution becomes finer if climate models are not run out to equilibrium this raises a potential mismatch between amoc stability properties in the climate models and those found in box models by their nature box models give the stability of equilibrium solutions whereas nearly all climate model runs do not represent equilibrium solutions modern climate models are usually called bistable if they maintain an amoc off state for a few hundred years but are not integrated long enough to see whether they would eventually return to a stable amoc on state as in stouffer and manabe 2003 however amoc being off for 1500 years is a very long time and this situation can certainly drastically change the earth s climate over that time period saravanan and mcwilliams 1995 coupled a two level atmosphere with simplified physical parameterizations to a zonally averaged sector ocean thermohaline model they compared amoc stability in the coupled model to the stability found when the same ocean model is forced by mixed boundary conditions they conclude mixed boundary conditions may enable ocean only models to capture the gross time averaged features of the corresponding coupled equilibria but they distort the stability characteristics of the equilibria bjornsson et al 1997 coupled an atmosphere energy moisture balance model to a zonally averaged ocean thermohaline model and compared the results with those from an ocean only model employing mixed boundary conditions their abstract states the authors conclude that due to the effects produced by the feedbacks in the coupled model they must have serious reservations about the results concerning long term climate variability obtained from ocean alone models rahmstorf et al 2005 show results from 11 coupled models of intermediate complexity often called emics which all have simplified atmosphere components so that an emic does not have all the feedbacks of a full climate model they show the amoc hysteresis curves when freshwater was added uniformly to the latitude band 20 n 50 n across the atlantic for positive freshwater forcing the amoc will collapse and remains small when the freshwater forcing is reversed until the forcing becomes negative forming a hysteresis loop in the amoc strength fig 2 is from rahmstorf et al 2005 and shows that all 11 models had a hysteresis loop in amoc when the freshwater forcing was varied fig 2 shows the width of the loop is larger in the models with a simplified ocean component than in the models which use a 3 d ocean component in contrast to these emics an amoc hysteresis loop has only been found in one fully coupled model this is documented in hawkins et al 2011 who used the famous model with very coarse resolution of 5 7 5 in the atmosphere and 2 5 3 75 in the ocean their fig 2 shows that the width of the hysteresis loop is much narrower than in the emic results shown in fig 2 jackson et al 2017 have very recently shown that the hysteresis loop in the famous model is even narrower if the hosing compensation is applied over the full ocean volume rather than just at the ocean surface note that existing computer power does not permit the large number of long integrations of a fine resolution climate model that are required to thoroughly check for hysteresis behavior the conclusion from this section is that the feedbacks contained in a fully coupled climate model frequently eliminate the stable amoc off state found in ocean alone models forced by mixed boundary conditions these feedbacks include the effects of sst and sea ice edge location on the atmosphere circulation which alters the surface winds and the heat and freshwater transports within the atmosphere which in turn affect the fluxes sea ice strongly reduces the fluxes into the ocean and increases the surface albedo which again changes the atmosphere circulation evaporation causes a latent heat flux which links the heat and freshwater fluxes and there is no restoring to surface salinity in a coupled model whereas ocean alone models usually use a weak restoring section 3 of griffies et al 2009 contains a fuller discussion of this topic 4 comments on the amoc bistability criterion rahmstorf 1996 shows results from a 4 box model and an ocean model coupled to an energy balance atmosphere he was the first to define the amoc bistability criterion as the sign of the amoc freshwater transport at the southern boundary of the atlantic ocean fot defined as 1 f o t v s d z s 0 where v is the zonally integrated baroclinic meridional velocity s is the zonally averaged salinity and s 0 is a reference salinity rahmstorf 1996 states that if fot is negative so that amoc is transporting freshwater southwards at 33 s then the freshwater forcing opposes the thermal driving and equilibria with and without north atlantic deep water formation exist the idea is that if fot is negative and amoc weakens then less freshwater is transported out of the basin making the atlantic fresher and amoc weakens further a positive feedback mechanism on amoc strength conversely if fot is positive then a weakened amoc will transport less freshwater into the basin making the atlantic saltier a negative feedback mechanism on amoc strength this criterion of a negative fot implying a bistable amoc whereas a positive fot implies a monostable amoc has since been very widely used to characterize amoc stability in a whole range of models for example huisman et al 2010 state in their abstract the sign of fot precisely shows whether this net anomalous freshwater transport is stabilizing or destabilizing the moc therefore it can indicate whether the moc is in a single or multiple equilibrium regime drijfhout et al 2011 state in their abstract apart from atmospheric feedbacks the sign of the salt flux into the atlantic basin that is carried by the moc determines whether the moc is in the single or multiple equilibria regime also deshayes et al 2013 document ocean hindcasts using a 1 12 model and their conclusion starts with all four eddy resolving simulations have an overturning freshwater transport negative on average suggesting the present day amoc is in the bistable regime in my opinion this criterion of diagnosing only the amoc freshwater transport can be misleading because it neglects other freshwater transport processes notably that by the gyre circulation the original rahmstorf 1996 paper points out that evaporation exceeds precipitation plus runoff over the tropical atlantic ocean so that the total freshwater transport at 33 s must be positive or northwards table 10 in talley 2008 suggests a value of 0 21 0 04 sv estimated from observations rahmstorf s fig 11 shows that if fot is negative but the total is positive then the gyre transport must be positive and larger than the amoc transport rahmstorf 1996 says the wind driven gyre transport is thus the largest term in the freshwater budget and balances not only the net freshwater loss from the atlantic basin through the atmosphere but also the additional freshwater export by the conveyor belt however using only the sign of fot as the stability criterion ignores changes in other processes including the gyre freshwater transport when amoc weakens or strengthens buckley and marshall 2016 state on page 21 that this assumption is questionable and some recent papers have shown that this assumption is wrong this has been demonstrated most clearly in a recent paper by mecking et al 2016 they show results from a version of hadgem3 that uses eddy permitting ocean resolution of 0 25 coupled to an atmosphere component with midlatitude resolution of 60 km the salinity in the upper 350 m is reduced by 0 6 psu in the arctic and atlantic north of 20 n which is an equivalent hosing of 10 sv every year for 10 years fig 3 is from mecking et al 2016 and shows the freshwater transport components in the atlantic from their control run the amoc transport fot which they label mov is negative throughout the atlantic including 33 s and agrees well with some estimates from observations the gyre transport maz is positive at 33 s and is larger than mov so that the total transport is positive as required the gyre transport is non negligible throughout the atlantic and dominates mov north of 45 n fig 4 is also from mecking et al 2016 and shows the changes in mov and maz compared to the control run averaged over years 311 410 after the hosing is stopped during which time the amoc remains in an off state changes in mov and maz are comparable in magnitude throughout the atlantic but at 33 s the change in maz is over twice as large as the change in mov note from fig 4 that the change in mov is mainly due to the change in velocity whereas the maz change is mainly due to the change in salinity mecking and drijfhout personal communication have shown that the changes in mov and maz are comparable throughout the atlantic at all times after the hosing is stopped and confirmed that the maz change is over twice the mov change at 33 s in years 11 110 as well as in years 311 410 shown in fig 4 therefore the assumption behind the simple stability criterion that other freshwater transport processes including the gyre transport do not change when amoc changes is clearly incorrect a good number of climate models have a positive fot and this has led some authors to write that climate models are biased in this regard hofmann and rahmstorf 2009 write however substantial evidence suggests that current models may be systematically too stable in that they are in a monostable regime far away from the threshold in contrast to what observational data suggest liu et al 2014 write in contrast sensitivity experiments in cgcms tend to show a monostable amoc stouffer et al 2006 indicating a model bias toward a monostable amoc tables 1 in weaver et al 2012 liu et al 2014 and mecking et al 2017 show that over 40 of the cmip5 climate models have a negative fot although most of these values are smaller than the negative value suggested by observations therefore it is certainly incorrect to say that climate models show a common bias toward a stable amoc with a single equilibrium as in liu et al 2017 weaver et al 2012 agree and write previous criticism regarding a tendancy for models to be overly stable appears not to be the case in the cmip5 models they show results from climate models using the strong rcp8 5 future forcing scenario the amoc reduces in all models but only collapses completely in one model which has a positive fot in all 10 models that have a negative fot possibly indicating a bistable regime the rcp8 5 forcing is not strong enough to collapse amoc completely liu and liu 2013 propose that an improved amoc bistability criterion is δmov which is the difference between the overturning freshwater transport at the southern and northern boundaries of the atlantic clearly the freshwater transport through fram strait the barents sea and the canadian archipeligo can affect the deepwater formation regions that strongly influence north atlantic amoc strength much more quickly than that entering the south atlantic table 1 in liu et al 2014 shows that in all 8 cmip4 models studied the overturning is transporting freshwater into the atlantic at the northern boundary and 6 of the model transport values are quite close to the 0 16 sv estimated from observations therefore in these climate models the largest difference in freshwater transport compared to observations is in the value of fot it would be interesting to know the value of the northern boundary overturning freshwater transport in all cmip5 models but as far as i am aware this has not been done in fact in most recent papers it is still fot rather than δmov which is quoted as the amoc bistability criterion 5 the dangers of using flux adjustments dijkstra and neelin 1999 study a zonally averaged ocean model of the thermohaline circulation forced by mixed boundary conditions they use a flux adjustment procedure to maintain a realistic amoc when parameters are changed which represents running a coarse resolution general circulation model with too large a viscosity or diffusivity this procedure produces an expanded multiple equilibria regime and their abstract states furthermore areas in parameter space exist with multiple equilibria in the flux corrected case that have a unique state in the uncorrected case care should thus be used in drawing conclusions on the existence of multiple equilibria and the stability of the thermohaline circulation when a flux correction procedure is used yin and stouffer 2007 compare a hosing experiment in two gfdl climate models the r30 has an atmosphere resolution of 2 25 3 75 and an ocean resolution of 2 25 1 875 and uses flux adjustments to maintain the modern day climate the cm2 1 has an atmosphere resolution of 2 2 5 and an ocean resolution of 1 and does not need any flux adjustments the hosing is a freshwater perturbation of 1 sv input uniformly over 50 n 70 n in the north atlantic for 100 years the hosing is then switched off and the models run for another 200 years in r30 the amoc collapses to the off state shown in fig 1c which persists for the remainder of the run in contrast in cm2 1 amoc collapses to the off state shown in fig 1d but then starts to recover and the maximum amoc has reached nearly 20 sv by year 300 which is near the cm2 1 control run average of 24 sv shown in fig 1b yin and stouffer 2007 perform a comprehensive and incisive analysis of why these two models show such different results they show that the weak reversed thermohaline circulation in the upper 1 km of the south atlantic and the enhanced antarctic bottom water cell below 3 km between the equator and 30 n shown in fig 1c and d are maintained over years 100 300 in r30 but they quickly reduce in strength after year 100 in the cm2 1 they conclude an additional factor which we find important in our analysis of the r30 results is the use of flux adjustments in this model due to the large flux adjustments employed by r30 the actual net surface water flux felt by the oceanic model is much smaller in r30 than in cm2 1 this leads to a much weaker oceanic freshwater transport and convergence necessary to stabilize the coupled system in r30 in this case a stable off state of the thc is much more easily obtained in contrast the pronounced net surface water flux in cm2 1 has to be totally compensated by oceanic processes only in other words it is the freshwater flux adjustment in r30 that maintains the amoc off state suggesting that amoc is bistable whereas cm2 1 with no flux adjustment suggests that amoc is monostable jackson 2013 shows results from the standard and flux adjusted versions of the hadcm3 climate model the atmosphere resolution is 2 5 3 75 and the ocean resolution is 1 25 1 25 the rationale for the flux adjusted version is to improve the atlantic surface salinity distribution and to change the sign of fot from positive in the standard version to negative in the flux adjusted version both versions are subjected to a hosing of 1 sv for 150 years over 50 n 70 n in the atlantic fig 5 is from jackson 2013 and shows the amoc in control and hosing runs from the two versions in the standard version amoc quickly starts to recover after the hosing is stopped by year 350 has recovered to stronger than in the control run and then slowly decays towards the control run value in contrast in the flux adjusted version amoc does not start to recover until year 300 and is only just returning to the control run value by year 750 thus amoc is less stable in the flux adjusted version than in the standard version jackson 2013 also shows similar results to the flux adjusted version when only the freshwater flux adjustment is applied liu et al 2017 show results from the standard and flux adjusted versions of the ccsm3 t31 3 climate model the atmosphere resolution is 3 75 3 75 and the ocean resolution is 3 3 fig 6 is from liu et al 2017 and shows the amoc in a control run and a continuation run after the co2 value has been instantaneously doubled in the standard version amoc reduces by about 4 sv but then slowly recovers towards the control run value in contrast in the flux adjusted version amoc collapses to 4 sv and stays at that low value for the remainder of the 1000 year run thus this shows an extreme change where amoc changes from monostable in the standard version to bistable in the flux adjusted version clearly the freshwater flux adjustment and the improved atlantic salinity distribution occur together so which of them is more important in affecting the amoc behavior the analysis of yin and stouffer 2007 discussed above clearly demonstrates that a large freshwater flux adjustment strongly changes amoc stability properties in a climate model therefore i think that there is much more evidence that the change in amoc stability shown in figs 5 and 6 is mostly caused by the flux adjustments imposed which strongly interfere with the stabilizing feedbacks between the atmosphere and ocean components therefore my conclusion from these results using standard and flux adjusted versions of the same model is that amoc stability conclusions from a climate model that uses large flux adjustments should be viewed with great suspicion 6 amoc collapse in modern climate models can a modern 1 climate model simulate an amoc collapse to a typical off state even though its bistability criterion says it is monostable the answer is yes if the perturbation is large enough the ccsm4 was forced by the rcp8 5 scenario from 2005 to 2300 by which time the co2 level is near 1960 ppm or about 5 times the 2005 level the run was then extended until 2600 with the co2 level constant and results are shown in jahn and holland 2013 and hu et al 2013 they show that the arctic becomes ice free defined as 106 km2 by 2300 and the antarctic becomes ice free by 2400 because the surface temperature in these regions has increased by 15 c deep water formation has ceased in the arctic and nordic seas and south of iceland fig 1 in hu et al 2013 shows the amoc maximum between 40 n 80 n as a function of time which reduces from 20 sv in 2005 to 3 sv in 2200 and remains 3 sv for the remainder of the run to 2600 an amoc collapse has also been documented in mecking et al 2016 which was discussed in section 4 they use a version of hadgem3 with eddy permitting ocean resolution of 0 25 the hosing is very large and is the equivalent of 10 sv every year for 10 years the amoc maximum reduces to 2 sv during the hosing and it remains shut off for the duration of the 450 year run this demonstrates that if modern climate models with non eddy resolving or eddy permitting resolution are given a very large perturbation then amoc can collapse and remain in an off state for several hundred years these two examples show this is true whether the simple stability criterion of the sign of fot at 33 s is monostable ccsm4 or bistable hadgem3 it would be very interesting to know whether the amoc in ccsm4 and hadgm3 would eventually recover after more than 1000 years as in the stouffer and manabe 2003 model very recent work by rind et al 2018 shows that amoc can recover after being collapsed for a very long time in a modern climate model they use the goddard institute for space studies e2 r model which has an atmosphere resolution of 2 2 5 and an ocean resolution of 1 1 25 and the version which has a calculated aerosol indirect effect tcadi fig 7 is from rind et al 2018 and shows the amoc when the co2 level is either abruptly set to 4 times the control run level upper panel or is kept at 4 times the control run level after 140 years of a 1 per year increasing co2 run lower panel in all three runs amoc collapses to an off state value of 5 sv after a few hundred years but then recovers to stronger than its control run value after between 1000 and 1400 years and eventually settles down to near the control run value of 22 sv rind et al 2018 show that amoc recovers because the high north atlantic warms at depth so that deep water formation there reactivates this is similar to the stouffer and manabe 2003 result and is the first case i know of where this occurs in a climate model without flux adjustments by my earlier strict definition this tacdi model does not have a stable amoc off state in fact i think it might be incorrect for a climate model to have a true long time stable amoc off state the reason is that there have been large freshwater perturbations in the north atlantic that can change amoc from a stable on state to an off state but it is more difficult to find large enough perturbations to return the climate from a truely stable amoc off state back to an amoc on state however weaver et al 2003 show that if the large meltwater pulse 1a is assumed to all come from antarctica ice melt then this freshwater input can return the university of victoria emic from a stable amoc off state back to an on state 7 results from eddy resolving climate models weijer et al 2012 perform hosing experiments when the freshwater input is confined to around the coast of greenland as well as across 50 n 70 n in the north atlantic they apply a hosing of 0 1 sv over 50 years in models where the ocean resolution is 0 1 and 1 their abstract states we find that the overall decline of the amoc on decadal time scales is quantitatively similar 10 in the two configurations nonetheless the transient response is significantly different as the amoc decline and reduction in wintertime convection is markedly more gradual and persistent in the strongly eddying configuration den toom et al 2014 use the same 0 1 and 1 models as weijer et al 2012 but use a five times stronger freshwater forcing around greenland their abstract states the freshwater input leads to a quantitatively comparable reduction of the overturning strength in the two models more recently there have been two comparisons that directly compare results using 0 1 and 1 ocean components of full climate models winton et al 2014 run 1 per year increasing co2 experiments using an atmosphere resolution of 0 5 and ocean resolution of 0 1 cm2 6 0 25 cm2 5 and 1 cm2 1 and in seven other gfdl climate models with 1 ocean resolution fig 8 is from winton et al 2014 and shows the reduction in amoc at co2 doubling compared to the control run value the amoc reductions in the higher resolution models cm2 5 and cm2 6 are 2 sv and 3 sv respectively although they both have a somewhat weak amoc in their control runs of 13 sv table 1 shows the percentage amoc reduction compared to the control run value and the ocean resolution for all 10 models shown in fig 8 it is clear that there is a rather wide range of percentage decreases in 1 models and that the decreases in the 0 25 cm2 5 and 0 1 cm2 6 models are smaller than in many of the 1 models small et al 2014 show results from a 100 year control run of a very high resolution version of the cesm1 which has 0 25 atmosphere and 0 1 ocean resolution very recently this model has been run between 2000 and 2050 forced by the rcp8 5 future scenario which started from year 50 of the control run fig 9 shows the maximum amoc from both the control and rcp8 5 runs there is quite large variability in this model and the amoc is generally increasing throughout the control run but that trend is weak over years 80 100 amoc increases for the first 13 years of the rcp8 5 run but then decreases for the remainder of the run to 2050 taking an average over the last 10 years of both runs gives amoc values of 26 2 sv and 22 8 sv so that the decline is 3 4 sv or 13 of the control run value fig 8 of meehl et al 2013 shows the amoc maximum in the standard 1 cesm1 version for several future scenarios including rcp8 5 the amoc decline at 2050 is 5 3 sv compared to 23 9 sv at 2000 a decline of 22 which is larger than in the very high resolution cesm1 version the winton et al 2014 and cesm1 results show there is quite a range of amoc declines in current climate models using 1 ocean resolution which indicates that ocean resolution is certainly not the dominant factor affecting amoc stability in addition they show that amoc declines using eddy resolving resolution of 0 1 are smaller than when using a 1 ocean with the same atmosphere model therefore i think that assuming amoc is more unstable in eddy resolving models using 0 1 compared to climate models using 1 ocean resolution is not justified 8 conclusions and discussion there are a number of conclusions that can be drawn from the results highlighted in this review 1 bistability in ocean alone models with mixed boundary conditions depends quite strongly on the model formulation especially the vertical mixing scheme 2 bistability is much reduced when going from ocean alone models to fully coupled climate models which have several more air sea interaction stabilizing feedbacks 3 bistability has been found in several emics which have reduced air sea interaction feedbacks and in one fully coupled climate model that has very coarse resolution 4 whether the amoc freshwater transport across 33 s is positive or negative is very frequently used as a criterion of whether a climate model s amoc is monostable or bistable however if the amoc freshwater transport is negative then the gyre freshwater transport must be positive and larger than the amoc transport because the total freshwater transport across 33 s must be positive a recent strong hosing experiment using an eddy permitting 1 4 ocean has shown that the gyre circulation freshwater transport change is comparable in magnitude to the amoc freshwater transport change throughout the atlantic and is larger at 33 s this casts very strong doubt on the usefulness of the simple amoc stability criterion which assumes that other freshwater transport processes including the gyre circulation do not change when amoc changes 5 three recent surveys of this simple amoc stability criterion show that over 40 of modern cmip5 climate models have a negative amoc freshwater transport across 33 s which possibly indicates a bistable state this is contrary to statements in two recent papers saying that nearly all climate models have a positive freshwater transport across 33 s possibly indicating a monostable state and therefore have a too stable amoc 6 in a flux adjusted climate model the adjustments interfere with the air sea interaction feedbacks and strongly change the amoc stability properties this has been shown in the gfdl r30 hadcm3 and ccsm3 t31 3 models i conclude that amoc stability results from a climate model that uses large flux adjustments should be viewed with great suspicion a flux adjusted model may be useful for short term predictions when an improved climate state is arguably more important than the air sea feedbacks but for amoc the opposite is true because the air sea feedbacks strongly affect its stability 7 amoc can be shut off for many hundreds of years in modern fully coupled climate models if the perturbation is large enough such as a very large increase in co2 or very strong hosing in the north atlantic this suggests that a model does not need a stable off state in order to have very long periods of weak amoc strength amoc can then potentially recover if deep water formation resumes in the labrador and nordic seas 8 recent 1 increasing co2 runs using a suite of gfdl models and rcp8 5 scenario runs in very high and standard resolution cesm1 versions have shown that the reduction in amoc is smaller using an eddy resolving 0 1 ocean than the standard 1 ocean resolution therefore assuming amoc is more unstable in eddy resolving models compared to standard 1 climate models is not justified in summary i think that obtaining the correct amoc stability in climate models is very subtle and tricky and is clearly not settled at this point modern 1 climate models show a wide range of amoc magnitudes in control runs and future declines when forced by the same increasing co2 scenario however recent evidence does not support statements that nearly all modern climate models have an amoc that is too stable a climate model does not need a stable amoc off state in order to simulate a rapid decline due to a large freshwater injection in the north atlantic followed by a long period of small amoc before it recovers and this cycle is very relevant on paleoclimate time scales i think the way forward must be to improve the atlantic salinity distribution which is indeed quite unrealistic in many climate models this can be achieved either by improving modern climate models or by using higher resolution than 1 and obtaining a much improved evaporation minus precipitation plus runoff distribution from the atmosphere component it is not clear to me that using ocean eddy resolving resolution is either required or optimal in the near future eddy length scales are partially resolved near the equator in 1 models especially those with finer meridional resolution there however the real problem is that eddy resolving resolution very strongly limits the length of coupled integrations runs of at least several hundred years if not a thousand years are required in order to make more reliable conclusions about amoc stability so that a resolution of near 0 5 in all components would allow adequately long runs in my opinion obtaining a realistic freshwater flux field from the atmosphere component is more important than higher ocean resolution in order to improve the atlantic ocean salinity distribution there is an excellent discussion on this topic in section 5 of mecking et al 2017 acknowledgments jianjun yin provided me with

24133,the stability of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc in ocean models depends quite strongly on the model formulation especially the vertical mixing and whether it is coupled to an atmosphere model a hysteresis loop in amoc strength with respect to freshwater forcing has been found in several intermediate complexity climate models and in one fully coupled climate model that has very coarse resolution over 40 of modern climate models are in a bistable amoc state according to the very frequently used simple stability criterion which is based solely on the sign of the amoc freshwater transport across 33 s in a recent freshwater hosing experiment in a climate model with an eddy permitting ocean component the change in the gyre freshwater transport across 33 s is larger than the amoc freshwater transport change this casts very strong doubt on the usefulness of this simple amoc stability criterion if a climate model uses large surface flux adjustments then these adjustments can interfere with the atmosphere ocean feedbacks and strongly change the amoc stability properties amoc can be shut off for many hundreds of years in modern fully coupled climate models if the hosing or carbon dioxide forcing is strong enough however in one climate model the amoc recovers after between 1000 and 1400 years recent 1 increasing carbon dioxide runs and rcp8 5 future scenario runs have shown that the amoc reduction is smaller using an eddy resolving ocean component than in the comparable standard 1 ocean climate models 1 introduction buckley and marshall 2016 have recently written a comprehensive review of atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc observations inferences and mechanisms they include a brief discussion of amoc stability in climate models but a more in depth look is instructive in light of some recent modeling results and assumptions the first assumption is that a climate model s amoc is monostable or bistable depending solely on the sign of the amoc freshwater transport across 33 s monostable means that the only stable amoc configuration is a strong overturning in the north atlantic which extends into the south atlantic often called an amoc on state as in today s climate bistable means that in addition to this amoc on state there is a stable amoc off state in which there is a deep reverse cell in the tropical atlantic and very weak overturning in the north atlantic midlatitudes fig 1 a and b shows amoc on states from control runs of the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl r30 and cm2 1 climate models and fig 1 c and d shows typical amoc off states after 81 100 years of a strong north atlantic water hosing experiment this figure is from yin and stouffer 2007 which will be discussed at length in section 5 the second assumption is the use of climate models with a large surface freshwater flux adjustment to study amoc stability under the assumption that the flux adjustment is justified because it improves the upper ocean salinity distribution in the atlantic the third assumption is that the amoc on state is too stable in nearly all modern climate models where the atmosphere and ocean resolution is about 1 this paper is not a comprehensive review of the hundreds of papers on this subject but concentrates on papers that highlight important results with respect to the three assumptions outlined above 2 stability in ocean alone models the idea that the amoc could have more than one stable state started with the paper by stommel 1961 he used a simple two vessel experiment and showed that when the salinity restoring is very weak there can be two stable states the first has temperature mainly influencing the density and flow from one vessel to the other whereas the second has reverse flow between the vessels and salinity mainly influencing the density the first study of amoc stability in a numerical ocean model was by bryan 1986 he used a 3 75 latitude 4 5 longitude ocean sector model that spanned from pole to pole and boundary conditions of restoring on sea surface temperature sst but a virtual salt flux that is symmetric about the equator and independent of the ocean surface salinity he showed that the model has three equilibrium solutions one with the overturning symmetric about the equator and two mirror image pole to pole circulations with strong overturning in the different hemispheres the model went to these different stable states depending on the initial state of the surface salinity the bryan 1986 paper sparked many stability studies in ocean alone models such as weaver and sarachik 1991 this paper nicely shows that an amoc state which is stable using boundary conditions of restoring to both sst and surface salinity can become unstable under mixed boundary conditions which are restoring to sst but a fixed freshwater flux prange et al 2003 used a coarse resolution 3 5 3 5 model forced by mixed boundary conditions they used five different profiles of vertical mixing and showed that the amoc strength had a strong dependence on the vertical diffusivity chosen they also changed the advection scheme in their model and found that this could substantially change the amoc stability properties sijp and england 2006 used a 1 8 3 6 ocean model and showed that changing the vertical mixing only in the atlantic ocean or elsewhere could quite strongly affect the amoc stability properties more recently griffies et al 2009 and danabasoglu et al 2014 found that the amoc representation varied strongly in many different ocean components of climate models which were all forced using the same mixed boundary conditions in order to prevent a drift in the salinity distribution the forcing includes a weak restoring to surface salinity and the amoc maximum value depends quite strongly on the strength of this restoring term the conclusion from this section is that the amoc strength and its stability depend rather strongly on the ocean formulation especially the vertical mixing and the boundary conditions used to force ocean alone models 3 stability in coupled models manabe and stouffer 1988 were the first to find a bistable amoc state in a coupled model they used the same 3 75 4 5 global ocean model as bryan 1986 coupled to a coarse resolution atmosphere component and large flux adjustments the model has a stable amoc on state with strong overturning in the north atlantic however if they used a different initial condition then the model could maintain a stable amoc off steady state with very weak overturning in the north atlantic in a subsequent study using the same model manabe and stouffer 1999 showed that the amoc off state could be reached in a hosing experiment by imposing a large freshwater flux between 50 n 70 n in the atlantic and that the amoc off state remained stable for the remaining 7000 year run they then repeated this run with a larger value of the upper ocean vertical mixing and found that the amoc collapsed to an off state during the hosing but then slowly recovered to its original on state over the next 1500 years this again shows that amoc stability properties strongly depend on ocean vertical mixing values manabe and stouffer 1993 also used their same model when the carbon dioxide co2 level was increased by 1 per year for 140 years and then held constant at 4 times the original value the north atlantic amoc collapsed to an off state which persisted for the rest of the 500 year run however stouffer and manabe 2003 document that they later continued this run beyond year 500 after about 1500 years the north atlantic amoc did recover to its original on state which persisted for the remainder of the 5000 year run the reason was that the warming near the surface of the north atlantic diffused down slowly over the 1500 years so that the upper 2 3 km of the ocean became less stratified and deep water formation started up again these results raise an interesting question about timescales is the manabe and stouffer model bistable because it maintains an amoc off state for 1500 years or is it monostable because it eventually returns to a stable amoc on state i will use a strict definition here and say that this amoc off state is not a stable equilibrium this model was run for several thousand years which is long enough for the ocean to reach equilibrium however modern climate models are almost never run this long because of the computational expense and the runs tend to be shorter as the model resolution becomes finer if climate models are not run out to equilibrium this raises a potential mismatch between amoc stability properties in the climate models and those found in box models by their nature box models give the stability of equilibrium solutions whereas nearly all climate model runs do not represent equilibrium solutions modern climate models are usually called bistable if they maintain an amoc off state for a few hundred years but are not integrated long enough to see whether they would eventually return to a stable amoc on state as in stouffer and manabe 2003 however amoc being off for 1500 years is a very long time and this situation can certainly drastically change the earth s climate over that time period saravanan and mcwilliams 1995 coupled a two level atmosphere with simplified physical parameterizations to a zonally averaged sector ocean thermohaline model they compared amoc stability in the coupled model to the stability found when the same ocean model is forced by mixed boundary conditions they conclude mixed boundary conditions may enable ocean only models to capture the gross time averaged features of the corresponding coupled equilibria but they distort the stability characteristics of the equilibria bjornsson et al 1997 coupled an atmosphere energy moisture balance model to a zonally averaged ocean thermohaline model and compared the results with those from an ocean only model employing mixed boundary conditions their abstract states the authors conclude that due to the effects produced by the feedbacks in the coupled model they must have serious reservations about the results concerning long term climate variability obtained from ocean alone models rahmstorf et al 2005 show results from 11 coupled models of intermediate complexity often called emics which all have simplified atmosphere components so that an emic does not have all the feedbacks of a full climate model they show the amoc hysteresis curves when freshwater was added uniformly to the latitude band 20 n 50 n across the atlantic for positive freshwater forcing the amoc will collapse and remains small when the freshwater forcing is reversed until the forcing becomes negative forming a hysteresis loop in the amoc strength fig 2 is from rahmstorf et al 2005 and shows that all 11 models had a hysteresis loop in amoc when the freshwater forcing was varied fig 2 shows the width of the loop is larger in the models with a simplified ocean component than in the models which use a 3 d ocean component in contrast to these emics an amoc hysteresis loop has only been found in one fully coupled model this is documented in hawkins et al 2011 who used the famous model with very coarse resolution of 5 7 5 in the atmosphere and 2 5 3 75 in the ocean their fig 2 shows that the width of the hysteresis loop is much narrower than in the emic results shown in fig 2 jackson et al 2017 have very recently shown that the hysteresis loop in the famous model is even narrower if the hosing compensation is applied over the full ocean volume rather than just at the ocean surface note that existing computer power does not permit the large number of long integrations of a fine resolution climate model that are required to thoroughly check for hysteresis behavior the conclusion from this section is that the feedbacks contained in a fully coupled climate model frequently eliminate the stable amoc off state found in ocean alone models forced by mixed boundary conditions these feedbacks include the effects of sst and sea ice edge location on the atmosphere circulation which alters the surface winds and the heat and freshwater transports within the atmosphere which in turn affect the fluxes sea ice strongly reduces the fluxes into the ocean and increases the surface albedo which again changes the atmosphere circulation evaporation causes a latent heat flux which links the heat and freshwater fluxes and there is no restoring to surface salinity in a coupled model whereas ocean alone models usually use a weak restoring section 3 of griffies et al 2009 contains a fuller discussion of this topic 4 comments on the amoc bistability criterion rahmstorf 1996 shows results from a 4 box model and an ocean model coupled to an energy balance atmosphere he was the first to define the amoc bistability criterion as the sign of the amoc freshwater transport at the southern boundary of the atlantic ocean fot defined as 1 f o t v s d z s 0 where v is the zonally integrated baroclinic meridional velocity s is the zonally averaged salinity and s 0 is a reference salinity rahmstorf 1996 states that if fot is negative so that amoc is transporting freshwater southwards at 33 s then the freshwater forcing opposes the thermal driving and equilibria with and without north atlantic deep water formation exist the idea is that if fot is negative and amoc weakens then less freshwater is transported out of the basin making the atlantic fresher and amoc weakens further a positive feedback mechanism on amoc strength conversely if fot is positive then a weakened amoc will transport less freshwater into the basin making the atlantic saltier a negative feedback mechanism on amoc strength this criterion of a negative fot implying a bistable amoc whereas a positive fot implies a monostable amoc has since been very widely used to characterize amoc stability in a whole range of models for example huisman et al 2010 state in their abstract the sign of fot precisely shows whether this net anomalous freshwater transport is stabilizing or destabilizing the moc therefore it can indicate whether the moc is in a single or multiple equilibrium regime drijfhout et al 2011 state in their abstract apart from atmospheric feedbacks the sign of the salt flux into the atlantic basin that is carried by the moc determines whether the moc is in the single or multiple equilibria regime also deshayes et al 2013 document ocean hindcasts using a 1 12 model and their conclusion starts with all four eddy resolving simulations have an overturning freshwater transport negative on average suggesting the present day amoc is in the bistable regime in my opinion this criterion of diagnosing only the amoc freshwater transport can be misleading because it neglects other freshwater transport processes notably that by the gyre circulation the original rahmstorf 1996 paper points out that evaporation exceeds precipitation plus runoff over the tropical atlantic ocean so that the total freshwater transport at 33 s must be positive or northwards table 10 in talley 2008 suggests a value of 0 21 0 04 sv estimated from observations rahmstorf s fig 11 shows that if fot is negative but the total is positive then the gyre transport must be positive and larger than the amoc transport rahmstorf 1996 says the wind driven gyre transport is thus the largest term in the freshwater budget and balances not only the net freshwater loss from the atlantic basin through the atmosphere but also the additional freshwater export by the conveyor belt however using only the sign of fot as the stability criterion ignores changes in other processes including the gyre freshwater transport when amoc weakens or strengthens buckley and marshall 2016 state on page 21 that this assumption is questionable and some recent papers have shown that this assumption is wrong this has been demonstrated most clearly in a recent paper by mecking et al 2016 they show results from a version of hadgem3 that uses eddy permitting ocean resolution of 0 25 coupled to an atmosphere component with midlatitude resolution of 60 km the salinity in the upper 350 m is reduced by 0 6 psu in the arctic and atlantic north of 20 n which is an equivalent hosing of 10 sv every year for 10 years fig 3 is from mecking et al 2016 and shows the freshwater transport components in the atlantic from their control run the amoc transport fot which they label mov is negative throughout the atlantic including 33 s and agrees well with some estimates from observations the gyre transport maz is positive at 33 s and is larger than mov so that the total transport is positive as required the gyre transport is non negligible throughout the atlantic and dominates mov north of 45 n fig 4 is also from mecking et al 2016 and shows the changes in mov and maz compared to the control run averaged over years 311 410 after the hosing is stopped during which time the amoc remains in an off state changes in mov and maz are comparable in magnitude throughout the atlantic but at 33 s the change in maz is over twice as large as the change in mov note from fig 4 that the change in mov is mainly due to the change in velocity whereas the maz change is mainly due to the change in salinity mecking and drijfhout personal communication have shown that the changes in mov and maz are comparable throughout the atlantic at all times after the hosing is stopped and confirmed that the maz change is over twice the mov change at 33 s in years 11 110 as well as in years 311 410 shown in fig 4 therefore the assumption behind the simple stability criterion that other freshwater transport processes including the gyre transport do not change when amoc changes is clearly incorrect a good number of climate models have a positive fot and this has led some authors to write that climate models are biased in this regard hofmann and rahmstorf 2009 write however substantial evidence suggests that current models may be systematically too stable in that they are in a monostable regime far away from the threshold in contrast to what observational data suggest liu et al 2014 write in contrast sensitivity experiments in cgcms tend to show a monostable amoc stouffer et al 2006 indicating a model bias toward a monostable amoc tables 1 in weaver et al 2012 liu et al 2014 and mecking et al 2017 show that over 40 of the cmip5 climate models have a negative fot although most of these values are smaller than the negative value suggested by observations therefore it is certainly incorrect to say that climate models show a common bias toward a stable amoc with a single equilibrium as in liu et al 2017 weaver et al 2012 agree and write previous criticism regarding a tendancy for models to be overly stable appears not to be the case in the cmip5 models they show results from climate models using the strong rcp8 5 future forcing scenario the amoc reduces in all models but only collapses completely in one model which has a positive fot in all 10 models that have a negative fot possibly indicating a bistable regime the rcp8 5 forcing is not strong enough to collapse amoc completely liu and liu 2013 propose that an improved amoc bistability criterion is δmov which is the difference between the overturning freshwater transport at the southern and northern boundaries of the atlantic clearly the freshwater transport through fram strait the barents sea and the canadian archipeligo can affect the deepwater formation regions that strongly influence north atlantic amoc strength much more quickly than that entering the south atlantic table 1 in liu et al 2014 shows that in all 8 cmip4 models studied the overturning is transporting freshwater into the atlantic at the northern boundary and 6 of the model transport values are quite close to the 0 16 sv estimated from observations therefore in these climate models the largest difference in freshwater transport compared to observations is in the value of fot it would be interesting to know the value of the northern boundary overturning freshwater transport in all cmip5 models but as far as i am aware this has not been done in fact in most recent papers it is still fot rather than δmov which is quoted as the amoc bistability criterion 5 the dangers of using flux adjustments dijkstra and neelin 1999 study a zonally averaged ocean model of the thermohaline circulation forced by mixed boundary conditions they use a flux adjustment procedure to maintain a realistic amoc when parameters are changed which represents running a coarse resolution general circulation model with too large a viscosity or diffusivity this procedure produces an expanded multiple equilibria regime and their abstract states furthermore areas in parameter space exist with multiple equilibria in the flux corrected case that have a unique state in the uncorrected case care should thus be used in drawing conclusions on the existence of multiple equilibria and the stability of the thermohaline circulation when a flux correction procedure is used yin and stouffer 2007 compare a hosing experiment in two gfdl climate models the r30 has an atmosphere resolution of 2 25 3 75 and an ocean resolution of 2 25 1 875 and uses flux adjustments to maintain the modern day climate the cm2 1 has an atmosphere resolution of 2 2 5 and an ocean resolution of 1 and does not need any flux adjustments the hosing is a freshwater perturbation of 1 sv input uniformly over 50 n 70 n in the north atlantic for 100 years the hosing is then switched off and the models run for another 200 years in r30 the amoc collapses to the off state shown in fig 1c which persists for the remainder of the run in contrast in cm2 1 amoc collapses to the off state shown in fig 1d but then starts to recover and the maximum amoc has reached nearly 20 sv by year 300 which is near the cm2 1 control run average of 24 sv shown in fig 1b yin and stouffer 2007 perform a comprehensive and incisive analysis of why these two models show such different results they show that the weak reversed thermohaline circulation in the upper 1 km of the south atlantic and the enhanced antarctic bottom water cell below 3 km between the equator and 30 n shown in fig 1c and d are maintained over years 100 300 in r30 but they quickly reduce in strength after year 100 in the cm2 1 they conclude an additional factor which we find important in our analysis of the r30 results is the use of flux adjustments in this model due to the large flux adjustments employed by r30 the actual net surface water flux felt by the oceanic model is much smaller in r30 than in cm2 1 this leads to a much weaker oceanic freshwater transport and convergence necessary to stabilize the coupled system in r30 in this case a stable off state of the thc is much more easily obtained in contrast the pronounced net surface water flux in cm2 1 has to be totally compensated by oceanic processes only in other words it is the freshwater flux adjustment in r30 that maintains the amoc off state suggesting that amoc is bistable whereas cm2 1 with no flux adjustment suggests that amoc is monostable jackson 2013 shows results from the standard and flux adjusted versions of the hadcm3 climate model the atmosphere resolution is 2 5 3 75 and the ocean resolution is 1 25 1 25 the rationale for the flux adjusted version is to improve the atlantic surface salinity distribution and to change the sign of fot from positive in the standard version to negative in the flux adjusted version both versions are subjected to a hosing of 1 sv for 150 years over 50 n 70 n in the atlantic fig 5 is from jackson 2013 and shows the amoc in control and hosing runs from the two versions in the standard version amoc quickly starts to recover after the hosing is stopped by year 350 has recovered to stronger than in the control run and then slowly decays towards the control run value in contrast in the flux adjusted version amoc does not start to recover until year 300 and is only just returning to the control run value by year 750 thus amoc is less stable in the flux adjusted version than in the standard version jackson 2013 also shows similar results to the flux adjusted version when only the freshwater flux adjustment is applied liu et al 2017 show results from the standard and flux adjusted versions of the ccsm3 t31 3 climate model the atmosphere resolution is 3 75 3 75 and the ocean resolution is 3 3 fig 6 is from liu et al 2017 and shows the amoc in a control run and a continuation run after the co2 value has been instantaneously doubled in the standard version amoc reduces by about 4 sv but then slowly recovers towards the control run value in contrast in the flux adjusted version amoc collapses to 4 sv and stays at that low value for the remainder of the 1000 year run thus this shows an extreme change where amoc changes from monostable in the standard version to bistable in the flux adjusted version clearly the freshwater flux adjustment and the improved atlantic salinity distribution occur together so which of them is more important in affecting the amoc behavior the analysis of yin and stouffer 2007 discussed above clearly demonstrates that a large freshwater flux adjustment strongly changes amoc stability properties in a climate model therefore i think that there is much more evidence that the change in amoc stability shown in figs 5 and 6 is mostly caused by the flux adjustments imposed which strongly interfere with the stabilizing feedbacks between the atmosphere and ocean components therefore my conclusion from these results using standard and flux adjusted versions of the same model is that amoc stability conclusions from a climate model that uses large flux adjustments should be viewed with great suspicion 6 amoc collapse in modern climate models can a modern 1 climate model simulate an amoc collapse to a typical off state even though its bistability criterion says it is monostable the answer is yes if the perturbation is large enough the ccsm4 was forced by the rcp8 5 scenario from 2005 to 2300 by which time the co2 level is near 1960 ppm or about 5 times the 2005 level the run was then extended until 2600 with the co2 level constant and results are shown in jahn and holland 2013 and hu et al 2013 they show that the arctic becomes ice free defined as 106 km2 by 2300 and the antarctic becomes ice free by 2400 because the surface temperature in these regions has increased by 15 c deep water formation has ceased in the arctic and nordic seas and south of iceland fig 1 in hu et al 2013 shows the amoc maximum between 40 n 80 n as a function of time which reduces from 20 sv in 2005 to 3 sv in 2200 and remains 3 sv for the remainder of the run to 2600 an amoc collapse has also been documented in mecking et al 2016 which was discussed in section 4 they use a version of hadgem3 with eddy permitting ocean resolution of 0 25 the hosing is very large and is the equivalent of 10 sv every year for 10 years the amoc maximum reduces to 2 sv during the hosing and it remains shut off for the duration of the 450 year run this demonstrates that if modern climate models with non eddy resolving or eddy permitting resolution are given a very large perturbation then amoc can collapse and remain in an off state for several hundred years these two examples show this is true whether the simple stability criterion of the sign of fot at 33 s is monostable ccsm4 or bistable hadgem3 it would be very interesting to know whether the amoc in ccsm4 and hadgm3 would eventually recover after more than 1000 years as in the stouffer and manabe 2003 model very recent work by rind et al 2018 shows that amoc can recover after being collapsed for a very long time in a modern climate model they use the goddard institute for space studies e2 r model which has an atmosphere resolution of 2 2 5 and an ocean resolution of 1 1 25 and the version which has a calculated aerosol indirect effect tcadi fig 7 is from rind et al 2018 and shows the amoc when the co2 level is either abruptly set to 4 times the control run level upper panel or is kept at 4 times the control run level after 140 years of a 1 per year increasing co2 run lower panel in all three runs amoc collapses to an off state value of 5 sv after a few hundred years but then recovers to stronger than its control run value after between 1000 and 1400 years and eventually settles down to near the control run value of 22 sv rind et al 2018 show that amoc recovers because the high north atlantic warms at depth so that deep water formation there reactivates this is similar to the stouffer and manabe 2003 result and is the first case i know of where this occurs in a climate model without flux adjustments by my earlier strict definition this tacdi model does not have a stable amoc off state in fact i think it might be incorrect for a climate model to have a true long time stable amoc off state the reason is that there have been large freshwater perturbations in the north atlantic that can change amoc from a stable on state to an off state but it is more difficult to find large enough perturbations to return the climate from a truely stable amoc off state back to an amoc on state however weaver et al 2003 show that if the large meltwater pulse 1a is assumed to all come from antarctica ice melt then this freshwater input can return the university of victoria emic from a stable amoc off state back to an on state 7 results from eddy resolving climate models weijer et al 2012 perform hosing experiments when the freshwater input is confined to around the coast of greenland as well as across 50 n 70 n in the north atlantic they apply a hosing of 0 1 sv over 50 years in models where the ocean resolution is 0 1 and 1 their abstract states we find that the overall decline of the amoc on decadal time scales is quantitatively similar 10 in the two configurations nonetheless the transient response is significantly different as the amoc decline and reduction in wintertime convection is markedly more gradual and persistent in the strongly eddying configuration den toom et al 2014 use the same 0 1 and 1 models as weijer et al 2012 but use a five times stronger freshwater forcing around greenland their abstract states the freshwater input leads to a quantitatively comparable reduction of the overturning strength in the two models more recently there have been two comparisons that directly compare results using 0 1 and 1 ocean components of full climate models winton et al 2014 run 1 per year increasing co2 experiments using an atmosphere resolution of 0 5 and ocean resolution of 0 1 cm2 6 0 25 cm2 5 and 1 cm2 1 and in seven other gfdl climate models with 1 ocean resolution fig 8 is from winton et al 2014 and shows the reduction in amoc at co2 doubling compared to the control run value the amoc reductions in the higher resolution models cm2 5 and cm2 6 are 2 sv and 3 sv respectively although they both have a somewhat weak amoc in their control runs of 13 sv table 1 shows the percentage amoc reduction compared to the control run value and the ocean resolution for all 10 models shown in fig 8 it is clear that there is a rather wide range of percentage decreases in 1 models and that the decreases in the 0 25 cm2 5 and 0 1 cm2 6 models are smaller than in many of the 1 models small et al 2014 show results from a 100 year control run of a very high resolution version of the cesm1 which has 0 25 atmosphere and 0 1 ocean resolution very recently this model has been run between 2000 and 2050 forced by the rcp8 5 future scenario which started from year 50 of the control run fig 9 shows the maximum amoc from both the control and rcp8 5 runs there is quite large variability in this model and the amoc is generally increasing throughout the control run but that trend is weak over years 80 100 amoc increases for the first 13 years of the rcp8 5 run but then decreases for the remainder of the run to 2050 taking an average over the last 10 years of both runs gives amoc values of 26 2 sv and 22 8 sv so that the decline is 3 4 sv or 13 of the control run value fig 8 of meehl et al 2013 shows the amoc maximum in the standard 1 cesm1 version for several future scenarios including rcp8 5 the amoc decline at 2050 is 5 3 sv compared to 23 9 sv at 2000 a decline of 22 which is larger than in the very high resolution cesm1 version the winton et al 2014 and cesm1 results show there is quite a range of amoc declines in current climate models using 1 ocean resolution which indicates that ocean resolution is certainly not the dominant factor affecting amoc stability in addition they show that amoc declines using eddy resolving resolution of 0 1 are smaller than when using a 1 ocean with the same atmosphere model therefore i think that assuming amoc is more unstable in eddy resolving models using 0 1 compared to climate models using 1 ocean resolution is not justified 8 conclusions and discussion there are a number of conclusions that can be drawn from the results highlighted in this review 1 bistability in ocean alone models with mixed boundary conditions depends quite strongly on the model formulation especially the vertical mixing scheme 2 bistability is much reduced when going from ocean alone models to fully coupled climate models which have several more air sea interaction stabilizing feedbacks 3 bistability has been found in several emics which have reduced air sea interaction feedbacks and in one fully coupled climate model that has very coarse resolution 4 whether the amoc freshwater transport across 33 s is positive or negative is very frequently used as a criterion of whether a climate model s amoc is monostable or bistable however if the amoc freshwater transport is negative then the gyre freshwater transport must be positive and larger than the amoc transport because the total freshwater transport across 33 s must be positive a recent strong hosing experiment using an eddy permitting 1 4 ocean has shown that the gyre circulation freshwater transport change is comparable in magnitude to the amoc freshwater transport change throughout the atlantic and is larger at 33 s this casts very strong doubt on the usefulness of the simple amoc stability criterion which assumes that other freshwater transport processes including the gyre circulation do not change when amoc changes 5 three recent surveys of this simple amoc stability criterion show that over 40 of modern cmip5 climate models have a negative amoc freshwater transport across 33 s which possibly indicates a bistable state this is contrary to statements in two recent papers saying that nearly all climate models have a positive freshwater transport across 33 s possibly indicating a monostable state and therefore have a too stable amoc 6 in a flux adjusted climate model the adjustments interfere with the air sea interaction feedbacks and strongly change the amoc stability properties this has been shown in the gfdl r30 hadcm3 and ccsm3 t31 3 models i conclude that amoc stability results from a climate model that uses large flux adjustments should be viewed with great suspicion a flux adjusted model may be useful for short term predictions when an improved climate state is arguably more important than the air sea feedbacks but for amoc the opposite is true because the air sea feedbacks strongly affect its stability 7 amoc can be shut off for many hundreds of years in modern fully coupled climate models if the perturbation is large enough such as a very large increase in co2 or very strong hosing in the north atlantic this suggests that a model does not need a stable off state in order to have very long periods of weak amoc strength amoc can then potentially recover if deep water formation resumes in the labrador and nordic seas 8 recent 1 increasing co2 runs using a suite of gfdl models and rcp8 5 scenario runs in very high and standard resolution cesm1 versions have shown that the reduction in amoc is smaller using an eddy resolving 0 1 ocean than the standard 1 ocean resolution therefore assuming amoc is more unstable in eddy resolving models compared to standard 1 climate models is not justified in summary i think that obtaining the correct amoc stability in climate models is very subtle and tricky and is clearly not settled at this point modern 1 climate models show a wide range of amoc magnitudes in control runs and future declines when forced by the same increasing co2 scenario however recent evidence does not support statements that nearly all modern climate models have an amoc that is too stable a climate model does not need a stable amoc off state in order to simulate a rapid decline due to a large freshwater injection in the north atlantic followed by a long period of small amoc before it recovers and this cycle is very relevant on paleoclimate time scales i think the way forward must be to improve the atlantic salinity distribution which is indeed quite unrealistic in many climate models this can be achieved either by improving modern climate models or by using higher resolution than 1 and obtaining a much improved evaporation minus precipitation plus runoff distribution from the atmosphere component it is not clear to me that using ocean eddy resolving resolution is either required or optimal in the near future eddy length scales are partially resolved near the equator in 1 models especially those with finer meridional resolution there however the real problem is that eddy resolving resolution very strongly limits the length of coupled integrations runs of at least several hundred years if not a thousand years are required in order to make more reliable conclusions about amoc stability so that a resolution of near 0 5 in all components would allow adequately long runs in my opinion obtaining a realistic freshwater flux field from the atmosphere component is more important than higher ocean resolution in order to improve the atlantic ocean salinity distribution there is an excellent discussion on this topic in section 5 of mecking et al 2017 acknowledgments jianjun yin provided me with

24134,we apply the unstructured grid hydrodynamic model suntans to investigate the internal wave dynamics around scott reef western australia an isolated coral reef atoll located on the edge of the continental shelf in water depths of 500 m and more the atoll is subject to strong semi diurnal tidal forcing and consists of two relatively shallow lagoons separated by a 500 m deep 2 km wide and 15 km long channel we focus on the dynamics in this channel as the internal tide driven flow and resulting mixing is thought to be a key mechanism controlling heat and nutrient fluxes into the reef lagoons we use an unstructured grid to discretise the domain and capture both the complex topography and the range of internal wave length scales in the channel flow the model internal wave field shows super tidal frequency lee waves generated by the combination of the steep channel topography and strong tidal flow we evaluate the model performance using observations of velocity and temperature from two through water column moorings in the channel separating the two reefs three different global ocean state estimate datasets global hycom csiro bluelink csiro climatology atlas were used to provide the model initial and boundary conditions and the model outputs from each were evaluated against the field observations the scenario incorporating the csiro bluelink data performed best in terms of through water column murphy skill scores of water temperature and eastward velocity variability in the channel the model captures the observed vertical structure of the tidal m 2 and super tidal m 4 frequency temperature and velocity oscillations the model also predicts the direction and magnitude of the m 2 internal tide energy flux an energy analysis reveals a net convergence of the m 2 energy flux and a divergence of the m 4 energy flux in the channel indicating the channel is a region of either energy transfer to higher frequencies or energy loss to dissipation this conclusion is supported by the mooring observations that reveal high frequency lee waves breaking on the turning phase of the tide keywords internal tides unstructured grid topography 1 introduction topographic internal wave generation occurs at length scales ranging from o 0 1 100 km important parameters that influence the type of internal wave response include the tidal excursion ratio the ratio of the internal wave characteristic slope to topographic slope and the topographic froude number legg and klymak see e g 2008 winters and armi see e g 2013 in regions where these parameters are all of order one nonlinear effects due to advection influence the generation process lee waves characterized by higher frequency harmonics form when internal wave generation is affected by barotropic advection bell 1975 these transient lee waves formed by oscillatory flow are referred to as tidal lee waves in the literature nakamura and awaji 2001 other phenomena including transient hydraulic jumps and internal wave breaking have been observed in locations such as the hawaiian ridge alford et al 2014 the luzon strait buijsman et al 2012 and the mendocino escarpment musgrave et al 2016 coral atolls and island chains along continental slopes fall within this regime of the flow parameter space a regime where vertical mixing is likely to be enhanced and in turn can have a strong influence on the local ecology e g gove et al 2016 three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans ocean models in island regions must therefore resolve the wide range of topographic length scales to adequately capture the internal wave generation process the models also need to capture the larger scale background forcing processes such as the shelf scale barotropic and baroclinic internal tides plus the regional mesoscale circulation rans models that employ an unstructured grid discretization are particularly suitable for this task furthermore island atolls are often steep sided with topographic gradients as large as 50 meaning that models using sigma coordinate vertical discretization have strict horizontal resolution requirements due to pressure gradient calculation issues see e g shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 modeling the time varying flow of the tidally driven stratified flow around and through the channel at the steep sided scott reef atoll system is the focus of this paper the key differences between scott reef and other channel sites such as at the mouth of an estuary or an ocean strait are that the reef is located in the open ocean the water column is continuously stratified and as opposed to forcing from a horizontal density gradient a large amplitude barotropic tide drives an unsteady flow through this channel at scott reef the tidal excursion distance is comparable to the length scale of the channel to model these processes one must capture the shelf scale circulation the tidal forcing and the internal tides while also resolving all the topographic length scales of interest the long term motivation here is to understand the internal wave driven vertical mixing near coral reef systems that are particularly sensitive to ocean warming caused by climate change hughes et al 2017 identifying topographically induced mixing processes will help identify regions within a reef that are less susceptible to surface warming because cooler water can be lifted from depth to mix with warm surface waters a first step is to model the transfer of the internal tide energy into higher frequencies and wavenumbers that are more conducive to dissipation and small scale mixing the next step and beyond the scope here is to quantify the mixing rates associated with the breaking of the internal waves e g sarkar and scotti 2017 in section 2 of this paper we give an overview of the study region and present the numerical model setup procedure in section 3 we present a quantitative comparison between the numerical model and the through water column mooring observations collected during a field experiment in april 2015 a description of the internal tide dynamics in the channel is then presented in section 4 along with model estimates of the internal wave energy generated by the island topography we conclude with a brief discussion of the dynamics and overview of the model performance 2 methods 2 1 study site scott reef is an island atoll reef system lying on the edge of the continental shelf in water depths of 500 m see fig 1 it is one of several offshore reef systems along the shelf edge of the australian north west shelf timor sea region the reefs have continued to grow despite being situated on a subsiding shelf collins and testa 2010 the topography of scott reef consists of two near circular reefs north and south scott reef with dimensions 38 km from north to south and 28 km from east to west south scott reef the larger of the two reefs has a deep lagoon with an average depth of 40 m which is open along its northern side the two reefs are separated by a 500 m deep channel approximately 15 km in length from east to west and 2 km wide at its narrowest point corals in the lagoons were affected during both the 1998 and 2016 global bleaching events gilmour et al 2013 hughes et al 2017 respectively rayson et al 2011 used a 2 km resolution roms model with a smoothed representation of scott reef to study the regional dynamics around the reef the oceanography of the region is dominated by a strong semi diurnal m 2 and s 2 tide with a tidal range at scott reef of 4 m the semi diurnal barotropic tidal currents on the shelf around the reef are in the range of 0 15 0 20 m s 1 at the 500 m isobath in rayson et al 2011 field measurements and numerical modeling revealed the presence of an energetic internal tide on the surrounding continental shelf and on the outer flanks of the reef the important geometric parameters of the channel are the length l depth h x and the width at both the surface b 0 x and through the water column b x z representative values for h and l are 450 m and 15 km respectively and the bottom slopes down at the western entrance fig 2a the width at the surface b 0 x varies between 2 and 6 km with the narrowest section located between easting 379 and 382 km the channel width varies with depth and can be approximated by a parabolic profile in the main contraction and by a rectangular like profile towards the entrances fig 2b the width of the channel is asymmetric with b 0 x diverging more rapidly at the eastern exit than at the western exit b 0 x 1 0 and 0 4 respectively the channel bends at the point of maximum contraction with a radius of curvature r 5 km curvature effects may also contribute to the mixing in the channel although they are not the primary focus here see e g edwards et al 2004 a preview of the isotherm displacement and along channel velocity from the suntans model is shown in fig 2c lee waves are evident in the eastern divergent section of the channel at around easting 385 km the internal froude number f r n u c n where u is the maximum barotropic velocity from the model and cn is the internal wave phase speed of mode n gill 1982 is shown as a function of distance along the channel in fig 2d the second baroclinic mode transitions from super critical fr 2 1 to sub critical fr 2 1 near the tidal lee wave generation region indicating that trapping of mode two waves is likely and hydraulic effects are important much of the focus for the rest of the paper is on the tidal lee wave evolution process and model data comparison in this particular region 2 2 field observations two moorings were deployed in the channel during a research cruise in april 2015 aboard the rv falkor operated by the schmidt ocean institute these measurements were taken in conjunction with other bio physical measurements around scott reef as part of a broader study to understand the connections between the physical processes and the ecosystem dynamics of australia s northern reef systems the two moorings were positioned near the 400 m and 200 m isobaths labelled scr400 and scr200 respectively in fig 1 the mooring locations were chosen based on the most energetic regions identified using an earlier version of the suntans model described here rayson 2012 we are now using the observations to evaluate the model performance and characterise the internal waves in the channel this is the first paper to show this set of observations the scr400 mooring consisted of 19 temperature instruments seabird electronics sbe56 39 and 37 six pressure instruments sbe39p and 37 and two conductivity sbe37 sensors velocity in the lower 200 m was measured with a downward looking rdi 75 khz long ranger adcp and velocity in the upper 170 m was measured with an upward looking rdi 300 khz workhorse adcp this adcp configuration was chosen to maximize flotation in the upper section of the mooring as the long ranger was buoy mounted the scr200 mooring was positioned 500 m south of scr400 on the edge of the channel where the side wall slope gradient was roughly 25 this mooring consisted of four pressure 11 temperature and two conductivity sensors and velocity was measured with an upward looking rdi 150 khz quartermaster moored 4 m above the seabed pressure was recorded at several fixed seabed locations around the lagoon using a rbr solo instrument although we have used one scr2e as a reference water level station at peak flows the very strong currents in excess of 1 5 m s 1 knocked the scr400 mooring down by up to 100 m we evaluated the vertical displacement via pressure measurements at six locations from 20 m below the surface to 100 m above the seabed using these six pressure measurements the temperature observations were then mapped onto a lagrangian vertical coordinate adcp measurements were omitted from the analyses when the instrument tilt due to knockdown was greater than 20 knockdown was less severe at the scr200 mooring although peak currents during ebb tides westward flow led to some loss of velocity data 2 3 numerical model setup we used the suntans hydrodynamic model code described in fringer et al 2006 for the present study suntans solves the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations on an unstructured horizontal domain and fixed z level vertical domain using a finite volume finite difference discretization a semi implicit time stepping scheme is used to update the free surface efficiently and high order flux limiting schemes are used for tracer advection the model can solve the full vertical momentum equation and hence the nonhydrostatic pressure although this was not necessary for the horizontal grid scale of the present application suntans has been used for various hydrodynamic studies of estuarine circulation e g rayson et al 2015 holleman et al 2013 wang et al 2011 and internal waves e g zhang et al 2011 kang and fringer 2012 other than these examples there are few regional unstructured grid modeling studies for this type of realistic shelf scale application in the literature 2 3 1 model grid the suntans unstructured mesh used in this study is shown in fig 3 the mesh was composed of n sided mainly hexagonal cells here we will refer to this mesh as the hexagonal or hex mesh although strictly speaking the grid was also composed of other n sided polygons wolfram and fringer 2013 showed that non triangular meshes reduce numerical error in the horizontal divergence calculation in unstructured finite volume models using an arakawa c grid the reduction in horizontal divergence error in turn reduces vertical velocity errors rayson et al 2015 used a mixed triangular quadrilateral grid in an estuarine application and showed better skill than a comparable triangle only grid this is the first published study using an n sided grid with the suntans model although the los alamos mpas ocean model now routinely uses this type of grid ringler et al 2013 the triangular dual grid was first constructed using the tom triangular paving algorithm described in holleman et al 2013 the hexagonal mesh was then generated by taking the dual of the triangular mesh i e nodes of the triangular grid became cell centres of the hex mesh and vice versa see fig 3d as an example inputs into the triangular grid generation code include a boundary polygon and a series of spatial lines that specify the target grid resolution in different parts of the domain using these inputs tom generates a near perfect orthogonal unstructured mesh that smoothly transitions between regions of different resolution with a specified maximum stretching rate we used a rate of 3 the geometric and topological properties of the resultant grid make it numerically efficient and stable for the finite volume formulation used in suntans the horizontal resolution the distance between cell centres transitioned from roughly 5000 m at the open boundary down to 100 m around scott reef itself fig 3 the inter tidal reef platforms on north and south scott reef were masked out and used as an internal land boundary to avoid the numerical issues associated with free surface wetting and drying the final hexagonal mesh consisted of 82 164 total horizontal cells with 165 753 nodes the triangular dual mesh had this many cells the vertical coordinate was discretised using 100 fixed z layers with a resolution δz 7 m at the surface that increased by a stretching factor r 1 034 down to the maximum depth roughly 5500 m the approximate vertical resolution at 400 m where the deepest observations were located was roughly 20 m the 3d model domain consisted of 2 150 409 total grid cells 2 3 2 bathymetry bathymetry data for the region was sourced from a geoscience australia ga gridded 250 m dataset 2009 that covered the entire region an incomplete geoscience australia gridded 50 m multibeam dataset and a 10 m resolution blended multibeam and lidar dataset provided by woodside energy ltd that spanned scott reef but little of the surrounding shelf we merged the different datasets by first mapping onto the ga 250 m resolution base grid using an averaging technique to blend the scattered data onto each grid point the 10 m and 50 m multibeam lidar datasets were then merged together on the same grid by filling the 50 m multibeam data into points where there was no 10 m data this dataset was then merged into the original ga 250 m grid by iteratively smoothing a 6 5 km buffer region where the datasets intersected we interpolated the merged dataset onto the suntans unstructured grid using a curvature minimizing interpolation method a simple gaussian filter was applied to remove any grid scale noise introduced by the interpolation scheme figs 1 and 3 b show contours of the actual model bathymetry it is clear that the steep bathymetry around scott reef with slope gradients up to 50 was well resolved by the model since suntans is a z level model it should be emphasized that little topographic smoothing was required to avoid the pressure gradient errors endemic to sigma coordinate ocean models 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions we are interested in the channel dynamics because it will influence the transport of tracers around the reef however we are also interested in the longer term transport as the vertical density temperature and salinity stratification influences internal wave generation and propagation we tested three different background ocean state temperature salinity velocity estimates for the suntans initial and boundary conditions namely the 1 12 global hycom ncoda ocean reanalysis chassignet et al 2007 the bluelink reanalysis bran 2016 version oke et al 2013 and the csiro atlas of regional seas cars climatological dataset ridgway et al 2002 both hycom and bran are data assimilating global ocean reanalysis datasets although the bran model is focused on the australian region cars is a regional temperature and salinity climatology derived from least squares fitting the mean plus annual and semi annual harmonics to ocean profile observations onto a constant 3d grid we applied a bias correction to the cars initial and boundary conditions by offsetting the estimate for april 2015 using temperature observations from the scr400 mooring daily averaged salinity and temperature which varied in space and time were interpolated from each of these data sets onto the suntans grid cells for use as initial and boundary conditions velocity data from the bran and hycom models was used to force the open boundaries only only salinity and temperature are available from the cars data so boundary velocities were set to zero for this particular scenario the initial free surface and velocity was set to zero for all cases barotropic tidal velocity and free surface boundary conditions were derived from the tpxov7 2 global tide solution egbert and erofeeva 2002 time varying velocities and free surface elevations were reconstructed from eight tidal constituents namely m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 at the suntans open boundary edges tidal fluxes were added to the low frequency open boundary velocities interpolated from the hycom and bran solutions boundary condition data in suntans is either specified as a flux along the boundary edges or by specifying the free surface directly in the boundary cell centres these are referred to as edge based or cell based open boundary types respectively tracer concentrations are then specified at either cell edges or centres based on the boundary type edge based boundary types are able to force meso scale ocean features such as coastal currents at the boundary although they suffer the limitation of not allowing one to specify the free surface directly it is therefore difficult to maintain an equilibrium free surface with only edge based boundaries due to drift in the total volume of the domain conversely the free surface may be specified at cell based boundary types but not the momentum flux as a workaround we used mainly edge based boundary types for most of the domain and then used roughly ten cell based boundaries close to the shoreline this method allowed the free surface to maintain a zero mean height we also used a sponge condition numerically implemented as an internal momentum sink to reduce the reflection of baroclinic waves from the boundary as described in zhang et al 2011 2 3 4 atmospheric forcing and boundary parameterisations atmospheric data from the era interim product provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecast dee et al 2011 was used to drive the exchange of momentum and heat between the atmosphere and the model ocean era interim is a global data assimilating atmospheric hindcast model run on a roughly 100 km grid with output data stored at six hourly time steps air sea fluxes were parameterised in suntans using the coare3 0 algorithm fairall and bradley 2003 using east and north wind velocity air temperature pressure and relative humidity net longwave and shortwave radiation components were calculated internally within the model using cloud cover from the era interim data see rayson et al 2015 for a description of the numerical implementation of the heat flux module into suntans a constant albedo was assumed 0 06 and the light extinction depth for shortwave radiation penetration was set spatially constant to 20 m a log law drag condition was used to parameterise stress at the bottom boundary with a constant roughness length scale z 0 2 10 3 m vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity terms were computed using the mellor yamada 2 5 turbulence closure model mellor and yamada 1982 2 3 5 run time the model was setup to run for 21 days from 9 to 30 april 2015 to cover the observation period 12 to 27 april and therefore at least one spring neap tidal period the first three model days spin up the surface and internal tides for the domain and were discarded as previously mentioned three scenarios were run with either hycom bran or cars initial and boundary conditions the model time step was 4 s simulations were run on 8 compute nodes of a cray cluster where each node has 2x 12 core intel xeon e5 2690 haswell chips 192 total cores communication between nodes was via a cray high speed low latency aries interconnection wall clock times for this configuration were roughly 18 hours for a total of 3456 cpu hours 3 model validation modeled quantities xmod from the three different runs hycom forced bran forced and cars forced were compared against observed quanities xobs using the root mean squared error rmse 1 r m s e 1 n x o b s x m o d 2 bias mean error 2 b i a s 1 n x m o d x o b s and the skill score murphy 1988 3 s k i l l 1 x m o d x o b s 2 x o b s x o b s 2 a skill score of unity indicates a perfect match while anywhere between zero and one indicates that the model error is less than the observed variance note the murphy skill score can be negative if the mean square error is greater than the observed variance these metrics particularly the skill allow us to quantitatively determine the most suitable choice of initial and boundary condition data 3 1 sea surface height sea surface height variations at scott reef site 2e over the study period for the bran forced scenario are shown in fig 4 neap tides were between april 13 and 15 2015 and peak spring tides were between april 20 and 22 2015 when the tidal range was 4 m tides on the kimberley shelf were dominated by semidiurnal components although a diurnal inequality was evident during spring tides fig 4 a all model runs showed good agreement between the observed sea surface heights although only the bran forced scenario is shown in fig 4 skill 0 96 rmse 0 17 m spring neap variability and phasing of the tides were all replicated by the model the maximum error was roughly 0 3 m as shown in fig 4c free surface predictions were largely insensitive to the initial condition because the tidal forcing was dominant 3 2 water temperature water temperature at the scr400 mooring from the bran forced model scenario and the observations are shown for the 15 day observation window in fig 5 isotherm displacements peaked during spring tides with peak to trough amplitudes up to 100 m a second non sinusoidal peak that dropped rapidly at peak flood tide reminiscent of a transient internal hydraulic jump was observed each tidal cycle higher frequency oscillations also occurred during spring tides and were particularly apparent on the 15 and 18 c isotherms fig 5c vertical displacement of the 15 c isotherm about its mean value is shown in fig 6 for both the bran forced model and the observations the 15 c isotherm was chosen as it was roughly mid water column where the vertical displacement amplitude was largest the model captured the phase of the two peaks during each tidal cycle although the model perturbations were biased towards a positive displacement while the observations showed a larger downward displacement differences in model and observed isotherm displacements could possibly be explained by differences in the actual background stratification see below displacement power spectral density estimates for the 15 c isotherm are shown in fig 6 peaks at the semi diurnal forcing frequency and several higher harmonics were observed the model captured these peaks however the energy between the dominant frequency bands was generally lower in the model the slope of the spectrum for higher frequencies was similar for both the model and observations and was generally proportional to ω 2 fig 6b the model spectrum rolled off more sharply at frequencies beyond 6 10 3 s 1 roughly coinciding with the horizontal wavelengths of a few horizontal grid cells i e the maximum wavenumber resolvable by the numerical grid fig 7 shows the temperature validation metrics in 25 m vertical bins at both scr200 and scr400 for all three model scenarios the hycom forced scenario performed poorest particularly at depths greater than 150 m with a warm bias of roughly 2 c and the worst skill at both moorings fig 7d and h the bias corrected cars forced scenario performed best with 1 c bias and skill 0 5 at all depths and at both sites the bran forced scenario performed similarly to the cars scenario except at 50 100 m depth where there was a 1 5 c warm bias at both moorings 3 3 along channel velocity along channel velocity at both moorings were vertically interpolated onto fixed depth levels for direct comparison with the model example time series of the measured and the bran forced modeled along channel velocity at six depths are shown fig 8 during flood tides the velocity magnitudes were up to 1 5 m s 1 positive along channel velocity and stronger in the lower 150 m in the upper 150 m the magnitude was approximately half the magnitude seen in the bottom layer there was also a phase difference between the upper and lower layers with the peak bottom jet layer preceding the upper layer velocity peak by about two hours peak ebb westward velocities were not as well resolved due to mooring knockdown during this phase of the tide velocity temperature contour plots at both moorings for a four day period during spring tides are shown in fig 9 the near bed jet was not evident at the 200 m mooring indicating it was confined to the centre region of the channel away from the wall the strongest baroclinic shear occurred during the flood ebb transition period when the current was negative below 100 m and positive above isopycnals also began upwelling during this phase of the tide fig 9 shows that this process was at least qualitatively captured by the bran forced model a similar structure was also captured by the other model scenarios not shown fig 10 shows the total barotropic plus baroclinic along channel velocity validation metrics in 25 m vertical bins the bran forced scenario performed best based on all metrics maximum along channel mean current at scr400 was roughly 0 1 m s 1 near the bed at scr400 and 0 12 m s 1 near the bed at scr200 although the mean flow was in the same direction at the corresponding depth between the two moorings it was roughly double in magnitude at scr200 the bran forced scenario best captured this mean profile at both sites which was reflected by a lower bias fig 7b and f at scr200 and scr400 respectively skill scores from all scenarios were largest near the bed at both sites skill 0 8 and got worse towards the surface both hycom and bran forced scenarios had similar rmse and skill scores at both sites with the latter performing slightly better the cars forced scenario performed considerably poorer for all velocity comparison metrics this suggests that other factors such as large scale temperature gradients not properly captured by the cars dataset contributed to model performance another possible reason is that the initial ocean state from cars was not dynamically balanced and we gave it insufficient time to spin up based on these results we only consider the bran forced scenario for further model analysis of the dynamics 3 4 harmonic analysis higher harmonic internal waves are generated in regions with large topographic excursion ratios bell 1975 nakamura and awaji 2001 we apply harmonic analysis to calculate the energy in the semidiurnal forcing frequency and its first few harmonics m 4 and m 6 to quantify the importance of these higher frequency waves to the overall energy budget we performed a harmonic fit on each of the model variables such that 4 ϕ x y z t m ϕ m x y z exp i ω m t where ϕ is any of the model variables e g u or t and ϕ m is the complex amplitude of the constituent number m due to the dominance of the semidiurnal tide at scott reef we limit our analysis to the primary forcing frequency and its first two harmonics i e m 2 m 4 and m 6 constituents during a spring tide period 17 21 april 2015 nonstationarity in the internal wave amplitude due to the nonlinear relationship between wave generation and tidal forcing limits the utility of harmonic decomposition over longer time periods see e g rayson 2012 the harmonic fields then have the form 5 ϕ ϕ m 2 ϕ m 4 ϕ m 6 e i ω t e i 2 ω t e i 3 ω t t the coefficient of determination r 2 between the best fit and the time series from both the observations and the model was used as a metric to determine the suitability of the harmonic analysis here r 2 indicates the fraction of variance explained by the harmonic fit and is given by the ratio of the variance of the harmonic signal to the original signal the variance explained by a particular frequency is given by 6 r n 2 1 2 ϕ n 2 ϕ 2 where ϕ n is the harmonic amplitude ϕ 2 is the input signal variance either model or observation and n is the frequency of choice model performance was assessed using the harmonic rmse e g rayson et al 2011 kang and fringer 2012 7 r m s e 0 5 a o 2 a m 2 a o a m cos g o g m 1 2 where ao and am are the harmonic amplitudes of the observed and modeled quantities respectively while go and gm are the respective phase values in order to analyse the mooring data we mapped the velocity and temperature observations onto a fixed vertical coordinate z level with 10 m spacing using linear interpolation temporal gaps due to mooring knockdown were then omitted from the least squares harmonic fitting procedure the suntans data was vertically interpolated onto the same vertical coordinate for consistency examples of harmonic tidal semidiurnal ellipse amplitudes extracted from the 3d numerical solution are shown in fig 11 to highlight the effect of topography on the spatial and depth variability of the tidal currents barotropic plus baroclinic the magnitude of the surface semidiurnal currents peaked at roughly 1 0 m s 1 along the northern entrance to south scott reef and in the two channels into north scott reef large amplitude regions were also present along the northern and south western flanks of the reef the dominant semidiurnal ellipse at 300 m depth was in the channel separating north and south scott reef peaking at roughly 1 2 m s 1 fig 11b this was the region where the strong jet and high frequency internal lee waves were observed in the mooring data the harmonic analysis revealed the vertical structure of the oscillatory along channel velocity and temperature perturbations as shown in fig 12 there was a peak in the semi diurnal along channel velocity component between 200 and 350 m deep with the model in good agreement with the observations tidal rmse 0 10 m s 1 fig 12c the model performed worse higher in the velocity amplitude profiles tidal rmse 0 2 0 3 m s 1 although the general shape of the profiles were similar more than 90 of the velocity variance was explained by the harmonic fit yet only roughly 5 of the variance was ascribed to the higher harmonics for both the observed and modeled velocity fig 12b eq 6 although the m 4 frequency velocity perturbations were roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the m 2 frequency they were similar in magnitude to the mean flow the observed semidiurnal temperature oscillations peaked at 1 5 c between 75 m and 150 m below the surface fig 12d model results exhibited a similar vertical structure although the peak was 2 5 c and the maximum tidal rmse calculated using eq 7 was 0 8 c at this depth fig 12f note that more of the modeled temperature variance was captured by the harmonic fit with r 2 0 95 at 100 m depth versus r 2 0 75 for the observations fig 12e this indicates that it was likely that more of the observed temperature variance was spread in frequency bands around m 2 as is also shown in fig 6b finally less than 50 of the temperature variance was explained by the harmonic fit in both the model and observations below 300 m depth indicating non oscillatory processes in that region higher harmonic temperature oscillations particularly the m 4 harmonic were significant in the channel m 4 frequency temperature oscillations peaked at 1 0 c between 150 and 200 m below the surface with the model in approximate agreement fig 12d note that almost 50 of the temperature variance calculated using eq 6 was explained by the m 4 m 6 harmonics in the model and 30 in the observations fig 12e the amplitudes of the m 2 and m 4 harmonics were approximately equal at 200 m depth close to the mean depth of the 15 c isotherm m 6 oscillations not shown were generally an order of magnitude smaller harmonic velocity and temperature profiles had a similar shape at the scr200 mooring fig 13 the m 4 amplitude temperature oscillations were similar in magnitude to the scr400 mooring and peaked at 150 m below the surface a key difference between the 200 m and 400 m mooring was a smaller peak velocity of 0 4 0 5 m s 1 at the scr200 mooring note the bottom intensified jet started at roughly 200 m depth at scr400 model error was slightly less at the 200 m mooring for both harmonics of velocity and temperature fig 13c and f respectively the m 4 frequency temperature oscillations and the bottom intensified jet were a signature of the lee wave evolution process 4 internal tide dynamics in the channel 4 1 along channel flow a sequence of vertical slices of the model velocity and density fields along the 400 m contour of the channel revealed the formation and evolution of tidal lee waves into a transient internal hydraulic jump over one tidal cycle fig 14 the upper panel shows a time series at the scr400 mooring to place the vertical slices in the context of fig 9b during the flood phase the channel shape forced an increase in the horizontal velocity in the convergent section easting 378 km and a decrease in the divergent section easting 383 km of the channel figure 14 b c in the main convergent section easting 378 383 km the flow accelerated and the isopycnals between 150 and 300 m depth were drawn down while below 300 m the isopycnals were displaced upwards thus creating a mode two vertical structure the mode two internal froude number transitioned from super to sub critical in this region during this stage of the tide indicating likely trapping of mode two internal waves fig 2d the along channel velocity was greatest in this section and the vertical profile defined the bottom intensified jet observed at the scr400 mooring in the divergent section of the channel between easting 383 and 385 km the flow then decelerated and the isopycnals returned sharply to their mean position as an internal hydraulic jump fig 14d e the local vertical displacement of the isopycnals was approximately 50 m and the horizontal length scale of this jump feature was approximately 4 km vertical shear was greatest at the mooring location during the flood ebb transition phase as the transient jump began to propagate back into the channel fig 14e f observations indicated that internal wave breaking indicated by large amplitude isopycnal overturns also occurred at this site during this phase of the tide see fig 5c similar to the response at the eastern end of the channel during flood tide a jump formed at the western end of the channel during ebb tide fig 14h at easting 375 km this jump was located higher in the water column 50 300 m than the jump at the eastern end the differences in the flow response at the eastern and western ends of the channel were likely due to the asymmetry in the variation of width and depth either side of the point of maximum contraction see fig 2b at scr400 for example high vertical shear did not occur on the ebb flood phase like it did on the flood ebb phase 4 2 energetics we used the harmonically decomposed velocity and density fields to calculate the baroclinic energy density e j m 2 at both the forcing frequency m 2 and at the first two harmonics m 4 m 6 using a similar method to that outlined in rayson et al 2012 the time averaged depth integrated internal wave energy density in harmonic form is 8 e m e k m e p m where 9 e k m ℜ ρ 0 4 h 0 u m 2 v m 2 w m 2 d z is the kinetic energy at frequency m u m v m w m are the complex harmonic amplitudes of each baroclinic velocity component an overbar indicates depth integration and the angle brackets indicate a time average operator 10 e p m ℜ ρ 0 4 h 0 b m 2 n 2 d z is the linear available potential energy at a particular harmonic ape 3 using the definition of kang and fringer 2010 b m ρ m g ρ 0 is the buoyancy perturbation at the harmonic and n is the buoyancy frequency the baroclinic energy flux vector is then 11 f m ℜ ρ 0 2 h 0 u m p m d z w m 1 where u m u m u is the complex baroclinic velocity and p m z 0 b m d z is the complex conjugate of the baroclinic pressure perturbation the barotropic velocity amplitude u was calculated by depth averaging the total velocity amplitude the steady state tidally averaged baroclinic kinetic energy equation in harmonic form is 12 h f m n l m n c m d i s s m n where h x y cm is the barotropic to baroclinic conversion 13 c m ℜ 1 2 u m h p m h nlmn are the nonlinear advection terms and dissmn are the dissipation terms the nonlinear and dissipative terms in the internal wave energy equation are presented in kang and fringer 2012 and it is beyond the scope of this paper to derive their harmonic equivalents time dependent residual terms arise after time averaging the flux and conversion terms when two frequencies interact that are non integer multiples of one another i e non harmonic tidal constituents such as m 2 and k 1 energy transfer between different harmonics indicated by the mn subscript only occur in the nonlinear and dissipative terms we approximate the forcing in this region as a single semidiurnal frequency so that we may assume steady state which is only reasonable for periods of several days beyond which the contributions from other frequencies are important the purpose here is to show that there was a significant contribution to the energy flux divergence from the higher harmonics that was linked to the tidal lee wave evolution we calculate the energy terms in eqs 9 and 11 for the mooring data using the harmonic velocity and temperature terms from section 3 4 vertical integrals were computed by extrapolating the closest velocity and temperature perturbations to the surface and seabed respectively a nonlinear equation of state using constant salinity 34 6 psu was used to convert observed temperature to buoyancy perturbations both observed and model energy quantities were computed on the same vertical grid for consistency depth integrated energy density eq 9 and the eastward energy flux eq 11 at the scr400 mooring are listed in table 1 the semidiurnal model total energy density was roughly 35 less than observed although both were of order 10 kj m 2 the m 4 frequency energy was roughly three times smaller in the model than the observations and both the model and observed energy densities were around an order of magnitude less than the semidiurnal component observed semidiurnal eastward along channel energy fluxes were roughly 11 kw m 1 and the model captured the direction although it was 15 weaker than the observations the m 4 flux component was in poorer agreement the sign was opposite although as we show below there was considerable spatial variability in the m 4 flux divergence in this section of the channel where the moorings were located meaning that a small change in position could change the sign of the m 4 energy flux the m 2 component energy density was larger in the model at the scr200 mooring 4550 and 2020 j m 2 for the model and observations respectively the m 4 component was still roughly twice as energetic in the observations eastward m 2 fluxes were significantly weaker than at the scr400 mooring with modeled and observed components of 3 and 1 5 kw m 1 respectively while uncertainties in the energy and flux estimates due to depth and time gaps may contribute to some error the model appeared to capture the direction magnitude and relative contributions from higher harmonics at this site spatial variation of the internal wave energy density with flux vectors overlaid for the forcing frequency and its first harmonic are shown in fig 15 the largest semidiurnal energy density was 15 20 kj m 2 in the main section of the channel and along the southern flank of scott reef fig 15a the m 4 energy density was roughly five times smaller than the main forcing frequency fig 15b the area averaged m 2 and m 4 energy density was 4 8 and 0 9 kj m 2 respectively there was however higher intensity m 4 peaks of 2 kj m 2 at either end of the channel i e at easting 370 378 and 383 390 km this coincided with the regions where tidal lee waves formed and propagated back into the channel fig 14d the horizontal energy flux divergence from eq 12 is shown for the channel region in fig 16 and area integrated flux divergence and barotropic to baroclinic conversion eq 13 are shown in table 2 the m 2 frequency flux vectors were divergent along the southern flank indicating wave generation and convergent within the channel indicated by a negative sign the channel separating north and scott reef was a region of net m 2 energy convergence 2 7 mw and net m 4 divergence 6 5 mw net barotropic to baroclinic conversion rates in the corresponding region were 15 and 0 6 mw for the m 2 and m 4 frequencies respectively m 2 frequency internal tide energy was therefore being lost in the channel and little of the converted energy was leaving the region as the m 4 divergence greatly exceeded the conversion we conclude that some of the energy at this harmonic was transferred directly from the forcing frequency via nonlinear interactions i e advection of waves by barotropic or baroclinic currents note that spurious m 4 energy can arise due to the tidal advection of freely propagating waves observed in an eulerian frame see e g pinkel 2008 stephenson et al 2016 stephenson et al 2016 show that harmonic filtering under predicts the primary frequency m 2 amplitude of a low mode internal wave subject to a maximum internal froude number of 0 5 by 20 30 the first harmonic m 4 is over predicts by a corresponding amount if tidal advection is important frn 1 then a lagrangian analysis of the harmonics is necessary to separate the freely propagating waves from the advected signal e g musgrave et al 2016 nagai et al 2015 shakespeare and hogg 2017 this method would be necessary to exactly balance an internal tide energy equation in frequency form however based on the past studies with a similar vertical wavenumber and froude number parameter space we expect that tidal advection will only modify the total m 4 energy density by a small amount furthermore given the m 4 signal was 5 10 times more energetic in the channel we conclude that this was predominantly the result of tidal lee waves 5 discussion a number of the flow features observed and captured by the 3d model were qualitatively similar to flows over two dimensional sills e g klymak et al 2010 winters and armi 2013 for a 2d sill part of the flow is blocked below the crest and a fast flowing layer or jet forms above the crest to compensate for this blockage at depth the blocked layer depth is proportional to u 0 n gill 1982 baines 1995 both steady klymak et al 2010 and unsteady winters and armi 2013 2d numerical simulations show that a bottom intensified jet forms in the initial lee wave development stage close to the topographic crest klymak et al 2010 show that the vertical scale of the jet increases with the topographic froude number f r t n h m u 0 where hm is the obstacle height therefore low mode lee waves form when the topographic height is much larger than the blocking depth at scott reef the jet height or thickness was roughly 150 m and the wave response is considered to be low mode mode one or two but as the flow was controlled by a contraction it is difficult to define an equivalent scale to hm to compare with the 2d case in a contraction with no sill or other three dimensional topography only part of the flow is blocked close to the channel edges yet the flow along the thalweg is unimpeded by topography it is this effective blocking near the sloped walls causing the flow to be deflected toward the thalweg instead of going up slope that likely causes the near bed jet this is the dividing streamline concept in 3d flows see e g castro et al 1983 snyder et al 1985 castro et al 1983 and others show that for a steady adiabatic flow the position of the dividing streamline can be calculated based on energy conservation layers where the flow has insufficient kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy necessary to lift the fluid over the topography will instead deflect around the topography and form a jet castro et al 1983 show experimentally that lee waves and overturns then form downstream qualitatively similar to our observations although the dividing streamline conceptually explains the formation of the bottom jet at scott reef idealised modeling is necessary to determine the dependence of the jet height internal wave mode on the topographic geometry as well as the effects of unsteady forcing and turbulent dissipation that are important in the present application 6 summary and conclusions we have demonstrated how high frequency internal lee waves were generated at steep island topography using a z level unstructured grid rans model driven by realistic forcing and validated using ocean mooring observations the focus was on a spring neap tidal period in april 2015 when moored observations were collected although the model could potentially be used for longer term predictions as it was one way nested within different global circulation models or climatological datasets as well as the tpxo tidal model and surface heat and momentum fluxes specified from a global atmospheric reanalysis model era interim a hex dominant unstructured mesh was used to resolve the island topography down to 100 m scale while alleviating the horizontal divergence calculation errors associated with triangular arakawa c grid finite volume models see e g wolfram and fringer 2013 the z level vertical discretization was necessary due to the very steep island atoll bathymetry with bottom slopes of up to 50 we compared three different scenarios each forced with different initial and boundary conditions and concluded that the bran forced scenario performed best in terms of all validation metrics for both water temperature and along channel velocity this scenario had a lower temperature bias than the hycom forced scenario in this region and captured the velocity variability better than a scenario initialized with the cars climatological data the bran forced scenario was weakest at about the 100 m depth in the peak thermocline region with a 1 5 c bias inaccurate description of mixing in the thermocline driven by internal tide induced processes was possibly a cause of the bias in both global models as they do not include tides and are too coarse to resolve the internal tides in detail insufficient observational coverage in the region was also a challenge observations revealed an oscillatory bottom intensified jet intensifying with the tidal forcing amplitude in the 500 m deep channel separating the two reef atolls isotherm oscillations at twice the dominant semidiurnal forcing frequency were observed in the same region in addition to the longer wave length internal tide our model was able to capture these dominant and key flow features in the channel the 3d model revealed that m 4 and higher frequency oscillations were formed in the lee of a transient hydraulic jump in the divergent section of the channel see fig 14 we interpret these high frequency oscillations as topographic lee waves an energetics analysis of the model output revealed a net convergence of internal tide m 2 frequency energy in the channel and a net divergence of higher frequency energy based on the harmonic energy density calculated from both the observations and the model table 1 roughly 10 of the internal tide energy was transferred to higher frequencies in particular the m 4 frequency this energy transfer is a direct mechanism for energy cascade to higher harmonics with shorter wave lengths that were steeper and therefore more likely to break the observations indicated the topographic lee waves eventually broke on the turn of the tide leading to large scale overturning events see e g fig 5c around 2015 04 19 12 00 the grid scale required to capture this breaking process was beyond the resolution of our rans model although the model was able to reproduce the larger scale conditions that led to these events i e the tidal lee wave formation

24134,we apply the unstructured grid hydrodynamic model suntans to investigate the internal wave dynamics around scott reef western australia an isolated coral reef atoll located on the edge of the continental shelf in water depths of 500 m and more the atoll is subject to strong semi diurnal tidal forcing and consists of two relatively shallow lagoons separated by a 500 m deep 2 km wide and 15 km long channel we focus on the dynamics in this channel as the internal tide driven flow and resulting mixing is thought to be a key mechanism controlling heat and nutrient fluxes into the reef lagoons we use an unstructured grid to discretise the domain and capture both the complex topography and the range of internal wave length scales in the channel flow the model internal wave field shows super tidal frequency lee waves generated by the combination of the steep channel topography and strong tidal flow we evaluate the model performance using observations of velocity and temperature from two through water column moorings in the channel separating the two reefs three different global ocean state estimate datasets global hycom csiro bluelink csiro climatology atlas were used to provide the model initial and boundary conditions and the model outputs from each were evaluated against the field observations the scenario incorporating the csiro bluelink data performed best in terms of through water column murphy skill scores of water temperature and eastward velocity variability in the channel the model captures the observed vertical structure of the tidal m 2 and super tidal m 4 frequency temperature and velocity oscillations the model also predicts the direction and magnitude of the m 2 internal tide energy flux an energy analysis reveals a net convergence of the m 2 energy flux and a divergence of the m 4 energy flux in the channel indicating the channel is a region of either energy transfer to higher frequencies or energy loss to dissipation this conclusion is supported by the mooring observations that reveal high frequency lee waves breaking on the turning phase of the tide keywords internal tides unstructured grid topography 1 introduction topographic internal wave generation occurs at length scales ranging from o 0 1 100 km important parameters that influence the type of internal wave response include the tidal excursion ratio the ratio of the internal wave characteristic slope to topographic slope and the topographic froude number legg and klymak see e g 2008 winters and armi see e g 2013 in regions where these parameters are all of order one nonlinear effects due to advection influence the generation process lee waves characterized by higher frequency harmonics form when internal wave generation is affected by barotropic advection bell 1975 these transient lee waves formed by oscillatory flow are referred to as tidal lee waves in the literature nakamura and awaji 2001 other phenomena including transient hydraulic jumps and internal wave breaking have been observed in locations such as the hawaiian ridge alford et al 2014 the luzon strait buijsman et al 2012 and the mendocino escarpment musgrave et al 2016 coral atolls and island chains along continental slopes fall within this regime of the flow parameter space a regime where vertical mixing is likely to be enhanced and in turn can have a strong influence on the local ecology e g gove et al 2016 three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans ocean models in island regions must therefore resolve the wide range of topographic length scales to adequately capture the internal wave generation process the models also need to capture the larger scale background forcing processes such as the shelf scale barotropic and baroclinic internal tides plus the regional mesoscale circulation rans models that employ an unstructured grid discretization are particularly suitable for this task furthermore island atolls are often steep sided with topographic gradients as large as 50 meaning that models using sigma coordinate vertical discretization have strict horizontal resolution requirements due to pressure gradient calculation issues see e g shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 modeling the time varying flow of the tidally driven stratified flow around and through the channel at the steep sided scott reef atoll system is the focus of this paper the key differences between scott reef and other channel sites such as at the mouth of an estuary or an ocean strait are that the reef is located in the open ocean the water column is continuously stratified and as opposed to forcing from a horizontal density gradient a large amplitude barotropic tide drives an unsteady flow through this channel at scott reef the tidal excursion distance is comparable to the length scale of the channel to model these processes one must capture the shelf scale circulation the tidal forcing and the internal tides while also resolving all the topographic length scales of interest the long term motivation here is to understand the internal wave driven vertical mixing near coral reef systems that are particularly sensitive to ocean warming caused by climate change hughes et al 2017 identifying topographically induced mixing processes will help identify regions within a reef that are less susceptible to surface warming because cooler water can be lifted from depth to mix with warm surface waters a first step is to model the transfer of the internal tide energy into higher frequencies and wavenumbers that are more conducive to dissipation and small scale mixing the next step and beyond the scope here is to quantify the mixing rates associated with the breaking of the internal waves e g sarkar and scotti 2017 in section 2 of this paper we give an overview of the study region and present the numerical model setup procedure in section 3 we present a quantitative comparison between the numerical model and the through water column mooring observations collected during a field experiment in april 2015 a description of the internal tide dynamics in the channel is then presented in section 4 along with model estimates of the internal wave energy generated by the island topography we conclude with a brief discussion of the dynamics and overview of the model performance 2 methods 2 1 study site scott reef is an island atoll reef system lying on the edge of the continental shelf in water depths of 500 m see fig 1 it is one of several offshore reef systems along the shelf edge of the australian north west shelf timor sea region the reefs have continued to grow despite being situated on a subsiding shelf collins and testa 2010 the topography of scott reef consists of two near circular reefs north and south scott reef with dimensions 38 km from north to south and 28 km from east to west south scott reef the larger of the two reefs has a deep lagoon with an average depth of 40 m which is open along its northern side the two reefs are separated by a 500 m deep channel approximately 15 km in length from east to west and 2 km wide at its narrowest point corals in the lagoons were affected during both the 1998 and 2016 global bleaching events gilmour et al 2013 hughes et al 2017 respectively rayson et al 2011 used a 2 km resolution roms model with a smoothed representation of scott reef to study the regional dynamics around the reef the oceanography of the region is dominated by a strong semi diurnal m 2 and s 2 tide with a tidal range at scott reef of 4 m the semi diurnal barotropic tidal currents on the shelf around the reef are in the range of 0 15 0 20 m s 1 at the 500 m isobath in rayson et al 2011 field measurements and numerical modeling revealed the presence of an energetic internal tide on the surrounding continental shelf and on the outer flanks of the reef the important geometric parameters of the channel are the length l depth h x and the width at both the surface b 0 x and through the water column b x z representative values for h and l are 450 m and 15 km respectively and the bottom slopes down at the western entrance fig 2a the width at the surface b 0 x varies between 2 and 6 km with the narrowest section located between easting 379 and 382 km the channel width varies with depth and can be approximated by a parabolic profile in the main contraction and by a rectangular like profile towards the entrances fig 2b the width of the channel is asymmetric with b 0 x diverging more rapidly at the eastern exit than at the western exit b 0 x 1 0 and 0 4 respectively the channel bends at the point of maximum contraction with a radius of curvature r 5 km curvature effects may also contribute to the mixing in the channel although they are not the primary focus here see e g edwards et al 2004 a preview of the isotherm displacement and along channel velocity from the suntans model is shown in fig 2c lee waves are evident in the eastern divergent section of the channel at around easting 385 km the internal froude number f r n u c n where u is the maximum barotropic velocity from the model and cn is the internal wave phase speed of mode n gill 1982 is shown as a function of distance along the channel in fig 2d the second baroclinic mode transitions from super critical fr 2 1 to sub critical fr 2 1 near the tidal lee wave generation region indicating that trapping of mode two waves is likely and hydraulic effects are important much of the focus for the rest of the paper is on the tidal lee wave evolution process and model data comparison in this particular region 2 2 field observations two moorings were deployed in the channel during a research cruise in april 2015 aboard the rv falkor operated by the schmidt ocean institute these measurements were taken in conjunction with other bio physical measurements around scott reef as part of a broader study to understand the connections between the physical processes and the ecosystem dynamics of australia s northern reef systems the two moorings were positioned near the 400 m and 200 m isobaths labelled scr400 and scr200 respectively in fig 1 the mooring locations were chosen based on the most energetic regions identified using an earlier version of the suntans model described here rayson 2012 we are now using the observations to evaluate the model performance and characterise the internal waves in the channel this is the first paper to show this set of observations the scr400 mooring consisted of 19 temperature instruments seabird electronics sbe56 39 and 37 six pressure instruments sbe39p and 37 and two conductivity sbe37 sensors velocity in the lower 200 m was measured with a downward looking rdi 75 khz long ranger adcp and velocity in the upper 170 m was measured with an upward looking rdi 300 khz workhorse adcp this adcp configuration was chosen to maximize flotation in the upper section of the mooring as the long ranger was buoy mounted the scr200 mooring was positioned 500 m south of scr400 on the edge of the channel where the side wall slope gradient was roughly 25 this mooring consisted of four pressure 11 temperature and two conductivity sensors and velocity was measured with an upward looking rdi 150 khz quartermaster moored 4 m above the seabed pressure was recorded at several fixed seabed locations around the lagoon using a rbr solo instrument although we have used one scr2e as a reference water level station at peak flows the very strong currents in excess of 1 5 m s 1 knocked the scr400 mooring down by up to 100 m we evaluated the vertical displacement via pressure measurements at six locations from 20 m below the surface to 100 m above the seabed using these six pressure measurements the temperature observations were then mapped onto a lagrangian vertical coordinate adcp measurements were omitted from the analyses when the instrument tilt due to knockdown was greater than 20 knockdown was less severe at the scr200 mooring although peak currents during ebb tides westward flow led to some loss of velocity data 2 3 numerical model setup we used the suntans hydrodynamic model code described in fringer et al 2006 for the present study suntans solves the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations on an unstructured horizontal domain and fixed z level vertical domain using a finite volume finite difference discretization a semi implicit time stepping scheme is used to update the free surface efficiently and high order flux limiting schemes are used for tracer advection the model can solve the full vertical momentum equation and hence the nonhydrostatic pressure although this was not necessary for the horizontal grid scale of the present application suntans has been used for various hydrodynamic studies of estuarine circulation e g rayson et al 2015 holleman et al 2013 wang et al 2011 and internal waves e g zhang et al 2011 kang and fringer 2012 other than these examples there are few regional unstructured grid modeling studies for this type of realistic shelf scale application in the literature 2 3 1 model grid the suntans unstructured mesh used in this study is shown in fig 3 the mesh was composed of n sided mainly hexagonal cells here we will refer to this mesh as the hexagonal or hex mesh although strictly speaking the grid was also composed of other n sided polygons wolfram and fringer 2013 showed that non triangular meshes reduce numerical error in the horizontal divergence calculation in unstructured finite volume models using an arakawa c grid the reduction in horizontal divergence error in turn reduces vertical velocity errors rayson et al 2015 used a mixed triangular quadrilateral grid in an estuarine application and showed better skill than a comparable triangle only grid this is the first published study using an n sided grid with the suntans model although the los alamos mpas ocean model now routinely uses this type of grid ringler et al 2013 the triangular dual grid was first constructed using the tom triangular paving algorithm described in holleman et al 2013 the hexagonal mesh was then generated by taking the dual of the triangular mesh i e nodes of the triangular grid became cell centres of the hex mesh and vice versa see fig 3d as an example inputs into the triangular grid generation code include a boundary polygon and a series of spatial lines that specify the target grid resolution in different parts of the domain using these inputs tom generates a near perfect orthogonal unstructured mesh that smoothly transitions between regions of different resolution with a specified maximum stretching rate we used a rate of 3 the geometric and topological properties of the resultant grid make it numerically efficient and stable for the finite volume formulation used in suntans the horizontal resolution the distance between cell centres transitioned from roughly 5000 m at the open boundary down to 100 m around scott reef itself fig 3 the inter tidal reef platforms on north and south scott reef were masked out and used as an internal land boundary to avoid the numerical issues associated with free surface wetting and drying the final hexagonal mesh consisted of 82 164 total horizontal cells with 165 753 nodes the triangular dual mesh had this many cells the vertical coordinate was discretised using 100 fixed z layers with a resolution δz 7 m at the surface that increased by a stretching factor r 1 034 down to the maximum depth roughly 5500 m the approximate vertical resolution at 400 m where the deepest observations were located was roughly 20 m the 3d model domain consisted of 2 150 409 total grid cells 2 3 2 bathymetry bathymetry data for the region was sourced from a geoscience australia ga gridded 250 m dataset 2009 that covered the entire region an incomplete geoscience australia gridded 50 m multibeam dataset and a 10 m resolution blended multibeam and lidar dataset provided by woodside energy ltd that spanned scott reef but little of the surrounding shelf we merged the different datasets by first mapping onto the ga 250 m resolution base grid using an averaging technique to blend the scattered data onto each grid point the 10 m and 50 m multibeam lidar datasets were then merged together on the same grid by filling the 50 m multibeam data into points where there was no 10 m data this dataset was then merged into the original ga 250 m grid by iteratively smoothing a 6 5 km buffer region where the datasets intersected we interpolated the merged dataset onto the suntans unstructured grid using a curvature minimizing interpolation method a simple gaussian filter was applied to remove any grid scale noise introduced by the interpolation scheme figs 1 and 3 b show contours of the actual model bathymetry it is clear that the steep bathymetry around scott reef with slope gradients up to 50 was well resolved by the model since suntans is a z level model it should be emphasized that little topographic smoothing was required to avoid the pressure gradient errors endemic to sigma coordinate ocean models 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions we are interested in the channel dynamics because it will influence the transport of tracers around the reef however we are also interested in the longer term transport as the vertical density temperature and salinity stratification influences internal wave generation and propagation we tested three different background ocean state temperature salinity velocity estimates for the suntans initial and boundary conditions namely the 1 12 global hycom ncoda ocean reanalysis chassignet et al 2007 the bluelink reanalysis bran 2016 version oke et al 2013 and the csiro atlas of regional seas cars climatological dataset ridgway et al 2002 both hycom and bran are data assimilating global ocean reanalysis datasets although the bran model is focused on the australian region cars is a regional temperature and salinity climatology derived from least squares fitting the mean plus annual and semi annual harmonics to ocean profile observations onto a constant 3d grid we applied a bias correction to the cars initial and boundary conditions by offsetting the estimate for april 2015 using temperature observations from the scr400 mooring daily averaged salinity and temperature which varied in space and time were interpolated from each of these data sets onto the suntans grid cells for use as initial and boundary conditions velocity data from the bran and hycom models was used to force the open boundaries only only salinity and temperature are available from the cars data so boundary velocities were set to zero for this particular scenario the initial free surface and velocity was set to zero for all cases barotropic tidal velocity and free surface boundary conditions were derived from the tpxov7 2 global tide solution egbert and erofeeva 2002 time varying velocities and free surface elevations were reconstructed from eight tidal constituents namely m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 at the suntans open boundary edges tidal fluxes were added to the low frequency open boundary velocities interpolated from the hycom and bran solutions boundary condition data in suntans is either specified as a flux along the boundary edges or by specifying the free surface directly in the boundary cell centres these are referred to as edge based or cell based open boundary types respectively tracer concentrations are then specified at either cell edges or centres based on the boundary type edge based boundary types are able to force meso scale ocean features such as coastal currents at the boundary although they suffer the limitation of not allowing one to specify the free surface directly it is therefore difficult to maintain an equilibrium free surface with only edge based boundaries due to drift in the total volume of the domain conversely the free surface may be specified at cell based boundary types but not the momentum flux as a workaround we used mainly edge based boundary types for most of the domain and then used roughly ten cell based boundaries close to the shoreline this method allowed the free surface to maintain a zero mean height we also used a sponge condition numerically implemented as an internal momentum sink to reduce the reflection of baroclinic waves from the boundary as described in zhang et al 2011 2 3 4 atmospheric forcing and boundary parameterisations atmospheric data from the era interim product provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecast dee et al 2011 was used to drive the exchange of momentum and heat between the atmosphere and the model ocean era interim is a global data assimilating atmospheric hindcast model run on a roughly 100 km grid with output data stored at six hourly time steps air sea fluxes were parameterised in suntans using the coare3 0 algorithm fairall and bradley 2003 using east and north wind velocity air temperature pressure and relative humidity net longwave and shortwave radiation components were calculated internally within the model using cloud cover from the era interim data see rayson et al 2015 for a description of the numerical implementation of the heat flux module into suntans a constant albedo was assumed 0 06 and the light extinction depth for shortwave radiation penetration was set spatially constant to 20 m a log law drag condition was used to parameterise stress at the bottom boundary with a constant roughness length scale z 0 2 10 3 m vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity terms were computed using the mellor yamada 2 5 turbulence closure model mellor and yamada 1982 2 3 5 run time the model was setup to run for 21 days from 9 to 30 april 2015 to cover the observation period 12 to 27 april and therefore at least one spring neap tidal period the first three model days spin up the surface and internal tides for the domain and were discarded as previously mentioned three scenarios were run with either hycom bran or cars initial and boundary conditions the model time step was 4 s simulations were run on 8 compute nodes of a cray cluster where each node has 2x 12 core intel xeon e5 2690 haswell chips 192 total cores communication between nodes was via a cray high speed low latency aries interconnection wall clock times for this configuration were roughly 18 hours for a total of 3456 cpu hours 3 model validation modeled quantities xmod from the three different runs hycom forced bran forced and cars forced were compared against observed quanities xobs using the root mean squared error rmse 1 r m s e 1 n x o b s x m o d 2 bias mean error 2 b i a s 1 n x m o d x o b s and the skill score murphy 1988 3 s k i l l 1 x m o d x o b s 2 x o b s x o b s 2 a skill score of unity indicates a perfect match while anywhere between zero and one indicates that the model error is less than the observed variance note the murphy skill score can be negative if the mean square error is greater than the observed variance these metrics particularly the skill allow us to quantitatively determine the most suitable choice of initial and boundary condition data 3 1 sea surface height sea surface height variations at scott reef site 2e over the study period for the bran forced scenario are shown in fig 4 neap tides were between april 13 and 15 2015 and peak spring tides were between april 20 and 22 2015 when the tidal range was 4 m tides on the kimberley shelf were dominated by semidiurnal components although a diurnal inequality was evident during spring tides fig 4 a all model runs showed good agreement between the observed sea surface heights although only the bran forced scenario is shown in fig 4 skill 0 96 rmse 0 17 m spring neap variability and phasing of the tides were all replicated by the model the maximum error was roughly 0 3 m as shown in fig 4c free surface predictions were largely insensitive to the initial condition because the tidal forcing was dominant 3 2 water temperature water temperature at the scr400 mooring from the bran forced model scenario and the observations are shown for the 15 day observation window in fig 5 isotherm displacements peaked during spring tides with peak to trough amplitudes up to 100 m a second non sinusoidal peak that dropped rapidly at peak flood tide reminiscent of a transient internal hydraulic jump was observed each tidal cycle higher frequency oscillations also occurred during spring tides and were particularly apparent on the 15 and 18 c isotherms fig 5c vertical displacement of the 15 c isotherm about its mean value is shown in fig 6 for both the bran forced model and the observations the 15 c isotherm was chosen as it was roughly mid water column where the vertical displacement amplitude was largest the model captured the phase of the two peaks during each tidal cycle although the model perturbations were biased towards a positive displacement while the observations showed a larger downward displacement differences in model and observed isotherm displacements could possibly be explained by differences in the actual background stratification see below displacement power spectral density estimates for the 15 c isotherm are shown in fig 6 peaks at the semi diurnal forcing frequency and several higher harmonics were observed the model captured these peaks however the energy between the dominant frequency bands was generally lower in the model the slope of the spectrum for higher frequencies was similar for both the model and observations and was generally proportional to ω 2 fig 6b the model spectrum rolled off more sharply at frequencies beyond 6 10 3 s 1 roughly coinciding with the horizontal wavelengths of a few horizontal grid cells i e the maximum wavenumber resolvable by the numerical grid fig 7 shows the temperature validation metrics in 25 m vertical bins at both scr200 and scr400 for all three model scenarios the hycom forced scenario performed poorest particularly at depths greater than 150 m with a warm bias of roughly 2 c and the worst skill at both moorings fig 7d and h the bias corrected cars forced scenario performed best with 1 c bias and skill 0 5 at all depths and at both sites the bran forced scenario performed similarly to the cars scenario except at 50 100 m depth where there was a 1 5 c warm bias at both moorings 3 3 along channel velocity along channel velocity at both moorings were vertically interpolated onto fixed depth levels for direct comparison with the model example time series of the measured and the bran forced modeled along channel velocity at six depths are shown fig 8 during flood tides the velocity magnitudes were up to 1 5 m s 1 positive along channel velocity and stronger in the lower 150 m in the upper 150 m the magnitude was approximately half the magnitude seen in the bottom layer there was also a phase difference between the upper and lower layers with the peak bottom jet layer preceding the upper layer velocity peak by about two hours peak ebb westward velocities were not as well resolved due to mooring knockdown during this phase of the tide velocity temperature contour plots at both moorings for a four day period during spring tides are shown in fig 9 the near bed jet was not evident at the 200 m mooring indicating it was confined to the centre region of the channel away from the wall the strongest baroclinic shear occurred during the flood ebb transition period when the current was negative below 100 m and positive above isopycnals also began upwelling during this phase of the tide fig 9 shows that this process was at least qualitatively captured by the bran forced model a similar structure was also captured by the other model scenarios not shown fig 10 shows the total barotropic plus baroclinic along channel velocity validation metrics in 25 m vertical bins the bran forced scenario performed best based on all metrics maximum along channel mean current at scr400 was roughly 0 1 m s 1 near the bed at scr400 and 0 12 m s 1 near the bed at scr200 although the mean flow was in the same direction at the corresponding depth between the two moorings it was roughly double in magnitude at scr200 the bran forced scenario best captured this mean profile at both sites which was reflected by a lower bias fig 7b and f at scr200 and scr400 respectively skill scores from all scenarios were largest near the bed at both sites skill 0 8 and got worse towards the surface both hycom and bran forced scenarios had similar rmse and skill scores at both sites with the latter performing slightly better the cars forced scenario performed considerably poorer for all velocity comparison metrics this suggests that other factors such as large scale temperature gradients not properly captured by the cars dataset contributed to model performance another possible reason is that the initial ocean state from cars was not dynamically balanced and we gave it insufficient time to spin up based on these results we only consider the bran forced scenario for further model analysis of the dynamics 3 4 harmonic analysis higher harmonic internal waves are generated in regions with large topographic excursion ratios bell 1975 nakamura and awaji 2001 we apply harmonic analysis to calculate the energy in the semidiurnal forcing frequency and its first few harmonics m 4 and m 6 to quantify the importance of these higher frequency waves to the overall energy budget we performed a harmonic fit on each of the model variables such that 4 ϕ x y z t m ϕ m x y z exp i ω m t where ϕ is any of the model variables e g u or t and ϕ m is the complex amplitude of the constituent number m due to the dominance of the semidiurnal tide at scott reef we limit our analysis to the primary forcing frequency and its first two harmonics i e m 2 m 4 and m 6 constituents during a spring tide period 17 21 april 2015 nonstationarity in the internal wave amplitude due to the nonlinear relationship between wave generation and tidal forcing limits the utility of harmonic decomposition over longer time periods see e g rayson 2012 the harmonic fields then have the form 5 ϕ ϕ m 2 ϕ m 4 ϕ m 6 e i ω t e i 2 ω t e i 3 ω t t the coefficient of determination r 2 between the best fit and the time series from both the observations and the model was used as a metric to determine the suitability of the harmonic analysis here r 2 indicates the fraction of variance explained by the harmonic fit and is given by the ratio of the variance of the harmonic signal to the original signal the variance explained by a particular frequency is given by 6 r n 2 1 2 ϕ n 2 ϕ 2 where ϕ n is the harmonic amplitude ϕ 2 is the input signal variance either model or observation and n is the frequency of choice model performance was assessed using the harmonic rmse e g rayson et al 2011 kang and fringer 2012 7 r m s e 0 5 a o 2 a m 2 a o a m cos g o g m 1 2 where ao and am are the harmonic amplitudes of the observed and modeled quantities respectively while go and gm are the respective phase values in order to analyse the mooring data we mapped the velocity and temperature observations onto a fixed vertical coordinate z level with 10 m spacing using linear interpolation temporal gaps due to mooring knockdown were then omitted from the least squares harmonic fitting procedure the suntans data was vertically interpolated onto the same vertical coordinate for consistency examples of harmonic tidal semidiurnal ellipse amplitudes extracted from the 3d numerical solution are shown in fig 11 to highlight the effect of topography on the spatial and depth variability of the tidal currents barotropic plus baroclinic the magnitude of the surface semidiurnal currents peaked at roughly 1 0 m s 1 along the northern entrance to south scott reef and in the two channels into north scott reef large amplitude regions were also present along the northern and south western flanks of the reef the dominant semidiurnal ellipse at 300 m depth was in the channel separating north and south scott reef peaking at roughly 1 2 m s 1 fig 11b this was the region where the strong jet and high frequency internal lee waves were observed in the mooring data the harmonic analysis revealed the vertical structure of the oscillatory along channel velocity and temperature perturbations as shown in fig 12 there was a peak in the semi diurnal along channel velocity component between 200 and 350 m deep with the model in good agreement with the observations tidal rmse 0 10 m s 1 fig 12c the model performed worse higher in the velocity amplitude profiles tidal rmse 0 2 0 3 m s 1 although the general shape of the profiles were similar more than 90 of the velocity variance was explained by the harmonic fit yet only roughly 5 of the variance was ascribed to the higher harmonics for both the observed and modeled velocity fig 12b eq 6 although the m 4 frequency velocity perturbations were roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the m 2 frequency they were similar in magnitude to the mean flow the observed semidiurnal temperature oscillations peaked at 1 5 c between 75 m and 150 m below the surface fig 12d model results exhibited a similar vertical structure although the peak was 2 5 c and the maximum tidal rmse calculated using eq 7 was 0 8 c at this depth fig 12f note that more of the modeled temperature variance was captured by the harmonic fit with r 2 0 95 at 100 m depth versus r 2 0 75 for the observations fig 12e this indicates that it was likely that more of the observed temperature variance was spread in frequency bands around m 2 as is also shown in fig 6b finally less than 50 of the temperature variance was explained by the harmonic fit in both the model and observations below 300 m depth indicating non oscillatory processes in that region higher harmonic temperature oscillations particularly the m 4 harmonic were significant in the channel m 4 frequency temperature oscillations peaked at 1 0 c between 150 and 200 m below the surface with the model in approximate agreement fig 12d note that almost 50 of the temperature variance calculated using eq 6 was explained by the m 4 m 6 harmonics in the model and 30 in the observations fig 12e the amplitudes of the m 2 and m 4 harmonics were approximately equal at 200 m depth close to the mean depth of the 15 c isotherm m 6 oscillations not shown were generally an order of magnitude smaller harmonic velocity and temperature profiles had a similar shape at the scr200 mooring fig 13 the m 4 amplitude temperature oscillations were similar in magnitude to the scr400 mooring and peaked at 150 m below the surface a key difference between the 200 m and 400 m mooring was a smaller peak velocity of 0 4 0 5 m s 1 at the scr200 mooring note the bottom intensified jet started at roughly 200 m depth at scr400 model error was slightly less at the 200 m mooring for both harmonics of velocity and temperature fig 13c and f respectively the m 4 frequency temperature oscillations and the bottom intensified jet were a signature of the lee wave evolution process 4 internal tide dynamics in the channel 4 1 along channel flow a sequence of vertical slices of the model velocity and density fields along the 400 m contour of the channel revealed the formation and evolution of tidal lee waves into a transient internal hydraulic jump over one tidal cycle fig 14 the upper panel shows a time series at the scr400 mooring to place the vertical slices in the context of fig 9b during the flood phase the channel shape forced an increase in the horizontal velocity in the convergent section easting 378 km and a decrease in the divergent section easting 383 km of the channel figure 14 b c in the main convergent section easting 378 383 km the flow accelerated and the isopycnals between 150 and 300 m depth were drawn down while below 300 m the isopycnals were displaced upwards thus creating a mode two vertical structure the mode two internal froude number transitioned from super to sub critical in this region during this stage of the tide indicating likely trapping of mode two internal waves fig 2d the along channel velocity was greatest in this section and the vertical profile defined the bottom intensified jet observed at the scr400 mooring in the divergent section of the channel between easting 383 and 385 km the flow then decelerated and the isopycnals returned sharply to their mean position as an internal hydraulic jump fig 14d e the local vertical displacement of the isopycnals was approximately 50 m and the horizontal length scale of this jump feature was approximately 4 km vertical shear was greatest at the mooring location during the flood ebb transition phase as the transient jump began to propagate back into the channel fig 14e f observations indicated that internal wave breaking indicated by large amplitude isopycnal overturns also occurred at this site during this phase of the tide see fig 5c similar to the response at the eastern end of the channel during flood tide a jump formed at the western end of the channel during ebb tide fig 14h at easting 375 km this jump was located higher in the water column 50 300 m than the jump at the eastern end the differences in the flow response at the eastern and western ends of the channel were likely due to the asymmetry in the variation of width and depth either side of the point of maximum contraction see fig 2b at scr400 for example high vertical shear did not occur on the ebb flood phase like it did on the flood ebb phase 4 2 energetics we used the harmonically decomposed velocity and density fields to calculate the baroclinic energy density e j m 2 at both the forcing frequency m 2 and at the first two harmonics m 4 m 6 using a similar method to that outlined in rayson et al 2012 the time averaged depth integrated internal wave energy density in harmonic form is 8 e m e k m e p m where 9 e k m ℜ ρ 0 4 h 0 u m 2 v m 2 w m 2 d z is the kinetic energy at frequency m u m v m w m are the complex harmonic amplitudes of each baroclinic velocity component an overbar indicates depth integration and the angle brackets indicate a time average operator 10 e p m ℜ ρ 0 4 h 0 b m 2 n 2 d z is the linear available potential energy at a particular harmonic ape 3 using the definition of kang and fringer 2010 b m ρ m g ρ 0 is the buoyancy perturbation at the harmonic and n is the buoyancy frequency the baroclinic energy flux vector is then 11 f m ℜ ρ 0 2 h 0 u m p m d z w m 1 where u m u m u is the complex baroclinic velocity and p m z 0 b m d z is the complex conjugate of the baroclinic pressure perturbation the barotropic velocity amplitude u was calculated by depth averaging the total velocity amplitude the steady state tidally averaged baroclinic kinetic energy equation in harmonic form is 12 h f m n l m n c m d i s s m n where h x y cm is the barotropic to baroclinic conversion 13 c m ℜ 1 2 u m h p m h nlmn are the nonlinear advection terms and dissmn are the dissipation terms the nonlinear and dissipative terms in the internal wave energy equation are presented in kang and fringer 2012 and it is beyond the scope of this paper to derive their harmonic equivalents time dependent residual terms arise after time averaging the flux and conversion terms when two frequencies interact that are non integer multiples of one another i e non harmonic tidal constituents such as m 2 and k 1 energy transfer between different harmonics indicated by the mn subscript only occur in the nonlinear and dissipative terms we approximate the forcing in this region as a single semidiurnal frequency so that we may assume steady state which is only reasonable for periods of several days beyond which the contributions from other frequencies are important the purpose here is to show that there was a significant contribution to the energy flux divergence from the higher harmonics that was linked to the tidal lee wave evolution we calculate the energy terms in eqs 9 and 11 for the mooring data using the harmonic velocity and temperature terms from section 3 4 vertical integrals were computed by extrapolating the closest velocity and temperature perturbations to the surface and seabed respectively a nonlinear equation of state using constant salinity 34 6 psu was used to convert observed temperature to buoyancy perturbations both observed and model energy quantities were computed on the same vertical grid for consistency depth integrated energy density eq 9 and the eastward energy flux eq 11 at the scr400 mooring are listed in table 1 the semidiurnal model total energy density was roughly 35 less than observed although both were of order 10 kj m 2 the m 4 frequency energy was roughly three times smaller in the model than the observations and both the model and observed energy densities were around an order of magnitude less than the semidiurnal component observed semidiurnal eastward along channel energy fluxes were roughly 11 kw m 1 and the model captured the direction although it was 15 weaker than the observations the m 4 flux component was in poorer agreement the sign was opposite although as we show below there was considerable spatial variability in the m 4 flux divergence in this section of the channel where the moorings were located meaning that a small change in position could change the sign of the m 4 energy flux the m 2 component energy density was larger in the model at the scr200 mooring 4550 and 2020 j m 2 for the model and observations respectively the m 4 component was still roughly twice as energetic in the observations eastward m 2 fluxes were significantly weaker than at the scr400 mooring with modeled and observed components of 3 and 1 5 kw m 1 respectively while uncertainties in the energy and flux estimates due to depth and time gaps may contribute to some error the model appeared to capture the direction magnitude and relative contributions from higher harmonics at this site spatial variation of the internal wave energy density with flux vectors overlaid for the forcing frequency and its first harmonic are shown in fig 15 the largest semidiurnal energy density was 15 20 kj m 2 in the main section of the channel and along the southern flank of scott reef fig 15a the m 4 energy density was roughly five times smaller than the main forcing frequency fig 15b the area averaged m 2 and m 4 energy density was 4 8 and 0 9 kj m 2 respectively there was however higher intensity m 4 peaks of 2 kj m 2 at either end of the channel i e at easting 370 378 and 383 390 km this coincided with the regions where tidal lee waves formed and propagated back into the channel fig 14d the horizontal energy flux divergence from eq 12 is shown for the channel region in fig 16 and area integrated flux divergence and barotropic to baroclinic conversion eq 13 are shown in table 2 the m 2 frequency flux vectors were divergent along the southern flank indicating wave generation and convergent within the channel indicated by a negative sign the channel separating north and scott reef was a region of net m 2 energy convergence 2 7 mw and net m 4 divergence 6 5 mw net barotropic to baroclinic conversion rates in the corresponding region were 15 and 0 6 mw for the m 2 and m 4 frequencies respectively m 2 frequency internal tide energy was therefore being lost in the channel and little of the converted energy was leaving the region as the m 4 divergence greatly exceeded the conversion we conclude that some of the energy at this harmonic was transferred directly from the forcing frequency via nonlinear interactions i e advection of waves by barotropic or baroclinic currents note that spurious m 4 energy can arise due to the tidal advection of freely propagating waves observed in an eulerian frame see e g pinkel 2008 stephenson et al 2016 stephenson et al 2016 show that harmonic filtering under predicts the primary frequency m 2 amplitude of a low mode internal wave subject to a maximum internal froude number of 0 5 by 20 30 the first harmonic m 4 is over predicts by a corresponding amount if tidal advection is important frn 1 then a lagrangian analysis of the harmonics is necessary to separate the freely propagating waves from the advected signal e g musgrave et al 2016 nagai et al 2015 shakespeare and hogg 2017 this method would be necessary to exactly balance an internal tide energy equation in frequency form however based on the past studies with a similar vertical wavenumber and froude number parameter space we expect that tidal advection will only modify the total m 4 energy density by a small amount furthermore given the m 4 signal was 5 10 times more energetic in the channel we conclude that this was predominantly the result of tidal lee waves 5 discussion a number of the flow features observed and captured by the 3d model were qualitatively similar to flows over two dimensional sills e g klymak et al 2010 winters and armi 2013 for a 2d sill part of the flow is blocked below the crest and a fast flowing layer or jet forms above the crest to compensate for this blockage at depth the blocked layer depth is proportional to u 0 n gill 1982 baines 1995 both steady klymak et al 2010 and unsteady winters and armi 2013 2d numerical simulations show that a bottom intensified jet forms in the initial lee wave development stage close to the topographic crest klymak et al 2010 show that the vertical scale of the jet increases with the topographic froude number f r t n h m u 0 where hm is the obstacle height therefore low mode lee waves form when the topographic height is much larger than the blocking depth at scott reef the jet height or thickness was roughly 150 m and the wave response is considered to be low mode mode one or two but as the flow was controlled by a contraction it is difficult to define an equivalent scale to hm to compare with the 2d case in a contraction with no sill or other three dimensional topography only part of the flow is blocked close to the channel edges yet the flow along the thalweg is unimpeded by topography it is this effective blocking near the sloped walls causing the flow to be deflected toward the thalweg instead of going up slope that likely causes the near bed jet this is the dividing streamline concept in 3d flows see e g castro et al 1983 snyder et al 1985 castro et al 1983 and others show that for a steady adiabatic flow the position of the dividing streamline can be calculated based on energy conservation layers where the flow has insufficient kinetic energy to overcome the potential energy necessary to lift the fluid over the topography will instead deflect around the topography and form a jet castro et al 1983 show experimentally that lee waves and overturns then form downstream qualitatively similar to our observations although the dividing streamline conceptually explains the formation of the bottom jet at scott reef idealised modeling is necessary to determine the dependence of the jet height internal wave mode on the topographic geometry as well as the effects of unsteady forcing and turbulent dissipation that are important in the present application 6 summary and conclusions we have demonstrated how high frequency internal lee waves were generated at steep island topography using a z level unstructured grid rans model driven by realistic forcing and validated using ocean mooring observations the focus was on a spring neap tidal period in april 2015 when moored observations were collected although the model could potentially be used for longer term predictions as it was one way nested within different global circulation models or climatological datasets as well as the tpxo tidal model and surface heat and momentum fluxes specified from a global atmospheric reanalysis model era interim a hex dominant unstructured mesh was used to resolve the island topography down to 100 m scale while alleviating the horizontal divergence calculation errors associated with triangular arakawa c grid finite volume models see e g wolfram and fringer 2013 the z level vertical discretization was necessary due to the very steep island atoll bathymetry with bottom slopes of up to 50 we compared three different scenarios each forced with different initial and boundary conditions and concluded that the bran forced scenario performed best in terms of all validation metrics for both water temperature and along channel velocity this scenario had a lower temperature bias than the hycom forced scenario in this region and captured the velocity variability better than a scenario initialized with the cars climatological data the bran forced scenario was weakest at about the 100 m depth in the peak thermocline region with a 1 5 c bias inaccurate description of mixing in the thermocline driven by internal tide induced processes was possibly a cause of the bias in both global models as they do not include tides and are too coarse to resolve the internal tides in detail insufficient observational coverage in the region was also a challenge observations revealed an oscillatory bottom intensified jet intensifying with the tidal forcing amplitude in the 500 m deep channel separating the two reef atolls isotherm oscillations at twice the dominant semidiurnal forcing frequency were observed in the same region in addition to the longer wave length internal tide our model was able to capture these dominant and key flow features in the channel the 3d model revealed that m 4 and higher frequency oscillations were formed in the lee of a transient hydraulic jump in the divergent section of the channel see fig 14 we interpret these high frequency oscillations as topographic lee waves an energetics analysis of the model output revealed a net convergence of internal tide m 2 frequency energy in the channel and a net divergence of higher frequency energy based on the harmonic energy density calculated from both the observations and the model table 1 roughly 10 of the internal tide energy was transferred to higher frequencies in particular the m 4 frequency this energy transfer is a direct mechanism for energy cascade to higher harmonics with shorter wave lengths that were steeper and therefore more likely to break the observations indicated the topographic lee waves eventually broke on the turn of the tide leading to large scale overturning events see e g fig 5c around 2015 04 19 12 00 the grid scale required to capture this breaking process was beyond the resolution of our rans model although the model was able to reproduce the larger scale conditions that led to these events i e the tidal lee wave formation in a follow up study we will examine the observed dissipation and vertical mixing rates associated with these breaking events and use the model developed here as a tool to ascertain the importance of these events for vertical heat and nutrient fluxes in the region acknowledgments we would like to thank the schmidt ocean institute and the captain and crew of the r v falkor this data set was
