13735,municipal wastewater is recognized as having a high amount of biodegradable matter which is not easily hydrolyzed through anaerobic treatments in cold climate countries under proper operating conditions the direct membrane filtration dmf appears to be a feasible technology capable of efficiently separating and concentrating the primary wastewater for subsequent anaerobic digestion under mesophilic conditions the long term operation of a municipal wastewater concentration process was proved feasible with intermittent gas scouring 40 s of operation followed by a pause of 3 5 min and permeate backwash operating at 12 7 l m2 h feed with medium strength wastewaters a permeate stream below the discharge limit was obtained and the resulting concentrate streams presented levels of between 19 000 and 54 000 mg l of cod an estimated energy balance pointed to the self sufficiency of the process by allowing for an energy production of 0 19 kw h m3 through the anaerobic digestion while the power consumption for the gas scouring and pumping resulted in 0 15 kw h m3 experiments demonstrated that the threshold flux for a wastewater filtration is highly influenced by the gas scouring velocity the operation performed with 32 9 gtss l of primary concentrated wastewater indicated that the threshold fluxes increase by more than 300 through increasing the gas scouring velocities from 0 to 30 6 m h keywords primary wastewater concentration organic matter recovery anaerobic digestion ultrafiltration membrane 1 introduction a wide range of sustainable processes for municipal wastewater mw treatment have been studied and encouraged in order to improve or replace conventional systems in several wastewater treatment plants worldwide either to save energy to recover nutrients or to reduce environmental impacts 1 2 typical plants for mw treatment are based on the activated sludge as process which despite its effectiveness presents downsides including a high amount of energy expenditure of around 0 2 2 kw h m3 3 4 high excess sludge production 5 and the wasting of valuable organic content embedded in mw streams 6 which carries the potential to make the wastewater treatment plants self sufficient 7 8 all these authors have mentioned that there are several opportunities for energy savings in the current mw treatment plants from improvement in management practices to a better recovery of organic solids the anaerobic processes comprise the most prominent strategy capable of taking full advantage of the organic content from mw and their application either as standalone or combined processes should be further strengthened for mw treatment in both developed and developing countries 9 because of their low environmental impact such as the reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions and the potential positive net energy production by means of biogas cogeneration however the direct application of anaerobic processes to treat municipal wastewater faces some major drawbacks such as a high fraction of particulate cod moderate biodegradability and low strength with varying concentrations and usually low temperatures in this sense anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr have been shown as potential technologies capable of uniting both energy savings and minimal environmental impact nevertheless important challenges remain jeopardizing the efficiency of their application these challenges are mostly related to low temperature low rate of particulate matter biodegradation membrane fouling and the energy required for recirculation and crossflow velocity 10 11 at this point it is clear that a technology capable of separating and concentrating the particulate fraction from municipal wastewater would enhance the treatment by enabling the appropriate recovery of carbon content through the direct conveyance to anaerobic digestion under mesophilic thermophilic conditions this has been the approach taken by many researchers and some recent reviews have already been prepared in order to bring this theme into a broader discussion 12 14 different technologies are being studied in order to pre concentrate the mw such as high rate activated sludge system for carbon recovery 15 16 chemical enhanced primary treatment cept 17 dynamic membrane 18 19 direct osmosis 20 21 and direct membrane filtration dmf 22 26 direct membrane filtration has been the subject of growing interest as a prominent process for the mw up concentration by solving the problems associated with low temperature and power consumption therefore the objective of the dmf is to obtain a compact and loaded stream with high carbon content to be conveyed for biogas conversion and a major permeate stream with soluble cod and nutrients another process based on the coagulation adsorption enhanced membrane caem method which redesigns the c and n mass flows for energy neutral wastewater treatment has also been studied 27 the advantages of the dmf system are related to its extreme compactness small footprint and reduced energy consumption moreover the high concentrations of solids reached during the direct membrane filtration which can be digested to produce energy is a relevant feature when compared to the conventional activated sludge systems without the concentration process thus it can be expected that the direct membrane processes facilitate the achievement of better carbon neutrality values by simultaneous addressing both wastewater treatment and in some cases nutrient recovery through the addition of chemical reagents 28 however it is necessary to study the dmf process since there are few studies that have been conducted under continuous operation and most of these were carried out on a short term laboratory scale these limitations make it difficult to determine the operating parameters and the feasibility of the process 29 30 therefore the assessment of dmf operations for organic recovery from mw on larger long term scales are still necessary moreover assessment is required to determine the success of the dmf implementation depending on the strategies used to maintain the membrane module in operation by combining reasonable permeate fluxes and safe transmembrane pressures tmp without compromising the membrane itself and at the same time being able to fulfill their main goals from the theoretical point of view the critical flux value is an important piece of information which is necessary in order to perform a safe and feasible dmf process critical flux can be defined as the flux below which no fouling affects the filtration process in a short period of time or in other words the flux from which the cake layer formation starts to be noticeable or variable with time dtmp dt 0 in its strong definition as stated by field et al 31 however at long term operation both for real and synthetic wastewaters 32 the membrane fouling is perceived as a result of the accumulation of reversible and irreversible fouling even under subcritical conditions which is an inherent characteristic of dead end processes from a practical point of view and in order to provide useful guidance the concept of threshold flux jt is hereby implemented for the dmf operation as a flux at or below which a low and near constant rate of fouling occurs but above which the rate of fouling markedly increases 33 an immediate consequence of the threshold flux is the more subjective yet useful concept of sustainable flux which is defined as the net flux that can be maintained under the conditions particular to antifouling strategies considering an optimum balance of the operating costs 34 therefore considering a feasible long term operation of dmf system and putting into perspective the pragmatic threshold and sustainable fluxes membrane fouling is a great concern and therefore antifouling strategies have been the subject of discussion over the last years 25 35 different methods have been tested in order to avoid fouling during the mw concentration and their actions vary from producing large loose particles of solids using coagulation flocculation processes providing a shear force that detaches the cake layer from the membrane surface using air gas scouring 36 37 and also the application of permeate backwash and chemically enhanced backwash as strategies to minimize irreversible fouling 23 the aforementioned strategies are the most common that have been found in literature up until now and studies have reported good results when applying different arrangements of these antifouling methods within this framework the aim of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of mw up concentration in a continuous process by ultrafiltration membranes dmf process while strategies like permeate backwash intermittent gas scouring and periodical purging of the concentrate stream are being applied for fouling control in order to simulate the dmf under more severe conditions the threshold fluxes are studied with highly concentrated mw the energy balance of membrane consumption and biogas generation is calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane module setup the membrane module used in the experiments is a hollow fiber type zw 10 zenon ge with a mean pore size of 0 04 Î¼m and filtration area of 0 93 m2 at the bottom of the module there is a diffuser of coarse bubbles that provides the gas scouring to the membrane fibers the gas scouring flux was controlled by a rotameter 2 2 threshold flux setup the jt determination for the dmf of mw was performed in short term experiments following a flux step method in which the filtration flux was increased until the variation of tmp suffered a noticeable slope change the filtration flow was initially set at 2 l h and then subsequently increased by steps of 2 l h before each filtration the membrane was backwashed with clean water for 30 s with the same flux of filtration and then the membrane started to filtrate for a fixed period of 5 min the wastewater used in these experiments was collected from the downstream section of the grit chamber stage of the wwtp from the small town of renedo de esgueva spain the plant process is based on an activated sludge system previously to the experiment several stages of decantation and filtration were used to up concentrate two volumes of raw wastewater 1 2 m3 and 2 4 m3 resulting in two volumes of 16 l with 18 6 g tss l and 32 9 g tss l respectively these samples of concentrated raw wastewater were then used with the consideration that they could be achieved during the mw up concentration process by operating as a long term continuous process the jt was determined for the two concentrations of wastewater as well as different superficial gas velocities vg for each concentration 0 10 2 20 4 and 30 6 m h the experiments were conducted in a pvc cylindrical tube of 0 15 m in diameter and 1 8 m high in order to maintain a constant solid concentration in the bulk of the wastewater inside the tube the filtrations were performed in a closed circuit so as to return the permeate effluent to the pvc cylinder the superficial gas velocity was calculated taking into account the transversal area of the pvc cylinder the permeate line was equipped with a pressure transmitter endress hauser pmc 131 1 to 1 bar valladolid es and during the experiments the mw samples remained constant at 20 c 2 2 1 membrane cleaning before each experiment with the different solid concentrations 18 6 gtss l and 32 9 g tss l the membrane module was chemically cleaned and its permeability was then determined each chemical cleaning consisted of 4 stages including 1 physical cleaning tap water jet and soft sponge and 3 chemical cleanings soaking for 2 h in 1 000 ppm naclo while undergoing agitation with air blowing repeat procedure followed by soaking for 2 h in 1 0 w v citric acid under agitation moreover during the experiment with the same solid concentration but changing the superficial gas velocities the membrane module was only physically cleaned out of place with a jet of tap water and a soft sponge and following this its permeability was also determined 2 2 2 membrane permeability the permeability of the membrane after the short term flux step method was determined a pvc cylindrical tube with clean water at 20 c was used for the characterization the procedure used for the permeability determination consisted of measuring the tmp response in accordance with the applied filtration fluxes 2 3 long term continuous municipal wastewater concentration process by direct membrane filtration the municipal wastewater concentration process was carried out in a continuously operating pilot plant the characteristics of the wastewater feed are presented in table 1 the discharge limit for the treated urban wastewater is 125 mg l cod data in brackets are the standard deviations the pilot plant was composed of a vertical polypropylene tank 1 76 m in height and 0 34 m in diameter with a useful volume of 126 l as indicated in fig 1 the hollow fiber membrane module zw 10 zenon ge is placed within the upper section of this tank in the continuous experiments the membrane was surrounded by an airlift a cylindrical protector made of pvc 0 15 m in diameter and 0 69 m in height the airlift length completely covers the extension of the membrane module the membrane tank has several sampling points sp which were used for sampling in this experiment the feed entrance to the membrane tank sp 1 the filtration section sp 2 the control of the concentrate section sp 3 sp 4 and sp 5 and the permeate line sp 6 the cylinder and the internal elements are practically to scale peristaltic pumps were used for the feed watson marlon 520s and filtration backwash line watson marlon 520u the feed wastewater sp 1 is conducted through a centrical tube to the bottom of the membrane tank this centrical tube works as a deflector by hindering the larger particles from rising out of the feed wastewater and into the filtration section the feed wastewater sp 1 reaches the center and is directed downwards the sedimentation concentration section comprises a total volume of 32 9 l between the feed entrance sp 1 and the bottom of the membrane tank sp 5 the concentrated solids are periodically purged from the lower section sp 5 in order to keep the membrane in continuous operation permeate backwash and intermittent gas scouring were used as antifouling methods the filtration cycle was composed of four periods 0 5 min backwash 5 s pause 7 min filtration and 5 s pause again therefore the filtration time corresponded to 91 3 of the total filtration cycle the membrane module was subjected to scouring provided by closed circuit recirculation in the headspace of the membrane tank using a compressor secoh sv50 barcelona es the gas velocity was calculated by taking into account the established gas flow through the transversal area of the airlift the velocity was controlled using a rotameter and the compressor regime was set to operate intermittently using a timer control for 40 s of operation time followed by a 3 5 min pause the plant was equipped with pressure transmitters endress hauser pmc 131 1 to 1 bar valladolid es in the permeate backwash line and in the headspace of the membrane tank the picolog technology ltd data acquisition system was used to monitor and store the data regarding temperature and filtration pressures 2 4 chemical assays and sampling total cod soluble cod total solids ts volatile solids vs total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 38 samples for the long term operation process were collected periodically every 2 days approx from the sampling points labelled sp 1 sp 5 and sp 6 in order to monitor the concentration process 2 5 biochemical methane potential assay biochemical methane potential assays bmp at mesophilic 35 1 0 3 c conditions were carried out in order to assess the biodegradability of the concentrated solids from the primary wastewater purged in the lower section of the membrane tank sp 5 the tests were performed in triplicate the anaerobic inoculum used was obtained from a pilot sludge digester and pre incubated for two days 35 1 0 3 c to minimize its residual biodegradable organic matter content a blank test without substrate was included serum bottles with a volume of 160 ml were used in the bmp tests with a reaction volume of 80 ml the inoculum ratio s x was 0 4 gvsssubs gvssinoc the bottles were sealed using rubber septa and aluminum crimp caps and then gassed with helium and subjected to continuous agitation in an orbital shaker biogas production was estimated by measuring the pressure in the headspace of the bottles and the biogas composition biogas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph varian cp 3800 palo alto ca usa coupled with a thermal conductivity detector and equipped with a cp molsieve 5a 15 m x0 53 mm x15 Î¼m and cp pora bond q 25 m x0 53 mm x15 Î¼m columns the specific methane yield smy ml ch4 gvsfed was calculated by dividing the net methane production associated with the substrate by the quantity of volatile solids from the substrate at the beginning of the test 3 results and discussion 3 1 threshold flux determination using primary wastewater sludge 3 1 1 the effect of gas scouring and solid concentrations the graphics shown in fig 2 are the results of the jt determination for each jt determination the fluxes are increased until the tmp reached a maximum value of 400 mbar this value was chosen as a safe working pressure in order not to damage the membrane module and even when the jt was reached with tmp under 400 mbar except in one case fig 2f the filtration fluxes were still raised up to 400 mbar in order to appreciate the increasing slopes the adopted arbitrary limit for the jt determination was based on the observed slope values for the graphics tmp mbar vs time min dtmp dt in accordance with the procedure followed by other authors 39 41 the criterion established here is that the threshold flux is the flux at which dtmp dt is immediately inferior to the unit as presented in fig 2 according to this assumption the jt can never promote an increase of 1 mbar min this consideration for the current experiment allows the threshold flux variation to be determined without incurring qualitative error besides establishing a fouling rate which can be appreciated through observation the gas scouring velocity and the solid concentrations in wastewater have a remarkable effect on the membrane surface and hence in the obtained threshold fluxes when comparing the jt for the two solid concentrations assayed a notable increase is observed in the resulting jt as the superficial gas velocities increase these increases in jt due to the increases of gas velocities caused enhancements of 500 and 300 respectively to the lower and higher concentrations besides increasing the wastewater concentration severely affects the threshold fluxes for the same applied gas scouring it is interesting to take note of the fact that for industrial purposes the balance between the sustainable permeate flux and the superficial gas velocities applied might be more valuable than the objective of reaching the maximum permeate flux even though it means an extra operating cost the operation with 18 6 gtss l wastewater seems to be achievable in a continuous process with low to medium filtration fluxes and tmp and moderate gas scouring as exemplified by the conditions of figs 2b and 2c as reported by gong et al 42 the long term ultrafiltration of municipal wastewater under high concentrations of tss above 20 0 g l is feasible employing enhanced preconcentration and air backflushing over a two month operation period the higher jt obtained for the first train of experiments is due to the ease of cleaning the membrane surface at this stage since the solid concentration is lower and therefore the fouling layer is more fragile and more susceptible to being detached by the gas scouring for the second train of experiments with a solid concentration of 32 9 gtss l the threshold fluxes determined were maintained at 2 2 lmh for the first three superficial gas velocities applied the jt only increased to 6 5 lmh when the superficial gas velocity was increased to 30 6 m h indicating that depending on the concentration of solids in raw wastewater the jt may not have varied until a sufficient gas scouring velocity was applied to disturb the fouling layer on the membrane surface from the data collected in all experiments the critical flux in its strict concept was never attained even with the lower flux of 2 2 lmh the dtmp dt values measured were positive indicating some degree of fouling this is precisely the conclusion of le clech et al 32 who were operating a submerged membrane bioreactor with real and synthetic wastewaters these authors indicate that there is a flux a so called weak form of critical flux from which the fouling starts to be significant and although difficult to determine with precision it is useful for comparing fouling tendencies these authors reported that these critical fluxes might be around 10 lmh when working with 3 g l of mlss concentration for the both the synthetic and real wastewaters investigated furthermore as found in this research the membrane filtration without gas scouring usually leads to a rapid and accentuated dropping of the critical threshold fluxes bottino et al 43 working with a fixed 3 l min of air scouring reported a decrease of 2 5 times in the critical flux by increasing the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss from 3 to 14 g l after performing a submerged filtration with a polyethylene membrane in an mbr process the authors also verified the same tendency by using a pvdf membrane by changing the mlss from 3 to 8 g l a decrease in the critical flux from 14 7 to 12 1 lmh was obtained from the economical point of view higher solid concentrations mean lower filtration fluxes and high demand for a higher superficial gas velocity which leads the system to expend extra energy 44 however the concept of operating at subcritical or at below the threshold flux seems to solve many of the concerns regarding submerged membranes for direct wastewater filtration investigations have been indicating that this approach brings the industrial processes into long term sustainable operation and that the benefits are diverse comprising environmental protection technical simplicity and being economically attractive 34 3 1 2 membrane permeability during the threshold flux determination the membrane module had been previously used in other experiments not mentioned in this work so before using it for the jt determination it was soaked in clean water and following chemical cleaning it presented an initial permeability of 0 72 mbar lmh throughout both experiments for the jt determination the first one with 18 6 gtss l and the second one with 32 9 gtss l the increase in the membrane fouling was also perceived by the decrease in its permeability caused by the physical cleanings in the first experiment the permeability decreased from 0 72 mbar lmh to 0 47 mbar lmh while after the 4th physical cleaning and for the second experiment these permeabilities corresponded to 0 75 mbar lmh and 0 44 mbar lmh respectively this indicates that despite the physical cleanings and the backwash at the beginning of the jt determinations the fouling was being accumulated on the membrane pores indicating that physical cleaning alone is not enough to ensure the recovery of membrane permeability moreover the decreasing permeabilities have probably influenced the threshold flux results if the membrane was completely restored with physical cleanings the threshold fluxes after the first experiment would probably be higher than the current threshold fluxes measured since the physical protocols were not sufficient for restoring the initial membrane permeability the fouling was classified as irreversible 45 however the chemical cleaning with naclo and citric acid dissolution before the second train was able to efficiently restore the permeability to the value at the beginning of the experiments proving this to be an important procedure in promoting the membrane filterability at least in the short term the use of these reagents however require caution and long term assessment is desirable in order to better understand the behavior in the long term 46 the naclo does not cause severe damages to the structure of the pvdf membranes but its long term application may cause changes to the membrane surface and to its hydrophilicity characteristics as verified by wang et al 47 on the other hand the mildness of the citric acid associated with its rinsability for inorganic foulants 48 actually stimulates its application either alone or coupled with oxidizing reagents 30 3 2 long term continuous municipal wastewater concentration process by direct membrane filtration 3 2 1 wastewater concentration process a continuous experiment for urban wastewater up concentration was carried out with intermittent gas scouring the operating conditions for the continuous experiment are presented in table 2 the operation proved to be efficient for the concentration process ensuring the production of a stable permeate completely free of suspended particles moreover the total cod in the effluent has been reduced by 85 allowing only the soluble matter to remain in the permeate stream jin et al 49 also showed an average cod removal of 94 with a physicochemical based enhanced membrane coagulation reactor e mcr during a continuous operation process zhao et al 28 found similar cod reduction around 90 in both cases however previous coagulation processes were performed the process has been shown as feasible reaching high concentrations of organic matter fitting with the desirable concentrations for a subsequent anaerobic digestion the concentrated solids were periodically purged with an average volume estimated as 4 l each 4 days this stream presented concentrations in the range of 19 000 54 000 mg l cod with an average 30 720 8 058 mg l therefore being characterized as a high loaded the concentration of this stream of solids is variable depending on the flow and the frequency of the purges performed the obtained concentrations of ts were between 17 68 and 32 29 g l with an average 24 02 4 13 g l and vs were between 12 42 and 23 02 g l with an average 16 65 2 79 g l the resulted ts content are of the same order as those used in the experiments for the threshold flux nevertheless due to the membrane tank design and the frequency of purges performed these values are only reached in the lower section and not in the filtration zone in keeping with the objective the membrane tank height allows the filtration design to be separated in two zones the upper section where the membrane is located and the lower section or concentration section where the particulate matter is thus concentrated because of this design the tss concentration remained at around 0 47 g l in the filtration section sp 2 which implies a remarkable stratification with respect to the concentration section the effect of the gas scouring and the air lift have also contributed to this behavior and hence to a lower rate of membrane fouling samples from the sampling points sp 3 and sp 4 see fig 1 were periodically collected in order to measure the ts concentrations and then to control the height of the concentrate volume along the experiment the ts concentrations have varied between 4 and 32 gts l for the sp 4 and between 2 and 7 gts l for the sp 3 which indicates that the majority of solids are sedimented at the lower section of the membrane tank 32 9 l between sp1 and sp 5 with higher concentration values in the first 16 l comprised between the sp 4 and the sp 5 high concentrate streams have also been achieved by other authors jin et al 22 working with cycles consisting of 12 min permeation followed by 3 min relaxation at doses of 30 mg l polyaluminum chloride pac over a 295 h continuous concentration period reached a cod concentration around 16 000 mg l nevertheless the cod concentration reached in the present work is even higher being achieved every four days when the purge is carried out and without the addition of coagulants gong et al 42 also adding coagulants together with controlled filtration 10 min permeation and 2 min membrane relaxation and air backflushing 25 s on during the relaxation period in continuous operation were able to reach a cod concentration of around 23 000 mg l when the amounts of entering and discharging organics were balanced jin et al 49 on the other hand also with an enhanced membrane coagulation reactor e mcr in a long term process with air backflushing 200 kpa of pressure during 30 s each 5 min30 s and 1d of concentrate retention time reported a cod concentration of 9 700 mg l with 94 of recovery 3 2 2 cod ts balance in order to avoid oxidation and to check for the possible loss of organic matter the experiment was carried out closed off from the atmosphere initially the composition of the gas chamber was essentially air nevertheless as time went on the oxygen was consumed and the predominant gas became nitrogen the gas within the membrane tank was analyzed throughout the experiment resulting in an average final composition of 95 of n2 4 of o2 2 of co2 0 7 of ch4 and 0 1 of h2s which indicates a negligible conversion rate of cod through anaerobic digestion otherwise the carbon dioxide and methane proportion were expected to be higher the mass balance was carried out over the entire period of operation by the integration of the individual data collected during the experiment regarding the total cod content 16 of the soluble cod was drained out of the membrane tank in the permeate stream and the purged streams contained about 54 of the total cod in the feed thus the theoretical losses of matter corresponded to 30 of the total feed cod these differences in the mass balance are probably due to the loading variation in the wastewater feed throughout the day that actually influenced the precision of the mass balance besides after the experiment the membrane tank was opened and a cake layer attached to the membrane module was verified but not recovered the recovery of organic matter could help to better close the cod mass balance since as can be seen from the gas composition there has been practically no anaerobic degradation of the concentrated organic matter this process permitted the recovery of a dense stream of concentrated wastewater and a permeate free of any particles with a minor loss of matter these losses however have been frequently reported by other researchers jin et al 22 using both coagulation and intermittent aeration with a normalized air flow rate of 0 12 m3 h with intermittent air blowing for 3 min every 15 min reported an inï¬uent organic matter recovery of nearly 70 with a mineralized cod representing about 19 of the total cod mass in the present work the loss of cod was higher at around 30 of the inlet cod not including however the cake layer at the end of the experiment kimura et al 48 working with two sequentially connected filtration tanks in which hollow fiber mf membrane modules were immersed set with a total hrt of about 3 1 h and without aeration have indicated from a cod mass balance that about 75 of the organic matter in the raw municipal wastewater was recovered organic matter losses may depend on the amount of air supplied to maintain the membrane operation the increases in airflow rate increase the oxidation of organic matter and consequently decrease the methane recovery also gong et al 42 working with different powdered active carbon concentrations showed around 72 1 and 75 7 of organic recovery in a concentrated form 14 2 and 12 8 of discharged organics in the effluent and 13 7 and 11 5 comprised by losses biomethane potential essays performed using the concentrated solids have pointed to an average specific methane production of 250 mlch4 gvssfed which is a reasonable result for that kind of primary wastewater 50 a simplified energy balance has been outlined in order to estimate the benefits of the gas scouring at intermittent regime and the benefits of a carbon harvest by the dmf from the primary municipal wastewater intermittent gas scouring essentially nitrogen gas n2 at 97 m h 40 s each 3 5 min operating in a closed circuit at 20 c was considered for the compressor requirements the membrane tank headspace was considered as having 30 mbar 0 03 atm of positive pressure a column of 1 0 m 0 1 atm of wastewater was considered for the gas scouring and an overall 1 5 m of head loss was used for the estimation and for the permeate pumping it was assumed that the system was controlled with 400 mbar of filtration pressure by pushing a filtration flux of 12 7 lmh of permeate in a cyclic filtration process regime consisting of 7 min filtration 5 s pause 30 s backwash and 5 s pause for the methane generation it is assumed that at least 95 of the vss from a wastewater contained an average 210 mgvss l would be retained within the membrane tank as concentrated stream and this stream would be conveyed to the anaerobic digestion process at 250 mlch4 gvssfed as specific methane production results showed energy consumption rates per cubic meter of permeate of 0 14 kw h m3 for the gas scouring and 0 01 kw h m3 for the permeate pumping and 0 19 kwh m3 for the power production considering 889 kj molch4 heat power and electrical efficiency of 35 therefore a surplus of 0 04 kw h m3 of the energy produced is reached in the dmf process and could cover minor requirements for the operation the intermittent regime for the gas scouring means an important practice for the energy savings the assumed cycle for the compressor means that it is operating during 16 of a continuous time regime otherwise the energy consumption would raise to 0 89 kw h m3 in continuous mode besides there are much room to improve the overall process and some considerations would significantly play in favor of the system for instance by reducing the air scouring velocity 80 m h reducing head losses 1 m and considering a higher specific methane production 300 mlch4 gvssfed a positive 0 13 kw h m3 is theoretically achievable it is worth noting that depending on the wastewater strength the permeate stream would carry an important fraction of dissolved organic matter and the anaerobic treatment at a low temperature an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor for example could be an interesting approach for extra energy production kimura et al 48 proposes a low energy consuming process such as a packed biological filter for treatment of the permeate recent studies have reported the feasibility of positive net electrical energy production through membrane based systems by coupling the pre concentration of municipal wastewater through direct membrane filtration with further anaerobic processes for the conversion of organic matter into biogas gong et al 42 reported a positive balance of between 0 050 and 0 029 kw h m3 whereas jin et al 49 indicated a net energy production of at least 0 0315 kw h m3 both authors also drew attention to the need to optimize processes which would certainly lead to more sustainable results in the systems 3 2 3 tmp behavior the continuous experiments have been operated with a constant feed flow rate of 10 l h and with intermittent gas scouring 40 s on and 3 5 min off with coarse bubbles from the bottom of the membrane module throughout the process it was necessary to increase the superficial gas velocity as the tmp increased in order to control membrane fouling thus the influence of gas scouring on the wastewater concentration was assessed the tmp behavior for the filtration is presented in fig 3 by the blue square dots the tmps have gradually decreased to values near to 400 mbar when a superficial gas velocity of 78 m h was applied later however a new gas velocity increase to 97 m h was needed in order to keep the membrane operating for longer in a range between 300 and 500 mbar of tmp since the feed and filtration flows were kept constant during the experiment membrane fouling and the possible formation of cake on the membrane surface were responsible for the tmp increase however this fouling seems to be reversible since the increase in gas scouring up to 97 m h allows the membrane to operate for a longer period periodic purging from the lower section of the tank has also contributed to the maintenance of the membrane operability these purges prevent high solid concentrations in the filtration section which otherwise would prompt the fouling formation the strategy of increasing the superficial gas scouring has enabled the concentration process in the long term other authors have addressed long term experiments by applying different antifouling methods this is the case of horstmeyer et al 51 who showed the importance of active carbon as a strategy to reduce membrane fouling while gong et al 42 demonstrated that the addition of powdered active carbon is an interesting approach for the reduction of membrane fouling due to the stronger flock formation the tmp of the backwash indicated by the graph with orange triangular dots decreased only slightly throughout the experiment this may suggest that the pore block effect occurred to a small extent and the resistance was mainly due to the reversible fouling the range of the tmps was similar to those reported by other authors working with direct sewage filtration for example gong et al 42 reported increasing tmps up to a maximum of 700 mbar which was the stable tmp over many days of continuous operation while the filtration fluxes decreased from about 10 l m2 h to nearly 5 l m2 h 3 2 4 effect of the gas scouring and the permeate backwash combined another noteworthy point is the combined effect of the gas scouring and permeate backwash fig 3 was constructed by taking the average tmp of 500 mbar measured pressure points recorded each 3 s by the picolog program in order to make it easier to appreciate of the filtration tendencies when it comes to individual measures of pressure the filtration pressures follow a different behavior pattern fig 4 illustrates an excerpt from a graph plotted by the picolog program with individual measures of pressures in two hours of operation according to the graph during the 7 min of the filtration stage the pressures were continuously dropping increasing tmp even with the periodical permeate backwash and gas scouring effect the backwash and gas scouring timer controls only coincide every 45 min approximately when operating separately these two antifouling strategies act by delaying the formation of the cake layer over the membrane not impeding however the subsequently increase in tmp however as they currently coincide every 45 min the filtration pressures rapidly decrease probably as a response to the loose effect over the cake layer due to the backwash and the dragging of solids caused by the gas scouring which leaves the filtration section free of most of the particles likewise the gas scouring may also contribute to make the cake layer over the membrane surface thinner and consequently decrease the filtration resistance once the backwash and gas scouring coincide the filtration pressures start dropping again until the next time they coincide as a result this strategy enables a more stable process for the wastewater up concentration while guaranteeing a better controlled pressure increase this behavior should be studied further in order for a precise conclusion to be drawn regarding the effects of these combined strategies 4 conclusions the dmf is a robust technology for concentrating the particulate matter from municipal wastewater favoring the harvest of the organic matter content by subsequent anaerobic treatment experiments determined that this operation is feasible for the concentration of organic matters up to 18 gtss l for moderate gas scouring velocities and permeate fluxes with sustainable threshold fluxes also the membrane fouling control by gas scouring over the membrane fibers can increase the threshold flux by 300 in a 33 gtss l wastewater filtration with gas scouring velocities increasing from 0 to 30 m h a long term experiment with intermittent gas scouring and permeate backwash resulted in a viable process reaching high solid concentration streams of

13735,municipal wastewater is recognized as having a high amount of biodegradable matter which is not easily hydrolyzed through anaerobic treatments in cold climate countries under proper operating conditions the direct membrane filtration dmf appears to be a feasible technology capable of efficiently separating and concentrating the primary wastewater for subsequent anaerobic digestion under mesophilic conditions the long term operation of a municipal wastewater concentration process was proved feasible with intermittent gas scouring 40 s of operation followed by a pause of 3 5 min and permeate backwash operating at 12 7 l m2 h feed with medium strength wastewaters a permeate stream below the discharge limit was obtained and the resulting concentrate streams presented levels of between 19 000 and 54 000 mg l of cod an estimated energy balance pointed to the self sufficiency of the process by allowing for an energy production of 0 19 kw h m3 through the anaerobic digestion while the power consumption for the gas scouring and pumping resulted in 0 15 kw h m3 experiments demonstrated that the threshold flux for a wastewater filtration is highly influenced by the gas scouring velocity the operation performed with 32 9 gtss l of primary concentrated wastewater indicated that the threshold fluxes increase by more than 300 through increasing the gas scouring velocities from 0 to 30 6 m h keywords primary wastewater concentration organic matter recovery anaerobic digestion ultrafiltration membrane 1 introduction a wide range of sustainable processes for municipal wastewater mw treatment have been studied and encouraged in order to improve or replace conventional systems in several wastewater treatment plants worldwide either to save energy to recover nutrients or to reduce environmental impacts 1 2 typical plants for mw treatment are based on the activated sludge as process which despite its effectiveness presents downsides including a high amount of energy expenditure of around 0 2 2 kw h m3 3 4 high excess sludge production 5 and the wasting of valuable organic content embedded in mw streams 6 which carries the potential to make the wastewater treatment plants self sufficient 7 8 all these authors have mentioned that there are several opportunities for energy savings in the current mw treatment plants from improvement in management practices to a better recovery of organic solids the anaerobic processes comprise the most prominent strategy capable of taking full advantage of the organic content from mw and their application either as standalone or combined processes should be further strengthened for mw treatment in both developed and developing countries 9 because of their low environmental impact such as the reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions and the potential positive net energy production by means of biogas cogeneration however the direct application of anaerobic processes to treat municipal wastewater faces some major drawbacks such as a high fraction of particulate cod moderate biodegradability and low strength with varying concentrations and usually low temperatures in this sense anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr have been shown as potential technologies capable of uniting both energy savings and minimal environmental impact nevertheless important challenges remain jeopardizing the efficiency of their application these challenges are mostly related to low temperature low rate of particulate matter biodegradation membrane fouling and the energy required for recirculation and crossflow velocity 10 11 at this point it is clear that a technology capable of separating and concentrating the particulate fraction from municipal wastewater would enhance the treatment by enabling the appropriate recovery of carbon content through the direct conveyance to anaerobic digestion under mesophilic thermophilic conditions this has been the approach taken by many researchers and some recent reviews have already been prepared in order to bring this theme into a broader discussion 12 14 different technologies are being studied in order to pre concentrate the mw such as high rate activated sludge system for carbon recovery 15 16 chemical enhanced primary treatment cept 17 dynamic membrane 18 19 direct osmosis 20 21 and direct membrane filtration dmf 22 26 direct membrane filtration has been the subject of growing interest as a prominent process for the mw up concentration by solving the problems associated with low temperature and power consumption therefore the objective of the dmf is to obtain a compact and loaded stream with high carbon content to be conveyed for biogas conversion and a major permeate stream with soluble cod and nutrients another process based on the coagulation adsorption enhanced membrane caem method which redesigns the c and n mass flows for energy neutral wastewater treatment has also been studied 27 the advantages of the dmf system are related to its extreme compactness small footprint and reduced energy consumption moreover the high concentrations of solids reached during the direct membrane filtration which can be digested to produce energy is a relevant feature when compared to the conventional activated sludge systems without the concentration process thus it can be expected that the direct membrane processes facilitate the achievement of better carbon neutrality values by simultaneous addressing both wastewater treatment and in some cases nutrient recovery through the addition of chemical reagents 28 however it is necessary to study the dmf process since there are few studies that have been conducted under continuous operation and most of these were carried out on a short term laboratory scale these limitations make it difficult to determine the operating parameters and the feasibility of the process 29 30 therefore the assessment of dmf operations for organic recovery from mw on larger long term scales are still necessary moreover assessment is required to determine the success of the dmf implementation depending on the strategies used to maintain the membrane module in operation by combining reasonable permeate fluxes and safe transmembrane pressures tmp without compromising the membrane itself and at the same time being able to fulfill their main goals from the theoretical point of view the critical flux value is an important piece of information which is necessary in order to perform a safe and feasible dmf process critical flux can be defined as the flux below which no fouling affects the filtration process in a short period of time or in other words the flux from which the cake layer formation starts to be noticeable or variable with time dtmp dt 0 in its strong definition as stated by field et al 31 however at long term operation both for real and synthetic wastewaters 32 the membrane fouling is perceived as a result of the accumulation of reversible and irreversible fouling even under subcritical conditions which is an inherent characteristic of dead end processes from a practical point of view and in order to provide useful guidance the concept of threshold flux jt is hereby implemented for the dmf operation as a flux at or below which a low and near constant rate of fouling occurs but above which the rate of fouling markedly increases 33 an immediate consequence of the threshold flux is the more subjective yet useful concept of sustainable flux which is defined as the net flux that can be maintained under the conditions particular to antifouling strategies considering an optimum balance of the operating costs 34 therefore considering a feasible long term operation of dmf system and putting into perspective the pragmatic threshold and sustainable fluxes membrane fouling is a great concern and therefore antifouling strategies have been the subject of discussion over the last years 25 35 different methods have been tested in order to avoid fouling during the mw concentration and their actions vary from producing large loose particles of solids using coagulation flocculation processes providing a shear force that detaches the cake layer from the membrane surface using air gas scouring 36 37 and also the application of permeate backwash and chemically enhanced backwash as strategies to minimize irreversible fouling 23 the aforementioned strategies are the most common that have been found in literature up until now and studies have reported good results when applying different arrangements of these antifouling methods within this framework the aim of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of mw up concentration in a continuous process by ultrafiltration membranes dmf process while strategies like permeate backwash intermittent gas scouring and periodical purging of the concentrate stream are being applied for fouling control in order to simulate the dmf under more severe conditions the threshold fluxes are studied with highly concentrated mw the energy balance of membrane consumption and biogas generation is calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane module setup the membrane module used in the experiments is a hollow fiber type zw 10 zenon ge with a mean pore size of 0 04 Î¼m and filtration area of 0 93 m2 at the bottom of the module there is a diffuser of coarse bubbles that provides the gas scouring to the membrane fibers the gas scouring flux was controlled by a rotameter 2 2 threshold flux setup the jt determination for the dmf of mw was performed in short term experiments following a flux step method in which the filtration flux was increased until the variation of tmp suffered a noticeable slope change the filtration flow was initially set at 2 l h and then subsequently increased by steps of 2 l h before each filtration the membrane was backwashed with clean water for 30 s with the same flux of filtration and then the membrane started to filtrate for a fixed period of 5 min the wastewater used in these experiments was collected from the downstream section of the grit chamber stage of the wwtp from the small town of renedo de esgueva spain the plant process is based on an activated sludge system previously to the experiment several stages of decantation and filtration were used to up concentrate two volumes of raw wastewater 1 2 m3 and 2 4 m3 resulting in two volumes of 16 l with 18 6 g tss l and 32 9 g tss l respectively these samples of concentrated raw wastewater were then used with the consideration that they could be achieved during the mw up concentration process by operating as a long term continuous process the jt was determined for the two concentrations of wastewater as well as different superficial gas velocities vg for each concentration 0 10 2 20 4 and 30 6 m h the experiments were conducted in a pvc cylindrical tube of 0 15 m in diameter and 1 8 m high in order to maintain a constant solid concentration in the bulk of the wastewater inside the tube the filtrations were performed in a closed circuit so as to return the permeate effluent to the pvc cylinder the superficial gas velocity was calculated taking into account the transversal area of the pvc cylinder the permeate line was equipped with a pressure transmitter endress hauser pmc 131 1 to 1 bar valladolid es and during the experiments the mw samples remained constant at 20 c 2 2 1 membrane cleaning before each experiment with the different solid concentrations 18 6 gtss l and 32 9 g tss l the membrane module was chemically cleaned and its permeability was then determined each chemical cleaning consisted of 4 stages including 1 physical cleaning tap water jet and soft sponge and 3 chemical cleanings soaking for 2 h in 1 000 ppm naclo while undergoing agitation with air blowing repeat procedure followed by soaking for 2 h in 1 0 w v citric acid under agitation moreover during the experiment with the same solid concentration but changing the superficial gas velocities the membrane module was only physically cleaned out of place with a jet of tap water and a soft sponge and following this its permeability was also determined 2 2 2 membrane permeability the permeability of the membrane after the short term flux step method was determined a pvc cylindrical tube with clean water at 20 c was used for the characterization the procedure used for the permeability determination consisted of measuring the tmp response in accordance with the applied filtration fluxes 2 3 long term continuous municipal wastewater concentration process by direct membrane filtration the municipal wastewater concentration process was carried out in a continuously operating pilot plant the characteristics of the wastewater feed are presented in table 1 the discharge limit for the treated urban wastewater is 125 mg l cod data in brackets are the standard deviations the pilot plant was composed of a vertical polypropylene tank 1 76 m in height and 0 34 m in diameter with a useful volume of 126 l as indicated in fig 1 the hollow fiber membrane module zw 10 zenon ge is placed within the upper section of this tank in the continuous experiments the membrane was surrounded by an airlift a cylindrical protector made of pvc 0 15 m in diameter and 0 69 m in height the airlift length completely covers the extension of the membrane module the membrane tank has several sampling points sp which were used for sampling in this experiment the feed entrance to the membrane tank sp 1 the filtration section sp 2 the control of the concentrate section sp 3 sp 4 and sp 5 and the permeate line sp 6 the cylinder and the internal elements are practically to scale peristaltic pumps were used for the feed watson marlon 520s and filtration backwash line watson marlon 520u the feed wastewater sp 1 is conducted through a centrical tube to the bottom of the membrane tank this centrical tube works as a deflector by hindering the larger particles from rising out of the feed wastewater and into the filtration section the feed wastewater sp 1 reaches the center and is directed downwards the sedimentation concentration section comprises a total volume of 32 9 l between the feed entrance sp 1 and the bottom of the membrane tank sp 5 the concentrated solids are periodically purged from the lower section sp 5 in order to keep the membrane in continuous operation permeate backwash and intermittent gas scouring were used as antifouling methods the filtration cycle was composed of four periods 0 5 min backwash 5 s pause 7 min filtration and 5 s pause again therefore the filtration time corresponded to 91 3 of the total filtration cycle the membrane module was subjected to scouring provided by closed circuit recirculation in the headspace of the membrane tank using a compressor secoh sv50 barcelona es the gas velocity was calculated by taking into account the established gas flow through the transversal area of the airlift the velocity was controlled using a rotameter and the compressor regime was set to operate intermittently using a timer control for 40 s of operation time followed by a 3 5 min pause the plant was equipped with pressure transmitters endress hauser pmc 131 1 to 1 bar valladolid es in the permeate backwash line and in the headspace of the membrane tank the picolog technology ltd data acquisition system was used to monitor and store the data regarding temperature and filtration pressures 2 4 chemical assays and sampling total cod soluble cod total solids ts volatile solids vs total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 38 samples for the long term operation process were collected periodically every 2 days approx from the sampling points labelled sp 1 sp 5 and sp 6 in order to monitor the concentration process 2 5 biochemical methane potential assay biochemical methane potential assays bmp at mesophilic 35 1 0 3 c conditions were carried out in order to assess the biodegradability of the concentrated solids from the primary wastewater purged in the lower section of the membrane tank sp 5 the tests were performed in triplicate the anaerobic inoculum used was obtained from a pilot sludge digester and pre incubated for two days 35 1 0 3 c to minimize its residual biodegradable organic matter content a blank test without substrate was included serum bottles with a volume of 160 ml were used in the bmp tests with a reaction volume of 80 ml the inoculum ratio s x was 0 4 gvsssubs gvssinoc the bottles were sealed using rubber septa and aluminum crimp caps and then gassed with helium and subjected to continuous agitation in an orbital shaker biogas production was estimated by measuring the pressure in the headspace of the bottles and the biogas composition biogas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph varian cp 3800 palo alto ca usa coupled with a thermal conductivity detector and equipped with a cp molsieve 5a 15 m x0 53 mm x15 Î¼m and cp pora bond q 25 m x0 53 mm x15 Î¼m columns the specific methane yield smy ml ch4 gvsfed was calculated by dividing the net methane production associated with the substrate by the quantity of volatile solids from the substrate at the beginning of the test 3 results and discussion 3 1 threshold flux determination using primary wastewater sludge 3 1 1 the effect of gas scouring and solid concentrations the graphics shown in fig 2 are the results of the jt determination for each jt determination the fluxes are increased until the tmp reached a maximum value of 400 mbar this value was chosen as a safe working pressure in order not to damage the membrane module and even when the jt was reached with tmp under 400 mbar except in one case fig 2f the filtration fluxes were still raised up to 400 mbar in order to appreciate the increasing slopes the adopted arbitrary limit for the jt determination was based on the observed slope values for the graphics tmp mbar vs time min dtmp dt in accordance with the procedure followed by other authors 39 41 the criterion established here is that the threshold flux is the flux at which dtmp dt is immediately inferior to the unit as presented in fig 2 according to this assumption the jt can never promote an increase of 1 mbar min this consideration for the current experiment allows the threshold flux variation to be determined without incurring qualitative error besides establishing a fouling rate which can be appreciated through observation the gas scouring velocity and the solid concentrations in wastewater have a remarkable effect on the membrane surface and hence in the obtained threshold fluxes when comparing the jt for the two solid concentrations assayed a notable increase is observed in the resulting jt as the superficial gas velocities increase these increases in jt due to the increases of gas velocities caused enhancements of 500 and 300 respectively to the lower and higher concentrations besides increasing the wastewater concentration severely affects the threshold fluxes for the same applied gas scouring it is interesting to take note of the fact that for industrial purposes the balance between the sustainable permeate flux and the superficial gas velocities applied might be more valuable than the objective of reaching the maximum permeate flux even though it means an extra operating cost the operation with 18 6 gtss l wastewater seems to be achievable in a continuous process with low to medium filtration fluxes and tmp and moderate gas scouring as exemplified by the conditions of figs 2b and 2c as reported by gong et al 42 the long term ultrafiltration of municipal wastewater under high concentrations of tss above 20 0 g l is feasible employing enhanced preconcentration and air backflushing over a two month operation period the higher jt obtained for the first train of experiments is due to the ease of cleaning the membrane surface at this stage since the solid concentration is lower and therefore the fouling layer is more fragile and more susceptible to being detached by the gas scouring for the second train of experiments with a solid concentration of 32 9 gtss l the threshold fluxes determined were maintained at 2 2 lmh for the first three superficial gas velocities applied the jt only increased to 6 5 lmh when the superficial gas velocity was increased to 30 6 m h indicating that depending on the concentration of solids in raw wastewater the jt may not have varied until a sufficient gas scouring velocity was applied to disturb the fouling layer on the membrane surface from the data collected in all experiments the critical flux in its strict concept was never attained even with the lower flux of 2 2 lmh the dtmp dt values measured were positive indicating some degree of fouling this is precisely the conclusion of le clech et al 32 who were operating a submerged membrane bioreactor with real and synthetic wastewaters these authors indicate that there is a flux a so called weak form of critical flux from which the fouling starts to be significant and although difficult to determine with precision it is useful for comparing fouling tendencies these authors reported that these critical fluxes might be around 10 lmh when working with 3 g l of mlss concentration for the both the synthetic and real wastewaters investigated furthermore as found in this research the membrane filtration without gas scouring usually leads to a rapid and accentuated dropping of the critical threshold fluxes bottino et al 43 working with a fixed 3 l min of air scouring reported a decrease of 2 5 times in the critical flux by increasing the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss from 3 to 14 g l after performing a submerged filtration with a polyethylene membrane in an mbr process the authors also verified the same tendency by using a pvdf membrane by changing the mlss from 3 to 8 g l a decrease in the critical flux from 14 7 to 12 1 lmh was obtained from the economical point of view higher solid concentrations mean lower filtration fluxes and high demand for a higher superficial gas velocity which leads the system to expend extra energy 44 however the concept of operating at subcritical or at below the threshold flux seems to solve many of the concerns regarding submerged membranes for direct wastewater filtration investigations have been indicating that this approach brings the industrial processes into long term sustainable operation and that the benefits are diverse comprising environmental protection technical simplicity and being economically attractive 34 3 1 2 membrane permeability during the threshold flux determination the membrane module had been previously used in other experiments not mentioned in this work so before using it for the jt determination it was soaked in clean water and following chemical cleaning it presented an initial permeability of 0 72 mbar lmh throughout both experiments for the jt determination the first one with 18 6 gtss l and the second one with 32 9 gtss l the increase in the membrane fouling was also perceived by the decrease in its permeability caused by the physical cleanings in the first experiment the permeability decreased from 0 72 mbar lmh to 0 47 mbar lmh while after the 4th physical cleaning and for the second experiment these permeabilities corresponded to 0 75 mbar lmh and 0 44 mbar lmh respectively this indicates that despite the physical cleanings and the backwash at the beginning of the jt determinations the fouling was being accumulated on the membrane pores indicating that physical cleaning alone is not enough to ensure the recovery of membrane permeability moreover the decreasing permeabilities have probably influenced the threshold flux results if the membrane was completely restored with physical cleanings the threshold fluxes after the first experiment would probably be higher than the current threshold fluxes measured since the physical protocols were not sufficient for restoring the initial membrane permeability the fouling was classified as irreversible 45 however the chemical cleaning with naclo and citric acid dissolution before the second train was able to efficiently restore the permeability to the value at the beginning of the experiments proving this to be an important procedure in promoting the membrane filterability at least in the short term the use of these reagents however require caution and long term assessment is desirable in order to better understand the behavior in the long term 46 the naclo does not cause severe damages to the structure of the pvdf membranes but its long term application may cause changes to the membrane surface and to its hydrophilicity characteristics as verified by wang et al 47 on the other hand the mildness of the citric acid associated with its rinsability for inorganic foulants 48 actually stimulates its application either alone or coupled with oxidizing reagents 30 3 2 long term continuous municipal wastewater concentration process by direct membrane filtration 3 2 1 wastewater concentration process a continuous experiment for urban wastewater up concentration was carried out with intermittent gas scouring the operating conditions for the continuous experiment are presented in table 2 the operation proved to be efficient for the concentration process ensuring the production of a stable permeate completely free of suspended particles moreover the total cod in the effluent has been reduced by 85 allowing only the soluble matter to remain in the permeate stream jin et al 49 also showed an average cod removal of 94 with a physicochemical based enhanced membrane coagulation reactor e mcr during a continuous operation process zhao et al 28 found similar cod reduction around 90 in both cases however previous coagulation processes were performed the process has been shown as feasible reaching high concentrations of organic matter fitting with the desirable concentrations for a subsequent anaerobic digestion the concentrated solids were periodically purged with an average volume estimated as 4 l each 4 days this stream presented concentrations in the range of 19 000 54 000 mg l cod with an average 30 720 8 058 mg l therefore being characterized as a high loaded the concentration of this stream of solids is variable depending on the flow and the frequency of the purges performed the obtained concentrations of ts were between 17 68 and 32 29 g l with an average 24 02 4 13 g l and vs were between 12 42 and 23 02 g l with an average 16 65 2 79 g l the resulted ts content are of the same order as those used in the experiments for the threshold flux nevertheless due to the membrane tank design and the frequency of purges performed these values are only reached in the lower section and not in the filtration zone in keeping with the objective the membrane tank height allows the filtration design to be separated in two zones the upper section where the membrane is located and the lower section or concentration section where the particulate matter is thus concentrated because of this design the tss concentration remained at around 0 47 g l in the filtration section sp 2 which implies a remarkable stratification with respect to the concentration section the effect of the gas scouring and the air lift have also contributed to this behavior and hence to a lower rate of membrane fouling samples from the sampling points sp 3 and sp 4 see fig 1 were periodically collected in order to measure the ts concentrations and then to control the height of the concentrate volume along the experiment the ts concentrations have varied between 4 and 32 gts l for the sp 4 and between 2 and 7 gts l for the sp 3 which indicates that the majority of solids are sedimented at the lower section of the membrane tank 32 9 l between sp1 and sp 5 with higher concentration values in the first 16 l comprised between the sp 4 and the sp 5 high concentrate streams have also been achieved by other authors jin et al 22 working with cycles consisting of 12 min permeation followed by 3 min relaxation at doses of 30 mg l polyaluminum chloride pac over a 295 h continuous concentration period reached a cod concentration around 16 000 mg l nevertheless the cod concentration reached in the present work is even higher being achieved every four days when the purge is carried out and without the addition of coagulants gong et al 42 also adding coagulants together with controlled filtration 10 min permeation and 2 min membrane relaxation and air backflushing 25 s on during the relaxation period in continuous operation were able to reach a cod concentration of around 23 000 mg l when the amounts of entering and discharging organics were balanced jin et al 49 on the other hand also with an enhanced membrane coagulation reactor e mcr in a long term process with air backflushing 200 kpa of pressure during 30 s each 5 min30 s and 1d of concentrate retention time reported a cod concentration of 9 700 mg l with 94 of recovery 3 2 2 cod ts balance in order to avoid oxidation and to check for the possible loss of organic matter the experiment was carried out closed off from the atmosphere initially the composition of the gas chamber was essentially air nevertheless as time went on the oxygen was consumed and the predominant gas became nitrogen the gas within the membrane tank was analyzed throughout the experiment resulting in an average final composition of 95 of n2 4 of o2 2 of co2 0 7 of ch4 and 0 1 of h2s which indicates a negligible conversion rate of cod through anaerobic digestion otherwise the carbon dioxide and methane proportion were expected to be higher the mass balance was carried out over the entire period of operation by the integration of the individual data collected during the experiment regarding the total cod content 16 of the soluble cod was drained out of the membrane tank in the permeate stream and the purged streams contained about 54 of the total cod in the feed thus the theoretical losses of matter corresponded to 30 of the total feed cod these differences in the mass balance are probably due to the loading variation in the wastewater feed throughout the day that actually influenced the precision of the mass balance besides after the experiment the membrane tank was opened and a cake layer attached to the membrane module was verified but not recovered the recovery of organic matter could help to better close the cod mass balance since as can be seen from the gas composition there has been practically no anaerobic degradation of the concentrated organic matter this process permitted the recovery of a dense stream of concentrated wastewater and a permeate free of any particles with a minor loss of matter these losses however have been frequently reported by other researchers jin et al 22 using both coagulation and intermittent aeration with a normalized air flow rate of 0 12 m3 h with intermittent air blowing for 3 min every 15 min reported an inï¬uent organic matter recovery of nearly 70 with a mineralized cod representing about 19 of the total cod mass in the present work the loss of cod was higher at around 30 of the inlet cod not including however the cake layer at the end of the experiment kimura et al 48 working with two sequentially connected filtration tanks in which hollow fiber mf membrane modules were immersed set with a total hrt of about 3 1 h and without aeration have indicated from a cod mass balance that about 75 of the organic matter in the raw municipal wastewater was recovered organic matter losses may depend on the amount of air supplied to maintain the membrane operation the increases in airflow rate increase the oxidation of organic matter and consequently decrease the methane recovery also gong et al 42 working with different powdered active carbon concentrations showed around 72 1 and 75 7 of organic recovery in a concentrated form 14 2 and 12 8 of discharged organics in the effluent and 13 7 and 11 5 comprised by losses biomethane potential essays performed using the concentrated solids have pointed to an average specific methane production of 250 mlch4 gvssfed which is a reasonable result for that kind of primary wastewater 50 a simplified energy balance has been outlined in order to estimate the benefits of the gas scouring at intermittent regime and the benefits of a carbon harvest by the dmf from the primary municipal wastewater intermittent gas scouring essentially nitrogen gas n2 at 97 m h 40 s each 3 5 min operating in a closed circuit at 20 c was considered for the compressor requirements the membrane tank headspace was considered as having 30 mbar 0 03 atm of positive pressure a column of 1 0 m 0 1 atm of wastewater was considered for the gas scouring and an overall 1 5 m of head loss was used for the estimation and for the permeate pumping it was assumed that the system was controlled with 400 mbar of filtration pressure by pushing a filtration flux of 12 7 lmh of permeate in a cyclic filtration process regime consisting of 7 min filtration 5 s pause 30 s backwash and 5 s pause for the methane generation it is assumed that at least 95 of the vss from a wastewater contained an average 210 mgvss l would be retained within the membrane tank as concentrated stream and this stream would be conveyed to the anaerobic digestion process at 250 mlch4 gvssfed as specific methane production results showed energy consumption rates per cubic meter of permeate of 0 14 kw h m3 for the gas scouring and 0 01 kw h m3 for the permeate pumping and 0 19 kwh m3 for the power production considering 889 kj molch4 heat power and electrical efficiency of 35 therefore a surplus of 0 04 kw h m3 of the energy produced is reached in the dmf process and could cover minor requirements for the operation the intermittent regime for the gas scouring means an important practice for the energy savings the assumed cycle for the compressor means that it is operating during 16 of a continuous time regime otherwise the energy consumption would raise to 0 89 kw h m3 in continuous mode besides there are much room to improve the overall process and some considerations would significantly play in favor of the system for instance by reducing the air scouring velocity 80 m h reducing head losses 1 m and considering a higher specific methane production 300 mlch4 gvssfed a positive 0 13 kw h m3 is theoretically achievable it is worth noting that depending on the wastewater strength the permeate stream would carry an important fraction of dissolved organic matter and the anaerobic treatment at a low temperature an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor for example could be an interesting approach for extra energy production kimura et al 48 proposes a low energy consuming process such as a packed biological filter for treatment of the permeate recent studies have reported the feasibility of positive net electrical energy production through membrane based systems by coupling the pre concentration of municipal wastewater through direct membrane filtration with further anaerobic processes for the conversion of organic matter into biogas gong et al 42 reported a positive balance of between 0 050 and 0 029 kw h m3 whereas jin et al 49 indicated a net energy production of at least 0 0315 kw h m3 both authors also drew attention to the need to optimize processes which would certainly lead to more sustainable results in the systems 3 2 3 tmp behavior the continuous experiments have been operated with a constant feed flow rate of 10 l h and with intermittent gas scouring 40 s on and 3 5 min off with coarse bubbles from the bottom of the membrane module throughout the process it was necessary to increase the superficial gas velocity as the tmp increased in order to control membrane fouling thus the influence of gas scouring on the wastewater concentration was assessed the tmp behavior for the filtration is presented in fig 3 by the blue square dots the tmps have gradually decreased to values near to 400 mbar when a superficial gas velocity of 78 m h was applied later however a new gas velocity increase to 97 m h was needed in order to keep the membrane operating for longer in a range between 300 and 500 mbar of tmp since the feed and filtration flows were kept constant during the experiment membrane fouling and the possible formation of cake on the membrane surface were responsible for the tmp increase however this fouling seems to be reversible since the increase in gas scouring up to 97 m h allows the membrane to operate for a longer period periodic purging from the lower section of the tank has also contributed to the maintenance of the membrane operability these purges prevent high solid concentrations in the filtration section which otherwise would prompt the fouling formation the strategy of increasing the superficial gas scouring has enabled the concentration process in the long term other authors have addressed long term experiments by applying different antifouling methods this is the case of horstmeyer et al 51 who showed the importance of active carbon as a strategy to reduce membrane fouling while gong et al 42 demonstrated that the addition of powdered active carbon is an interesting approach for the reduction of membrane fouling due to the stronger flock formation the tmp of the backwash indicated by the graph with orange triangular dots decreased only slightly throughout the experiment this may suggest that the pore block effect occurred to a small extent and the resistance was mainly due to the reversible fouling the range of the tmps was similar to those reported by other authors working with direct sewage filtration for example gong et al 42 reported increasing tmps up to a maximum of 700 mbar which was the stable tmp over many days of continuous operation while the filtration fluxes decreased from about 10 l m2 h to nearly 5 l m2 h 3 2 4 effect of the gas scouring and the permeate backwash combined another noteworthy point is the combined effect of the gas scouring and permeate backwash fig 3 was constructed by taking the average tmp of 500 mbar measured pressure points recorded each 3 s by the picolog program in order to make it easier to appreciate of the filtration tendencies when it comes to individual measures of pressure the filtration pressures follow a different behavior pattern fig 4 illustrates an excerpt from a graph plotted by the picolog program with individual measures of pressures in two hours of operation according to the graph during the 7 min of the filtration stage the pressures were continuously dropping increasing tmp even with the periodical permeate backwash and gas scouring effect the backwash and gas scouring timer controls only coincide every 45 min approximately when operating separately these two antifouling strategies act by delaying the formation of the cake layer over the membrane not impeding however the subsequently increase in tmp however as they currently coincide every 45 min the filtration pressures rapidly decrease probably as a response to the loose effect over the cake layer due to the backwash and the dragging of solids caused by the gas scouring which leaves the filtration section free of most of the particles likewise the gas scouring may also contribute to make the cake layer over the membrane surface thinner and consequently decrease the filtration resistance once the backwash and gas scouring coincide the filtration pressures start dropping again until the next time they coincide as a result this strategy enables a more stable process for the wastewater up concentration while guaranteeing a better controlled pressure increase this behavior should be studied further in order for a precise conclusion to be drawn regarding the effects of these combined strategies 4 conclusions the dmf is a robust technology for concentrating the particulate matter from municipal wastewater favoring the harvest of the organic matter content by subsequent anaerobic treatment experiments determined that this operation is feasible for the concentration of organic matters up to 18 gtss l for moderate gas scouring velocities and permeate fluxes with sustainable threshold fluxes also the membrane fouling control by gas scouring over the membrane fibers can increase the threshold flux by 300 in a 33 gtss l wastewater filtration with gas scouring velocities increasing from 0 to 30 m h a long term experiment with intermittent gas scouring and permeate backwash resulted in a viable process reaching high solid concentration streams of

low coordination properties better spectroscopic individualities and architectural ï¬exibility which make them interesting in various experimental and specialized fields 51 3 effects of dye pollutants on environment and human health thousands of dyes are available commercially and used in various industries 34 66 dyeing and finishing salts are highly used in dye manufacturing and released with industrial wastewater which increases toxicity of the wastewater 67 if untreated effluent is released into the environment it may show mutagenic carcinogenic and genotoxic effects on animals as well as humans 66 dye industries use many types of chemicals such as soaps nitrates acetic acid sulfur chromium vat dyes and naphthol compounds auxiliary chemicals and heavy metals like cadmium nickel cobalt lead copper arsenic and mercury that are responsible for the high toxicity of effluent 67 about forty percent of colorants contain organically bound chlorine which is a carcinogen 68 direct discharge of untreated effluent into the water bodies may increase temperature turbidity gives bad order change ph and color which disturb aquatic environment and also affect quality of water used for drinking purpose by humans and animals 68 69 turbidity and changed color prevent diffusion of sunlight into water decreases dissolved oxygen and adversely affects aquatic organisms 70 several dyes have been reported showing negative impacts on the as shown in table 2 4 remediation of pollutants from the dye industry effluent it has been reported that in developed countries treated wastewater is around fifty to ninety five percent while in developing countries eighty percent efï¬uents are released into lakes and rivers without proper treatment industrial wastewater has been demonstrated as a source of organic pollutants synthetic dyes and heavy metals 78 79 industrial wastewater treatment requires multiple operations and designs a large number of chemicals a high level of process regulator and daily maintenance maintenance of complex systems requires a group of technical staff to oversee the treatment of wastewater and maintenance of effluent treatment plants it also requires strict pollution control norms 80 treatment of wastewater can be done using various techniques and methods such as phytoremediation nanotechnological methods electrochemical techniques ultra filtration absorption sedimentation microbial remediation precipitation evaporation distillation and periphyton or periphytic biofilm etc 81 90 nanotechnological approaches and microbial electrochemical technologies have been discussed in this paper 4 1 nanotechnological approaches nanotechnology has been considered as advanced technology for remediation of organic pollutants it also includes safe nanomaterial designing which promotes ecological development of materials with environmental benefits 91 92 nanotechnology is the nanoscale 1 100 nm manipulation of matter in various fields like chemistry engineering biology and material science 93 nanotechnological approaches such as activated carbons ac 94 nano catalyst 95 nano membranes 96 nano

of nanomaterials are highly responsible for adsorption capability silver bromide based nanomaterials have been reported to have high efficiency for remediation of organic dyes such as orange g methyl orange acid red 18 and indigo carmine 108 abbasi et al 109 have reported 80 degradation of congo red and 70 degradation of crystal violet using zinc sulfide silver sulfide zns ag2s nanoparticles sarioglu et al 110 studied degradation of methylene blue mb using bacterial encapsulated electrospun nanofibrous webs and reported 69 degradation with pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 47085 polyethylene oxide peo web and 68 degradation with pseudomonas aeruginosa polyvinyl alcohol pva web 4 2 microbial electrochemical technologies mets microbes have capacity to oxidize organic waste by metabolic reactions on anode and reduction process recovers valuable product or generates biofuel on the cathode aerobic organisms use oxygen and anaerobic organisms use carbon dioxide nitrate or sulfate these processes make microorganisms as the center of attraction in met 111 112 there are two types of microbes involved in the met process i microorganisms that are not able to donate electrons directly to an anode and require mediators like bacillus sp and escherichia coli ii microorganisms electroactive bacteria eab that can donate electrons directly to an anode such as geobacter sulfurreducens and shewanella putrefaciens 112 mets employ microorganisms to catalyse various electrochemical reactions eg electrical power production by microbial fuel cells mfcs microbes gain energy by catalysing redox reactions breakdown of inorganic organic pollutants or respiration bacteria can transport electrons extracellularly by nanowires endogenous mediators and outer membrane cytochromes whereas yeast and algae can extracellularly transport electrons by mediated and direct electron transport 111 113 cui et al 114 have reported 95 decolorization of alizarin yellow r in concentration range from 30 to 120 mg l within 24 h by using electrochemically active bacteria eab fu et al 115 studied degradation of methyl orange mo using aerobic methane oxidizing microbes such as candidatus methanoperedens and pseudoxanthomonas sp which showed 47 91 mg l d degradation rate of methyl orange mani et al 116 have reported 80 decolorization of acid orange 7 with mfc dye cathode microbial fuel cell with shewanella oneidensis mr1 at the anode dye and laccase enzyme at the cathode and 20 decolorization of acid orange 7 with mfc dye anode microbial fuel cell with dye and shewanella oneidensis mr1 at the anode and laccase enzyme at the cathode organic pollutants such as cod methyl orange acid orange 7 zinc etc can be removed using various mets such as single chamber microbial fuel cell hollow fiber membrane bioreactor microbial fuel cell etc as narrated in table 3 schematic diagram for microbial electrochemical technology is shown in fig 1 4 3 other approaches wastewater treatment generally involves three stages called primary secondary and tertiary treatment 129 biological approach is the most effective due to its eco friendly nature low sludge generation and complete mineralization of organic pollutants 130 132 various bacteria yeast fungi algae and plants have been used for bioremediation of organic pollutants 83 available literature shows bioremediation can be affected by different microbial metabolic mechanisms and growth conditions 133 biological remediation of organic pollutants can be archived by enzymes such as oxidoreductase laccase azoreductase and peroxidase 134 137 advanced oxidation processes aop s such as photocatalysis 138 fenton 139 and photo fenton 140 and hydrodynamic cavitation 141 have been widely investigated for degradation of organic pollutants kumar et al 142 have reported 100 decolorization of ternary dyes methylene blue methyl orange and rhodamine b and 8 53 16 95 reduction of total organic carbon toc when hydrodynamic cavitation hc combined with h2o2 they have reported 98 28 decolorization of dye mixture and 38 42 reduction of toc when they have used hc fenton process however 98 decolorization of dye mixture and 41 28 toc reduction was noted when the hc photo fenton process was applied 82 13 dye decolorization and 15 63 toc reduction was observed by them when hc photocatalytic process was used 74 53 dye decolorization and 14 01 reduction of toc were observed by them when hydrodynamic cavitation was applied along with the photolytic process 5 factors affecting dye degradation dye industrial effluent contains various types of dyes along with other structurally different dyestuffs ph temperature aeration metals and other compounds present in effluent affects dye degradation rate many compounds present in industrial effluent due to their toxicity adversely affect microbial growth too 5 75 the factors affecting dye degradation have been summarized here 5 1 ph and temperature ph plays a key role in remediation process and also affects microbial growth 143 101 a ph of the wastewater depends on the type of dye and salts used during the dying process and based on that it can be neutral acidic or alkaline kumar et al 142 have observed 30 56 decolorization of tannery dye at 3 ph 28 23 decolorization at 2 ph and 8 3 of decolorization at 9 ph a high remediation rate can be achieved by a selection of microorganism that is able to grow at ph of effluent or b adjustment of effluent ph that supports dye degrader s growth of 144 temperature of dye effluent affects diffusion mineralization and chemical process 145 maximum microbial growth can be observed at the optimum temperature during biological treatment microbial growth can be affected by extreme temperatures i e either low or high 144 145 most microbes are mesophilic and require optimum temperature around 30 40 which increases degradation rate of dye however role of several thermophilic organisms has been reported for dye remediation at elevated temperatures 4 146 ma et al 147 have reported 98 34 and 86 87 removal of cr vi by aeribacillus pallidus bk1 at 20 mg l and 100 mg l cr vi concentration respectively aeribacillus pallidus bk1 required optimum temperature was 60 c literature is available stating that high temperature decreases decolorization rate to solve this problem cooling pre treatment is used to decrease temperature of dye effluent which increases bacterial activity to remove dye from wastewater 148 5 2 electron acceptors electron acceptors play an important role in remediation of dye effluent by altering microbial metabolism 149 based on requirement of oxygen microorganisms can be divided as aerobic anaerobic and semi aerobic types oxygen plays an important role in the catalysis process 150 the availability of oxygen affects separation of electron hole pairs in photo catalysis photo generated electrons go through dissolved oxygen molecules to yield highly oxidative sp superoxide radical anions and hydroxyl radicals and are associated with dye degradation 151 aerobic organisms contain oxygenase enzyme for the degradation of dyes whereas carboxylation or other mechanisms are employed by anaerobic organisms to degrade dye molecules 152 however enzymes like azoreductase and laccase are sensitive to oxygen and do not require oxygen for the degradation process 153 shaking conditions provide uniform distribution of oxygen molecules during aerobic processes oxidative enzymes are required for aerobic conditions in remediation of dye whereas anaerobic condition increases the activity of reductive enzymes 154 155 5 3 concentration and molecular weight of dye dye degrading bacteria may not be able to detect a low concentration of dye whereas high dye concentration can block the active site of enzymes and show a toxic effect on microbes molecular weight and dye structure also affect the remediation rate of dye industry wastewater 156 157 it has been reported that as dye concentration increases photocatalytic activity decreases 158 5 4 soluble salts and heavy metals dye industry wastewater contain a high quantity of salts because of employing high salt for dying it is essential to see the influence of salt concentration on remediation process 159 salts like nacl nano3 and na2so4 are generally used to develop fixation of dye and increase ionic strength on fabrics however these salts have been released in dye wastewater with discharge of dye contaminants 144 160 dye industrial wastewater consists of heavy metals that are toxic and may vary in concentration and types the level of heavy metal present in wastewater may be influenced by dyeing process which contains use of complex metal dye or metal bacterial growth and enzymatic activities are inhibited by heavy metal found in dye effluent the tolerance capacity of heavy metal by microorganisms varies with bacterial strain it has been noted that metals also complicate remediation process and waste management aspects of the processes 161 6 value added products from dye industrial effluents wastewater contains different types of pollutants but it also contains valuable products like chemicals fuels metals nutrients salts etc in it which can be recovered from wastewater 162 algae are highly used for remediation due to high photosynthetic capability high growth rate low carbon footprint less generation time and high lipid productivity 132 apart from algae other microorganisms like rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa rhodopseudomonas faecalis moorella thermoautotrophica and rhodopseudomonas palustris have also been reported in the recovery of value added products 163 164 various value added products from dye industry wastewater can be recovered as shown in fig 2 6 1 energy microorganisms have been reported to have the capacity to convert chemical energy into electrical energy using organic components present in the wastewater 165 166 distance between electrodes has a significant effect on power production kalathil et al 167 have reported that short distance increases power density and performance of mfc can be improved whereas long distance increases loss of ohmic enriched electrochemically active bacteria present on the anode can also increase power density 33 green microalgae contain chlorophyll and generate electrons in presence of light through respiration or photosynthesis electron transport chain transports the electrons and finally results in production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and adenosine triphosphate 168 mishra et al 169 have studied decolorization and bioenergy generation using microbial fuel cell mfc from real dye wastewater which has shown 83 decolorization 940 61 5 mw m2 power density and 790 5 mv voltage output generation logrono et al 117 have achieved a maximum of 123 2 27 5 mw m3 volumetric power density using a single chamber microbial fuel cell scmfc different treatment technologies microbial fuel cell hydrothermal gasification constructed wetland microbial fuel cell etc have been reported for degradation of organic pollutants such as cod acid orange 7 congo red etc with simultaneous recovery of value added products such as bio energy as depicted in table 4 6 2 biofuels microalgae can be used to remediate dye industry wastewater and have been demonstrated to have applications in biofuel production 173 microalgae such as haematococcus pluvialis chlorella vulgaris spirogyra sp scenedesmus sp and chlorophyceae etc have been demonstrated for their utilization in remediation process because they are economical and sustainable feedstock for production of biofuel and also used for production of carbohydrates pigments immune modulators proteins polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamins 132 researchers have noted that microalgae based biofuel and petroleum have similar chemical and physical characteristics conversion technology based microbial biofuel can be classified into four categories i biochemical conversion ii photosynthetic microbial fuel cell iii thermo chemical conversion and iv transesterification 174 sharma et al 175 have reported 84 01 biofuel production using chlorella vulgariswith two step microwave assisted acid base transesterification tripathi et al 176 have reported 452 mg l lipid production using green microalgae scenedesmus sp istga1 6 3 nutrients and other value added products recovery of nutrients such as ammonia potassium and phosphorus from dye industry wastewater is beneficial as it leads to both mitigation of environmental pollution and resource recovery 177 recovered and purified nutrients nitrogen phosphorus can be used to make organic fertilizers for agricultural and ecological use 144 li et al 178 have reported 66 5 3 nitrogen and 66 7 4 7 phosphate recovery using multi ion exchange membrane iem stack microbial electrolysis desalination cell medc reddy and mohan 179 have reported the conversion of nh4 to nitrates in the cathode chamber by aerobic biocatalyst activity nitrates then can be used as bio fertilizer dye industry wastewater also contains heavy metals that can be recovered using different technologies chromium cr is generally used in different industrial applications such as dye manufacturing tanning and wood product processing in microbial fuel cell mfc acidic cr vi can be used as a cathode electron acceptor which in turn would help in toxicity reduction of cr vi as well as simultaneously produce electricity reduction of cr2o7 2 to cr2o3 helps in removing cr by precipitating on the cathode surface with a maximum power density of 1600 mw m2 180 ding et al 181 have reported 90 3 recovery ratio of cr vi and 91 9 recovery of methylene blue using an integrated technical process with multifunctional adsorbents 7 future outlook and challenges remediation of organic pollutants present in the dye industry wastewater can be carried out using different technologies advanced remediation technology with no or very little damage to the economy and environment directs the perspectives of research dye industry wastewater is rich in organic pollutants such as benzene phenols ethylbenzene etc and it is difficult to remove organic pollutants by employing single treatment it has been reported that with help of integration of treatment technologies biological chemical physical it would become easier 123 124 along with organic pollutants dye industry wastewater also contains valuable products that can be recovered by employing relevant technologies many researchers are focusing their research work on technologies for recovery of nutrients metals energy etc from wastewater 166 169 170 a combination of other remediation techniques with microbial electrochemical technology has been focused by researchers eg combining microbial electrochemical technologies with phytoremediation 182 microbial electrochemical technology has great potential in remediation of pollutants with a simple design that could be considered towards real field applications economical and efficient treatment of dye industrial wastewater is a significant step in direction of cleaner manufacturing techniques in the dye industry to optimize proper utilization of dye industry wastewater sustainable technologies should be developed focus of research shall be thrown towards the biorefinery concept to develop novel bio based approaches as waste biorefineries would lead towards new market potentials for bio based products and organized resource utilization future studies require the development of integrated technologies to achieve better recovery of value added products it is highly imperative to study the technologies from small scale to large scale degradation pathways and mechanisms need further studies to achieve a high remediation rate the toxicity study of recovered products is highly recommended for environmental safety 8 conclusions dye industry wastewater contains a large amount of organic pollutants that increase concern about the ecosystem advanced wastewater treatment technologies need to be studied to solve this problem the biological treatment method is effective eco friendly and cost effective however enhanced remediation can be achieved by a combination of biological treatment with other approaches to settle hazards of dye industrial wastewater suitable technique that treats wastewater and produce resources would be a favourable option microbial electrochemical technology is one of the bio

low coordination properties better spectroscopic individualities and architectural ï¬exibility which make them interesting in various experimental and specialized fields 51 3 effects of dye pollutants on environment and human health thousands of dyes are available commercially and used in various industries 34 66 dyeing and finishing salts are highly used in dye manufacturing and released with industrial wastewater which increases toxicity of the wastewater 67 if untreated effluent is released into the environment it may show mutagenic carcinogenic and genotoxic effects on animals as well as humans 66 dye industries use many types of chemicals such as soaps nitrates acetic acid sulfur chromium vat dyes and naphthol compounds auxiliary chemicals and heavy metals like cadmium nickel cobalt lead copper arsenic and mercury that are responsible for the high toxicity of effluent 67 about forty percent of colorants contain organically bound chlorine which is a carcinogen 68 direct discharge of untreated effluent into the water bodies may increase temperature turbidity gives bad order change ph and color which disturb aquatic environment and also affect quality of water used for drinking purpose by humans and animals 68 69 turbidity and changed color prevent diffusion of sunlight into water decreases dissolved oxygen and adversely affects aquatic organisms 70 several dyes have been reported showing negative impacts on the as shown in table 2 4 remediation of pollutants from the dye industry effluent it has been reported that in developed countries treated wastewater is around fifty to ninety five percent while in developing countries eighty percent efï¬uents are released into lakes and rivers without proper treatment industrial wastewater has been demonstrated as a source of organic pollutants synthetic dyes and heavy metals 78 79 industrial wastewater treatment requires multiple operations and designs a large number of chemicals a high level of process regulator and daily maintenance maintenance of complex systems requires a group of technical staff to oversee the treatment of wastewater and maintenance of effluent treatment plants it also requires strict pollution control norms 80 treatment of wastewater can be done using various techniques and methods such as phytoremediation nanotechnological methods electrochemical techniques ultra filtration absorption sedimentation microbial remediation precipitation evaporation distillation and periphyton or periphytic biofilm etc 81 90 nanotechnological approaches and microbial electrochemical technologies have been discussed in this paper 4 1 nanotechnological approaches nanotechnology has been considered as advanced technology for remediation of organic pollutants it also includes safe nanomaterial designing which promotes ecological development of materials with environmental benefits 91 92 nanotechnology is the nanoscale 1 100 nm manipulation of matter in various fields like chemistry engineering biology and material science 93 nanotechnological approaches such as activated carbons ac 94 nano catalyst 95 nano membranes 96 nano adsorbents 97 carbon nanotube cnt 98 metal organic frameworks mofs 99 clays 100 zeolites 101 102 and nanomaterials nms like titanium dioxide nanoparticles tio2 nps 81 zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps

of nanomaterials are highly responsible for adsorption capability silver bromide based nanomaterials have been reported to have high efficiency for remediation of organic dyes such as orange g methyl orange acid red 18 and indigo carmine 108 abbasi et al 109 have reported 80 degradation of congo red and 70 degradation of crystal violet using zinc sulfide silver sulfide zns ag2s nanoparticles sarioglu et al 110 studied degradation of methylene blue mb using bacterial encapsulated electrospun nanofibrous webs and reported 69 degradation with pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 47085 polyethylene oxide peo web and 68 degradation with pseudomonas aeruginosa polyvinyl alcohol pva web 4 2 microbial electrochemical technologies mets microbes have capacity to oxidize organic waste by metabolic reactions on anode and reduction process recovers valuable product or generates biofuel on the cathode aerobic organisms use oxygen and anaerobic organisms use carbon dioxide nitrate or sulfate these processes make microorganisms as the center of attraction in met 111 112 there are two types of microbes involved in the met process i microorganisms that are not able to donate electrons directly to an anode and require mediators like bacillus sp and escherichia coli ii microorganisms electroactive bacteria eab that can donate electrons directly to an anode such as geobacter sulfurreducens and shewanella putrefaciens 112 mets employ microorganisms to catalyse various electrochemical reactions eg electrical power production by microbial fuel cells mfcs microbes gain energy by catalysing redox reactions breakdown of inorganic organic pollutants or respiration bacteria can transport electrons extracellularly by nanowires endogenous mediators and outer membrane cytochromes whereas yeast and algae can extracellularly transport electrons by mediated and direct electron transport 111 113 cui et al 114 have reported 95 decolorization of alizarin yellow r in concentration range from 30 to 120 mg l within 24 h by using electrochemically active bacteria eab fu et al 115 studied degradation of methyl orange mo using aerobic methane oxidizing microbes such as candidatus methanoperedens and pseudoxanthomonas sp which showed 47 91 mg l d degradation rate of methyl orange mani et al 116 have reported 80 decolorization of acid orange 7 with mfc dye cathode microbial fuel cell with shewanella oneidensis mr1 at the anode dye and laccase enzyme at the cathode and 20 decolorization of acid orange 7 with mfc dye anode microbial fuel cell with dye and shewanella oneidensis mr1 at the anode and laccase enzyme at the cathode organic pollutants such as cod methyl orange acid orange 7 zinc etc can be removed using various mets such as single chamber microbial fuel cell hollow fiber membrane bioreactor microbial fuel cell etc as narrated in table 3 schematic diagram for microbial electrochemical technology is shown in fig 1 4 3 other approaches wastewater treatment generally involves three stages called primary secondary and tertiary treatment 129 biological approach is the most effective due to its eco friendly nature low sludge generation and complete mineralization of organic pollutants 130 132 various bacteria yeast fungi algae and plants have been used for bioremediation of organic pollutants 83 available literature shows bioremediation can be affected by different microbial metabolic mechanisms and growth conditions 133 biological remediation of organic pollutants can be archived by enzymes such as oxidoreductase laccase azoreductase and peroxidase 134 137 advanced oxidation processes aop s such as photocatalysis 138 fenton 139 and photo fenton 140 and hydrodynamic cavitation 141 have been widely investigated for degradation of organic pollutants kumar et al 142 have reported 100 decolorization of ternary dyes methylene blue methyl orange and rhodamine b and 8 53 16 95 reduction of total organic carbon toc when hydrodynamic cavitation hc combined with h2o2 they have reported 98 28 decolorization of dye mixture and 38 42 reduction of toc when they have used hc fenton process however 98 decolorization of dye mixture and 41 28 toc reduction was noted when the hc photo fenton process was applied 82 13 dye decolorization and 15 63 toc reduction was observed by them when hc photocatalytic process was used 74 53 dye decolorization and 14 01 reduction of toc were observed by them when hydrodynamic cavitation was applied along with the photolytic process 5 factors affecting dye degradation dye industrial effluent contains various types of dyes along with other structurally different dyestuffs ph temperature aeration metals and other compounds present in effluent affects dye degradation rate many compounds present in industrial effluent due to their toxicity adversely affect microbial growth too 5 75 the factors affecting dye degradation have been summarized here 5 1 ph and temperature ph plays a key role in remediation process and also affects microbial growth 143 101 a ph of the wastewater depends on the type of dye and salts used during the dying process and based on that it can be neutral acidic or alkaline kumar et al 142 have observed 30 56 decolorization of tannery dye at 3 ph 28 23 decolorization at 2 ph and 8 3 of decolorization at 9 ph a high remediation rate can be achieved by a selection of microorganism that is able to grow at ph of effluent or b adjustment of effluent ph that supports dye degrader s growth of 144 temperature of dye effluent affects diffusion mineralization and chemical process 145 maximum microbial growth can be observed at the optimum temperature during biological treatment microbial growth can be affected by extreme temperatures i e either low or high 144 145 most microbes are mesophilic and require optimum temperature around 30 40 which increases degradation rate of dye however role of several thermophilic organisms has been reported for dye remediation at elevated temperatures 4 146 ma et al 147 have reported 98 34 and 86 87 removal of cr vi by aeribacillus pallidus bk1 at 20 mg l and 100 mg l cr vi concentration respectively aeribacillus pallidus bk1 required optimum temperature was 60 c literature is available stating that high temperature decreases decolorization rate to solve this problem cooling pre treatment is used to decrease temperature of dye effluent which increases bacterial activity to remove dye from wastewater 148 5 2 electron acceptors electron acceptors play an important role in remediation of dye effluent by altering microbial metabolism 149 based on requirement of oxygen microorganisms can be divided as aerobic anaerobic and semi aerobic types oxygen plays an important role in the catalysis process 150 the availability of oxygen affects separation of electron hole pairs in photo catalysis photo generated electrons go through dissolved oxygen molecules to yield highly oxidative sp superoxide radical anions and hydroxyl radicals and are associated with dye degradation 151 aerobic organisms contain oxygenase enzyme for the degradation of dyes whereas carboxylation or other mechanisms are employed by anaerobic organisms to degrade dye molecules 152 however enzymes like azoreductase and laccase are sensitive to oxygen and do not require oxygen for the degradation process 153 shaking conditions provide uniform distribution of oxygen molecules during aerobic processes oxidative enzymes are required for aerobic conditions in remediation of dye whereas anaerobic condition increases the activity of reductive enzymes 154 155 5 3 concentration and molecular weight of dye dye degrading bacteria may not be able to detect a low concentration of dye whereas high dye concentration can block the active site of enzymes and show a toxic effect on microbes molecular weight and dye structure also affect the remediation rate of dye industry wastewater 156 157 it has been reported that as dye concentration increases photocatalytic activity decreases 158 5 4 soluble salts and heavy metals dye industry wastewater contain a high quantity of salts because of employing high salt for dying it is essential to see the influence of salt concentration on remediation process 159 salts like nacl nano3 and na2so4 are generally used to develop fixation of dye and increase ionic strength on fabrics however these salts have been released in dye wastewater with discharge of dye contaminants 144 160 dye industrial wastewater consists of heavy metals that are toxic and may vary in concentration and types the level of heavy metal present in wastewater may be influenced by dyeing process which contains use of complex metal dye or metal bacterial growth and enzymatic activities are inhibited by heavy metal found in dye effluent the tolerance capacity of heavy metal by microorganisms varies with bacterial strain it has been noted that metals also complicate remediation process and waste management aspects of the processes 161 6 value added products from dye industrial effluents wastewater contains different types of pollutants but it also contains valuable products like chemicals fuels metals nutrients salts etc in it which can be recovered from wastewater 162 algae are highly used for remediation due to high photosynthetic capability high growth rate low carbon footprint less generation time and high lipid productivity 132 apart from algae other microorganisms like rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa rhodopseudomonas faecalis moorella thermoautotrophica and rhodopseudomonas palustris have also been reported in the recovery of value added products 163 164 various value added products from dye industry wastewater can be recovered as shown in fig 2 6 1 energy microorganisms have been reported to have the capacity to convert chemical energy into electrical energy using organic components present in the wastewater 165 166 distance between electrodes has a significant effect on power production kalathil et al 167 have reported that short distance increases power density and performance of mfc can be improved whereas long distance increases loss of ohmic enriched electrochemically active bacteria present on the anode can also increase power density 33 green microalgae contain chlorophyll and generate electrons in presence of light through respiration or photosynthesis electron transport chain transports the electrons and finally results in production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and adenosine triphosphate 168 mishra et al 169 have studied decolorization and bioenergy generation using microbial fuel cell mfc from real dye wastewater which has shown 83 decolorization 940 61 5 mw m2 power density and 790 5 mv voltage output generation logrono et al 117 have achieved a maximum of 123 2 27 5 mw m3 volumetric power density using a single chamber microbial fuel cell scmfc different treatment technologies microbial fuel cell hydrothermal gasification constructed wetland microbial fuel cell etc have been reported for degradation of organic pollutants such as cod acid orange 7 congo red etc with simultaneous recovery of value added products such as bio energy as depicted in table 4 6 2 biofuels microalgae can be used to remediate dye industry wastewater and have been demonstrated to have applications in biofuel production 173 microalgae such as haematococcus pluvialis chlorella vulgaris spirogyra sp scenedesmus sp and chlorophyceae etc have been demonstrated for their utilization in remediation process because they are economical and sustainable feedstock for production of biofuel and also used for production of carbohydrates pigments immune modulators proteins polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamins 132 researchers have noted that microalgae based biofuel and petroleum have similar chemical and physical characteristics conversion technology based microbial biofuel can be classified into four categories i biochemical conversion ii photosynthetic microbial fuel cell iii thermo chemical conversion and iv transesterification 174 sharma et al 175 have reported 84 01 biofuel production using chlorella vulgariswith two step microwave assisted acid base transesterification tripathi et al 176 have reported 452 mg l lipid production using green microalgae scenedesmus sp istga1 6 3 nutrients and other value added products recovery of nutrients such as ammonia potassium and phosphorus from dye industry wastewater is beneficial as it leads to both mitigation of environmental pollution and resource recovery 177 recovered and purified nutrients nitrogen phosphorus can be used to make organic fertilizers for agricultural and ecological use 144 li et al 178 have reported 66 5 3 nitrogen and 66 7 4 7 phosphate recovery using multi ion exchange membrane iem stack microbial electrolysis desalination cell medc reddy and mohan 179 have reported the conversion of nh4 to nitrates in the cathode chamber by aerobic biocatalyst activity nitrates then can be used as bio fertilizer dye industry wastewater also contains heavy metals that can be recovered using different technologies chromium cr is generally used in different industrial applications such as dye manufacturing tanning and wood product processing in microbial fuel cell mfc acidic cr vi can be used as a cathode electron acceptor which in turn would help in toxicity reduction of cr vi as well as simultaneously produce electricity reduction of cr2o7 2 to cr2o3 helps in removing cr by precipitating on the cathode surface with a maximum power density of 1600 mw m2 180 ding et al 181 have reported 90 3 recovery ratio of cr vi and 91 9 recovery of methylene blue using an integrated technical process with multifunctional adsorbents 7 future outlook and challenges remediation of organic pollutants present in the dye industry wastewater can be carried out using different technologies advanced remediation technology with no or very little damage to the economy and environment directs the perspectives of research dye industry wastewater is rich in organic pollutants such as benzene phenols ethylbenzene etc and it is difficult to remove organic pollutants by employing single treatment it has been reported that with help of integration of treatment technologies biological chemical physical it would become easier 123 124 along with organic pollutants dye industry wastewater also contains valuable products that can be recovered by employing relevant technologies many researchers are focusing their research work on technologies for recovery of nutrients metals energy etc from wastewater 166 169 170 a combination of other remediation techniques with microbial electrochemical technology has been focused by researchers eg combining microbial electrochemical technologies with phytoremediation 182 microbial electrochemical technology has great potential in remediation of pollutants with a simple design that could be considered towards real field applications economical and efficient treatment of dye industrial wastewater is a significant step in direction of cleaner manufacturing techniques in the dye industry to optimize proper utilization of dye industry wastewater sustainable technologies should be developed focus of research shall be thrown towards the biorefinery concept to develop novel bio based approaches as waste biorefineries would lead towards new market potentials for bio based products and organized resource utilization future studies require the development of integrated technologies to achieve better recovery of value added products it is highly imperative to study the technologies from small scale to large scale degradation pathways and mechanisms need further studies to achieve a high remediation rate the toxicity study of recovered products is highly recommended for environmental safety 8 conclusions dye industry wastewater contains a large amount of organic pollutants that increase concern about the ecosystem advanced wastewater treatment technologies need to be studied to solve this problem the biological treatment method is effective eco friendly and cost effective however enhanced remediation can be achieved by a combination of biological treatment with other approaches to settle hazards of dye industrial wastewater suitable technique that treats wastewater and produce resources would be a favourable option microbial electrochemical technology is one of the bio electrochemical technology aimed at the production of electrical energy from chemical energy where microbes act as a catalyst bioremediation of organic pollutants and energy generation using microbial electrochemical technology is dependent on various factors such as the potential of cathode and anode redox activity conversion of substrate charge transfer enzyme activity etc integration of

however there are some new challenges and research opportunities in the field of water and wastewater treatment concerning the novel coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 this article briefly summarizes the latest literature reporting the presence of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater sewage furthermore it highlights the challenges potential opportunities and research directions in the water and wastewater treatment field some of the significant challenges and research opportunities are the development of standard techniques for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in the water phase assessment of favorable environments for its survival and decay in water and development of effective strategies for elimination of the novel virus from water advancement in research in this domain will help to protect the environment human health and managing this type of pandemic in the future keywords covid 19 sars cov 2 water treatment pandemic environmental impacts disinfectants 1 introduction the current global pandemic of covid 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has been growing briskly 1 2 although the major transmission routes of sars cov 2 are through respiratory droplets and direct contact 3 5 recent studies have reported the presence of viral rna of sars cov 2 in untreated and treated wastewater and human feces 3 6 21 in most of the studies the samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants wwtps while one study reported in the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater from a cruise ship and commercial passenger aircraft 22 recent studies conducted in the netherlands and france confirmed that a reasonably high viral load of sars cov 2 rna is found in the sewage wastewater 19 23 the presence of sars cov 2 in feces and municipal wastewater poses a severe threat to the environment due to its potential spread via these routes 24 28 therefore there are serious concerns regarding the spread of sars cov 2 through virus laden aerosols borne and fecal oral routes 8 29 38 it is important to take the necessary precautions to limit the spread of the virus in the environment 39 nevertheless it creates some new environmental challenges that demand an imperative need for research development of effective standard techniques for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in water assessment of the existing water purification technologies and development of novel advanced water treatment systems are major challenges and open research opportunities furthermore careful surveillance of water and wastewater to be used as an early warning tool for such outbreaks in future understanding the survival and decay mechanism of the novel virus in water and wastewater analysis of potential pathways of sars cov 2 into water bodies are other potential research opportunities for environmental researchers 40 44 the major challenges and opportunities in the field of water and wastewater research are presented in fig 1 the objective of this article is to highlight the potential opportunities and challenges in the field of water research concerning the novel sars cov 2 virus the directions for future research to safeguard human health environment and to predict and manage this type of pandemic in the future are also provided 2 research opportunities and challenges 2 1 identification and analysis of sars cov 2 pathways into water and wastewater numerous studies have reported the presence of pathogenic viruses that enter into the water bodies through different sources 45 46 previous studies have demonstrated that sars cov 2 can enter into the water bodies from hospital wastewater and sewage 5 47 49 the waste and wastewater discharged from the quarantine facilities airports seaports and residential buildings of infected humans and animals are the potential sources of sars cov 2 than can enter into the water bodies the sars cov 2 may also find its ways to groundwater through possible leaching and infiltrations of effluents from health care facilities sewage solid landfill and drainage water another important source of viral contamination to the water environment is the leakage from sewage pipes the possible sources and pathways of sars cov 2 in water systems are depicted in fig 2 due to the fast growing number of patients worldwide the virus concentration in wastewater sewage is expected to increase rapidly the potential pathways of sars cov 2 into wastewater are via shedding in the stool for the viable virus while through urine and stool for the non viable virus 50 a careful and extensive investigation of all the possible sources of water contamination by sars cov 2 is needed that potentially includes wastewater dispatches from hospitals and greywater generated from washing personal protective equipment ppe surfaces and floors 51 table 1 summarizes the literature reporting the presence of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater in various parts of the world 3 17 19 42 all the reported samples were collected during the period from janruary 2020 to july 2020 the concentrations of sars cov 2 rna in untreated wastewater was in the range of 5 6 10 to 4 6 108 copies per liter 6 7 14 16 52 53 some studies also reported the detection of sars cov 2 in treated water samples 3 16 2 2 evaluation of favorable conditions for the survival of sars cov 2 in the aqueous environment previous reports suggested that sars cov 2 survival in an aqueous environment is strongly dependent on the characteristics of water wastewater 54 56 the ph temperature presence of antagonistic bacteria organic matter sunlight and oxidants might affect the survival of sars cov 2 in aqueous environment 54 57 58 a previous study reported that the inactivation of coronaviruses in the water is highly dependent on the level of organic matter temperature and presence of antagonistic bacteria 54 the suspended solids and organic matter present in water can provide protection for viruses that adsorb to these particles and they can survive up to several days 54 however some published reports suggested that coronaviruses are very sensitive to high temperature and oxidants such as chlorine 57 studies have reported that surrogate coronaviruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks 46 a recent study estimated that the half life of sars cov 2 in wastewater is in the range of 4 8 and 7 2 h 44 while another study reported that the virus causing covid 19 could survive in untreated wastewater from hours to days 59 it is essential to understand the stability and decay mechanism of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater the significant parameters that can predict the reduction kinetics need to be determined to establish the favorable and unfavorable conditions for the survival of sars cov 2 in aqueous environment detailed investigations of various water wastewater samples with different characteristics are required to assess the potential exposure risk of water contaminated with this virus launching a monitoring program is vital to determine the fate of sars cov 2 in water cycle 49 theoretical and computational analysis might help to provide a basis for experimental research 2 3 assessment of water and wastewater as a potential source of sars cov 2 transmission until now there is no evidence and enough data to confirm if the water and wastewater containing sars cov 2 could be the potential source of its transmission although some studies predicted a low risk of sars cov 2 transmission via wastewater especially the treated water 55 60 still extensive investigations need to be performed to validate these predictions and initial findings the information regarding the viability of the closely related sars cov 1 virus in wastewater may provide useful information about the survival of sars cov 2 in an aqueous environment 54 as a precaution the wastewater sewage treatment plants should be considered as the potential transmission routes a recent study demonstrated the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach to investigate the potential health risks of sars cov 2 in sewage to wwtps workers 61 results revealed that the viral loads in wastewater sewage at the entrance of wwtps were above the who benchmark of tolerable risk used for virus infection of 10 3 6 7 14 16 52 53 it is essential to evaluate bioaerosol and airborne particle risks to nearby communities and wwtp workers in general it can be made mandatory for the wwtp workers that perform manual cleaning of screening to use face masks and face shields the aerosol formation during wastewater treatment needs to be carefully examined as a potential source of virus transmission 62 water related exposures may occur in communities with weak sewage infrastructure or that use wastewater for irrigation 63 viral aerosols from a leaking sewage pipe at amoy gardens complex in hong kong were identified as the transmission route for coronaviruses during the sars cov 1 outbreak in 2003 47 the virus can also make its way into the drinking water distribution systems from the accidental contamination of drinking water with raw sewage and can enter individual homes the presence of sars cov 2 in water may also affect the water supply system by forming the biofilms that can compromise the water quality and endanger human health there is also an imperative need for research to investigate the fecal oral transmission potential of sars cov 2 33 64 it is crucial to examine if the sars cov 2 contaminated wastewater has adverse impacts on aquatic life soil and wildlife this needs careful examinations risk analysis and thorough investigations to reach a conclusion furthermore monitoring and control measures are essential along the wastewater treatment route to avert coronavirus spread it is recommended that the wwtp managers and stakeholders develop risk management strategies for the protection of wwtp workers and nearby communities 61 the disinfection steps in both wwtps and drinking water plants need to be developed carefully the quantitative disinfection kinetics need to be established and an optimum dose for inactivation of sars cov 2 need to be determined decentralized virus inactivation treatment for water discharged from wwtps and drinking water plants can also be beneficial in reducing the environmental load of sars cov 2 2 4 detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater is an essential but challenging step to track the infectious disease 50 65 due to complex nature of wastewater matrix it is essential to develop new biomarker extraction techniques as well as selective sensitive and cost effective tools for the analysis of wastewater samples containing the novel virus 66 to avoid exposure to dangerous virus sars cov 2 and to protect the safety of the lab analysts it is recommended to use virus surrogates instead of harmful sars cov 2 34 wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been recognized as a useful tool for evaluating predicting and managing the disease outbreaks 40 43 44 67 the concept is mainly based upon the detection extraction and analysis of biological and chemical compounds referred to as biomarkers recent studies have reported the successful detection of the novel virus in municipal wastewater and human stool 6 7 15 42 51 68 70 surveillance of relative changes in concentrations of sars cov 2 rna at the inlet of wwtp over time can serve as a useful tool for early warning for virus spread in the population 19 both upstream sampling i e at sewerage maintenance holes and downstream sampling i e at the wwtp approach can be used however upstream sampling is more appropriate due to variability in downstream samples a gis based sewerage map and flow rates would aid in the selection of upstream sampling locations 71 quantification of sars cov 2 rna in settled solids in wwtps may also be used as a reliable and sensitive target for wbe 72 moreover monitoring of sewage discharged from international airports and seaports would allow very early detection of the entrance of the virus into a country it could also help the relevant authorities in deciding the implementation or removal of lockdown 34 it is essential to develop an integrated wastewater surveillance programs by considering both privacy and inequality concerns of the public 71 wurtzer et al 73 performed the time course quantitative analysis of sars cov 2 in paris sewage by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr to investigate virus circulation in humans however these studies are at the initial stage and a large pool of data from different parts of the world is necessary to develop a reliable and sensitive detection method for sars cov 2 detection in wastewater sewage 74 a multidisciplinary research approach including engineers microbiologists chemists and public health experts will be productive to nurture more effective techniques for the quantification of sars cov 2 in water since sars cov 2 has a presumably short half life in water the detection technique must be valid for both viable and non viable sars cov 2 in water the virus can be degraded into other products it is essential to develop strategies that could use these degraded products as target materials for detection and quantification 50 the lack of standardized and optimized protocol for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater is another major challenge 59 75 76 this may lead to discrepancies in the results obtained by different laboratories as indicated by a recent study 3 currently the rt qpcr has been employed widely for detection of sars cov 2 in water samples 77 there is an imperative need to develop a standard operating procedure for accurate detection and quantification sars cov 2 in water and wastewater furthermore a standard sampling procedure must be developed to extract isolate detect and quantify the virus accurately this is an essential step for the development of commercial laboratories in various parts of the world that can accurately detect and quantify the virus with reproducible results advancements in the field of microbiology might play a key role in developing a low cost efficient method for detection and quantification of viral rna 78 recently various innovative detection techniques have been reported in the literature 79 81 novel nanomaterials based sensors were found to be useful for the detection of waterborne pathogens 82 there is a research potential to develop techniques using a similar approach for the detection of sars cov 2 by utilizing different novel nanomaterials a reliable widely accepted surveillance system needs to be developed for the accurate quantification of sars cov 2 in water samples 2 5 analysis of decay mechanism and breakdown products of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater the persistence of sars cov 2 in the water environment is assumed to be short due to the enveloped nature of the virus 49 60 83 the half life of sars cov 2 in hospital wastewater was estimated to range between 4 8 and 7 2 h at 20 c 44 however little is known about the vitality of sars cov 2 in water 16 furthermore the accurate survival period and concentration of sars cov 2 in water are still indefinite and these are open areas for research it is essential to understand the decay mechanism and breakdown products of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater it will not only help in developing effective techniques for accurate detection and quantification but also will be useful for proposing an efficient disinfection technique a recent study reported the transcriptomic architecture of sars cov 2 84 the sars cov 2 may present in the water phase either in a viable state or in the non viable form of viral debris 50 however the actual degradation products and accurate decay mechanism of sars cov 2 in water phase need to be explored yet 2 6 development of efficient techniques for the eradication of sars cov 2 from water and wastewater sewage the traditional treatment techniques for the removal of viruses from wastewater include sand filters chlorine treatment uv inactivation ozone treatment microbial treatment membranes and pond systems 85 90 though it is assumed that the current techniques used for wastewater treatment might be helpful to eliminate the novel virus due to the global impact of this pandemic experimental results are needed to validate this assumption 62 91 93 likewise experimental shreds of evidence are required to confirm the effectiveness of household filtration systems chlorination densification and boiling for the elimination of the novel virus from water it might be needed to upgrade the existing water and wastewater treatment systems or develop new treatment techniques to treat the sars cov 2 contaminated water the more stringent treatment above the current level is needed for virus reduction to ensure the safety of recycled water 94 95 who has highlighted guidelines on the safe management of water in july 2020 62 a recent study stated that the current disinfection strategy recommended by who might not be adequate to deactivate sars cov 2 in water 96 the existing wastewater treatment system might need necessary alternation or additional pretreatment steps to deactivate the sars cov 2 it should also be investigated if the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater affect the treatment process for the removal of other pollutants recent advancement in nanotechnology biotechnology and material sciences have opened many doors of applications and exhibited tremendous potential in water purification 97 102 the development of effective techniques for the inactivation of sars cov 2 is vital to limit its presence in wastewater and lessen its potential adverse effects on human health and the environment significant treatment steps are essential to upgrade both the wastewater and drinking water treatment plants to eradicate sars cov 2 or its rna fragments recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in the applications of various novel materials in water treatment 103 106 nanomaterials and their composites might play a critical role in the development of an efficient method for the eradication of sars cov 2 from water 106 110 advances in membrane systems provide an effective route for the removal of viruses from water 111 115 for drinking water a potable water straw or uv based system can be developed to filter kill the virus and to reduce the risk of waterborne viral infection 116 a recent study reported that there is a negative correlation between sunlight uv dose and percent positive of sars cov 2 117 other techniques such as oxidation coagulation and photocatalytic killing of the virus must also be explored to determine the effective treatment option for the deactivation of sars cov 2 in water the efficiency of emerging disinfection technologies for sars cov 2 inactivation need to be appraised the water distribution systems may potentially host the novel virus due to biofilm growth and presence of bacterial colonies innovations and improvements in the water distribution and plumbing systems are vital to minimize the transmission of sars cov 2 through the water 118 as a general rule it is the combination of different techniques in primary secondary and tertiary treatments that would allow sufficient virus removal to limit the possibility of environmental contamination the sars cov 2 pandemic should develop a global awareness for improving the wastewater treatment systems even in developing countries due to the possibility of its spread through the aquatic environment from inadequately treated wastewater the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater may have consequences for public health in developing countries with poor water and sewage infrastructure and inadequate institutional treatment disinfection facilities future research in these lines is essential for the protection of public health and the environment in addition robust policy intervention is essential to ensure reasonable compliance regarding the discharge of wastewater in various parts of the world 2 7 other miscellaneous impacts of covid 19 on water one of the major environmental concern associated with covid 19 pandemic is the excessive use of disinfectants such as alcohol based hand sanitizers and disinfecting soaps the usage of disinfectants during the covid 19 pandemic increases environmental and energy footprints significantly a recent report reveals that 2000 tons of disinfectants are dispensed at in sewage systems in wuhan city of china from january 29 to february 18 2020 119 120 these discharges not only poses a potential threat to the marine environment but can also contaminate drinking water resources another study estimated that excessive use of disinfectants and frequent handwashing could increase consumption of drinking water by 20 and lead to the generation of 15 18 more wastewater 121 the alcohol based hand sanitizer is not only associated with some health issues but it may also result in adverse impacts on the environment 122 123 a recent study highlighted that the extensive use of disinfectants poses a significant threat to urban wildlife 124 these disinfectants may find their ways to reach water bodies and pollute them it is therefore necessary to assess the exact hostile impacts of the disinfectants that discharge into water bodies and mitigate them to the maximum possible extent in addition the use of masks gloves and other ppe have resulted in the generation of a massive amount of wastes in the environment strategies for proper management of waste must be developed to lessen its adverse environmental impacts 3 conclusion in summary besides severe threats to humanity the ongoing pandemic offers the opportunity to environmental engineers and scientists to play a responsible role to control the potential spread of the virus from water development of effective standard techniques for the detection and quantification assessment of the existing water purification technologies and development of novel effective systems for elimination of sars cov 2 from water are critical challenges and open research

various fields to evaluate the fate of the crisis and combat it the apparent need for imperative research in the biological and medical field is the focus of researchers and scientists worldwide however there are some new challenges and research opportunities in the field of water and wastewater treatment concerning the novel coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 this article briefly summarizes the latest literature reporting the presence of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater sewage furthermore it highlights the challenges potential opportunities and research directions in the water and wastewater treatment field some of the significant challenges and research opportunities are the development of standard techniques for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in the water phase assessment of favorable environments for its survival and decay in water and development of effective strategies for elimination of the novel virus from water advancement in research in this domain will help to protect the environment human health and managing this type of pandemic in the future keywords covid 19 sars cov 2 water treatment pandemic environmental impacts disinfectants 1 introduction the current global pandemic of covid 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has been growing briskly 1 2 although the major transmission routes of sars cov 2 are through respiratory droplets and direct contact 3 5 recent studies have reported the presence of viral rna of sars cov 2 in untreated and treated wastewater and human feces 3 6 21 in most of the studies the samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants wwtps while one study reported in the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater from a cruise ship and commercial passenger aircraft 22 recent studies conducted in the netherlands and france confirmed that a reasonably high viral load of sars cov 2 rna is found in the sewage wastewater 19 23 the presence of sars cov 2 in feces and municipal wastewater poses a severe threat to the environment due to its potential spread via these routes 24 28 therefore there are serious concerns regarding the spread of sars cov 2 through virus laden aerosols borne and fecal oral routes 8 29 38 it is important to take the necessary precautions to limit the spread of the virus in the environment 39 nevertheless it creates some new environmental challenges that demand an imperative need for research development of effective standard techniques for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in water assessment of the existing water purification technologies and development of novel advanced water treatment systems are major challenges and open research opportunities furthermore careful surveillance of water and wastewater to be used as an early warning tool for such outbreaks in future understanding the survival and decay mechanism of the novel virus in water and wastewater analysis of potential pathways of sars cov 2 into water bodies are other potential research opportunities for environmental researchers 40 44 the major challenges and opportunities in the field of water and wastewater research are presented in fig 1 the objective of this article is to highlight the potential opportunities and challenges in the field of water research concerning the novel sars cov 2 virus the directions for future research to safeguard human health environment and to predict and manage this type of pandemic in the future are also provided 2 research opportunities and challenges 2 1 identification and analysis of sars cov 2 pathways into water and wastewater numerous studies have reported the presence of pathogenic viruses that enter into the water bodies through different sources 45 46 previous studies have demonstrated that sars cov 2 can enter into the water bodies from hospital wastewater and sewage 5 47 49 the waste and wastewater discharged from the quarantine facilities airports seaports and residential buildings of infected humans and animals are the potential sources of sars cov 2 than can enter into the water bodies the sars cov 2 may also find its ways to groundwater through possible leaching and infiltrations of effluents from health care facilities sewage solid landfill and drainage water another important source of viral contamination to the water environment is the leakage from sewage pipes the possible sources and pathways of sars cov 2 in water systems are depicted in fig 2 due to the fast growing number of patients worldwide the virus concentration in wastewater sewage is expected to increase rapidly the potential pathways of sars cov 2 into wastewater are via shedding in the stool for the viable virus while through urine and stool for the non viable virus 50 a careful and extensive investigation of all the possible sources of water contamination by sars cov 2 is needed that potentially includes wastewater dispatches from hospitals and greywater generated from washing personal protective equipment ppe surfaces and floors 51 table 1 summarizes the literature reporting the presence of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater in various parts of the world 3 17 19 42 all the reported samples were collected during the period from janruary 2020 to july 2020 the concentrations of sars cov 2 rna in untreated wastewater was in the range of 5 6 10 to 4 6 108 copies per liter 6 7 14 16 52 53 some studies also reported the detection of sars cov 2 in treated water samples 3 16 2 2 evaluation of favorable conditions for the survival of sars cov 2 in the aqueous environment previous reports suggested that sars cov 2 survival in an aqueous environment is strongly dependent on the characteristics of water wastewater 54 56 the ph temperature presence of antagonistic bacteria organic matter sunlight and oxidants might affect the survival of sars cov 2 in aqueous environment 54 57 58 a previous study reported that the inactivation of coronaviruses in the water is highly dependent on the level of organic matter temperature and presence of antagonistic bacteria 54 the suspended solids and organic matter present in water can provide protection for viruses that adsorb to these particles and they can survive up to several days 54 however some published reports suggested that coronaviruses are very sensitive to high temperature and oxidants such as chlorine 57 studies have reported that surrogate coronaviruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks 46 a recent study estimated that the half life of sars cov 2 in wastewater is in the range of 4 8 and 7 2 h 44 while another study reported that the virus causing covid 19 could survive in untreated wastewater from hours to days 59 it is essential to understand the stability and decay mechanism of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater the significant parameters that can predict the reduction kinetics need to be determined to establish the favorable and unfavorable conditions for the survival of sars cov 2 in aqueous environment detailed investigations of various water wastewater samples with different characteristics are required to assess the potential exposure risk of water contaminated with this virus launching a monitoring program is vital to determine the fate of sars cov 2 in water cycle 49 theoretical and computational analysis might help to provide a basis for experimental research 2 3 assessment of water and wastewater as a potential source of sars cov 2 transmission until now there is no evidence and enough data to confirm if the water and wastewater containing sars cov 2 could be the potential source of its transmission although some studies predicted a low risk of sars cov 2 transmission via wastewater especially the treated water 55 60 still extensive investigations need to be performed to validate these predictions and initial findings the information regarding the viability of the closely related sars cov 1 virus in wastewater may provide useful information about the survival of sars cov 2 in an aqueous environment 54 as a precaution the wastewater sewage treatment plants should be considered as the potential transmission routes a recent study demonstrated the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach to investigate the potential health risks of sars cov 2 in sewage to wwtps workers 61 results revealed that the viral loads in wastewater sewage at the entrance of wwtps were above the who benchmark of tolerable risk used for virus infection of 10 3 6 7 14 16 52 53 it is essential to evaluate bioaerosol and airborne particle risks to nearby communities and wwtp workers in general it can be made mandatory for the wwtp workers that perform manual cleaning of screening to use face masks and face shields the aerosol formation during wastewater treatment needs to be carefully examined as a potential source of virus transmission 62 water related exposures may occur in communities with weak sewage infrastructure or that use wastewater for irrigation 63 viral aerosols from a leaking sewage pipe at amoy gardens complex in hong kong were identified as the transmission route for coronaviruses during the sars cov 1 outbreak in 2003 47 the virus can also make its way into the drinking water distribution systems from the accidental contamination of drinking water with raw sewage and can enter individual homes the presence of sars cov 2 in water may also affect the water supply system by forming the biofilms that can compromise the water quality and endanger human health there is also an imperative need for research to investigate the fecal oral transmission potential of sars cov 2 33 64 it is crucial to examine if the sars cov 2 contaminated wastewater has adverse impacts on aquatic life soil and wildlife this needs careful examinations risk analysis and thorough investigations to reach a conclusion furthermore monitoring and control measures are essential along the wastewater treatment route to avert coronavirus spread it is recommended that the wwtp managers and stakeholders develop risk management strategies for the protection of wwtp workers and nearby communities 61 the disinfection steps in both wwtps and drinking water plants need to be developed carefully the quantitative disinfection kinetics need to be established and an optimum dose for inactivation of sars cov 2 need to be determined decentralized virus inactivation treatment for water discharged from wwtps and drinking water plants can also be beneficial in reducing the environmental load of sars cov 2 2 4 detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater is an essential but challenging step to track the infectious disease 50 65 due to complex nature of wastewater matrix it is essential to develop new biomarker extraction techniques as well as selective sensitive and cost effective tools for the analysis of wastewater samples containing the novel virus 66 to avoid exposure to dangerous virus sars cov 2 and to protect the safety of the lab analysts it is recommended to use virus surrogates instead of harmful sars cov 2 34 wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been recognized as a useful tool for evaluating predicting and managing the disease outbreaks 40 43 44 67 the concept is mainly based upon the detection extraction and analysis of biological and chemical compounds referred to as biomarkers recent studies have reported the successful detection of the novel virus in municipal wastewater and human stool 6 7 15 42 51 68 70 surveillance of relative changes in concentrations of sars cov 2 rna at the inlet of wwtp over time can serve as a useful tool for early warning for virus spread in the population 19 both upstream sampling i e at sewerage maintenance holes and downstream sampling i e at the wwtp approach can be used however upstream sampling is more appropriate due to variability in downstream samples a gis based sewerage map and flow rates would aid in the selection of upstream sampling locations 71 quantification of sars cov 2 rna in settled solids in wwtps may also be used as a reliable and sensitive target for wbe 72 moreover monitoring of sewage discharged from international airports and seaports would allow very early detection of the entrance of the virus into a country it could also help the relevant authorities in deciding the implementation or removal of lockdown 34 it is essential to develop an integrated wastewater surveillance programs by considering both privacy and inequality concerns of the public 71 wurtzer et al 73 performed the time course quantitative analysis of sars cov 2 in paris sewage by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr to investigate virus circulation in humans however these studies are at the initial stage and a large pool of data from different parts of the world is necessary to develop a reliable and sensitive detection method for sars cov 2 detection in wastewater sewage 74 a multidisciplinary research approach including engineers microbiologists chemists and public health experts will be productive to nurture more effective techniques for the quantification of sars cov 2 in water since sars cov 2 has a presumably short half life in water the detection technique must be valid for both viable and non viable sars cov 2 in water the virus can be degraded into other products it is essential to develop strategies that could use these degraded products as target materials for detection and quantification 50 the lack of standardized and optimized protocol for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater is another major challenge 59 75 76 this may lead to discrepancies in the results obtained by different laboratories as indicated by a recent study 3 currently the rt qpcr has been employed widely for detection of sars cov 2 in water samples 77 there is an imperative need to develop a standard operating procedure for accurate detection and quantification sars cov 2 in water and wastewater furthermore a standard sampling procedure must be developed to extract isolate detect and quantify the virus accurately this is an essential step for the development of commercial laboratories in various parts of the world that can accurately detect and quantify the virus with reproducible results advancements in the field of microbiology might play a key role in developing a low cost efficient method for detection and quantification of viral rna 78 recently various innovative detection techniques have been reported in the literature 79 81 novel nanomaterials based sensors were found to be useful for the detection of waterborne pathogens 82 there is a research potential to develop techniques using a similar approach for the detection of sars cov 2 by utilizing different novel nanomaterials a reliable widely accepted surveillance system needs to be developed for the accurate quantification of sars cov 2 in water samples 2 5 analysis of decay mechanism and breakdown products of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater the persistence of sars cov 2 in the water environment is assumed to be short due to the enveloped nature of the virus 49 60 83 the half life of sars cov 2 in hospital wastewater was estimated to range between 4 8 and 7 2 h at 20 c 44 however little is known about the vitality of sars cov 2 in water 16 furthermore the accurate survival period and concentration of sars cov 2 in water are still indefinite and these are open areas for research it is essential to understand the decay mechanism and breakdown products of sars cov 2 in water and wastewater it will not only help in developing effective techniques for accurate detection and quantification but also will be useful for proposing an efficient disinfection technique a recent study reported the transcriptomic architecture of sars cov 2 84 the sars cov 2 may present in the water phase either in a viable state or in the non viable form of viral debris 50 however the actual degradation products and accurate decay mechanism of sars cov 2 in water phase need to be explored yet 2 6 development of efficient techniques for the eradication of sars cov 2 from water and wastewater sewage the traditional treatment techniques for the removal of viruses from wastewater include sand filters chlorine treatment uv inactivation ozone treatment microbial treatment membranes and pond systems 85 90 though it is assumed that the current techniques used for wastewater treatment might be helpful to eliminate the novel virus due to the global impact of this pandemic experimental results are needed to validate this assumption 62 91 93 likewise experimental shreds of evidence are required to confirm the effectiveness of household filtration systems chlorination densification and boiling for the elimination of the novel virus from water it might be needed to upgrade the existing water and wastewater treatment systems or develop new treatment techniques to treat the sars cov 2 contaminated water the more stringent treatment above the current level is needed for virus reduction to ensure the safety of recycled water 94 95 who has highlighted guidelines on the safe management of water in july 2020 62 a recent study stated that the current disinfection strategy recommended by who might not be adequate to deactivate sars cov 2 in water 96 the existing wastewater treatment system might need necessary alternation or additional pretreatment steps to deactivate the sars cov 2 it should also be investigated if the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater affect the treatment process for the removal of other pollutants recent advancement in nanotechnology biotechnology and material sciences have opened many doors of applications and exhibited tremendous potential in water purification 97 102 the development of effective techniques for the inactivation of sars cov 2 is vital to limit its presence in wastewater and lessen its potential adverse effects on human health and the environment significant treatment steps are essential to upgrade both the wastewater and drinking water treatment plants to eradicate sars cov 2 or its rna fragments recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in the applications of various novel

virus and to reduce the risk of waterborne viral infection 116 a recent study reported that there is a negative correlation between sunlight uv dose and percent positive of sars cov 2 117 other techniques such as oxidation coagulation and photocatalytic killing of the virus must also be explored to determine the effective treatment option for the deactivation of sars cov 2 in water the efficiency of emerging disinfection technologies for sars cov 2 inactivation need to be appraised the water distribution systems may potentially host the novel virus due to biofilm growth and presence of bacterial colonies innovations and improvements in the water distribution and plumbing systems are vital to minimize the transmission of sars cov 2 through the water 118 as a general rule it is the combination of different techniques in primary secondary and tertiary treatments that would allow sufficient virus removal to limit the possibility of environmental contamination the sars cov 2 pandemic should develop a global awareness for improving the wastewater treatment systems even in developing countries due to the possibility of its spread through the aquatic environment from

institutional treatment disinfection facilities future research in these lines is essential for the protection of public health and the environment in addition robust policy intervention is essential to ensure reasonable compliance regarding the discharge of wastewater in various parts of the world 2 7 other miscellaneous impacts of covid 19 on water one of the major environmental concern associated with covid 19 pandemic is the excessive use of disinfectants such as alcohol based hand sanitizers and disinfecting soaps the usage of disinfectants during the covid 19 pandemic increases environmental and energy footprints significantly a recent report reveals that 2000 tons of disinfectants are dispensed at in sewage systems in wuhan city of china from january 29 to february 18 2020 119 120 these discharges not only poses a potential threat to the marine environment but can also contaminate drinking water resources another study estimated that excessive use of disinfectants and frequent handwashing could increase consumption of drinking water by 20 and lead to the generation of 15 18 more wastewater 121 the alcohol based hand sanitizer is not only associated with some health

13738,the up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor uahr was simultaneously employed for 2 biofuels h2 and ch4 production from solely biscuits wastewater bw industry and a mixture of bw with domestic sewage ds at a mixing ratio of 3 1 respectively the uahr was fed with bw and operated at an organic loading rate olr of 21 9 1 7 gcod l d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 0 h the module achieved volumetric hydrogen production rate vhpr and hydrogen yield hy of 0 95 0 13 l l reactor d and 118 6 22 3 ml gcodremoved respectively a substantial deterioration in the h2 productivity was occurred after 94 days of continuous feed operation due to the inhibition effect of long chain fatty acids lcfas ds was integrated into the bw at mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds where the uahr was continuously operated at olrs of 7 95 and 4 45 gcod l d achieving h2 and ch4 yields of 414 2 38 1 and 318 5 23 5 ml gcod removed respectively the payback periods for the production of biogas rich ch4 and h2 were 7 1 and 5 7 y respectively keywords anaerobic co digestion biogas rich h2 and or ch4 production techno economic analysis biscuits wastewater 1 introduction biscuits industry consumes a huge quantities of water and energy 1 moreover considerable amounts of high strength wastewater are daily produced and discharged into sewerage network causing severe environmental and health problems 2 fortunately this type of wastewater is highly biodegradable rich with lipids carbohydrates and nutrients which are suitable for energy production via anaerobic digestion process 1 3 2 biofuels h2 and ch4 production from biscuits wastewater bw industry is considered a clean environmentally friendly and renewable source of energy available for low income and developing countries 4 hydrogen h2 is an energy vector and the cleanest fuel that provides efficient energy conversion for multiple applications such as electricity and heating 5 h2 has a heating value of 33 3 kw h kg representing about 3 folds higher than conventional chemical fuels 6 8 methane ch4 gas has a lower heating value of 13 9 kw h kg 9 and it has been effectively utilized for essential applications viz vehicle fuels heating electricity and domestic purposes 10 because 2 biofuels h2 and ch4 is a novel approach an efficient reliable and non polluting energy source 11 it has attracted broad attention in terms of the energy crisis and environmental pollution hence more research should be conducted for maximizing its productivity anaerobic digestion is realistic and feasible process which has been extensively utilized to generate energy along with wastewater treatment 12 hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis are the processes contributed in lipids degradation 13 19 biofuels production from anaerobic digestion of wastewater rich lipids are strongly influenced by the culture ph hydraulic retention time hrt organic loading rate olr and substrate type 5 12 20 23 hydrolysis of lipids rich wastewater would produce long chain fatty acids lcfas 2 12 those lcfas are further anaerobically biodegraded through Î² oxidation to produce h2 and acetate which are then utilized by acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens to generate ch4 24 25 lipids rich wastewater could be feasible and attractive substrate for energy production along with pollution minimization 12 18 rusÃ­n et al 16 achieved a sufficient amount of biogas with a ch4 content of 55 1 from anaerobic digestion of wastewater industry however lcfas accumulation in the digester was occurred due to the inefficient utilization of organic acids by methanogens 26 this tendency leads to an overly acidic digester with a remarkable low ph environment 27 moreover the accumulation adsorption of lcfas onto the sludge bed of the anaerobic module creates a physical barrier which hinders the transfer of substrates and metabolite by products from the reaction medium into the bacterial cells this operation mode would inhibit the anaerobic microbial activities causing a failure of the anaerobic digestion of wastewater rich lipids the dilution of the inhibitory compounds via the addition of sewage sludge was previously reported by silvestre et al 28 29 hence the co digestion of biscuits wastewater bw rich lipids with domestic sewage ds is a promising approach to mitigate the inhibition effect of accumulation of lcfas deposition on microbial anaerobes surfaces and minimize the required synthetic chemical substrate 17 30 32 therefore the aims of this study are to 1 assess the efficiency of up

and ds at different ratios was extensively investigated here table 1 summarizes the characteristics of bw and ds the ph value was slightly acidic 4 2 0 1 for bw and neutral 7 1 0 3 for ds the major portion of the codt in bw was in a particulate form 80 and the cods were only 20 this is not the case for ds where the cods codt and codp codt ratios were 40 and 60 respectively likely the scarb tcarb and pcarb tcarb ratios were 0 27 and 0 37 for bw 0 73 and 0 63 for ds respectively the bw was highly rich with lipids 3581 4 852 7 mg l and carbohydrate 1537 9 201 6 mg l providing a suitable substrate for the anaerobic digestion process the lipids carbohydrate ratio was 2 3 in bw and 0 24 in ds which grantees the feasibility of co digestion of bw and ds to mitigate the inhibition impact

respectively 2693 2 mg l was not accounted due to the concentrations of fats oils glycerol other saturated and unsaturated lcfas were not determined in this study palmitic oleic and stearic acids were selected due to their high inhibitory effect on the microbial activity as reported earlier by deaver et al 33 the biodegradability of bw and ds was quite high as the vss tss ratio was 0 95 and 0 73

manufactured from the perspex material with a height of 134 cm and a diameter of 20 cm the top part of the reactor was equipped by polyurethane foam puf to minimize the biomass loss and enhance the biodegradation process the puf materials had a pore size of 0 56 mm and specific surface area of 256 m2 m3 the packing media was arranged in a curtain shape to facilitate the flow of wastewater avoiding clogging problems the reactor was initially inoculated with 21 0 l sludge which represented 50 of the total reactor volume total solids ts volatile solids vs and sludge volume index svi of the seed sludge were 30 84 3 5 23 74 2 1 g l and 62 23 5 3 ml gtss respectively the volumetric biogas and composition was daily measured by a wet gas meter model lml 1 changchun filter co ltd germany

180 days at olrs of 4 45 and 7 95 gcod l d which were equivalent to hrts of 21 5 and 12 0 h respectively anaerobic batch assays experiments were carried out to optimize the mixing ratio of biscuits wastewater bw with domestic sewage ds to mitigate the inhibition effect caused by long chain fatty acids lcfas fig 1 for this purpose serum bottles with a capacity of 250 ml were supplied with 50 ml anaerobic culture sludge 150 ml substrate the bw ds mixing ratios were respectively 5 1 3 1 1 1 1 3 and 1 5 whereas bw was used as a sole substrate for the control test the experiments were conducted under the conditions of ph 7 5 0 2 all batches were vigorously mixed well and covered by an aluminum caps with specific rubber stopper the headspaces of the serum bottles were 50 ml which was purged

containing 3 bw 1 0 ds diluted in the range of 10 4 10 8 and placed directly on a selective medium i e clostridium botulinum isolation cbi agar the medium was trypticase peptone 40 g l na2hpo4 5 0 g l

mixed and heated at a ph value of 7 4 afterwards the medium was placed in an autoclave at a temperature of 121 c for 15 min and then cooled down to 35 c in a water bath the egg yolk suspension was aseptically added and the medium was fully mixed further 20 ml of the medium was poured into 100 mm plastic petri dishes which were kept in an anaerobic glove box for 4 0 h the h2 gas was detected using 25 ml gas tight test tubes bellco glass inc vineland nj the medium supplemented with glucose and flushed with nitrogen gas for 15 min and placed in an anaerobic chamber the test tubes were filled with the media capped with a rubber stopper crimp sealed and autoclaved for 15 min the morphological and physiological properties were used for strain identification according to bergey s manual of systematic bacteriology 45 the hydrogen producers were determined by the pcr based techniques total genomic dna was extracted and purified from the sludge samples the 16s rrna pcr amplification of the total purified genomic dna pcr clean up and phylogenetic analyses were obtained according to the method described by elsamadony et al 46 the basic local alignment search tool blast was used for online searching to obtain sequence analysis where the phylogenetic analysis was obtained using mega molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 solely anaerobic digestion of biscuits wastewater bw the uahr module was operated for a period of 120 days for treatment of bw as a sole feed substrate at an olr of 21 9 1 7 gcod l d which equivalent to hrt of 12 h the microbial culture was anaerobically acclimatized with high strength bw industry for a period of 28 days during the start up phase the anaerobes was efficiently converted the organics present in wastewater into h2 gas and vfas along with cod reduction 47 this period was followed by a progressive improvement in volumetric hydrogen production rate vhpr and hydrogen yield hy reaching maximum values of 0 95 0 13 l l reactor d and 118 6 22 3 ml g cod removed respectively up to day 94 table 3 concurrently the ph value was declined from 7 5 0 4 bw to 5 2 0 2 in the treated effluent representing a proper ph level to attain the hydrogen fermentative process similarly elbeshbishy et al 48 reported that a ph domain of 5 0 6 0 was suitable for the proliferation of h2 producing bacteria along with controlling the methanogenic activity in the reaction medium in addition the high lipase activity was accounted for 0 11 0 02 u ml table 3 which was responsible for lipids hydrolysis and subsequently enhanced the hydrogen production as reported earlier by elsamadony et al 6 similarly soltan et al 7 found that an adequate lipase activity 0 31 0 02 u ml improved the lipids degradation efficiency realizing high h2 productivity 86 9 4 9 ml gcodremoved from fruit and vegetable peels the degradation efficiencies of c16 0 c18 1 and c18 0 were 49 8 2 5 30 02 2 1 and 22 2 1 6 respectively as these lcfas might be converted into acetate and h2 as shown in table 3 the hac and hbu were increased in the treated effluent by values of 458 and 236 9 mg l respectively due to the acetate fermentation pathway eq 5 where hac hbu ratio exceeded 2 1 0 03 in the treated effluent however the hpr was reduced by a value of 30 9 2 4 which was utilized by acetogenesis for acetate production eq 6 5 a c e t a t e p a t h w a y c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o o h 2 c o 2 4 h 2 6 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 2 c h 3 c h 2 c o o h 2 h 2 o the reactor achieved removal efficiencies of 50 3 15 8 for codt 8 8 6 4 for cods and 55 4 20 6 for codp table 3 the low cods removal efficiency was mainly due to the accumulation of lcfas onto the sludge bed surface creating a barrier that hinders the degradation of the readily biodegradable cods content 27 this finding suggested that adsorption was also an essential mechanism for lcfas removal moreover the module achieved a considerable reduction of codp due to the adsorption entrapment of particles onto the sludge bed and packing materials 18 the cod balance in terms of cod vfa cod biomass cod biosolids and codh2 was calculated to assess the hydrogen recovery from anaerobic digestion of bw the codvfa cod biomass cod biosolids and codh2 was accounted for 31 8 12 25 and 6 3 respectively which equivalent to 75 1 the cod biomass was quite high due to vss tss ratio of bw was 0 95 24 9 of the calculated cod balance was unknown where a portion of cod could be directed for maintenance and cell storage as reported by reddy et al 47 the acidification and acid formation rate was accounted for 28 9 and 288 5 g d d during the following operational period of 94 120 days the vhpr was decreased up to 0 7 0 32 l l reactor d data not shown the lower hydrogen productivity was associated with a drop in the culture ph to below 4 0 where under this conditions the acids and alcoholic metabolites tend to penetrate the microbial cell membrane of anaerobes and inhibit the biodegradation activity of h2 producers 48 this result could also be attributed to the inhibition effect of lcfas accumulation and adsorption by the anaerobic sludge surface 27 moreover this tendency adversely affected the removal efficiencies of cod fractions which significantly p 0 05 dropped to approximately 10 data not shown these findings along with the reduction of hydrolytic extracellular lipases activity by 63 6 suggested the failure condition of the uahr system treating the high strength of bw industry hence the following section suggests the incorporation of a portion of domestic sewage ds into the feed substrate 3 2 optimization of anaerobic co digestion biscuits wastewater domestic sewage at different mixing ratios in batch assay experiments anaerobic co digestion of different substrates provides unique conditions for anaerobes where the limitations of nutrients enzyme activities hydrolysis buffering capacity and inhibition impact of lcfas are certainly overcome moreover the biogas production is increased due to the enhancement of acidogenesis and methanogenesis process martÃ­nez et al 49 revealed that the co digestion of sewage sludge with fat enhanced the digester stability and biogas yield where the toxicity of lipids accumulation onto the anaerobes was properly diminished furthermore zhang et al 17 found that anaerobic co digestion of animal manure with food waste provided 1 an adequate buffering capacity 2 an essential nutrients required for the growth of methanogens 3 an enhancement of biodegradability and d a high biogas productivity fig 2 a shows the cumulative biogas production cbp from anaerobic co digestion of bw and ds at different mixing ratios the maximum cbp of 150 4 10 6 ml was achieved at a mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds this value was about 2 folds higher than those produced from anaerobic digestion of solely bw which demonstrated the positive effect of incorporating ds into lipids rich wastewater during the anaerobic co digestion process under the condition of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds the concentrations of palmitic acid c16 0 oleic acid c18 1 stearic acid c18 0 and linoleic acid c18 2 was dropped up to 40 5 3 7 20 9 1 5 10 4 0 9 and 6 16 4 8 mg l in the digestate fig 2c due to the improved biological and lipase activities of 0 18 0 03 u ml fig 2d apparently the addition of ds diluted the inhibitory compounds resulted from the lcfas accumulation onto microbial anaerobes surfaces silvestre et al 29 reported similar results for anaerobic co digestion of sewage sludge with grease however the acetogenic and methanogenic populations were inhibited at high concentration of total lcfas over 1300 mg l mainly palmitate 80 and oleate 20 fig 2b shows the variations of ph alkalinity ammonia and biogas composition h2 ch4 at different mixing ratios of bw and ds the ph condition attained up to 6 4 0 3 at mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds which is considered an appropriate level for the growth of methanogenic bacteria 50 the methane content amounted to 43 2 3 8 fig 2b moreover the findings revealed that the ds supplementation tended to enhance the culture s buffering capacity with an alkalinity level of 144 6 34 9 mg caco3 l furthermore the ammonia concentration at mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds was sufficient to supply the required nutrients to the anaerobic consortium the degradation efficiency of cods scarb and lipids were maximized at levels of 74 0 5 1 82 7 3 9 and 79 2 6 8 at mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds fig 2d this result complied with the highest lipase enzyme activity of 0 38 0 05 u ml which was substantially higher by 4 folds than those achieved for solely anaerobic digestion of bw similarly donoso bravo et al 30 depicted that high biogas production from the anaerobic co digestion of sewage sludge and grease trap was attributed to the enhancement of lipids degradation by the action of the lipases activities in this context the mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds had a positive impact on the degradation efficiency the enzymatic activity of lipase and cumulative biogas production cbg hence this mixture was employed as a feed for maximizing energy production using continuous operation mode of uahr in section 3 7 3 3 microbial community anaerobic degradation of biscuits wastewater containing lcfas certainly requires syntrophic communities i e acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea where the 1st perform fatty acid Ã oxidation and the 2nd species consume hydrogen and acetate interspecies hydrogen transfer plays a key role in this syntrophic cooperation 51 14 species was identified for degrading of fatty acids in syntrophy with methanogens abbasi et al 11 stated that the aforementioned methanogenic micro organisms were involved in anaerobic digestion for ch4 production via the following reactions in eqs 7 10 7 4 h 2 c o 2 c h 4 2 h 2 o 8 2 c h 4 c h 2 o h c o 2 2 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 9 2 c h 3 c h 2 2 c o o h 2 h 2 o c o 2 4 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 10 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 c o 2 the results of the microbial community in fig 3 complied with the fact that methanogens surpassed the h2 producing bacteria attaining higher ch4 content 43 2 3 8 than h2 content 23 8 2 4 the 16s rrna phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial community associated with the batch anaerobic assay of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds which achieved the maximum biogas production are presented in fig 3 the results exhibited the dominance of different species of methane producing anaerobes i e methanobrevibacter arboriphilus methanospirillum hungatei and methanobrevibacter ruminantium in the reaction medium this was mainly due to the major fraction of biogas was ch4 content as shown in fig 2 this was not the case for hydrogen producers where only clostridium hungatei was detected in the reaction medium where the h2 content was accounted for 23 8 2 4 feng et al 52 mentioned that clostridium hungatei could be used to harvest h2 from the fermentation of various substrates such as cellulose xylan glucose and fructose likely the main archeae s present in the up flow anaerobic separation gases reactor treating polyester wastewater was belonged to methanobacterium and methanosaeta genus which was correlated with the methane production at low olr 23 and firmicutes were detected due to hydrogen generation elreedy et al 13 found that the sequences of anaerobes was close to methanobacterium 56 4 of the archaeal sequences in corporation with proteobacteria 44 3 followed by firmicutes 28 9 chloroflexi 8 9 actinobacteria 5 7 and bacteroidetes 5 6 in anaerobic reactor producing hythane h2 ch4 from petrochemical wastewater industry clostridiales was abundance 41 and composed of clostridiaceae1 and clostridiaceae 4 family level in dark fermentation of gelatinous wastewater industry 53 low fractions of anaerolineales 5 2 and bacteroidales 9 3 was detected in the sludge blanket microbial analysis of anaerobes attached to polyurethane foam pfu and treating saline to hypersaline industrial wastewater showed that the methanogens were abundance and genus of methanosarcina and acetobacterium was dominant in the reactor 8 3 4 anaerobic co digestion of biscuits wastewater and domestic sewage at a mixing ratio of 3 0 1 0 respectively via continuous feed in up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor table 4 summaries of the performance of uahr treating the mixture of bw and ds at organic olrs of 4 45 and 7 95 gcod l d the vhpr and hy values were 1 3 0 21 l l reactor d and 414 2 38 1 ml g codt removed respectively at olr of 7 95 gcod l d fig 4 b this finding complied with the data presented in table 4 in which the vfas hac hbu hla hpr at olr of 7 95 gcod l d i e acidogenic conditions was about 2 folds higher than that achieved at olr of 4 45 gcod l d this result could be linked to the short hrt of 12 0 h providing a conducive condition for hydrogen production 34 similarly si et al 26 found that a short hrt of 8 h was sufficient to attain a h2 yield of 1 47 mol mol sugaradded using an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor fed with glucose kumar et al 54 found that reducing hrt from 24 to 9 0 h in a continuous stirred tank reactor fed with galactose respectively caused h2 improvement from 1 93 to 2 34 l l d which was accompanied by a decrease in the carbohydrate removal efficiency from 93 to 55 their study 54 demonstrated that the longer hrt could switch the metabolic pathway from acetogenesis to solventogenesis a short hrt would add another benefit to the h2 fermentation system regarding the use of smaller bioreactors with low capital e g construction costs moreover the proposed uahr configuration i e the use of polyurethane foam tends to minimize the failure issue by avoiding biomass wash out at short hrt however mariakakis et al 5 found that hy was substantially reduced from 1 72 to 0 26 mol molhexose with decreasing olr from 20 to 2 0 gsucrose l d respectively using a complete mixed tank reactor bravo et al 55 reported that low olr would enable the reproduction of slow growing organisms including methanogenic archaea which tends to consume the hydrogen gas leading to a low h2 production efficiency mthethwa et al 34 revealed that a long fermentation period could enable the accumulation of electron sinks for biomass growth instead of h2 formation thus the biomethanization process was dominant at lower olr of 4 45 gcod l d table 4 which could be associated with the prevalence of the methanogenic conditions at longer hrt of 21 5 h 56 the methane yield my and volumetric methane production rate vmpr was 318 5 23 5 ml g codt removed and 1 01 0 02 l l reactor d respectively at olr of 4 45 gcod l d table 4 and fig 4b better cod removal efficiency was achieved 70 3 18 4 at an olr of 4 45 gcod l d fig 4a due to sufficient contact time between substrate and anaerobes 48 the cod removal efficiency was dropped to 47 5 15 3 at an olr of 7 95 gcod l d this observation could be ascribed to the increased amount of vfas during acidogenic fermentation 6 leading to a high concentration of cods in the final effluent the richness of h2 percentage in the biogas composition produced at an olr of 7 95 gcod l d fig 5 b was also accompanied by the increased of hac and hbu concentrations by acidogenesis bacteria 57 as listed in table 4 the high concentration of ethanol was achieved at olr of 7 95 gcod l d as described by wu et al 58 who achieved the maximum ethanol production at ph value of 5 5 and high olr 3 5 scanning electronic microscope sem typical sem images of polyurethane foam puf packing materials before and after the experimental period of 400 days are shown in fig 5c and d the anaerobes were densely attached to the porous packing material fig 5d the presence of anaerobes in the puf not only minimizes the sludge washout but also enhances the biodegradation process and increase the biomass retention time the ts and vs of the attached biomass was 12 1 7 and 8 7 1 2 g lpuf and vs ts ratio was 72 5 indicating the presence of active micro organisms 3 6 sustainable application of up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor uahr for biogas production from co digestion of biscuits wastewater and domestic sewage at a mixing ratio of 3 0 1 0 respectively this part attempts to integrate the biological fermenter digester into a framework for ensuring the economic feasibility of h2 and ch4 production along with other environmental benefits e g pollutants removal and final use appropriate data were retrieved from experimental laboratory tests manufacturer quotes and literature databases related to the case study similar to bonk et al 19 the study would save 25 of the assumed economic and energy analyses due to the limited specific measurements as well as the variability in assumptions and methodologies 3 6 1 layout of scaling up the proposed up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor uahr module fig 6 a and b show the layout of the proposed anaerobic co digestion chain for production of biogas rich ch4 and h2 from biscuits wastewater bw and domestic sewage ds at mixing ratio of 3 0 1 0 respectively as adapted from 10 based on a series of anaerobic co digestion batches fig 2 the selected mixture was appropriate for reducing the inhibition effect of lcfas accumulation leading to enhanced microbial activities and biogas rich ch4 h2 production initially a pre treatment step was suggested to eliminate any undesirable material that could damage the equipment cause technical issues in the digester or inhibit the biological treatment process screens are proposed as a suitable option for the pre treatment process to remove large particles 59 which were then disposed of into a sanitary landfill assuming a transfer distance of 80 km via diesel fuelled vehicles an equalization tank is used to control the olr fluctuation leading to the improvement of the efficiency and stability of the following anaerobic digestion system 60 wastewater is flowed from the pre treatment step to the anaerobic digestion process for energy recovery purpose in this study two scenarios were planned for the main anaerobic biological process case 1 is the use of olr of 4 45 gcod l d for ch4 rich biogas production fig 6a and case 2 is the application of olr of 7 95 gcod l d for h2 rich biogas production fig 6b the required information on co substrate bw ds conversion efficiencies ch4 and h2 yields of each approach were obtained from the experimental data summarized in table 4 this comparison is essential to perform an assessment of alternatives e g use of h2 in fuel cells or ch4 in gas turbines and or to substitute natural gas for cooking and heating under the same process basis biogas rich ch4 h2 production was not only the main benefit in the projected anaerobic co digestion framework for this purpose the anaerobically pretreated effluent is introduced to a separation technology post treatment stage equivalent to 15 5 usd m3 19 this phase is assumed to eliminate the remaining portions of undesirable soluble and particulate organics in the effluent of anaerobic module before land application as reported by thompson et al 61 the post treatment unit is provided by two outlet lines viz a the supernatant is moved to an effluent storage tank for irrigation purpose and b the solid phase is transferred to a sludge storage tank for the composting application in parallel centrifuge filter system could be utilized for sludge dewatering where the electricity demands to centrifuge the feed and pasteurize the supernatant was assumed to be 0 04 and 0 07 kw h l respectively 62 this unit is connected to two outlets 63 viz a the supernatant aqueous phase obtained after centrifugation would have fertilizer potential providing a high nitrogen and phosphate content to replace chemical ones and b the separated solids are used for composting as a valuable soil amendment option for agricultural practices the total cost of composting includes forced ventilation mechanical equipment and retention time 28 days and it is presumed that replacing 1 0 tone of conventional fertilizer would save 241 5 kw h 19 the application of sludge dewatering accompanied by irrigation and composting has been adopted from bonk et al 19 all required energy was equivalent to 0 03 usd kwh based on the current tariff of electricity prices in the country 3 6 2 outcomes of techno economic assessment table 5 summarizes the outcomes of the economic assessment including profits from energy recovery irrigation composting and environmental benefits it was found that biogas rich h2 production had a higher initial investment cost of 18 494 usd m3 compared to 15 178 usd m3 for biogas rich ch4 production which could be due to the requirement of additional facilities for the treatment of partially stabilized uahr effluent 64 this pattern is noted previously in table 4 in which the cod removal efficiencies of hydrogen fermentative process are lower than those achieved for methane production the sum of operating costs for biogas rich h2 production i e 5 405 usd m3 y was higher than that of biogas rich ch4 production 3 649 usd m3 yr which could be associated with the addition of mineral media and buffer to avoid vfas inhibition 9 supplementary nutrients and buffering agents added to the effluent storage unit before irrigation were equivalent to an operating cost of about 0 444 0 473 usd m3 yr fig 6a operating costs also included maintenance and installation expenses of 2 0 and 10 per equipment purchase respectively the operating cost of energy recovery included the utilization of naoh absorption and addition of ad13 to eliminate trace elements e g h2s and co2 from biogas as reported by francini et al 65 on the other hand biogas rich h2 production represented a higher sum of profits which could be linked to the higher energy content of hydrogen gas compared to the case of ch4 rich biogas production viz heating values of 17 7 mj kgcodhâ and 12 5 mj kgcodchâ 66 in addition biogas was the main source of potential profits followed by the revenues obtained from either composting or irrigation the revenue derived from the item pollutants removal see table 5 retained an acceptable profit distribution which corresponded to the addition of 0 13 8 06 and 30 94 to the cash flow for the removals of 1 0 kg of cod n and p respectively 67 these values represented prices paid by the municipality for treatment of the wafer wastewater and domestic sewage avoiding environmental damages if contaminants were dumped in an uncontrolled manner both approaches attained payback periods below the project lifespan 20 yr indicating that the investment is environmentally and economically acceptable the payback period of biogas rich h2 production 5 7 yr was lower than that of biogas rich ch4 production 7 1 yr implying that the h2 based scenario would recoup its initial investment earlier than the ch4 based pathway in addition the combustion of h2 would release only water vapor with no pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions compared to the stoichiometric factor of 2 75 kgcoâ per kgchâ it is also recommended that the anaerobic digestion treatment plant would be established close to the land application e g irrigation and composting to reduce additional transportation costs a similar approach has been conducted by tapia rodrÃ­guez et al 9 which revealed the techno economic feasibility for the utilization of agave bagasse hydrolysate for energy production using two pathways i e a ch4 rich biogas and b h2 rich biogas the output of this investigation would provide meaningful indicators to ensure the bio economy concept and maintain environmental integrity particularly in developing countries further research and pilot scale studies are therefore necessary to support the utilization of wafer wastewater in commercial energy production the pilot scale researches would include several strategies such as deactivation of bio hydrogen consuming organisms removal of inhibitory by products and improvement of the substrate conversion efficiency to enhance the bio h2 productivity although the study depicted that the revenues profits of the proposed project would recover the cost of an investment a full life cycle analysis is needed to assess the overall environmental impact of the studied process and that will be carried out in our future work 4 conclusions biscuits wastewater bw industry is largely generated from food manufacturing company in egypt and it is rich with lipids organics and nutrients causing severe concerns to the receiving environment the anaerobic digestion of solely bw provided the maximum vhpr and hy values of 0 95 0 13 l l d and 118 6 22 3 ml g cod removed respectively at an olr of 21 9 1 7 gcod l d the anaerobic co digestion of bw and ds at an optimum mixing ratio of 3 0 1 0 respectively minimized the inhibitory effect of lcfas accumulation and ensured the system performance stability achieving a cumulative biogas production of 150 4 10 6 ml the microbial community analysis revealed the dominance of m arboriphilus m hungatei and m ruminantium as methanogens coupled with hydrogen producing bacteria of c hungatei the uahr was continuously fed with 3 bw 1 ds for biogas production and operated at a olrs of 4 45 and 7 95 gcod l d the module achieved ch4 and h2 yields of 318 5 23 5 and 414 2 38 1 ml gcodremoved at olrs of 4 45 and 7 95 gcod l d respectively the techno economic estimation and payback period for the sustainable treatment process of biscuits wastewater industry and domestic sewage implied that biogas rich h2 production would recover its initial investment within 5 7 yr compared to 7 1 yr for biogas rich ch4 the payback periods were shorter than the project lifespan and hence the application of the proposed uahr framework would be economically feasible credit authorship contribution

13738,the up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor uahr was simultaneously employed for 2 biofuels h2 and ch4 production from solely biscuits wastewater bw industry and a mixture of bw with domestic sewage ds at a mixing ratio of 3 1 respectively the uahr was fed with bw and operated at an organic loading rate olr of 21 9 1 7 gcod l d and hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 0 h the module achieved volumetric hydrogen production rate vhpr and hydrogen yield hy of 0 95 0 13 l l reactor d and 118 6 22 3 ml gcodremoved respectively a substantial deterioration in the h2 productivity was occurred after 94 days of continuous feed operation due to the inhibition effect of long chain fatty acids lcfas ds was integrated into the bw at mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds where the uahr was continuously operated at olrs of 7 95 and 4 45 gcod l d achieving h2 and ch4 yields of 414 2 38 1 and 318 5 23 5 ml gcod removed respectively the payback periods for the production of biogas rich ch4 and h2 were 7 1 and 5 7 y respectively keywords anaerobic co digestion biogas rich h2 and or ch4 production techno economic analysis biscuits wastewater 1 introduction biscuits industry consumes a huge quantities of water and energy 1 moreover considerable amounts of high strength wastewater are daily produced and discharged into sewerage network causing severe environmental and health problems 2 fortunately this type of wastewater is highly biodegradable rich with lipids carbohydrates and nutrients which are suitable for energy production via anaerobic digestion process 1 3 2 biofuels h2 and ch4 production from biscuits wastewater bw industry is considered a clean environmentally friendly and renewable source of energy available for low income and developing countries 4 hydrogen h2 is an energy vector and the cleanest fuel that provides efficient energy conversion for multiple applications such as electricity and heating 5 h2 has a heating value of 33 3 kw h kg representing about 3 folds higher than conventional chemical fuels 6 8 methane ch4 gas has a lower heating value of 13 9 kw h kg 9 and it has been effectively utilized for essential applications viz vehicle fuels heating electricity and domestic purposes 10 because 2 biofuels h2 and ch4 is a novel approach an efficient reliable and non polluting energy source 11 it has attracted broad attention in terms of the energy crisis and environmental pollution hence more research should be conducted for maximizing its productivity anaerobic digestion is realistic and feasible process which has been extensively utilized to generate energy along with wastewater treatment 12 hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis are the processes contributed in lipids degradation 13 19 biofuels production from anaerobic digestion of wastewater rich lipids are strongly influenced by the culture ph hydraulic retention time hrt organic loading rate olr and substrate type 5 12 20 23 hydrolysis of lipids rich wastewater would produce long chain fatty acids lcfas 2 12 those lcfas are further anaerobically biodegraded through Î² oxidation to produce h2 and acetate which are then utilized by acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens to generate ch4 24 25 lipids rich wastewater could be feasible and attractive substrate for energy production along with pollution minimization 12 18 rusÃ­n et al 16 achieved a sufficient amount of biogas with a ch4 content of 55 1 from anaerobic digestion of wastewater industry however lcfas accumulation in the digester was occurred due to the inefficient utilization of organic acids by methanogens 26 this tendency leads to an overly acidic digester with a remarkable low ph environment 27 moreover the accumulation adsorption of lcfas onto the sludge bed of the anaerobic module creates a physical barrier which hinders the transfer of substrates and metabolite by products from the reaction medium into the bacterial cells this operation mode would inhibit the anaerobic microbial activities causing a failure of the anaerobic digestion of wastewater rich lipids the dilution of the inhibitory compounds via the addition of sewage sludge was previously reported by silvestre et al 28 29 hence the co digestion of biscuits wastewater bw rich lipids with domestic sewage ds is a promising approach to mitigate the inhibition effect of accumulation of lcfas deposition on microbial anaerobes surfaces and minimize the required synthetic chemical substrate 17 30 32 therefore the aims of this study are to 1 assess the efficiency of up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor for simultaneously treatment and h2 production from solely biscuits wastewater bw industry at olr of 21 9 1 7 gcod l d and hrt of 12 h 2 study the impact of addition of domestic sewage ds as a co substrate at different mixing ratios on the anaerobic digestion of bw with emphasis on the identification of the dominant microbial species 3 evaluate the performance of up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor treating a mixture of 3 bw 1 ds for biofuels h2 and ch4 production at olrs of 7 95 and 4 45 gcod l d and 4 estimate the techno economic feasibility and payback period for the sustainable approach of treatment of the mixture of bw 3 and ds 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewaters collection and characterization biscuits wastewater bw industry and domestic sewage ds was daily collected from ocean foods manufacturing company new borg el arab city alexandria egypt the main products of the company are cakes cookies chocolates and biscuits the mixture of bw 433 m3 d and ds 144 m3 was combined and discharged into the sewers network before taking the decision for separation of sewers lines for bw and ds and minimize the construction cost treatment of the mixture of bw and ds at different ratios was extensively investigated here table 1 summarizes the characteristics of bw and ds the ph value was slightly acidic 4 2 0 1 for bw and neutral 7 1 0 3 for ds the major portion of the codt in bw was in a particulate form 80 and the cods were only 20 this is not the case for ds where the cods codt and codp codt ratios were 40 and 60 respectively likely the scarb tcarb and pcarb tcarb ratios were 0 27 and 0 37 for bw 0 73 and 0 63 for ds respectively the bw was highly rich with lipids 3581 4 852 7 mg l and carbohydrate 1537 9 201 6 mg l providing a suitable substrate for the anaerobic digestion process the lipids carbohydrate ratio was 2 3 in bw and 0 24 in ds which grantees the feasibility of co digestion of bw and ds to mitigate the inhibition impact of lcfas 538 2 81 7 mg l for palmitic acid c16 0 58 9 7 9 mg l for stearic acid c18 0 and 291 1 42 5 mg l for oleic acid c18 1 the total lcfas and lipids concentrations were 888 2 and 3581 4 mg l respectively 2693 2 mg l was not accounted due to the concentrations of fats oils glycerol other saturated and unsaturated lcfas were not determined in this study palmitic oleic and stearic acids were selected due to their high inhibitory effect on the microbial activity as reported earlier by deaver et al 33 the biodegradability of bw and ds was quite high as the vss tss ratio was 0 95 and 0 73 respectively 2 2 up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor and inoculum sludge 42 0 l of an up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor uahr was employed for continuous feeding experiments fig 1 the reactor was manufactured from the perspex material with a height of 134 cm and a diameter of 20 cm the top part of the reactor was equipped by polyurethane foam puf to minimize the biomass loss and enhance the biodegradation process the puf materials had a pore size of 0 56 mm and specific surface area of 256 m2 m3 the packing media was arranged in a curtain shape to facilitate the flow of wastewater avoiding clogging problems the reactor was initially inoculated with 21 0 l sludge which represented 50 of the total reactor volume total solids ts volatile solids vs and sludge volume index svi of the seed sludge were 30 84 3 5 23 74 2 1 g l and 62 23 5 3 ml gtss respectively the volumetric biogas and composition was daily measured by a wet gas meter model lml 1 changchun filter co ltd germany and gas chromatography respectively the initial ph value of the influent bw was adjusted at a level of 7 5 0 4 using sodium bicarbonate 2 3 experimental setup table 2 and fig 1 display the operational conditions of the continuous and batch assay experiments respectively the uahr was continuously operated at an ambient temperature of 20 31 c avoiding a high cost for operational conditions and fed with 1 solely biscuits wastewater bw for a period of 120 days at an olr of 20 gcod l d and hrt of 12 h 2 mixture of biscuits wastewater bw and domestic sewage ds at mixing ratio of 3 1 for a period of 180 days at olrs of 4 45 and 7 95 gcod l d which were equivalent to hrts of 21 5 and 12 0 h respectively anaerobic batch assays experiments were carried out to optimize the mixing ratio of biscuits wastewater bw with domestic sewage ds to mitigate the inhibition effect caused by long chain fatty acids lcfas fig 1 for this purpose serum bottles with a capacity of 250 ml were supplied with 50 ml anaerobic culture sludge 150 ml substrate the bw ds mixing ratios were respectively 5 1 3 1 1 1 1 3 and 1 5 whereas bw was used as a sole substrate for the control test the experiments were conducted under the conditions of ph 7 5 0 2 all batches were vigorously mixed well and covered by an aluminum caps with specific rubber stopper the headspaces of the serum bottles were 50 ml which was purged with nitrogen gas for 20 min to assure the anaerobic conditions the batches sets were placed in a water bath without mixing at a temperature 25 2 c the batch experiments were conducted in triplicate for a period of 15 days the biogas production and composition in terms of h2 ch4 and co2 were daily measured by displacement method and gas chromatography respectively 34 the batch experiments were terminated after 15 days where the biogas production was completely stopped the modified gompertz equation eq 1 model was used to calculate the h2 and ch4 potential and maximum production rate where h

according to apha 42 the soluble cod cods and soluble carbohydrate s carbo was measured after filtration using membrane with pore size of 0 45 Î¼m the cod and carbohydrate in a particulate form codp and pcarb was calculated by subtraction of codt and cods tcarbo and scarbo respectively carbohydrate measurement was performed by the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as the standard 31 ethanol et oh and vfas compositions in terms of hac hpr hla and hbu were determined using high performance liquid chromatography lc 10 ad shimadzu japan long chain fatty acids lcfas i e palmitic acid c16 0 stearic acid c18 0 and oleic acid c18 1 were determined and quantified based on the method described by neves et al 43 the composition of biogas was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu japan lipase enzyme activity was determined according to mostafa et al 25 the images of surface and morphology of polyurethane foam puf before and after the experiments were taken by a jsm 5600 lv scanning electron microscope jeol japan at 25 and 20 kv as reported by tawfik et al 44 2 5 microbial community analysis for microbial analysis sludge samples were withdrawn from the batches containing 3 bw 1 0 ds diluted in the range of 10 4 10 8 and placed directly on a selective medium i e clostridium botulinum isolation cbi agar the medium was trypticase peptone 40 g l na2hpo4 5 0 g l

mixed and heated at a ph value of 7 4 afterwards the medium was placed in an autoclave at a temperature of 121 c for 15 min and then cooled down to 35 c in a water bath the egg yolk suspension was aseptically added and the medium was fully mixed further 20 ml of the medium was poured into 100 mm plastic petri dishes which were kept in an anaerobic glove box for 4 0 h the h2 gas was detected using 25 ml gas tight test tubes bellco glass inc vineland nj the medium supplemented with glucose and flushed with nitrogen gas for 15 min and placed in an anaerobic chamber the test tubes were filled with the media capped with a rubber stopper crimp sealed and autoclaved for 15 min the morphological and physiological properties were used for strain identification according to bergey s manual of systematic bacteriology 45 the hydrogen producers were determined by the pcr based techniques total genomic dna was extracted and purified from the sludge samples the 16s rrna pcr amplification of the total purified genomic dna pcr clean up and phylogenetic analyses were obtained according to the method described by elsamadony et al 46 the basic local alignment search tool blast was used for online searching to obtain sequence analysis where the phylogenetic analysis was obtained using mega molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 3 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 solely anaerobic digestion of biscuits wastewater bw the uahr module was operated for a period of 120 days for treatment of bw as a sole feed substrate at an olr of 21 9 1 7 gcod l d which equivalent to hrt of 12 h the microbial culture was anaerobically acclimatized with high strength bw industry for a period of 28 days during the start up phase the anaerobes was efficiently converted the organics present in wastewater into h2 gas and vfas along with cod reduction 47 this period was followed by a progressive improvement in volumetric hydrogen production rate vhpr and hydrogen yield hy reaching maximum values of 0 95 0 13 l l reactor d and 118 6 22 3 ml g cod removed respectively up to day 94 table 3 concurrently the ph value was declined from 7 5 0 4 bw to 5 2 0 2 in the treated effluent representing a proper ph level to attain the hydrogen fermentative process similarly elbeshbishy et al 48 reported that a ph domain of 5 0 6 0 was suitable for the proliferation of h2 producing bacteria along with controlling the methanogenic activity in the reaction medium in addition the high lipase activity was accounted for 0 11 0 02 u ml table 3 which was responsible for lipids hydrolysis and subsequently enhanced the hydrogen production as reported earlier by elsamadony et al 6 similarly soltan et al 7 found that an adequate lipase activity 0 31 0 02 u ml improved the lipids degradation efficiency realizing high h2 productivity 86 9 4 9 ml gcodremoved from fruit and vegetable peels the degradation efficiencies of c16 0 c18 1 and c18 0 were 49 8 2 5 30 02 2 1 and 22 2 1 6 respectively as these lcfas might be converted into acetate and h2 as shown in table 3 the hac and hbu were increased in the treated effluent by values of 458 and 236 9 mg l respectively due to the acetate fermentation pathway eq 5 where hac hbu ratio exceeded 2 1 0 03 in the treated effluent however the hpr was reduced by a value of 30 9 2 4 which was utilized by acetogenesis for acetate production eq 6 5 a c e t a t e p a t h w a y c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o o h 2 c o 2 4 h 2 6 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 2 c h 3 c h 2 c o o h 2 h 2 o the reactor achieved removal efficiencies of 50 3 15 8 for codt 8 8 6 4 for cods and 55 4 20 6 for codp table 3 the low cods removal efficiency was mainly due to the accumulation of lcfas onto the sludge bed surface creating a barrier that hinders the degradation of the readily biodegradable cods content 27 this finding suggested that adsorption was also an essential mechanism for lcfas removal moreover the module achieved a considerable reduction of codp due to the adsorption entrapment of particles onto the sludge bed and packing materials 18 the cod balance in terms of cod vfa cod biomass cod biosolids and codh2 was calculated to assess the hydrogen recovery from anaerobic digestion of bw the codvfa cod biomass cod biosolids and codh2 was accounted for 31 8 12 25 and 6 3 respectively which equivalent to 75 1 the cod biomass was quite high due to vss tss ratio of bw was 0 95 24 9 of the calculated cod balance was unknown where a portion of cod could be directed for maintenance and cell storage as reported by reddy et al 47 the acidification and acid formation rate was accounted for 28 9 and 288 5 g d d during the following operational period of 94 120 days the vhpr was decreased up to 0 7 0 32 l l reactor d data not shown the lower hydrogen productivity was associated with a drop in the culture ph to below 4 0 where under this conditions the acids and alcoholic metabolites tend to penetrate the microbial cell membrane of anaerobes and inhibit the biodegradation activity of h2 producers 48 this result could also be attributed to the inhibition effect of lcfas accumulation and adsorption by the anaerobic sludge surface 27 moreover this tendency adversely affected the removal efficiencies of cod fractions which significantly p 0 05 dropped to approximately 10 data not shown these findings along with the reduction of hydrolytic extracellular lipases activity by 63 6 suggested the failure condition of the uahr system treating the high strength of bw industry hence the following section suggests the incorporation of a portion of domestic sewage ds into the feed substrate 3 2 optimization of anaerobic co digestion biscuits wastewater domestic sewage at different mixing ratios in batch assay experiments anaerobic co digestion of different substrates provides unique conditions for anaerobes where the limitations of nutrients enzyme activities hydrolysis buffering capacity and inhibition impact of lcfas are certainly overcome moreover the biogas production is increased due to the enhancement of acidogenesis and methanogenesis process martÃ­nez et al 49 revealed that the co digestion of sewage sludge with fat enhanced the digester stability and biogas yield where the toxicity of lipids accumulation onto the anaerobes was properly diminished furthermore zhang et al 17 found that anaerobic co digestion of animal manure with food waste provided 1 an adequate buffering capacity 2 an essential nutrients required for the growth of methanogens 3 an enhancement of biodegradability and d a high biogas productivity fig 2 a shows the cumulative biogas production cbp from anaerobic co digestion of bw and ds at different mixing ratios the maximum cbp of 150 4 10 6 ml was achieved at a mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds this value was about 2 folds higher than those produced from anaerobic digestion of solely bw which demonstrated the positive effect of incorporating ds into lipids rich wastewater during the anaerobic co digestion process under the condition of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds the concentrations of palmitic acid c16 0 oleic acid c18 1 stearic acid c18 0 and linoleic acid c18 2 was dropped up to 40 5 3 7 20 9 1 5 10 4 0 9 and 6 16 4 8 mg l in the digestate fig 2c due to the improved biological and lipase activities of 0 18 0 03 u ml fig 2d apparently the addition of ds diluted the inhibitory compounds resulted from the lcfas accumulation onto microbial anaerobes surfaces silvestre et al 29 reported similar results for anaerobic co digestion of sewage sludge with grease however the acetogenic and methanogenic populations were inhibited at high concentration of total lcfas over 1300 mg l mainly palmitate 80 and oleate 20 fig 2b shows the variations of ph alkalinity ammonia and biogas composition h2 ch4 at different mixing ratios of bw and ds the ph condition attained up to 6 4 0 3 at mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds which is considered an appropriate level for the growth of methanogenic bacteria 50 the methane content amounted to 43 2 3 8 fig 2b moreover the findings revealed that the ds supplementation tended to enhance the culture s buffering capacity with an alkalinity level of 144 6 34 9 mg caco3 l furthermore the ammonia concentration at mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds was sufficient to supply the required nutrients to the anaerobic consortium the degradation efficiency of cods scarb and lipids were maximized at levels of 74 0 5 1 82 7 3 9 and 79 2 6 8 at mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds fig 2d this result complied with the highest lipase enzyme activity of 0 38 0 05 u ml which was substantially higher by 4 folds than those achieved for solely anaerobic digestion of bw similarly donoso bravo et al 30 depicted that high biogas production from the anaerobic co digestion of sewage sludge and grease trap was attributed to the enhancement of lipids degradation by the action of the lipases activities in this context the mixing ratio of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds had a positive impact on the degradation efficiency the enzymatic activity of lipase and cumulative biogas production cbg hence this mixture was employed as a feed for maximizing energy production using continuous operation mode of uahr in section 3 7 3 3 microbial community anaerobic degradation of biscuits wastewater containing lcfas certainly requires syntrophic communities i e acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea where the 1st perform fatty acid Ã oxidation and the 2nd species consume hydrogen and acetate interspecies hydrogen transfer plays a key role in this syntrophic cooperation 51 14 species was identified for degrading of fatty acids in syntrophy with methanogens abbasi et al 11 stated that the aforementioned methanogenic micro organisms were involved in anaerobic digestion for ch4 production via the following reactions in eqs 7 10 7 4 h 2 c o 2 c h 4 2 h 2 o 8 2 c h 4 c h 2 o h c o 2 2 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 9 2 c h 3 c h 2 2 c o o h 2 h 2 o c o 2 4 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 10 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 c o 2 the results of the microbial community in fig 3 complied with the fact that methanogens surpassed the h2 producing bacteria attaining higher ch4 content 43 2 3 8 than h2 content 23 8 2 4 the 16s rrna phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial community associated with the batch anaerobic assay of 3 0 bw 1 0 ds which achieved the maximum biogas production are presented in fig 3 the results exhibited the dominance of different species of methane producing anaerobes i e methanobrevibacter arboriphilus methanospirillum hungatei and methanobrevibacter ruminantium in the reaction medium this was mainly due to the major fraction of biogas was ch4 content as shown in fig 2 this was not the case for hydrogen producers where only clostridium hungatei was detected in the reaction medium where the h2 content was accounted for 23 8 2 4 feng et al 52 mentioned that clostridium hungatei could be used to harvest h2 from the fermentation of various substrates such as cellulose xylan glucose and fructose likely the main archeae s present in the up flow anaerobic separation gases reactor treating polyester wastewater was belonged to methanobacterium and methanosaeta genus which was correlated with the methane production at low olr 23 and firmicutes were detected due to hydrogen generation elreedy et al 13 found that the sequences of anaerobes was close to methanobacterium 56 4 of the archaeal sequences in corporation with proteobacteria 44 3 followed by firmicutes 28 9 chloroflexi 8 9 actinobacteria 5 7 and bacteroidetes 5 6 in anaerobic reactor producing hythane h2 ch4 from petrochemical wastewater industry clostridiales was abundance 41 and composed of clostridiaceae1 and clostridiaceae 4 family level in dark fermentation of gelatinous wastewater industry 53 low fractions of anaerolineales 5 2 and bacteroidales 9 3 was detected in the sludge blanket microbial analysis of anaerobes attached to polyurethane foam pfu and treating saline to hypersaline industrial wastewater showed that the methanogens were abundance and genus of methanosarcina and acetobacterium was dominant in the reactor 8 3 4 anaerobic co digestion of biscuits wastewater and domestic sewage at a mixing ratio of 3 0 1 0 respectively via continuous feed in up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor table 4 summaries of the performance of uahr treating the mixture of bw and ds at organic olrs of 4 45 and 7 95 gcod l d the vhpr and hy values were 1 3 0 21 l l reactor d and 414 2 38 1 ml g codt removed respectively at olr of 7 95 gcod l d fig 4 b this finding complied with the data presented in table 4 in which the vfas hac hbu hla hpr at olr of 7 95 gcod l d i e acidogenic conditions was about 2 folds higher than that achieved at olr of 4 45 gcod l d this result could be linked to the short hrt of 12 0 h providing a conducive condition for hydrogen production 34 similarly si et al 26 found that a short hrt of 8 h was sufficient to attain a h2 yield of 1 47 mol mol sugaradded using an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor fed with glucose kumar et al 54 found that reducing hrt from 24 to 9 0 h in a continuous stirred tank reactor fed with galactose respectively caused h2 improvement from 1 93 to 2 34 l l d which was accompanied by a decrease in the carbohydrate removal efficiency from 93 to 55 their study 54 demonstrated that the longer hrt could switch the metabolic pathway from acetogenesis to solventogenesis a short hrt would add another benefit to the h2 fermentation system regarding the use of smaller bioreactors with low capital e g construction costs moreover the proposed uahr configuration i e the use of polyurethane foam tends to minimize the failure issue by avoiding biomass wash out at short hrt however mariakakis et al 5 found that hy was substantially reduced from 1 72 to 0 26 mol molhexose with decreasing olr from 20 to 2 0 gsucrose l d respectively using a complete mixed tank reactor bravo et al 55 reported that low olr would enable the reproduction of slow growing organisms including methanogenic archaea which tends to consume the hydrogen gas leading to a low h2 production efficiency mthethwa et al 34 revealed that a long fermentation period could enable the accumulation of electron sinks for biomass growth instead of h2 formation thus the biomethanization process was dominant at lower olr of 4 45 gcod l d table 4 which could be associated with the prevalence of the methanogenic conditions at longer hrt of 21 5 h 56 the methane yield my and volumetric methane production rate vmpr was 318 5 23 5 ml g codt removed and 1 01 0 02 l l reactor d respectively at olr of 4 45 gcod l d table 4 and fig 4b better cod removal efficiency was achieved 70 3 18 4 at an olr of 4 45 gcod l d fig 4a due to sufficient contact time between substrate and anaerobes 48 the cod removal efficiency was dropped to 47 5 15 3 at an olr of 7 95 gcod l d this observation could be ascribed to the increased amount of vfas during acidogenic fermentation 6 leading to a high concentration of cods in the final effluent the richness of h2 percentage in the biogas composition produced at an olr of 7 95 gcod l d fig 5 b was also accompanied by the increased of hac and hbu concentrations by acidogenesis bacteria 57 as listed in table 4 the high concentration of ethanol was achieved at olr of 7 95 gcod l d as described by wu et al 58 who achieved the maximum ethanol production at ph value of 5 5 and high olr 3 5 scanning electronic microscope sem typical sem images of polyurethane foam puf packing materials before and after the experimental period of 400 days are shown in fig 5c and d the anaerobes were densely attached to the porous packing material fig 5d the presence of anaerobes in the puf not only minimizes the sludge washout but also enhances the biodegradation process and increase the biomass retention time the ts and vs of the attached biomass was 12 1 7 and 8 7 1 2 g lpuf and vs ts ratio was 72 5 indicating the presence of active micro organisms 3 6 sustainable application of up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor uahr for biogas production from co digestion of biscuits wastewater and domestic sewage at a mixing ratio of 3 0 1 0 respectively this part attempts to integrate the biological fermenter digester into a framework for ensuring the economic feasibility of h2 and ch4 production along with other environmental benefits e g pollutants removal and final use appropriate data were retrieved from experimental laboratory tests manufacturer quotes and literature databases related to the case study similar to bonk et al 19 the study would save 25 of the assumed economic and energy analyses due to the limited specific measurements as well as the variability in assumptions and methodologies 3 6 1 layout of scaling up the proposed up flow anaerobic hybrid reactor uahr module fig 6 a and b show the layout of the proposed anaerobic co digestion chain for production of biogas rich ch4 and h2 from biscuits wastewater bw and domestic sewage ds at mixing ratio of 3 0 1 0 respectively as adapted from 10 based on a series of anaerobic co digestion batches fig 2 the selected mixture was appropriate for reducing the inhibition effect of lcfas accumulation leading to enhanced microbial activities and biogas rich ch4 h2 production initially a pre treatment step was suggested to eliminate any undesirable material that could damage the equipment cause technical issues in the digester or inhibit the biological treatment process screens are proposed as a suitable option for the pre treatment process to remove large particles 59 which were then disposed of into a sanitary landfill assuming a transfer distance of 80 km via diesel fuelled vehicles an equalization tank is used to control the olr fluctuation leading to the improvement of the efficiency and stability of the following anaerobic digestion system 60 wastewater is flowed from the pre treatment step to the anaerobic digestion process for energy recovery purpose in this study two scenarios were planned for the main anaerobic biological process case 1 is the use of olr of 4 45 gcod l d for ch4 rich biogas production fig 6a and case 2 is the application of olr of 7 95 gcod l d for h2 rich biogas production fig 6b the required information on co substrate bw ds conversion efficiencies ch4 and h2 yields of each approach were obtained from the experimental data summarized in table 4 this comparison is essential to perform an assessment of alternatives e g use of h2 in fuel cells or ch4 in gas turbines and or to substitute natural gas for cooking and heating under the same process basis biogas rich ch4 h2 production was not only the main benefit in the projected anaerobic co digestion framework for this purpose the anaerobically pretreated effluent is introduced to a separation technology post treatment stage equivalent to 15 5 usd m3 19 this phase is assumed to eliminate the remaining portions of undesirable soluble and particulate organics in the effluent of anaerobic module before land application as reported by thompson et al 61 the post treatment unit is provided by two outlet lines viz a the supernatant is moved to an effluent storage tank for irrigation purpose and b the solid phase is transferred to a sludge storage tank for the composting application in parallel centrifuge filter system could be utilized for sludge dewatering where the electricity demands to centrifuge the feed and pasteurize the supernatant was assumed to be 0 04 and 0 07 kw h l respectively 62 this unit is connected to two outlets 63 viz a the supernatant aqueous phase obtained after centrifugation would have fertilizer potential providing a high nitrogen and phosphate content to replace chemical ones and b the separated solids are used for composting as a valuable soil amendment option for agricultural practices the total cost of composting includes forced ventilation mechanical equipment and retention time 28 days and it is presumed that replacing 1 0 tone of conventional fertilizer would save 241 5 kw h 19 the application of sludge dewatering accompanied by irrigation and composting has been adopted from bonk et al 19 all required energy was equivalent to 0 03 usd kwh based on the current tariff of electricity prices in the country 3 6 2 outcomes of techno economic assessment table 5 summarizes the outcomes of the economic assessment including profits from energy recovery irrigation composting and environmental benefits it was found that biogas rich h2 production had a higher initial investment cost of 18 494 usd m3 compared to 15 178 usd m3 for biogas rich ch4 production which could be due to the requirement of additional facilities for the treatment of partially stabilized uahr effluent 64 this pattern is noted previously in table 4 in which the cod removal efficiencies of hydrogen fermentative process are lower than those achieved for methane production the sum of operating costs for biogas rich h2 production i e 5 405 usd m3 y was higher than that of biogas rich ch4 production 3 649 usd m3 yr which could be associated with the addition of mineral media and buffer to avoid vfas inhibition 9 supplementary nutrients and buffering agents added to the effluent storage unit before irrigation were equivalent to an operating cost of about 0 444 0 473 usd m3 yr fig 6a operating costs also included maintenance and installation expenses of 2 0 and 10 per equipment purchase respectively the operating cost of energy recovery included the utilization of naoh absorption and addition of ad13 to eliminate trace elements e g h2s and co2 from biogas as reported by francini et al 65 on the other hand biogas rich h2 production represented a higher sum of profits which could be linked to the higher energy content of hydrogen gas compared to the case of ch4 rich biogas production viz heating values of 17 7 mj kgcodhâ and 12 5 mj kgcodchâ 66 in addition biogas was the main source of potential profits followed by the revenues obtained from either composting or irrigation the revenue derived from the item pollutants removal see table 5 retained an acceptable profit distribution which corresponded to the addition of 0 13 8 06 and 30 94 to the cash flow for the removals of 1 0 kg of cod n and p respectively 67 these values represented prices paid by the municipality for treatment of the wafer wastewater and domestic sewage avoiding environmental damages if contaminants were dumped in an uncontrolled manner both approaches attained payback periods below the project lifespan 20 yr indicating that the investment is environmentally and economically acceptable the payback period of biogas rich h2 production 5 7 yr was lower than that of biogas rich ch4 production 7 1 yr implying that the h2 based scenario would recoup its initial investment earlier than the ch4 based pathway in addition the combustion of h2 would release only water vapor with no pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions compared to the stoichiometric factor of 2 75 kgcoâ per kgchâ it is also recommended that the anaerobic digestion treatment plant would be established close to the land application e g irrigation and composting to reduce additional transportation costs a similar approach has been conducted by tapia rodrÃ­guez et al 9 which revealed the techno economic feasibility for the utilization of agave bagasse hydrolysate for energy production using two pathways i e a ch4 rich biogas and b h2 rich biogas the output of this investigation would provide meaningful indicators to ensure the bio economy concept and maintain environmental integrity particularly in developing countries further research and pilot scale studies are therefore necessary to support the utilization of wafer wastewater in commercial energy production the pilot scale researches would include several strategies such as deactivation of bio hydrogen consuming organisms removal of inhibitory by products and improvement of the substrate conversion efficiency to enhance the bio h2 productivity although the study depicted that the revenues profits of the proposed project would recover the cost of an investment a full life cycle analysis is needed to assess the overall environmental impact of the studied process and that will be carried out in our future work 4 conclusions biscuits wastewater bw industry is largely generated from food manufacturing company in egypt

total nitrogen tc total carbon tan total ammonia nitrogen 1 introduction the main obstacle the world faces today is the need for energy generation from a sustainable source high dependence on fossil products as key sources of energy has a detrimental effect on the environment necessitating the need for alternative sources of energy generation 1 2 the harmful impacts of fossil fuels on the environment led to harsh climate changes which led to the signing of the paris agreement in 2015 which aimed to maintain global surface temperature lower than 2 c 3 recently extensive concerns have grown regarding the environmental impacts of fossil fuels 4 5 renewable energy sources are considered the best candidate with the potential to alleviate the environmental impacts of fossil fuels 6 7 among these different renewable energy sources is biomass in particular that in municipal solid wastes msw and wastewater 8 9 wastewater is discharged daily with large amounts excreted from different sources including all industrial domestic sewage and agriculture sectors the conventional wastewater treatment technologies are cost intensive and energy consuming with no valuable materials being regenerated as the energy stored in organic wastes is useless generally around half of energy consumption occurs during aeration while 15 is consumed by pumping 10 it has been said that the energy stored in domestic wastewater is almost nine times the energy required for its treatment using conventional technologies 11 the proper treatment of domestic and industrial wastes and wastewater can be a useful source of energy one of the cleanest and most sustainable carriers of energy is hydrogen 12 the net calorific value of hydrogen is nearly 119 9 kj g much higher as compared to other fuel like coal 29 0 kj g petroleum 43 4 kj g ethanol 26 7 kj g etc 13 14 the burning of hydrogen leads to the production of water which is also non pollutant to the environment 15 16 hydrogen has a huge future potential as a viable energy generation medium the major limitation of hydrogen is its availability to attain a full hydrogen economy the annual production should be over billion tonnes the primary production of hydrogen today is carried out from natural gas and coal 17 18 hydrogen can also be produced from water electrolysis and thermolysis 19 20 due to the low energy required for generating hydrogen via biological routes it is considered to be the future of the energy generation industry 21 dark fermentation has been considered as an ideal process for the production of hydrogen 22 the catalysis of the process can be executed using pure or mixed microbial culture 23 pure carbohydrates or other wastes can be used as a substrate 24 the specific and volumetric hydrogen production rate can reach beyond 40 mmolh2 g h and 40 lh2 l day 25 these processes have some limitations in terms of the hydrogen yield again the gas is mixed with other anaerobic digestion gas meaning it will require further purification processes all these factors contribute to an increase in dark fermentation costs thereby reducing its application industrially 26 27 applying of electrochemical methods for hydrogen production has several advantages such as low operating temperature facile method environmentally friendly 28 and they also effectively used as sensors for detection of toxic materials such as lamotrigine 29 uranyl ions 30 mercury ions 30 palladium ions 31 and lead ions 32 bioelectrochemical systems are electrochemical systems that use a biocatalyst at anode and or cathode and have recently been effectively used for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy generation 33 34 bioelectrochemical systems bess are suitable for extracting the energy stored in wastewater in the form of electricity or valuable chemicals such as hydrogen with no or low energy consumption in a safe manner this is because these systems have little or no environmental impacts compared to traditional ones 35 37 due to the importance of the bess extensive studies have been carried out that have been summarized in several works including the progress done in applying bess in metal removal and recovery 38 degradation of volatile organic materials using bess 39 the role of bess in syngas production 40 electroactive microorganisms in bess 41 mathematical models in bess 42 43 and the application of bess in desalination 44 however the literature is missing the challenges practical limitations risks assessment and control of the different types of bess as well as the integration of the bess with other renewable energy sources this investigation therefore thoroughly discusses the challenges impeding their commercialization practical limitations and prospects of the different types of bioelectrochemical systems risk assessment and control in bioelectrochemical systems have also been discussed furthermore the different components types operation principals and applications of bess in wastewater treatment including urine treatment were elaborated 2 brief background about biofuels and different technologies applied this section covers a brief background of the different types of biofuels such as biogas biodiesel and bioethanol biofuel is the fuel produced from the conversion of biomass and includes different fuel types such as bioethanol biogas biodiesel and syngas 45 different types of bio based materials can be used for biofuel production namely algae carbohydrates agriculture wastes and activated sludge from a conventional wastewater treatment plant 45 the conventional wastewater treatment process relies on an aerated activated sludge process which is an energy intensive process that requires 0 5 2 kwh m3 to remove carbon and partly nitrogen 10 on the other hand the wastewater is considered a rich biomass source with high energy content 11 46 conventional wastewater treatment plants produce a vast amount of sludge which has a high content of organic matter thus it can be used as biomass for energy generation to decrease the cost of the wastewater treatment process as well as to reduce environmental impacts various methods can be applied for extracting the energy of the biomass contained in wastewater such as anaerobic digestion thermochemical process mechanical process and bioelectrochemical systems anaerobic digestion ad technology depends on extracting the energy stored in wastewater as biogas theoretically 4 kg of cod is consumed to produce 1 kg of methane that contains about 50 mj kg 47 the biogas can be used for electricity generation and the quantity of electricity depends on the method used for power generation for example 491 kw h of electricity is produced per million gallons of wastewater using a microturbine however 525 kw h is produced when using an internal combustion engine 48 anaerobic digesters become non cost effective when the total capacity of the wastewater treatment plant is less than 5 million gallons per day 49 thermo chemical processes are used to extract the energy stored in wastewater using pyrolysis gasification or incineration 50 these technologies use the sludge produced from the wastewater treatment plant for biodiesel syngas or solid fuel production compared to anaerobic digestion and thermochemical methods bess convert the organic load of the wastewater directly to electricity or valuable materials with less sludge disposal self regeneration and no aeration requirements bess can be used for different types of wastewater and operates at ambient conditions with no need for high pressure or temperature this is contrary to the gasification process which occurs at a high pressure of 33 bars and a temperature of 500 1400 c fig 1 below shows the different routes and technologies for extracting energy and fuels from waste material 2 1 biodiesel this type of biofuel is mainly produced using grease fat algae or vegetable oil 51 52 the biodiesel is produced through the transesterification process of the oils or fats using both alcohol and a catalyst besides biodiesel glycerol is produced as a by product which is separated and used in different applications the problems facing biodiesel production are the high cost of production and purification processes 53 54 2 2 bioethanol bioethanol can be produced through fermentation of different biomass wastes such as agriculture animal and human wastes the production process includes three main the first is pre treatment in which the hydrolysis of complex polysaccharides to simple sugar using acid or enzymes secondly fermentation occurs in which the simple sugar is converted to ethanol through enzymatic reactions using bacteria or yeast finally the distillation process occurs for the separation of ethanol 55 56 2 3 biogas biogas is produced through an anaerobic digestion process in which organic wastes are digested using different microorganisms these microorganisms include acetogenic acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms all of which produce biogas mainly methane 57 firstly the complex organic wastes are hydrolysed into simple sugars and amino acids by acidogenic microorganisms they are then hydrolysed to acetic acid hydrogen and higher volatile fatty acids following that the volatile fatty acids are converted to hydrogen carbon dioxide and acetic acid lastly the methanogenic microorganisms convert the carbon dioxide acetate and hydrogen into methane and carbon dioxide 58 3 bioelectrochemical systems bess bioelectrochemical systems bess are unique systems capable of converting chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa by employing microbes as catalysts the microorganisms play a crucial functional role in ensuring the success of electrochemical reactions in these devices fig 2 adapted from 59 depicts the various classifications of electrochemical devices the applications of bess are key factors that contribute to the recent spike in research interest in this field research activities carried out in the last few years have all aimed to explore the potential of bioelectrochemical energy systems as renewable or sustainable sources of energy bess produce electricity through the bioelectrocatalytic process with the aid of biomatter to convert organic materials 60 61 bess utilize biological processes enzymes or microorganisms in the production of electricity and other products such as biohydrogen 62 microbial electrolysis cells mecs microbial fuel cells mfcs microbial desalination cells mdcs enzymatic biofuel cells ebcs microbial reverse electrodialysis cells mrecs and microbial solar cells mscs as well as microbial electrosynthesis cells mescs are all types of bess 63 the following parts describe the operative fundamentals of bess and their main components 3 1 operational characteristics of bioelectrochemical systems as explained earlier bess use microorganisms for dual wastewater treatment and energy generation 64 65 the processes leading to the generation of electricity in bess occur via multifaceted microbial electrochemical reactions 66 bess are usually described as a novel technology that transform wastewater into electricity with the aid of microbes 67 bess are made up of an anodic fuel cell compartment 68 69 the cathodic fuel cell compartment is considered an electrode which is purposely designed for the acceptance of oxygen 70 71 there is also an ion exchange membrane for the separation of the bes compartments the ion exchange membranes are designed to prevent the permeation of oxygen into the anode 72 the schematics of microbial fuel and electrolysis cells as typical examples of bess are shown in fig 3 the figure shows that electricity is the main product from mfc along with carbon dioxide and water meanwhile hydrogen carbon dioxide and some other species are the main products from mec in bess acetates or formates are produced when the cell is in operation due to the biocatalyst biologically breaking down the substrate production of cations also occurs with the aid of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad in microorganisms the transport of byproducts occurs this process also leads to the growth of biofilms on the surface of the electrodes 73 the occurrence of these processes is accompanied by direct electron transfer or mediated electron transfer the main goal of biofuel cells is to transform the chemical energy in a substrate into electricity via a biological process 3 2 components of bioelectrochemical fuel cells 3 2 1 electrode materials an electrode is a solid electric conductor that carries the electric current in bess the electrodes in bess are categorized into anode and cathode with specific consideration made during the selection of any material as electrodes for bess some of these factors include excellent conductivity enhanced mass transfer and large surface area other selection criteria include low cost mechanical strength scalability biocompatibility and chemical stability 74 the performance of bess depends on the electrode material materials ideal for the anode includes carbon felt carbon mesh graphite fiber brush and carbon cloth materials suitable for the cathode include platinum black platinum and graphite 75 platinum coated electrodes are normally utilized due to their effectiveness and superiority in the generation of energy despite the high cost of the platinum pt catalyst it is the best known catalyst for oxygen reduction reactions orr poor oxygen reduction occurs with pt free cathodes different electron acceptors rather than o2 were used in bess to overcome the poor orr such as potassium ferricyanide 76 permanganate 77 hg2 78 hexavalent chromium 79 nitrate 80 uranium 80 or sodium hypochlorite 81 biocathode is another strategy that uses the aerobic biofilm at the cathode surface as an electron acceptor 82 83 in microbial electrolysis cell mec pt is also the best catalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions her however due to its high cost and easy poising its application in such systems is limited 84 different pt free catalysts were investigated in mec for her such as stainless steel nickel nickel alloys and tungsten carbide 85 89 similarly biocathode is suggested to be used in mec for her 90 however the biocathode affects the purity of hydrogen produced due to the growing methanogenesis bacteria 91 92 3 2 2 ion exchange membrane different ion exchange membranes were used in bess including porous and nonporous membranes porous membranes include microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes these membranes transfer the neutral or charged species according to the pore size 93 94 noneporous membranes include cation exchange membranes cem anion exchange membranes aem and bipolar membranes bpm these types of membranes allow for the passage of charged pieces and prevent the oxygen crossover 95 96 nafion 97 flemion 98 hyflon 99 polyarylene ether sulfone polyarylene ether ketone and polyarylene sulfone were used in bess 100 102 one of the main challenges with membranes in bess is fouling fouling of the membrane occurs with different pollutants i e organic biological and scaling 103 there are two types of fouling irreversible and reversible this depends on the strength with which the particles attach to the membrane membrane fouling can be measured using permeability resistivity and transmembrane pressure 104 it is worth mentioning that sometimes there is no need to use ion exchange membranes 105 3 2 3 substrates the organic molecules which microorganisms consume during cell operation are referred to as substrates the substrate remains a key factor that affects the production of power 106 substrates give energy to the bacterial cell to develop which defines their pivotal role as a source for carbon energy this factor equally affects the economic characteristics of bioelectrochemical fuel cells as well as their performance the nature constituents and concentration of the substrate affect the microbial community and the energy that can be obtained from the bess different substrates have been considered as feedstock in bess including low molecular simple organic material complex carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch have also been considered the energy generated from the acetate substrate as an end product of glucose metabolism is higher compared to that of other substrates 107 glucose cellulose sodium acetate oil refinery waste agro process waste residuals dairy and vegetable waste have all be explored as potential substrates for besss 107 109 3 2 4 microorganisms substrates that are organic in nature break down with the aid of microorganisms into various species and ions this phenomenon affects the flow of electrons via the bess these microorganisms are unicellular organisms with a simple or compartmented cell structure a large number of microorganisms have proven their effectiveness as biocatalysts in bess these include iron reducing bacteria such as geobacter sulfurreducens which produce high power at room temperature 110 these microorganisms are available in activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants 111 113 the efficiency of the bess is highly dependant on the rate of movement or transport of electrons from the microorganisms to the electrodes 114 115 the mechanisms for the transfer of electrons vary depending on the classification of microorganisms used in the investigation some notable bacterial commonly used in bess that uses glucose are escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and proteus vulgaris escherichia coli proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas methanica use sucrose and acetate 116 3 3 mechanisms in bioelectrochemical systems in bess bioenergy can be harnessed via microbial reactions occuring at the anode compartment this is attributed to either amalgamation between fermentation or putrefaction and respiration reactions putrefaction which is an oxidation reaction is commonly seen at the anode 117 the flow of electrons via an external circuit occurs once it joins with a cathode it is therefore possible for power to be generated via bacterial respiration in fuel cells the biocatalysts affect the breakdown of the substrate into electrons protons as well as the electron transfer rate from the biocatalyst to the anode surface the separation of these processes with the aid of ion exchange membranes and electron acceptors at cathode lead to electricity 118 3 3 1 operational characteristics of bioelectrochemical cells bess are made up of anode and cathode electrodes substrates ion exchange membranes and microbial communities some of the microbes used as explained earlier include escherichia coli clostridium acetobutylicum enterobacter aerogenes clostridium perfringens and clostridium butyricum the breakdown of the substrate using bacteria occurs at the anode via fermentation for the production of ions and electrons these bacteria are also responsible for the movement of electrons to the anodic electrodes the region inside the bess is functional due to the anaerobic conditions formed as the oxygen restrains the generation of electricity at the cathode however oxygen from the air is permitted 119 the ions flow through a solution to the cathode resulting in an interface across the ion selective membrane these characteristics result in the creation of a potential difference between the two electrodes 3 3 2 transfer of electrons in bioelectrochemical fuel cells the extracellular transfer of electrons in bess occurs via direct electron transfers and indirect electron transfers explained as follows 120 direct electron transfer electrically conductive pili i e nanowire and or direct contact i e membrane spanning cytochromes via extracellular polymeric substances eps of biofilms 121 indirect electron transfer via mediators shuttled such as self excreted exogenous as a redox mediator shuttle byproduct mediator shuttled and artificial mediator electron shuttled 122 fig 4 shows the different possible electron trnafer mechanism in bess rhodoferax ferrireducens and shewanella putrefaciens are common microorganisms that support the electron transfer it has further been highlighted that the movement of the electrons takes place from a lower redox probability to a higher redox probability some bacteria support direct electron transfer det mediator shuttles are required for the induced electron transfer approach in the movement of electrons to the electrode surface further supporting extracellular electron transfer mfcs that function with the aid of mediators as electron shuttles are called mediator mfcs mediators are electrochemical active groups responsible for redox reactions these groups equally affect the interaction between the cell and the surface of the electrode the cells are therefore able to interact with the surface of the electrode via the presence of a mediator or shuttled electron the application of mediators is very common in mfcs where the bacteria are not able to transfer electrons to the surface of the anode there are some requirements to ensuring the high functionality of these mediators the mediators must be able to penetrate the cell membrane without any obstruction to absorb the electrons from their carriers the redox mediator and the reductive metabolite must be proportional to each other 123 there must be stability during the long phase of redox cycling the reduced mediator must be able to leave the inner cell easily via the bacterial membrane the electrochemical kinetics of reduced mediators must also be fast the metabolic progression must not change due to the mediator s oxidation state the mediator shuttles must able to transfer electrons between electrodes and cells cobal sepulchrate neutral red benzyl viologen 2 4 anthraquinone disulfonate aqds methylene blue mb and methyl viologen mv are some examples of electron shuttles used in bess 3 4 classification of bess microbial electrolysis cells mecs microbial fuel cells mfcs microbial desalination cells mdcs enzymatic biofuel cells ebcs microbial reverse electrodialysis cells mrecs microbial solar cells mscs and microbial electrosynthesis cells mescs are all types of bess 63 among these different types mfcs and mecs are commonly used for simultaneously treating wastewater and producing electricity or chemicals as depicted in fig 5 this section discusses the progress made in using mfc and mec in wastewater treatment 3 4 1 microbial fuel cell microbial fuel cells are one of the most commonly exploited bess the application of mfcs is capable of transforming chemical energy into electrical energy via microbes 124 the microorganisms function as biocatalysts for the oxidation of chemical species in biodegradable substrates with the aid of the electrodes 125 these characteristics of mfcs contribute to their consideration as effective bess for the generation of electricity 126 these systems are used in many applications such as biosensors wastewater treatment and water desalination 127 129 as explained earlier research across the globe has experimented with many substrates suitable for mfcs mainly to increase the amount of electricity generated 130 131 there has been significant variation in these substrates spanning from simple and single organic molecules to complex substrates industrial wastewater made up of simple and complex organic pollutants has been utilized as a substrate for mfcs 131 the biofilm at the anode is complex and is usually made up of electroactive and fermentative microorganisms 132 the electroactive microorganisms are able to extract electrical energy from the breakdown of simple organic molecules 133 different types of wastewater were examined in mfc for producing electricity as can be seen in table 1 the table shows the effect of the anode or cathode type and or modification on the power generation 3 4 2 microbial electrolysis cell mec the last decade has seen a considerable increase in research relating to microbial electrolysis cells for the production of hydrogen from waste 141 mecs utilize biologically degradable organics as a source of electrons 142 mecs are designed to produce more hydrogen gas due to their ability to exceed the fermentative barrier predominant in fermentation based processes 143 several substrates can be used in mecs unlike other methods used for producing hydrogen 144 although the progress and developments already achieved in mecs there are still some challenges that need to be addressed before commercialization optimization of the technology to increase the hydrogen gas along with a reduction in the overall cost of the technology are both critical for the eventual commercialization of this technology investigations into mecs were first carried in 2005 145 bacteria capable of transferring electrons via extracellular mechanisms in mecs utilize the anode as an electron sink for the oxidation of organics and the production of electrons and protons the process involves the diffusion of protons through the proton exchange membrane to the cathode there is a reduction of electron transfer through the external electric circuit for the production of hydrogen at the cathode mecs are not functional extemporaneously because of limiting factors such as the thermodynamic barrier and excess energy needed for driving the reduction reaction 146 the potential at the anode varies from 0 2 0 5 v the reduction of protons to hydrogen gas is the half reaction at the cathode according to the nerst equations the potential at the cathode is largely influenced by the concentration of free protons the hydrogen s partial pressure and temperature due to thermodynamic limitations associated with mecs energy input is critical in these types of cells 147 a method for reducing or removing the energy needed for mecs is by enhancing the potential at the cathode via a change in the ph this is possible because the potential at the cathode will be high therefore the electrolyte ph can be reduced to less than 5 the main issue here is that the migration of protons via the membrane would be curbed when a lower ph is maintained in the cathode this in return will cause a decrease in ph at the anode and will be detrimental to the microorganisms at the anode 3 4 2 1 merits and demerits of microbial electrolysis cell operating conditions of mecs are simple compared to other hydrogen production methods for instance using acetate as a substrate requires 0 11 v input for hydrogen gas production 148 this implies the energy required in the production of hydrogen using mecs is nearly 1 3 kw h m3 149 on the other hand electrolyzers used for the production of hydrogen industrially requires around 4 5 5 0 kw h m3 150 the hydrogen produced in mec is higher compared to that of other hydrogen generation processes like fermentation based processes 151 the stoichiometric yield for hydrogen in the dark fermentation process is only 4 mol h2 molglucose 152 butyrate and acetate are some byproducts that are produced from these processes the conversion of these products to hydrogen gas is not feasible thermodynamically and is a clear indication of an incomplete breakdown of organics especially in dark fermentation hydrogen gas yield is directly proportional to the complete oxidation of these byproducts 153 in terms of stoichiometry this will sum up to 4 mol h2 molacetate in mec the yield of hydrogen gas from glucose is 12 mol h2 molglucose the purity of hydrogen produced via mecs is higher compared to that of other hydrogen generation methods due to the organic breakdown that occurs in dark fermentation the hydrogen produced is normally accompanied by other gases like carbon dioxide 154 the hydrogen produced by the mecs is considered to be ideal for various applications as it is expected to be sulfur free in a nutshell the future of hydrogen production particularly at a reduced cost revolves around mec the rate of hydrogen production is a key issue impeding the commercialization of this viable technology i e mec for instance the production of hydrogen even under laboratory conditions is limited to 3 m3h2 m3 day 155 the hydrogen production rate undergoes deterioration when the entire process is scaled up most pilot reactors from literature generated lower hydrogen gas and lower current densities when compared to laboratory reactors some of the factors that were responsible for these phenomena include the reactor geometry electrode material glass fiber separators possible connection resistances and microbiological factors leading to slow start up for the reactor 156 producing methane can be achieved even when the hydrogen production rate at the pilot scale is lower the highest hydrogen production rate in small scale mec can exceed 50 m3h2 m3 day 157 this therefore attests to the suitability of mecs as decentralized systems for the production of hydrogen the integration of mecs with existing technologies provide an enormous impact in terms of futuristic industrial applications 3 4 2 2 microbial electrolysis cell for hydrogen production from wastewater wastewater from different sources was recently investigated as fuel to produce hydrogen in mecs different types of wastewater electrode materials and membranes were investigated to increase the cod removal efficiency columbic efficiency and hydrogen production rate table 2 summarizes some of the studies performed on hydrogen production by mec from different wastewaters as clear from the table that mec is a viable option for simultaneous wastewater treatment and hydrogen production 4 application of bes in treating urine wastewater urine produced by the human kidneys appears transparent in color the kidney usually functions as a separator and filters the blood this process supports the elimination of excess water and soluble waste 163 human urine is simply an aqueous solution of urea inorganic salts of chloride potassium and sodium as well as ammonia creatine organic acids and other toxins created due to the decomposition of hemoglobin 164 the color of urine is determined by urobilin there are variations in the composition of human urine subject to a person s lifestyle physical conditions environmental characteristics and diet a healthy body produces between 1 5 2 l day of urine this implies that considering the world s population in excess of 7 billion 1 16 1 54 1010 l day of urine is produced this can further be extended to a total annual of 4 22 5 62 1012 l 165 there have been many research activities carried out on human urine mostly in the field of wastewater treatment it has been reported that human urine is responsible for 10 of the total chemical oxygen demand cod 75 of total nitrogen and 50 of phosphorous in municipal wastewater 166 treating urine separately will imply that some useful nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous can be recovered from wastewater 167 168 research regarding using human urine as a substrate for bess can be traced to scientists at the university of the west of england wetsus and wageningen university and the university of science technology of china 169 170 the first research work carried out was aimed at the generation of electricity with the aid of mfcs using human urine as a substrate 171 other researchers also explored the feasibility of producing ammonia on the cathode and simultaneously producing electricity 172 4 1 urine fed microbial fuel cell microbial fuel cells can be developed using human urine as a substrate due to the rich organic molecules contained in urine 173 urine also has a higher solution conductivity which limits internal losses in electrochemical systems this results in a decrement in terms of ohmic resistance thereby improving the electrochemical output 174 the last decade has seen an appreciable increase in work carried out in terms of the application of urine in bess this attests to the accelerated growth of this novel concept the application of urine in the development of mfcs can be carried out using a membrane or membrane less design concept the application of urine in bess can also aid in recovering nutrients such as ammonia and phosphate one must be extra cautious during the transformation of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds particularly in urine hydrolysis there are two types of urine fed mfcs single chamber membrane based and membrane less urine fed mfcs the single chamber membrane based urine fed mfc functions with the aid of a polymeric separator the polymeric membrane serves as a partition between the anode and the cathode 169 today these polymeric membranes are being replaced with ceramic separators a concept initiated in 2013 175 it was further improved in another investigation that utilized a membrane less setup based on self stratification of urine via a column 176 the stratification of the urine supported complete anaerobiosis at the bottom of the column while the top of the column was anoxic the application of urine as feedstock in mfc in terms of research activities has increased due to the high nutritional content of urine the development of urine fed mfc revolves around acrylic compartments it was further highlighted that the performance of the cell in terms of the current generation improved significantly whenever urine was utilized recovery of ammonia along with the production of electricity with the aid of double chamber mfc was also reported 177 a cation exchange membrane supported the ammonium ions to move to the cathode chamber for their transformation to ammonia a miniaturized mfc having anodic chamber volumes of 1 4 ml and 6 25 ml has also been reported 178 the anode and the cathode compartments were separated with the aid of the polymeric cation exchange membrane a power output of 1 5 mw was generated after stacking 48 mfcs together the application of ceramic membrane as separators in mfcs aids in cost reduction and the usage of sustainable materials for the treatment of wastewater and generation of power an origami type mfc with a urine substrate was also reported 179 this mfc produced 50 60 Î¼w of peak power the mfc used six cell stack and was linked to a power management system and produced energy that could broadcast messages from transceiver over 24 h 179 other types of membranes from natural rubber and an egg based open air cathode coated with lanolin have also been investigated in a urine fed mfc an investigation carried out for 24 weeks also showed that these types of fuel cells could be used to power other applications 180 similar work using carbon fiber sleeve anodes and cathodes with nafion tubing has also been reported 181 the urine fed mfc was made up of 24 cell stacks 182 the application of 3d printed molds supports the manufacturing of miniaturized urine fed mfcs 183 to reduce the complexity of the design the self stratifying membrane less mfc was developed with a similar structure to that of the benthic mfc 175 the main difference between the two is the plurality of the anode positioned in the anoxic layers of an environment and the plurality of cathodes positioned in the oxic environment for self stratifying membrane less mfcs there is the absence of a barrier between the anodes and cathodes the electrolyte is therefore shared between the two electrodes which are usually 5 mm apart the main concept behind the self stratifying membrane less mfc is to explore the self stratification phenomenon in the development of membranes urine fed mfc 175 the overall goal is to harness the capacity of microorganisms to breakdown urine into both oxic and anoxic this essentially explores the capacity of microorganisms within two different environments having varied redox potentials 4 2 urine fed microbial electrolysis cell nitrogen present in domestic water originates from urine in the form of urea ammonia can therefore be produced via enzymatic hydrolysis using ammonium ions nitrogen compounds must be eliminated from wastewater to prevent eutrophication of water systems leading to environmental challenges 184 the entire process requires high energy input and usually very challenging to meet the high demand for fertilizers there has been a significant increase in nitrogen rich fertilizer production nitrogen recovery using mfcs as well as bioenergy production have been thoroughly investigated 185 the application of mec for ammonia recovery from urine has not been exploited much from literature it has been determined that the removal and recovery of nitrogen from source separated urine can be a source of revenue generation 186 fig 6 captures the processes leading to the transport and transformation of ammonia and ammonium ions inside mfc and mec the ammonium ions are transported via a membrane in followed by an ammonia diffusion through the membrane then the ammonia gas is escaped out of the system after that the ammonium ions involve in biological oxidation with the aid of oxygen gas as there is a hypothesis of anodic ammonia nitrification forming nitrogen with the aid of the microorganisms finally the ammonium ions are used for building biomass on both the anode and the cathode there is a reduction in the water produced in the cathode chamber to hydroxyl ions and hydrogen in mec unlike mfc the ph of the cathode compartment tends to increase because of the hydroxyl ions present thus resulting in the transformation of the nh4 to nh3 there is more hydrogen produced due to this which results in a reduction in aeration of the cathode chamber a key requirement in mfcs designed for ammonium recovery the hydrogen gas generated can also support the elimination of ammonia from the cathode solution and this action invites easy elimination of ammonium from the anolyte the production of hydrogen and ammonium recovery with the aid of mec using urine can be traced back to 2014 187 the researchers utilized a double chambered mec with the anode made up of carbon felt while the cathode was developed using a pt based catalyst separated by a cation exchange membrane the potentials at the anode and the cathode were determined with the aid of two reference electrode configuration a constant temperature of 30 c was utilized throughout the investigation the system was further inoculated with the aid of effluent from the mfc it was further observed that there was an increment in the cell voltage from 0 6 v to 1 0 v after 42 days 187 one of the investigations set up had synthetic wastewater as its feedstock but the other setups were urine fed at varying feed flows the final set up was urine fed but the solution at the cathode was continuously being replaced it was further deduced that the rate of nitrogen removal for the system with the wastewater was far lower compared to that with the urine more stable values of nitrogen removal were recorded for the set up with the constant replacement of the cathode solution the rate of ammonium elimination was steady during the entire investigation while the others had a reduction in the removal efficiency with time the current density obtained was 14 64 a m2 and the hydrogen produced was 32 m3h2 m3 and energy input of 2 32 kw h m3h2 187 despite this good result the amount of ammonium eliminated was low thereby stressing the need for further optimization in order to accelerate the commercialization of this technology to increase the ammonium rate of removal the migration of the ammonium ions can be increased furthermore a better ammonia stripping process to support the diffusion of ammonium from the anode should also be considered bio electro concentration systems are substitutes for mec in terms of nutrient recovery from urine this concept is a hybrid method that employs mec and medc there is first the generation of an electric field from an external source and cautiously moving charged ions from one chamber to the other via specific polymeric membranes the overall goal of this technology is to facilitate the concentration of anions and cations inside the central chamber it has been reported that this concept is very viable in terms of ammonia phosphate and potassium recovery from urine 187 the setup for the investigation was made up of an anode concentrate and a cathode a cation exchange membrane was used to serve as a physical barrier or separator between the anode and the concentrate compartment an anion exchange membrane was also used as a separator between the concentrate and anode compartment graphite granules were used as the anode and cathode the current collector for the anode was a graphite rod while that of the cathode was titanium ti mesh the energy balance for the system was positive which was applied to support the movement of ions via the membranes there was also inoculation of the reactor using acetate fed bioanode urine and anaerobic sludge the current density generated from the system was 37 6 a m2 at an applied voltage of 1 46 v this value is the highest recorded so far in nitrogen recovery for mfc and mec systems the experiment was carried out three times with 7 18 g nh4 m3d 0 52 g po4 3 m3d and 1 62 g k m3d being eliminated but then recovered into a concentrated stream 188 5 mec hybrid with other renewable energy sources to moderate the disadvantages regarding the energy required for the mecs it is usually integrated with other renewable energy sources to provide the required energy for its operation the following section discusses the recent progress done at this point 5 1 bioelectrochemical based systems microbial fuel cells as explained are able to generate power via the breakdown of wastes today many researchers are advocating for mfc being used with mec in an integrated system as depicted in fig 7 this technique has been used in hydrogen production in the absence of external power sources with the aid of acetate as substrate 1 21 mol h2 molacetate and hydrogen production rate of 14 9 ml l day was obtained 189 other authors equally explored bio photoelectrochemical cell made up of both mfcs and mecs hydrogen gas was produced due to the illumination of the photocathode of the bio photoelectrochemical cell while voltage required for electrolysis was obtained from the mfcs the process generated hydrogen gas at a rate of 1 35 0 15 ml h the current density obtained was 0 68 a m2 190 mecs can also be powered using mfcs aside from hydrogen production 190 it has been reported that mfcs can be used as a source of energy for mecs to transform carbon dioxide into formic acid 191 5 2 submersible microbial electrolysis cell the overall objective for the development of a submersible mec was to eliminate the external source of energy needed for its functionality the cells were designed to be applicable even in anaerobic digesters anode chambers are not required for these types of cells for power generation the other chamber is still designed to produce hydrogen gas an investigation carried out in 2012 explored the performance of self powered submersible mec for hydrogen production in anaerobic digesters 192 other investigations aimed at measuring the biological oxygen demand bod with the aid of anodic biofilm have also been reported it was deduced that the current generated was subject to the bod of the wastewater the inoculum type and concentration both affect the adhesion of the bacterial cells to the surface of the electrode so a new anode was used to analyse the microbial activity 193 ammonia inhibition in anaerobic digestion has also been used in a novel hybrid system the system was made up of submersible mec and a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr this process led to the recovery of ammonia and electricity being generated again the process resulted in the production of biogas other investigations also explored submerged microbial desalination denitrification cells this was used to eliminate nitrate from groundwater and led to the generation of electricity in terms of wastewater treatment there has also been significant improvement 194 electricity was generated via anodic bacteria activity while no3 and na were migrated to the anode and cathode via anion exchange membrane and cation exchange membranes respectively the effluent migrated to the cathode while the no3 was reduced to nitrogen via autotrophic denitrification the submerged microbial desalination denitrification cell was able to eliminate 90 5 of nitrate from groundwater the structure of the submerged mec showed the possibility of integrating mec with anaerobic digesters the process for the removal of nitrate from groundwater with the aid of novel submerged desalination denitrification cell method is represented in fig 8 5 3 microbial electrolysis cell powered by solar energy solar energy is abundant and environmentally friendly 195 196 because of this it is perceived as a suitable alternative in terms of energy generation to meet the growing world energy demand this suggests that the power required to operate mecs can be derived from dye sensitized solar cells 197 hydrogen production with the aid of solar powered mec with a hydrogen conversion efficiency of 82 from acetate has been reported 198 harvesting of energy using dye sensitized solar cells to power mecs for biological hydrogen production was also reported 198 it was further captured that the hydrogen generated from mecs with the aid of dye sensitized solar cells was equivalent to that obtained using a conventional power source the conversion efficiency in the dye sensitized solar cells to optimize the systems performance a bio photoelectrochemical cell was powered using the mfc the mfc functioned as a source of electrical potential the bio photoelectrochemical cell was made up of an anode and photocathode the rate of hydrogen produced with the aid of this system was 1 35 0 15 ml h 190 it must be considered that for the mec and the dye sensitized solar cell the current density is subject to the light intensity and the characteristics of the anodic microbiological catalyst 5 4 dark fermentation microbial fuel and microbial electrolysis cells hybrid system the application of dark fermentation can lead to the production of hydrogen gas from dissolved organic materials in wastewater there are issues pertaining to the thermodynamic obstacles that influence the hydrogen being produced via this process 199 this limitation leads to the development of butyrate and acetate instead of the production of hydrogen gas again an external source of energy is required to support thermodynamically feasible reactions its been reported that dark fermentation of 1 mol of glucose can generate 4 mol of hydrogen gas 200 201 using bio catalysed electrolysis acetate can also be transformed into hydrogen gas combining the two processes can lead to 12 mol h2 moleglucose being produced 202 an investigation ascertained the dark fermentation of corn stalk attached to an mec this process led to more hydrogen gas being produced in comparison to a stand alone dark fermentation process other researchers also investigated the feasibility of using the excess energy generated from dark fermentation with the aid of an mec 203 this investigation underwent with the aid of effluent of dark fermentation as a substrate for the mec the effluent consisted of fatty acids supporting the production of hydrogen at a rate of 81 ml h2 ld at organic removal rate was 85 203 production of hydrogen from cellulose has been equally reported 204 the researchers connected two mfcs to mecs in series leading to a generation of 0 43 v with the aid of effluent from mec as a substrate to mfc it was concluded that the presence of the dark ferment paired to the mfc and the mec enhanced the rate of production of by 41 compared to that of stand alone fermentation 204 6 factors impeding the commercialization of bioelectrochemical systems energy production using bess is very promising however several obstacles still prevent it from reaching its full potential in spite of all the progress highlighted in this review there are still issues that need to be addressed the first is that most investigations conducted on bess have mainly been conducted under laboratory conditions and scales an important consideration for future large scale applications lower efficiency and a reduction in the rate of production are also key issues that have impeded the commercialization of bes technologies the type of substrate to use is also another issue of concern that must be critically evaluated the electrode material and types of microorganisms used in bess have an equal effect on the functionality of these systems there are several types of substrates that may be used in bess however their efficiencies may be different cellulose starch and complex sugars are notable substrates the application of landfill leachate has also been reported as a suitable substrate for bess the concerns with dependence on these types of substrates have to do with human health safety and the environment the use of carbohydrates such as glucose as a substrate is also a major challenge as it competes with food demand the material used for electrodes in bess is expected to exhibit a higher flow of electrons mass transfer large surface area porosity mechanical strength scalability biocompatibility and chemical stability 205 platinum is an expensive material that increases the overall cost of the technology the application of a membrane as a separator in bess comes with its own challenges 206 the application of membranes in bess can reduce the permeability of protons loss of substrates and back diffusion of oxygen other issues like biofouling internal resistance and ph gradient all affect the performance of membrane based bess 205 all these key issues affect the maintenance of the membrane and create technical concerns in terms of design efficiency and scaling up of the bess using microorganisms in bess comes with some issues as well the mechanism for the transfer of the electrons has always been subject to concern the transfer of electrons in bess varies based on the type of bacteria utilized this attests to the fact that the selection of the right and suitable microbes for the bess plays a key role in the functionality of the cell the power output of the cell is also affected when mixed culture bacteria is used 207 temperature sensitivity also influences the efficiency output and lifespan of the bes this is attributed to not being able to perform well under lower temperature conditions because of the sluggish characteristics of microbial reaction under such conditions one key issue influencing the scaling up of this technology is the lack of an in depth understanding of microbes under unconventional bess environments 7 practical limitation risk assessment and prospects of bioelectrochemical systems 7 1 practical limitations of bioelectrochemical systems some limitations still face the practical application of bess firstly the high capital cost of such systems this is mainly due to the high cost of catalysts electrodes cathode in case of using precious catalysts membrane and current collectors secondly the low power output and hydrogen yields these systems should operate at ideal conditions for keeping the activity of microorganisms different carbon based electrodes derived from carbon wastes were synthesized and investigated for mfcs to decrease the cost of electrodes 208 novel cell configurations is needed to decrease capital cost reduce the maintenance cost and enhancing the efficiency of the bess for example using multiple anodes and or cathodes instead of one large size electrode makes the replacement and maintenance process easier simpler and less time consuming membrane cost and fouling is another challenge facing the development and application of bess membrane fouling negatively affected the performance of mfcs and mecs therefore membrane less bess are highly recommended to avoid these problems 209 however oxygen crossover from the cathode compartment to the anode compartment as well as substrate crossover in the reverse direction decreases the columbic efficiency power generation and microorganism activity 210 the biofilm formed on the cathode surface is another issue facing the application of membrane less mfc as it decreases the rate of oxygen reductionreaction orr at the cathode surface antibacterial orr catalysts such as silver nanoparticles and pyrolyzed iron phthalocyanines were applied to prevent the biofilm formation 211 212 kim et al proposed a new mfcs configuration based on a dual anode to prevent the fuel crossover and biofilm formation at the cathode using an additional anode placed between the main electrodes 210 7 2 risk assessment and control in bioelectrochemical systems microbial fuel cells and microbial electrolysis cells as common bioelectrochemical systems have proven to be very efficient and promising for utilizing wastewater as a carbon source leading to generation of electricity this is true in the case of mfcs they are also promising for producing hydrogen gas as clean fuel like in the case of mecs however some additional measures have to be taken when considering bess for dual wastewater treatment and energy generation either electricity or hydrogen fuel wastewater has a very diverse matrix of compounds so concentrations are usually expressed in terms of total elemental concentration such as total carbon tc total organic carbon toc chemical and biological oxygen demands cod and bod as an indirect measure of degradable carbon content total nitrogen tn total ammonia nitrogen tan etc unfortunately wastewater contains some species that can fail the entire operation of mfcs and mecs by inhibiting the microbial growth and in turn reducing power or hydrogen generation 213 as a result the appropriate medium composition has to be ensured to obtain the desired operation level of bess a good example of this inhibition phenomenon is ammonia concentration although a source of nitrogen usually ammonia ammonium ion or nitrate ion is essential for microbial growth a high concentration of ammonia can lead to substrate inhibition and reduce the energy output of bess nam et al have found that increasing the ammonia concentration in a single chamber mfc from 500 mg n l to 4000 mg n l as tan results in a significant reduction in maximum power density from 4240 mw m3 to 1700 mw m3 214 this was mainly attributed to the inhibition of ammonia oxidizing and nitrate oxidizing bacteria showing an effective concentration of 894 mg n l as an optimum with advice to carefully monitor the tan during the mfc operation hiegemann et al obtained a similar observation with regards to the cod loads and free ammonia in both bench scale and 45 l scale mfcs both showed an instant collapse in power output at tan 8000 mg n l 213 similar results were observed for sulfide inhibition as result of sulfate reducing bacteria in mfcs showing a decrease in power output by about 83 215 the inhibition of microbial growth in bess utilizing a wastewater matrix is not just subject to substrate inhibition heavy metals and heavy metal oxides also have a critical toxicity and result in severe inhibition of microbial growth due to their antimicrobial action 216 218 stein et al studied the effect of toxic components on mfc operations suggesting the use of i v polarization curves to observe inhibition and to estimate its type 219 microbial electrolysis cell mecs work in a similar fashion to that of mfc meaning microbial inhibitions are critical here as well however mecs face an additional challenge due to the growth of methanogenic microorganisms which shift the mec on a route to producing methane rather than hydrogen 220 222 although methane is considered as valuable fuel as well it has a severe environmental impact due to its carbon footprint so mec operations should ultimately be tailored toward hydrogen production methane produced with hydrogen in mecs will either be used in a mixed fuel with hydrogen or will require further down stream processing in order to separate it this will obtain clean hydrogen gas but will however add to the cost of mecs due to the high interest in bess in general particularly mfcs and mecs several strategies and approaches have been investigated to mitigate and control the risks associated with inhibition in bess this has also been done with methanogen growth in mecs to optimize bes operations substrate and heavy metal inhibition in bess have been mainly mitigated by setting limits on the concentration of different nutrients of cod and tan which can be achieved by dilution and mixing of different wastewater streams 213 214 on the other hand many strategies have been developed to minimize methanogenesis in mecs mec operation under alkaline conditions have shown up to 85 90 hydrogen in the evolved gas over 50 days of 25 cycles at an overall energy recovery of 72 at ph of 11 2 this was attributed to methanogen inhibition 222 alternatively the use of specific enzymes can selectively stimulate or inhibit the growth of methanogens thereby controlling the product as desired which ranges from methane to hydrogen 223 karthikeyan et al described a strategy of interfering with methanogen activity for example targeting methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr 224 injection of chemical inhibitors such as 2 bromoethanesulfonate at an injection dose of 286 Î¼m reduced methanogenic electron loss from 36 4 to 2 5 thereby increasing overall hydrogen efficiency from 56 1 80 1 with good stability over 10 batch cycles 92 lu et al found that working at psychrophilic conditions with mec maintained at temperatures of 4 and 9 c effectively inhibited the growth of methanogens such as methanobrevibacter arboriphilus 225 7 3 prospects of bioelectrochemical systems the applications of bess span from bioelectricity to producing clean energy other applications include wastewater treatment and environmental remediation most research work carried out have all concluded the generation of electricity from microbes this method involves the microbe catalyzed conversion of a chemical substrate for energy production the application of microorganisms in mfcs for the generation of electricity has been extensively studied which has proven to be promising for future commercialization it has been established that biohydrogen can be generated from microbial action with the aid of other renewable substrates such as acetate and wastewater via fermentation in the presence or absence of membranes 226 the application of bess for wastewater treatment is also crucial research work has also been conducted geared towards exploring issues pertaining to wastewater treatment with the aid of bess 131 227 the research work explained that bess are ideal for wastewater treatment into biochemical bioenergy and bioproducts bess can also be utilized in the valorization of biomass wastes bioremediation of heavy metal polluted water and soils with the aid of varying substrates and exchange membranes bess can also be used for bioassays and biosensors 228 it has been reported that mfcs can support the detection of toxicity and metabolic processes when employed in bioassays and biosensors 229 investigations into water quality monitoring assessment and electrochemical evaluation have all been examined using biosensors made from mfcs and other bess types 230 231 the investigations carried out have also stated that using mfc based sensors are likely to ensure quick onsite monitoring and detection of toxic analytes needed for water quality testing bess can also help in addressing carbon dioxide emissions finally bess can equally be applied in co2 capturing and conversion 232 233 research and development efforts should focus on the scaling up of bess from bench scales and lab scales which are currently being widely investigated to pilot scale and eventually full scale applications 234 while working on these developments a better and full understanding of the metabolic routes of extractive microorganisms should be developed as well this will help to better enrich the growth of these microorganisms and improve the electron transfer from the cell interior to the anode surface simple designs are recommended to avoid operation complexity high capital cost and to have an easier and lower maintenance cost application of bess for wastewater treatment and removal or remediation of hazardous materials such as denitrification heavy metal and chemical production will increase the overall attractiveness of the process hybrid bess with other systems for wastewater treatment or water desalination which in turn increase overall efficiency should be thoroughly considered and further explored the use of nanotechnology to develop high efficiency membranes should be considered electrodes that decrease biofouling and enhance biofilm formation should also be thoroughly considered 8 conclusion this investigation explored the various principles and operational characteristics of bioelectrochemical systems bess like microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs the investigation further touched on various bess hybrids of mfc and mec as well as other technologies factors impeding the commercialization of bess were equally presented in this investigation in addition the future directions of bess were thoroughly evaluated the investigation therefore creates a link between the existing knowledge and future commercialization aspects of bess it was concluded that bes is a novel technology that functions with the aid of microorganisms for the conversion of chemical energy in organic materials those present in wastewater serve to generate power via varying processes in microbial electrochemical reactions the investigation also highlighted the importance of the substrate electrode and membrane material on the functionality of the bess similarly choosing the right microorganism is critical in improving the overall performance of bess although bess can be used in many applications there are some critical factors impeding the advancement of technology into the commercialization stage these factors include lower efficiencies and energy output poor conductivity mass transfer porosity and area of the electrode material other factors include mechanical strength scalability and chemical stability of the bess electrodes despite these challenges bess can significantly contribute to clean power generation in future with more research and attention the application of bess will revolve around wastewater treatment bioanalysis and biosensors a thorough understanding of this technology will have a positive effect in terms of water treatment energy waste management and environmental concerns in future declaration of competing interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest in this work 
13739,the application of bioelectrochemical systems mostly aims to be used for the generation of electricity or chemicals the quest to generate energy that is both sustainable and environmentally friendly over the last few years has accelerated the growth in research activities in bioelectrochemical cells namely microbial fuel cells mfcs microbial electrolysis cells mecs microbial desalination cells mdcs and microbial electrolysis desalination cells medcs microbial fuel cells and microbial electrolysis cells are considered the most developed technologies among these various types of bioelectrochemical systems this investigation intends to highlight the basic operational characteristics of mfcs and mecs using wastewater as fuel the prospects associated with this novel technology along with challenges related to their operation have all been highlighted in this investigation the application of bioelectrochemical systems as well as possible integration with other technologies have all been critically discussed moreover the current work identified key factors impeding the commercialization of these technologies including lower efficiencies mass transfer limitations porosity and protonic conductivity other factors include the mechanical and chemical stability of materials along with their biocompatibility in summary the application of bioelectrochemical systems

total nitrogen tc total carbon tan total ammonia nitrogen 1 introduction the main obstacle the world faces today is the need for energy generation from a sustainable source high dependence on fossil products as key sources of energy has a detrimental effect on the environment necessitating the need for alternative sources of energy generation 1 2 the harmful impacts of fossil fuels on the environment led to harsh climate changes which led to the signing of the paris agreement in 2015 which aimed to maintain global surface temperature lower than 2 c 3 recently extensive concerns have grown regarding the environmental impacts of fossil fuels 4 5 renewable energy sources are considered the best candidate with the potential to alleviate the environmental impacts of fossil fuels 6 7 among these different renewable energy sources is biomass in particular that in municipal solid wastes msw and wastewater 8 9 wastewater is discharged daily with large amounts excreted from different sources including all industrial domestic sewage and agriculture sectors the conventional wastewater treatment technologies are cost intensive and energy consuming with no valuable materials being regenerated as the energy stored in organic wastes is useless generally around half of energy consumption occurs during aeration while 15 is consumed by pumping 10 it has been said that the energy stored in domestic wastewater is almost nine times the energy required for its treatment using conventional technologies 11 the proper treatment of domestic and industrial wastes and wastewater can be a useful source of energy one of the cleanest and most sustainable carriers of energy is hydrogen 12 the net calorific value of hydrogen is nearly 119 9 kj g much higher as compared to other fuel like coal 29 0 kj g petroleum 43 4 kj g ethanol 26 7 kj g etc 13 14 the burning of hydrogen leads to the production of water which is also non pollutant to the environment 15 16 hydrogen has a huge future potential as a viable energy generation medium the major limitation of hydrogen is its availability to attain a full hydrogen economy the annual production should be over billion tonnes the primary production of hydrogen today is carried out from natural gas and coal 17 18 hydrogen can also be produced from water electrolysis and thermolysis 19 20 due to the low energy required for generating hydrogen via biological routes it is considered to be the future of the energy generation industry 21 dark fermentation has been considered as an ideal process for the production of hydrogen 22 the catalysis of the process can be executed using pure or mixed microbial culture 23 pure carbohydrates or other wastes can be used as a substrate 24 the specific and volumetric hydrogen production rate can reach beyond 40 mmolh2 g h and 40 lh2 l day 25 these processes have some limitations in terms of the hydrogen yield again the gas is mixed with other anaerobic digestion gas meaning it will require further purification processes all these factors contribute to an increase in dark fermentation costs thereby reducing its application industrially 26 27 applying of electrochemical methods for hydrogen production has several advantages such as low operating temperature facile method environmentally friendly 28 and they also effectively used as sensors for detection of toxic materials such as lamotrigine 29 uranyl ions 30 mercury ions 30 palladium ions 31 and lead ions 32 bioelectrochemical systems are electrochemical systems that use a biocatalyst at anode and or cathode and have recently been effectively used for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy generation 33 34 bioelectrochemical systems bess are suitable for extracting the energy stored in wastewater in the form of electricity or valuable chemicals such as hydrogen with no or low energy consumption in a safe manner this is because these systems have little or no environmental impacts compared to traditional ones 35 37 due to the importance of the bess extensive studies have been carried out that have been summarized in several works including the progress done in applying bess in metal removal and recovery 38 degradation of volatile organic materials using bess 39 the role of bess in syngas production 40 electroactive microorganisms in bess 41 mathematical models in bess 42 43 and the application of bess in desalination 44 however the literature is missing the challenges practical limitations risks assessment and control of the different types of bess as well as the integration of the bess with other renewable energy sources this investigation therefore thoroughly discusses the challenges impeding their commercialization practical limitations and prospects of the different types of bioelectrochemical systems risk assessment and control in bioelectrochemical systems have also been discussed furthermore the different components types operation principals and applications of bess in wastewater treatment including urine treatment were elaborated 2 brief background about biofuels and different technologies applied this section covers a brief background of the different types of biofuels such as biogas biodiesel and bioethanol biofuel is the fuel produced from the conversion of biomass and includes different fuel types such as bioethanol biogas biodiesel and syngas 45 different types of bio based materials can be used for biofuel production namely algae carbohydrates agriculture wastes and activated sludge from a conventional wastewater treatment plant 45 the conventional wastewater treatment process relies on an aerated activated sludge process which is an energy intensive process that requires 0 5 2 kwh m3 to remove carbon and partly nitrogen 10 on the other hand the wastewater is considered a rich biomass source with high energy content 11 46 conventional wastewater treatment plants produce a vast amount of sludge which has a high content of organic matter thus it can be used as biomass for energy generation to decrease the cost of the wastewater treatment process as well as to reduce environmental impacts various methods can be applied for extracting the energy of the biomass contained in wastewater such as anaerobic digestion thermochemical process mechanical process and bioelectrochemical systems anaerobic digestion ad technology depends on extracting the energy stored in wastewater as biogas theoretically 4 kg of cod is consumed to produce 1 kg of methane that contains about 50 mj kg 47 the biogas can be used for electricity generation and the quantity of electricity depends on the method used for power generation for example 491 kw h of electricity is produced per million gallons of wastewater using a microturbine however 525 kw h is produced when using an internal combustion engine 48 anaerobic digesters become non cost effective when the total capacity of the wastewater treatment plant is less than 5 million gallons per day 49 thermo chemical processes are used to extract the energy stored in wastewater using pyrolysis gasification or incineration 50 these technologies use the sludge produced from the wastewater treatment plant for biodiesel syngas or solid fuel production compared to anaerobic digestion and thermochemical methods bess convert the organic load of the wastewater directly to electricity or valuable materials with less sludge disposal self regeneration and no aeration requirements bess can be used for different types of wastewater and operates at ambient conditions with no need for high pressure or temperature this is contrary to the gasification process which occurs at a high pressure of 33 bars and a temperature of 500 1400 c fig 1 below shows the different routes and technologies for extracting energy and fuels from waste material 2 1 biodiesel this type of biofuel is mainly produced using grease fat algae or vegetable oil 51 52 the biodiesel is produced through the transesterification process of the oils or fats using both alcohol and a catalyst besides biodiesel glycerol is produced as a by product which is separated and used in different applications the problems facing biodiesel production are the high cost of production and purification processes 53 54 2 2 bioethanol bioethanol can be produced through fermentation of different biomass wastes such as agriculture animal and human wastes the production process includes three main the first is pre treatment in which the hydrolysis of complex polysaccharides to simple sugar using acid or enzymes secondly fermentation occurs in which the simple sugar is converted to ethanol through enzymatic reactions using bacteria or yeast finally the distillation process occurs for the separation of ethanol 55 56 2 3 biogas biogas is produced through an anaerobic digestion process in which organic wastes are digested using different microorganisms these microorganisms include acetogenic acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms all of which produce biogas mainly methane 57 firstly the complex organic wastes are hydrolysed into simple sugars and amino acids by acidogenic microorganisms they are then hydrolysed to acetic acid hydrogen and higher volatile fatty acids following that the volatile fatty acids are converted to hydrogen carbon dioxide and acetic acid lastly the methanogenic microorganisms convert the carbon dioxide acetate and hydrogen into methane and carbon dioxide 58 3 bioelectrochemical systems bess bioelectrochemical systems bess are unique systems capable of converting chemical energy into electrical energy and vice versa by employing microbes as catalysts the microorganisms play a crucial functional role in ensuring the success of electrochemical reactions in these devices fig 2 adapted from 59 depicts the various classifications of electrochemical devices the applications of bess are key factors that contribute to the recent spike in research interest in this field research activities carried out in the last few years have all aimed to explore the potential of bioelectrochemical energy systems as renewable or sustainable sources of energy bess produce electricity through the bioelectrocatalytic process with the aid of biomatter to convert organic materials 60 61 bess utilize biological processes enzymes or microorganisms in the production of electricity and other products such as biohydrogen 62 microbial electrolysis cells mecs microbial fuel cells mfcs microbial desalination cells mdcs enzymatic biofuel cells ebcs microbial reverse electrodialysis cells mrecs and microbial solar cells mscs as well as microbial electrosynthesis cells mescs are all types of bess 63 the following parts describe the operative fundamentals of bess and their main components 3 1 operational characteristics of bioelectrochemical systems as explained earlier bess use microorganisms for dual wastewater treatment and energy generation 64 65 the processes leading to the generation of electricity in bess occur via multifaceted microbial electrochemical reactions 66 bess are usually described as a novel technology that transform wastewater into electricity with the aid of microbes 67 bess are made up of an anodic fuel cell compartment 68 69 the cathodic fuel cell compartment is considered an electrode which is purposely designed for the acceptance of oxygen 70 71 there is also an ion exchange membrane for the separation of the bes compartments the ion exchange membranes are designed to prevent the permeation of oxygen into the anode 72 the schematics of microbial fuel and electrolysis cells as typical examples of bess are shown in fig 3 the figure shows that electricity is the main product from mfc along with carbon dioxide and water meanwhile hydrogen carbon dioxide and some other species are the main products from mec in bess acetates or formates are produced when the cell is in operation due to the biocatalyst biologically breaking down the substrate production of cations also occurs with the aid of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad in microorganisms the transport of byproducts occurs this process also leads to the growth of biofilms on the surface of the electrodes 73 the occurrence of these processes is accompanied by direct electron transfer or mediated electron transfer the main goal of biofuel cells is to transform the chemical energy in a substrate into electricity via a biological process 3 2 components of bioelectrochemical fuel cells 3 2 1 electrode materials an electrode is a solid electric conductor that carries the electric current in bess the electrodes in bess are categorized into anode and cathode with specific consideration made during the selection of any material as electrodes for bess some of these factors include excellent conductivity enhanced mass transfer and large surface area other selection criteria include low cost mechanical strength scalability biocompatibility and chemical stability 74 the performance of bess depends on the electrode material materials ideal for the anode includes carbon felt carbon mesh graphite fiber brush and carbon cloth materials suitable for the cathode include platinum black platinum and graphite 75 platinum coated electrodes are normally utilized due to their effectiveness and superiority in the generation of energy despite the high cost of the platinum pt catalyst it is the best known catalyst for oxygen reduction reactions orr poor oxygen reduction occurs with pt free cathodes different electron acceptors rather than o2 were used in bess to overcome the poor orr such as potassium ferricyanide 76 permanganate 77 hg2 78 hexavalent chromium 79 nitrate 80 uranium 80 or sodium hypochlorite 81 biocathode is another strategy that uses the aerobic biofilm at the cathode surface as an electron acceptor 82 83 in microbial electrolysis cell mec pt is also the best catalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions her however due to its high cost and easy poising its application in such systems is limited 84 different pt free catalysts were investigated in mec for her such as stainless steel nickel nickel alloys and tungsten carbide 85 89 similarly biocathode is suggested to be used in mec for her 90 however the biocathode affects the purity of hydrogen produced due to the growing methanogenesis bacteria 91 92 3 2 2 ion exchange membrane different ion exchange membranes were used in bess including porous and nonporous membranes porous membranes include microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes these membranes transfer the neutral or charged species according to the pore size 93 94 noneporous membranes include cation exchange membranes cem anion exchange membranes aem and bipolar membranes bpm these types of membranes allow for the passage of charged pieces and prevent the oxygen crossover 95 96 nafion 97 flemion 98 hyflon 99 polyarylene ether sulfone polyarylene ether ketone and polyarylene sulfone were used in bess 100 102 one of the main challenges with membranes in bess is fouling fouling of the membrane occurs with different pollutants i e organic biological and scaling 103 there are two types of fouling irreversible and reversible this depends on the strength with which the particles attach to the membrane membrane fouling can be measured using permeability resistivity and transmembrane pressure 104 it is worth mentioning that sometimes there is no need to use ion exchange membranes 105 3 2 3 substrates the organic molecules which microorganisms consume during cell operation are referred to as substrates the substrate remains a key factor that affects the production of power 106 substrates give energy to the bacterial cell to develop which defines their pivotal role as a source for carbon energy this factor equally affects the economic characteristics of bioelectrochemical fuel cells as well as their performance the nature constituents and concentration of the substrate affect the microbial community and the energy that can be obtained from the bess different substrates have been considered as feedstock in bess including low molecular simple organic material complex carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch have also been considered the energy generated from the acetate substrate as an end product of glucose metabolism is higher compared to that of other substrates 107 glucose cellulose sodium acetate oil refinery waste agro process waste residuals dairy and vegetable waste have all be explored as potential substrates for besss 107 109 3 2 4 microorganisms substrates that are organic in nature break down with the aid of microorganisms into various species and ions this phenomenon affects the flow of electrons via the bess these microorganisms are unicellular organisms with a simple or compartmented cell structure a large number of microorganisms have proven their effectiveness as biocatalysts in bess these include iron reducing bacteria such as geobacter sulfurreducens which produce high power at room temperature 110 these microorganisms are available in activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants 111 113 the efficiency of the bess is highly dependant on the rate of movement or transport of electrons from the microorganisms to the electrodes 114 115 the mechanisms for the transfer of electrons vary depending on the classification of microorganisms used in the investigation some notable bacterial commonly used in bess that uses glucose are escherichia coli bacillus subtilis and proteus vulgaris escherichia coli proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas methanica use sucrose and acetate 116 3 3 mechanisms in bioelectrochemical systems in bess bioenergy can be harnessed via microbial reactions occuring at the anode compartment this is attributed to either amalgamation between fermentation or putrefaction and respiration reactions putrefaction which is an oxidation reaction is commonly seen at the anode 117 the flow of electrons via an external circuit occurs once it joins with a cathode it is therefore possible for power to be generated via bacterial respiration in fuel cells the biocatalysts affect the breakdown of the substrate into electrons protons as well as the electron transfer rate from the biocatalyst to the anode surface the separation of these processes with the aid of ion exchange membranes and electron acceptors at cathode lead to electricity 118 3 3 1 operational characteristics of bioelectrochemical cells bess are made up of anode and cathode electrodes substrates ion exchange membranes and microbial communities some of the microbes used as explained earlier include escherichia coli clostridium acetobutylicum enterobacter aerogenes clostridium perfringens and clostridium butyricum the breakdown of the substrate using bacteria occurs at the anode via fermentation for the production of ions and electrons these bacteria are also responsible for the movement of electrons to the anodic electrodes the region inside the bess is functional due to the anaerobic conditions formed as the oxygen restrains the generation of electricity at the cathode however oxygen from the air is permitted 119 the ions flow through a solution to the cathode resulting in an interface across the ion selective membrane these characteristics result in the creation of a potential difference between the two electrodes 3 3 2 transfer of electrons in bioelectrochemical fuel cells the extracellular transfer of electrons in bess occurs via direct electron transfers and indirect electron transfers explained as follows 120 direct electron transfer electrically conductive pili i e nanowire and or direct contact i e membrane spanning cytochromes via extracellular polymeric substances eps of biofilms 121 indirect electron transfer via mediators shuttled such as self excreted exogenous as a redox mediator shuttle byproduct mediator shuttled and artificial mediator electron shuttled 122 fig 4 shows the different possible electron trnafer mechanism in bess rhodoferax ferrireducens and shewanella putrefaciens are common microorganisms that support the electron transfer it has further been highlighted that the movement of the electrons takes place from a lower redox probability to a higher redox probability some bacteria support direct electron transfer det mediator shuttles are required for the induced electron transfer approach in the movement of electrons to the electrode surface further supporting extracellular electron transfer mfcs that function with the aid of mediators as electron shuttles are called mediator mfcs mediators are electrochemical active groups responsible for redox reactions these groups equally affect the interaction between the cell and the surface of the electrode the cells are therefore able to interact with the surface of the electrode via the presence of a mediator or shuttled electron the application of mediators is very common in mfcs where the bacteria are not able to transfer electrons to the surface of the anode there are some requirements to ensuring the high functionality of these mediators the mediators must be able to penetrate the cell membrane without any obstruction to absorb the electrons from their carriers the redox mediator and the reductive metabolite must be proportional to each other 123 there must be stability during the long phase of redox cycling the reduced mediator must be able to leave the inner cell easily via the bacterial membrane the electrochemical kinetics of reduced mediators must also be fast the metabolic progression must not change due to the mediator s oxidation state the mediator shuttles must able to transfer electrons between electrodes and cells cobal sepulchrate neutral red benzyl viologen 2 4 anthraquinone disulfonate aqds methylene blue mb and methyl viologen mv are some examples of electron shuttles used in bess 3 4 classification of bess microbial electrolysis cells mecs microbial fuel cells mfcs microbial desalination cells mdcs enzymatic biofuel cells ebcs microbial reverse electrodialysis cells mrecs microbial solar cells mscs and microbial electrosynthesis cells mescs are all types of bess 63 among these different types mfcs and mecs are commonly used for simultaneously treating wastewater and producing electricity or chemicals as depicted in fig 5 this section discusses the progress made in using mfc and mec in wastewater treatment 3 4 1 microbial fuel cell microbial fuel cells are one of the most commonly exploited bess the application of mfcs is capable of transforming chemical energy into electrical energy via microbes 124 the microorganisms function as biocatalysts for the oxidation of chemical species in biodegradable substrates with the aid of the electrodes 125 these characteristics of mfcs contribute to their consideration as effective bess for the generation of electricity 126 these systems are used in many applications such as biosensors wastewater treatment and water desalination 127 129 as explained earlier research across the globe has experimented with many substrates suitable for mfcs mainly to increase the amount of electricity generated 130 131 there has been significant variation in these substrates spanning from simple and single organic molecules to complex substrates industrial wastewater made up of simple and complex organic pollutants has been utilized as a substrate for mfcs 131 the biofilm at the anode is complex and is usually made up of electroactive and fermentative microorganisms 132 the electroactive microorganisms are able to extract electrical energy from the breakdown of simple organic molecules 133 different types of wastewater were examined in mfc for producing electricity as can be seen in table 1 the table shows the effect of the anode or cathode type and or modification on the power generation 3 4 2 microbial electrolysis cell mec the last decade has seen a considerable increase in research relating to microbial electrolysis cells for the production of hydrogen from waste 141 mecs utilize biologically degradable organics as a source of electrons 142 mecs are designed to produce more hydrogen gas due to their ability to exceed the fermentative barrier predominant in fermentation based processes 143 several substrates can be used in mecs unlike other methods used for producing hydrogen 144 although the progress and developments already achieved in mecs there are still some challenges that need to be addressed before commercialization optimization of the technology to increase the hydrogen gas along with a reduction in the overall cost of the technology are both critical for the eventual commercialization of this technology investigations into mecs were first carried in 2005 145 bacteria capable of transferring electrons via extracellular mechanisms in mecs utilize the anode as an electron sink for the oxidation of organics and the production of electrons and protons the process involves the diffusion of protons through the proton exchange membrane to the cathode there is a reduction of electron transfer through the external electric circuit for the production of hydrogen at the cathode mecs are not functional extemporaneously because of limiting factors such as the thermodynamic barrier and excess energy needed for driving the reduction reaction 146 the potential at the anode varies from 0 2 0 5 v the reduction of protons to hydrogen gas is the half reaction at the cathode according to the nerst equations the potential at the cathode is largely influenced by the concentration of free protons the hydrogen s partial pressure and temperature due to thermodynamic limitations associated with mecs energy input is critical in these types of cells 147 a method for reducing or removing the energy needed for mecs is by enhancing the potential at the cathode via a change in the ph this is possible because the potential at the cathode will be high therefore the electrolyte ph can be reduced to less than 5 the main issue here is that the migration of protons via the membrane would be curbed when a lower ph is maintained in the cathode this in return will cause a decrease in ph at the anode and will be detrimental to the microorganisms at the anode 3 4 2 1 merits and demerits of microbial electrolysis cell operating conditions of mecs are simple compared to other hydrogen production methods for instance using acetate as a substrate requires 0 11 v input for hydrogen gas production 148 this implies the energy required in the production of hydrogen using mecs is nearly 1 3 kw h m3 149 on the other hand electrolyzers used for the production of hydrogen industrially requires around 4 5 5 0 kw h m3 150 the hydrogen produced in mec is higher compared to that of other hydrogen generation processes like fermentation based processes 151 the stoichiometric yield for hydrogen in the dark fermentation process is only 4 mol h2 molglucose 152 butyrate and acetate are some byproducts that are produced from these processes the conversion of these products to hydrogen gas is not feasible thermodynamically and is a clear indication of an incomplete breakdown of organics especially in dark fermentation hydrogen gas yield is directly proportional to the complete oxidation of these byproducts 153 in terms of stoichiometry this will sum up to 4 mol h2 molacetate in mec the yield of hydrogen gas from glucose is 12 mol h2 molglucose the purity of hydrogen produced via mecs is higher compared to that of other hydrogen generation methods due to the organic breakdown that occurs in dark fermentation the hydrogen produced is normally accompanied by other gases like carbon dioxide 154 the hydrogen produced by the mecs is considered to be ideal for various applications as it is expected to be sulfur free in a nutshell the future of hydrogen production particularly at a reduced cost revolves around mec the rate of hydrogen production is a key issue impeding the commercialization of this viable technology i e mec for instance the production of hydrogen even under laboratory conditions is limited to 3 m3h2 m3 day 155 the hydrogen production rate undergoes deterioration when the entire process is scaled up most pilot reactors from literature generated lower hydrogen gas and lower current densities when compared to laboratory reactors some of the factors that were responsible for these phenomena include the reactor geometry electrode material glass fiber separators possible connection resistances and microbiological factors leading to slow start up for the reactor 156 producing methane can be achieved even when the hydrogen production rate at the pilot scale is lower the highest hydrogen production rate in small scale mec can exceed 50 m3h2 m3 day 157 this therefore attests to the suitability of mecs as decentralized systems for the production of hydrogen the integration of mecs with existing technologies provide an enormous impact in terms of futuristic industrial applications 3 4 2 2 microbial electrolysis cell for hydrogen production from wastewater wastewater from different sources was recently investigated as fuel to produce hydrogen in mecs different types of wastewater electrode materials and membranes were investigated to increase the cod removal efficiency columbic efficiency and hydrogen production rate table 2 summarizes some of the studies performed on hydrogen production by mec from different wastewaters as clear from the table that mec is a viable option for simultaneous wastewater treatment and hydrogen production 4 application of bes in treating urine wastewater urine produced by the human kidneys appears transparent in color the kidney usually functions as a separator and filters the blood this process supports the elimination of excess water and soluble waste 163 human urine is simply an aqueous solution of urea inorganic salts of chloride potassium and sodium as well as ammonia creatine organic acids and other toxins created due to the decomposition of hemoglobin 164 the color of urine is determined by urobilin there are variations in the composition of human urine subject to a person s lifestyle physical conditions environmental characteristics and diet a healthy body produces between 1 5 2 l day of urine this implies that considering the world s population in excess of 7 billion 1 16 1 54 1010 l day of urine is produced this can further be extended to a total annual of 4 22 5 62 1012 l 165 there have been many research activities carried out on human urine mostly in the field of wastewater treatment it has been reported that human urine is responsible for 10 of the total chemical oxygen demand cod 75 of total nitrogen and 50 of phosphorous in municipal wastewater 166 treating urine separately will imply that some useful nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous can be recovered from wastewater 167 168 research regarding using human urine as a substrate for bess can be traced to scientists at the university of the west of england wetsus and wageningen university and the university of science technology of china 169 170 the first research work carried out was aimed at the generation of electricity with the aid of mfcs using human urine as a substrate 171 other researchers also explored the feasibility of producing ammonia on the cathode and simultaneously producing electricity 172 4 1 urine fed microbial fuel cell microbial fuel cells can be developed using human urine as a substrate due to the rich organic molecules contained in urine 173 urine also has a higher solution conductivity which limits internal losses in electrochemical systems this results in a decrement in terms of ohmic resistance thereby improving the electrochemical output 174 the last decade has seen an appreciable increase in work carried out in terms of the application of urine in bess this attests to the accelerated growth of this novel concept the application of urine in the development of mfcs can be carried out using a membrane or membrane less design concept the application of urine in bess can also aid in recovering nutrients such as ammonia and phosphate one must be extra cautious during the transformation of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds particularly in urine hydrolysis there are two types of urine fed mfcs single chamber membrane based and membrane less urine fed mfcs the single chamber membrane based urine fed mfc functions with the aid of a polymeric separator the polymeric membrane serves as a partition between the anode and the cathode 169 today these polymeric membranes are being replaced with ceramic separators a concept initiated in 2013 175 it was further improved in another investigation that utilized a membrane less setup based on self stratification of urine via a column 176 the stratification of the urine supported complete anaerobiosis at the bottom of the column while the top of the column was anoxic the application of urine as feedstock in mfc in terms of research activities has increased due to the high nutritional content of urine the development of urine fed mfc revolves around acrylic compartments it was further highlighted that the performance of the cell in terms of the current generation improved significantly whenever urine was utilized recovery of ammonia along with the production of electricity with the aid of double chamber mfc was also reported 177 a cation exchange membrane supported the ammonium ions to move to the cathode chamber for their transformation to ammonia a miniaturized mfc having anodic chamber volumes of 1 4 ml and 6 25 ml has also been reported 178 the anode and the cathode compartments were separated with the aid of the polymeric cation exchange membrane a power output of 1 5 mw was generated after stacking 48 mfcs together the application of ceramic membrane as separators in mfcs aids in cost reduction and the usage of sustainable materials for the treatment of wastewater and generation of power an origami type mfc with a urine substrate was also reported 179 this mfc produced 50 60 Î¼w of peak power the mfc used six cell stack and was linked to a power management system and produced energy that could broadcast messages from transceiver over 24 h 179 other types of membranes from natural rubber and an egg based open air cathode coated with lanolin have also been investigated in a urine fed mfc an investigation carried out for 24 weeks also showed that these types of fuel cells could be used to power other applications 180 similar work using carbon fiber sleeve anodes and cathodes with nafion tubing has also been reported 181 the urine fed mfc was made up of 24 cell stacks 182 the application of 3d printed molds supports the manufacturing of miniaturized urine fed mfcs 183 to reduce the complexity of the design the self stratifying membrane less mfc was developed with a similar structure to that of the benthic mfc 175 the main difference between the two is the plurality of the anode positioned in the anoxic layers of an environment and the plurality of cathodes positioned in the oxic environment for self stratifying membrane less mfcs there is the absence of a barrier between the anodes and cathodes the electrolyte is therefore shared between the two electrodes which are usually 5 mm apart the main concept behind the self stratifying membrane less mfc is to explore the self stratification phenomenon in the development of membranes urine fed mfc 175 the overall goal is to harness the capacity of microorganisms to breakdown urine into both oxic and anoxic this essentially explores the capacity of microorganisms within two different environments having varied redox potentials 4 2 urine fed microbial electrolysis cell nitrogen present in domestic water originates from urine in the form of urea ammonia can therefore be produced via enzymatic hydrolysis using ammonium ions nitrogen compounds must be eliminated from wastewater to prevent eutrophication of water systems leading to environmental challenges 184 the entire process requires high energy input and usually very challenging to meet the high demand for fertilizers there has been a significant increase in nitrogen rich fertilizer production nitrogen recovery using mfcs as well as bioenergy production have been thoroughly investigated 185 the application of mec for ammonia recovery from urine has not been exploited much from literature it has been determined that the removal and recovery of nitrogen from source separated urine can be a source of revenue generation 186 fig 6 captures the processes leading to the transport and transformation of ammonia and ammonium ions inside mfc and mec the ammonium ions are transported via a membrane in followed by an ammonia diffusion through the membrane then the ammonia gas is escaped out of the system after that the ammonium ions involve in biological oxidation with the aid of oxygen gas as there is a hypothesis of anodic ammonia nitrification forming nitrogen with the aid of the microorganisms finally the ammonium ions are used for building biomass on both the anode and the cathode there is a reduction in the water produced in the cathode chamber to hydroxyl ions and hydrogen in mec unlike mfc the ph of the cathode compartment tends to increase because of the hydroxyl ions present thus resulting in the transformation of the nh4 to nh3 there is more hydrogen produced due to this which results in a reduction in aeration of the cathode chamber a key requirement in mfcs designed for ammonium recovery the hydrogen gas generated can also support the elimination of ammonia from the cathode solution and this action invites easy elimination of ammonium from the anolyte the production of hydrogen and ammonium recovery with the aid of mec using urine can be traced back to 2014 187 the researchers utilized a double chambered mec with the anode made up of carbon felt while the cathode was developed using a pt based catalyst separated by a cation exchange membrane the potentials at the anode and the cathode were determined with the aid of two reference electrode configuration a constant temperature of 30 c was utilized throughout the investigation the system was further inoculated with the aid of effluent from the mfc it was further observed that there was an increment in the cell voltage from 0 6 v to 1 0 v after 42 days 187 one of the investigations set up had synthetic wastewater as its feedstock but the other setups were urine fed at varying feed flows the final set up was urine fed but the solution at the cathode was continuously being replaced it was further deduced that the rate of nitrogen removal for the system with the wastewater was far lower compared to that with the urine more stable values of nitrogen removal were recorded for the set up with the constant replacement of the cathode solution the rate of ammonium elimination was steady during the entire investigation while the others had a reduction in the removal efficiency with time the current density obtained was 14 64 a m2 and the hydrogen produced was 32 m3h2 m3 and energy input of 2 32 kw h m3h2 187 despite this good result the amount of ammonium eliminated was low thereby stressing the need for further optimization in order to accelerate the commercialization of this technology to increase the ammonium rate of removal the migration of the ammonium ions can be increased furthermore a better ammonia stripping process to support the diffusion of ammonium from the anode should also be considered bio electro concentration systems are substitutes for mec in terms of nutrient recovery from urine this concept is a hybrid method that employs mec and medc there is first the generation of an electric field from an external source and cautiously moving charged ions from one chamber to the other via specific polymeric membranes the overall goal of this technology is to facilitate the concentration of anions and cations inside the central chamber it has been reported that this concept is very viable in terms of ammonia phosphate and potassium recovery from urine 187 the setup for the investigation was made up of an anode concentrate and a cathode a cation exchange membrane was used to serve as a physical barrier or separator between the anode and the concentrate compartment an anion exchange membrane was also used as a separator between the concentrate and anode compartment graphite granules were used as the anode and cathode the current collector for the anode was a graphite rod while that of the cathode was titanium ti mesh the energy balance for the system was positive which was applied to support the movement of ions via the membranes there was also inoculation of the reactor using acetate fed bioanode urine and anaerobic sludge the current density generated from the system was 37 6 a m2 at an applied voltage of 1 46 v this value is the highest recorded so far in nitrogen recovery for mfc and mec systems the experiment was carried out three times with 7 18 g nh4 m3d 0 52 g po4 3 m3d and 1 62 g k m3d being eliminated but then recovered into a concentrated stream 188 5 mec hybrid with other renewable energy sources to moderate the disadvantages regarding the energy required for the mecs it is usually integrated with other renewable energy sources to provide the required energy for its operation the following section discusses the recent progress done at this point 5 1 bioelectrochemical based systems microbial fuel cells as explained are able to generate power via the breakdown of wastes today many researchers are advocating for mfc being used with mec in an integrated system as depicted in fig 7 this technique has been used in hydrogen production in the absence of external power sources with the aid of acetate as substrate 1 21 mol h2 molacetate and hydrogen production rate of 14 9 ml l day was obtained 189 other authors equally explored bio photoelectrochemical cell made up of both mfcs and mecs hydrogen gas was produced due to the illumination of the photocathode of the bio photoelectrochemical cell while voltage required for electrolysis was obtained from the mfcs the process generated hydrogen gas at a rate of 1 35 0 15 ml h the current density obtained was 0 68 a m2 190 mecs can also be powered using mfcs aside from hydrogen production 190 it has been reported that mfcs can be used as a source of energy for mecs to transform carbon dioxide into formic acid 191 5 2 submersible microbial electrolysis cell the overall objective for the development of a submersible mec was to eliminate the external source of energy needed for its functionality the cells were designed to be applicable even in anaerobic digesters anode chambers are not required for these types of cells for power generation the other chamber is still designed to produce hydrogen gas an investigation carried out in 2012 explored the performance of self powered submersible mec for hydrogen production in anaerobic digesters 192 other investigations aimed at measuring the biological oxygen demand bod with the aid of anodic biofilm have also been reported it was deduced that the current generated was subject to the bod of the wastewater the inoculum type and concentration both affect the adhesion of the bacterial cells to the surface of the electrode so a new anode was used to analyse the microbial activity 193 ammonia inhibition in anaerobic digestion has also been used in a novel hybrid system the system was made up of submersible mec and a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr this process led to the recovery of ammonia and electricity being generated again the process resulted in the production of biogas other investigations also explored submerged microbial desalination denitrification cells this was used to eliminate nitrate from groundwater and led to the generation of electricity in terms of wastewater treatment there has also been significant improvement 194 electricity was generated via anodic bacteria activity while no3 and na were migrated to the anode and cathode via anion exchange membrane and cation exchange membranes respectively the effluent migrated to the cathode while the no3 was reduced to nitrogen via autotrophic denitrification the submerged microbial desalination denitrification cell was able to eliminate 90 5 of nitrate from groundwater the structure of the submerged mec showed the possibility of integrating mec with anaerobic digesters the process for the removal of nitrate from groundwater with the aid of novel submerged desalination denitrification cell method is represented in fig 8 5 3 microbial electrolysis cell powered by solar energy solar energy is abundant and environmentally friendly 195 196 because of this it is perceived as a suitable alternative in terms of energy generation to meet the growing world energy demand this suggests that the power required to operate mecs can be derived from dye sensitized solar cells 197 hydrogen production with the aid of solar powered mec with a hydrogen conversion efficiency of 82 from acetate has been reported 198 harvesting of energy using dye sensitized solar cells to power mecs for biological hydrogen production was also reported 198 it was further captured that the hydrogen generated from mecs with the aid of dye sensitized solar cells was equivalent to that obtained using a conventional power source the conversion efficiency in the dye sensitized solar cells to optimize the systems performance a bio photoelectrochemical cell was powered using the mfc the mfc functioned as a source of electrical potential the bio photoelectrochemical cell was made up of an anode and photocathode the rate of hydrogen produced with the aid of this system was 1 35 0 15 ml h 190 it must be considered that for the mec and the dye sensitized solar cell the current density is subject to the light intensity and the characteristics of the anodic microbiological catalyst 5 4 dark fermentation microbial fuel and microbial electrolysis cells hybrid system the application of dark fermentation can lead to the production of hydrogen gas from dissolved organic materials in wastewater there are issues pertaining to the thermodynamic obstacles that influence the hydrogen being produced via this process 199 this limitation leads to the development of butyrate and acetate instead of the production of hydrogen gas again an external source of energy is required to support thermodynamically feasible reactions its been reported that dark fermentation of 1 mol of glucose can generate 4 mol of hydrogen gas 200 201 using bio catalysed electrolysis acetate can also be transformed into hydrogen gas combining the two processes can lead to 12 mol h2 moleglucose being produced 202 an investigation ascertained the dark fermentation of corn stalk attached to an mec this process led to more hydrogen gas being produced in comparison to a stand alone dark fermentation process other researchers also investigated the feasibility of using the excess energy generated from dark fermentation with the aid of an mec 203 this investigation underwent with the aid of effluent of dark fermentation as a substrate for the mec the effluent consisted of fatty acids supporting the production of hydrogen at a rate of 81 ml h2 ld at organic removal rate was 85 203 production of hydrogen from cellulose has been equally reported 204 the researchers connected two mfcs to mecs in series leading to a generation of 0 43 v with the aid of effluent from mec as a substrate to mfc it was concluded that the presence of the dark ferment paired to the mfc and the mec enhanced the rate of production of by 41 compared to that of stand alone fermentation 204 6 factors impeding the commercialization of bioelectrochemical systems energy production using bess is very promising however several obstacles still prevent it from reaching its full potential in spite of all the progress highlighted in this review there are still issues that need to be addressed the first is that most investigations conducted on bess have mainly been conducted under laboratory conditions and scales an important consideration for future large scale applications lower efficiency and a reduction in the rate of production are also key issues that have impeded the commercialization of bes technologies the type of substrate to use is also another issue of concern that must be critically evaluated the electrode material and types of microorganisms used in bess have an equal effect on the functionality of these systems there are several types of substrates that may be used in bess however their efficiencies may be different cellulose starch and complex sugars are notable substrates the application of landfill leachate has also been reported as a suitable substrate for bess the concerns with dependence on these types of substrates have to do with human health safety and the environment the use of carbohydrates such as glucose as a substrate is also a major challenge as it competes with food demand the material used for electrodes in bess is expected to exhibit a higher flow of electrons mass transfer large surface area porosity mechanical strength scalability biocompatibility and chemical stability 205 platinum is an expensive material that increases the overall cost of the technology the application of a membrane as a separator in bess comes with its own challenges 206 the application of membranes in bess can reduce the permeability of protons loss of substrates and back diffusion of oxygen other issues like biofouling internal resistance and ph gradient all affect the performance of membrane based bess 205 all these key issues affect the maintenance of the membrane and create technical concerns in terms of design efficiency and scaling up of the bess using microorganisms in bess comes with some issues as well the mechanism for the transfer of the electrons has always been subject to concern the transfer of electrons in bess varies based on the type of bacteria utilized this attests to the fact that the selection of the right and suitable microbes for the bess plays a key role in the functionality of the cell the power output of the cell is also affected when mixed culture bacteria is used 207 temperature sensitivity also influences the efficiency output and lifespan of the bes this is attributed to not being able to perform well under lower temperature conditions because of the sluggish characteristics of microbial reaction under such conditions one key issue influencing the scaling up of this technology is the lack of an in depth understanding of microbes under unconventional bess environments 7 practical limitation risk assessment and prospects of bioelectrochemical systems 7 1 practical limitations of bioelectrochemical systems some limitations still face the practical application of bess firstly the high capital cost of such systems this is mainly due to the high cost of catalysts electrodes cathode in case of using precious catalysts membrane and current collectors secondly the low power output and hydrogen yields these systems should operate at ideal conditions for keeping the activity of microorganisms different carbon based electrodes derived from carbon wastes were synthesized and investigated for mfcs to decrease the cost of electrodes 208 novel cell configurations is needed to decrease capital cost reduce the maintenance cost and enhancing the efficiency of the bess for example using multiple anodes and or cathodes instead of one large size electrode makes the replacement and maintenance process easier simpler and less time consuming membrane cost and fouling is another challenge facing the development and application of bess membrane fouling negatively affected the performance of mfcs and mecs therefore membrane less bess are highly recommended to avoid these problems 209 however oxygen crossover from the cathode compartment to the anode compartment as well as substrate crossover in the reverse direction decreases the columbic efficiency power generation and microorganism activity 210 the biofilm formed on the cathode surface is another issue facing the application of membrane less mfc as it decreases the rate of oxygen reductionreaction orr at the cathode surface antibacterial orr catalysts such as silver nanoparticles and pyrolyzed iron phthalocyanines were applied to prevent the biofilm formation 211 212 kim et al proposed a new mfcs configuration based on a dual anode to prevent the fuel crossover and biofilm formation at the cathode using an additional anode placed between the main electrodes 210 7 2 risk assessment and control in bioelectrochemical systems microbial fuel cells and microbial electrolysis cells as common bioelectrochemical systems have proven to be very efficient and promising for utilizing wastewater as a carbon source leading to generation of electricity this is true in the case of mfcs they are also promising for producing hydrogen gas as clean fuel like in the case of mecs however some additional measures have to be taken when considering bess for dual wastewater treatment and energy generation either electricity or hydrogen fuel wastewater has a very diverse matrix of compounds so concentrations are usually expressed in terms of total elemental concentration such as total carbon tc total organic carbon toc chemical and biological oxygen demands cod and bod as an indirect measure of degradable carbon content total nitrogen tn total ammonia nitrogen tan etc unfortunately wastewater contains some species that can fail the entire operation of mfcs and mecs by inhibiting the microbial growth and in turn reducing power or hydrogen generation 213 as a result the appropriate medium composition has to be ensured to obtain the desired operation level of bess a good example of this inhibition phenomenon is ammonia concentration although a source of nitrogen usually ammonia ammonium ion or nitrate ion is essential for microbial growth a high concentration of ammonia can lead to substrate inhibition and reduce the energy output of bess nam et al have found that increasing the ammonia concentration in a single chamber mfc from 500 mg n l to 4000 mg n l as tan results in a significant reduction in maximum power density from 4240 mw m3 to 1700 mw m3 214 this was mainly attributed to the inhibition of ammonia oxidizing and nitrate oxidizing bacteria showing an effective concentration of 894 mg n l as an optimum with advice to carefully monitor the tan during the mfc operation hiegemann et al obtained a similar observation with regards to the cod loads and free ammonia in both bench scale and 45 l scale mfcs both showed an instant collapse in power output at tan 8000 mg n l 213 similar results were observed for sulfide inhibition as result of sulfate reducing bacteria in mfcs showing a decrease in power output by about 83 215 the inhibition of microbial growth in bess utilizing a wastewater matrix is not just subject to substrate inhibition heavy metals and heavy metal oxides also have a critical toxicity and result in severe inhibition of microbial growth due to their antimicrobial action 216 218 stein et al studied the effect of toxic components on mfc operations suggesting the use of i v polarization curves to observe inhibition and to estimate its type 219 microbial electrolysis cell mecs work in a similar fashion to that of mfc meaning microbial inhibitions are critical here as well however mecs face an additional challenge due to the growth of methanogenic microorganisms which shift the mec on a route to producing methane rather than hydrogen 220 222 although methane is considered as valuable fuel as well it has a severe environmental impact due to its carbon footprint so mec operations should ultimately be tailored toward hydrogen production methane produced with hydrogen in mecs will either be used in a mixed fuel with hydrogen or will require further down stream processing in order to separate it this will obtain clean hydrogen gas but will however add to the cost of mecs due to the high interest in bess in general particularly mfcs and mecs several strategies and approaches have been investigated to mitigate and control the risks associated with inhibition in bess this has also been done with methanogen growth in mecs to optimize bes operations substrate and heavy metal inhibition in bess have been mainly mitigated by setting limits on the concentration of different nutrients of cod and tan which can be achieved by dilution and mixing of different wastewater streams 213 214 on the other hand many strategies have been developed to minimize methanogenesis in mecs mec operation under alkaline conditions have shown up to 85 90 hydrogen in the evolved gas over 50 days of 25 cycles at an overall energy recovery of 72 at ph of 11 2 this was attributed to methanogen inhibition 222 alternatively the use of specific enzymes can selectively stimulate or inhibit the growth of methanogens thereby controlling the product as desired which ranges from methane to hydrogen 223 karthikeyan et al described a strategy of interfering with methanogen activity for example targeting methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr 224 injection of chemical inhibitors such as 2 bromoethanesulfonate at an injection dose of 286 Î¼m reduced methanogenic electron loss from 36 4 to 2 5 thereby increasing overall hydrogen efficiency from 56 1 80 1 with good stability over 10 batch cycles 92 lu et al found that working at psychrophilic conditions with mec maintained at temperatures of 4 and 9 c effectively inhibited the growth of methanogens such as methanobrevibacter arboriphilus 225 7 3 prospects of bioelectrochemical systems the applications of bess span from bioelectricity to producing clean energy other applications include wastewater treatment and environmental remediation most research work carried out have all concluded the generation of electricity from microbes this method involves the microbe catalyzed conversion of a chemical substrate for energy production the application of microorganisms in mfcs for the generation of electricity has been extensively studied which has proven to be promising for future commercialization it has been established that biohydrogen can be generated from microbial action with the aid of other renewable substrates such as acetate and wastewater via fermentation in the presence or absence of membranes 226 the application of bess for wastewater treatment is also crucial research work has also been conducted geared towards exploring issues pertaining to wastewater treatment with the aid of bess 131 227 the research work explained that bess are ideal for wastewater treatment into biochemical bioenergy and bioproducts bess can also be utilized in the valorization of biomass wastes bioremediation of heavy metal polluted water and soils with the aid of varying substrates and exchange membranes bess can also be used for bioassays and biosensors 228 it has been reported that mfcs can support the detection of toxicity and metabolic processes when employed in bioassays and biosensors 229 investigations into water quality monitoring assessment and electrochemical evaluation have all been examined using biosensors made from mfcs and other bess types 230 231 the investigations carried out have also stated that using mfc based sensors are likely to ensure quick onsite monitoring and detection of toxic analytes needed for water quality testing bess can also help in addressing carbon dioxide emissions finally bess can equally be applied in co2 capturing and conversion 232 233 research and development efforts should focus on the scaling up of bess from bench scales and lab scales which are currently being widely investigated to pilot scale and eventually full scale applications 234 while working on these developments a better and full understanding of the metabolic routes of extractive microorganisms should be developed as well this will help to better enrich the growth of these microorganisms and improve the electron transfer from the cell interior to the anode surface simple designs are recommended to avoid operation complexity high capital cost and to have an easier and lower maintenance cost application of bess for wastewater treatment and removal or remediation of hazardous materials such as denitrification heavy metal and chemical production will increase the overall attractiveness of the process hybrid bess with other systems for wastewater treatment or water desalination which in turn increase overall efficiency should be thoroughly considered and further explored the use of nanotechnology to develop high efficiency membranes should be considered electrodes that decrease biofouling and enhance biofilm formation should also be thoroughly considered 8 conclusion this investigation explored the various principles and operational characteristics of bioelectrochemical systems bess like microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs the investigation further touched on various bess hybrids of mfc and mec as well as other technologies factors impeding the commercialization of bess were equally presented in this investigation in addition the future directions of bess were thoroughly evaluated the investigation therefore creates a link between the existing knowledge and future commercialization aspects of bess it was concluded that bes is a novel technology that functions with the aid of microorganisms for the conversion of chemical energy in organic materials those present in wastewater serve to generate power via varying processes in microbial electrochemical reactions the investigation also highlighted the importance of the substrate electrode and membrane material on the functionality of the bess similarly choosing the right microorganism is critical in improving the overall performance of bess although bess can be used in many applications there are some critical factors impeding the advancement of technology into the commercialization stage these factors include lower efficiencies and energy output poor conductivity mass transfer porosity and area of the electrode material other factors include mechanical strength scalability and chemical stability of the bess electrodes despite these challenges bess can significantly contribute to clean power generation in future with more research and attention the application of bess will revolve around wastewater treatment bioanalysis and biosensors a thorough understanding of this technology will have a positive effect in terms of water treatment energy waste management and environmental concerns in future declaration of competing interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest in this work
