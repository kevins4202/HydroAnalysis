fluoride pvdf matrix the go g pmsa nanosheets were synthesized by growing of pmsa zwitterionic brushes on go surface by the redox graft polymerization via the graft from strategy causing the twofold advantages of increasing the go dispersibility in the membrane matrix and giving more antifouling property to go the incorporation of the zwitterionic additive in the pvdf membranes significantly improved water affinity and surface hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite membranes comparing to pure pvdf membranes and go pvdf membranes as prepared go g pmsa pvdf membranes showed evident improvement

that zwitterionic polymer modified go as an antifouling additive can be potentially applied to fabricate antifouling nanocomposite membranes keywords nanocomposite pvdf membrane go g pmsa hydrophilic modification anti fouling performance 1 introduction due to the world population growth and depletion of fresh water there is a strong demand for fresh clean water in the modern society membrane separation technique has been extensively used in the applications of wastewater treatment seawater desalination and drinking water treatment 1 among the developed polymeric membranes pvdf is a classical and favorable membrane material due to its extraordinary properties such as good thermal stability outstanding chemical resistance high mechanical strength and easily controlled morphology 2 in addition to these special advantages the strong inherent hydrophobic characteristic and low surface energy of pvdf triggering severe membrane protein fouling sharp flux decline low rejection of contaminates and a change in cut off size have limited its applications in the membrane separation process of aqueous solutions hence it is indispensable to design and prepare low fouling or non fouling pvdf membranes by advanced techniques for practical uses 3 4 it is generally accepted that the hydrophilic modification is an effective applied strategy to reduce the fouling trend of polymeric membranes and therefore enhance their performance during separation process 5 various approaches have been applied to improve the hydrophilicity and antifouling ability of the pvdf membranes including the membrane surface hydrophilic modification blending with hydrophilic polymers or fillers and direct modification of the membrane materials 2 6 introducing of the hydrophilic polymers to the membrane matrix or surface which can be carried out whether directly or indirectly has been proved to be a convenient approach in preparing membranes with better property and performance among these polymers zwitterionic polymers such as polysulfobetaine polyphosphobetaine and polycarboxybetaine with super antifouling properties have received enormous attention from researchers sulfobetaine surfaces can bind a remarkable amount of water molecules to form a free water hydration layer via electrostatically induced hydration thus the strong hydration of sulfobetaine surfaces based on the positive and negative groups with strong hydrophilicity can prevent nonspecific protein adsorption in the film application process 7 8 up to now various methods such as blending of zwitterionic copolymers membrane surface coating with zwitterionic polymers and membrane surface grafting with zwitterionic brushes have been applied to enhance the protein adsorption resistant properties of the hydrophobic membranes 9 12 nevertheless the use of zwitterionic materials in the large scale membrane applications is restricted owing to harsh conditions and multi step reactions of these methods as well as poor dissolutions of zwitterionic materials in the organic solvents 13 incorporation of inorganic nanomaterials such as tio2 14 zno 15 carbon nanotube cnt 16 and graphene oxide go 17 into the polymer membrane matrix to fabricate nanocomposite membranes has been a point of considerable interest over the last decades for it is simple and can be produced at an industrial scale with ease 18 go an atomic thin carbon material can be used as a novel nanomaterial in fabrication of high performance membranes for water separation because of its flexibility in chemical functionalization high surface area and superior chemical stability the main challenge in the membrane application of go nanosheets is its strong tendency to aggregation in the polymer matrix by л л stacking appropriate chemical modification of go is very effective in providing better processing and interaction with other compounds on the other hand functionalization of go provides them with functional groups for enhancing several properties such as charges and specific interactions with water contaminants in order to produce additives with potential applications in the membrane separation process 19 20 one of the most popular strategies to improve the go miscibility with the polymer matrix is grafting of water soluble polymer to from their surface via polymerization techniques 21 zwittterionic modification of nanofillers carried out by grafting of zwitteronic polymers to their surface can overcome the problems such as the agglomeration of the nanofillers in the membrane matrix immiscibility between organic phase and inorganic phase and also insolubility of the zwitterionic materials in the organic solvents until now most research groups have used zwitterionic functionalized nanofillers to improve the biocompatibility of materials 22 23 however only a few papers have reported the synthesis of the zwitterionic functionalized nanofillers for improving the membrane fouling control by the blending method recently he et al 24 prepared zwitterionic sio2 nanoparticles by grafting lysine onto the sio2 nanoparticles surface and blending them with pvdf to prepare an asymmetric ultrafiltration membrane via phase inversion method the results indicated that the zwitterionic nanoparticles could enhance antifouling performance of hydrophobic membranes liu et al 25 also observed a remarkable improvement in the filtration performance and antifouling property of the pvdf composite membrane prepared via blending with tio2 pmma psbma polymethyl methacrylate polysulfobetaine methacrylate nanoparticles as zwitterionic fillers wang et al 26 prepared a pes ultrafiltration membrane blended with hnts mpc halloysite nanotubes 2 methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine to improve the hydrophilicity and antifouling performance of the hybrid membrane to the best of our knowledge the use of polyzwitterionic grafted go has never been reported to modify the asymmetric membranes for water purification applications in this paper poly 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl dimethyl 3 sulfopropyl ammonium hydroxide grafted go go g pmsa containing ammonium and sulfonic acid groups was prepared and used as a new blending additive to prepare go g pmsa pvdf nanocomposite membranes by the phase inversion process the cerium ce iv induced graft polymerization of msa was carried out in the presence of functionalized go as flat macromolecular backbone the effect of the addition of zwitterionic nanosheets on the separation performance and fouling resistant properties of prepared nanocomposite membranes was systematically investigated the nanocomposite membranes structure and properties were characterized using afm fesem edx porosity and water contact angle measurements the main objective of this work was to develop a novel and convenient strategy for fabrication of anti fouling pvdf membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pvdf average mw 145 000 was used as polymer matrix

200 ml then the wet sediments were washed with large amounts of distilled water several times until the ph of the filtrate became neutral after drying the residue in air go was used for further modification 2 3 functionalization of go with aptes go nh2 go 0 5 g was suspended in a 1 1 mixture of ethanol and dmf 50 50 ml by sonication ammonia solution 30 ml was then added into the above

pmsa pvdf membranes were prepared via the phase inversion process the measured amount of nanosheets was well dispersed in dmf solvent using sonication for 30 min and then 18 wt pvdf as the bulk material was dissolved in the above solution at 50 0c followed by further stirring the mixture for 24 h to obtain a homogeneous casting solution after that bubbles were completely removed from the solution it was casted on a glass plate with a constant casting rate using a 200 μm thick casting blade then the glass plate was dipped into a coagulation bath distilled water at 30 0c without any evaporation time after the membrane formation the membranes were washed with fresh distilled water to remove the residual dmf and kept in distilled water for 24 h prior to testing the composition of the casting solutions for all membranes are given in table 1 the percentages of the nanosheets denote the corresponding weight percentages of nanosheets regarding overall concentration of polymer 2 6 characterization to investigate the chemical changes in the structure of go during the modification process ft ir analysis bruker equinox 55 was employed the thermal properties of the modified go were measured by thermogravimetric analysis tga sta 6000 perkin elmer through which the samples 5 mg were heated to 800 0c at a heating rate of 20 0c per minute under nitrogen atmosphere the cross section morphology of the prepared membranes was studied by fesem hitachi s 41600 in which cross cut samples were prepared by fracturing the membranes in liquid nitrogen and a thin layer of gold was coated on the surface of all samples before microscopic analysis fesem zeiss supra 35 v p equipped with an edx system was also utilized to study the composition and chemical element distribution on the surface of the pvdf nanocomposite membrane the surface roughness of the prepared membranes was studied by an afm instrument ara nanoscope full plus iran using the tapping mode in which the sample squares of the membranes approximately 1 cm2 were fixed on a specimen holder before being scanned the hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes was characterized using static contact angle measurements

time m3 s 1 and tmp is the operation pressure 0 7 mpa 2 8 filtration and antifouling performance experiments a homemade dead end stirred cell filtration system see fig 1 was employed to investigate the filtration and antifouling performance of the prepared membranes all membranes were pressurized with di water at 0 7 mpa for 30 min so that a steady flux could be provided moreover prior to the filtration test the sample membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h the feed pressure of 0 7 mpa and ambient temperature were applied to carry out the cyclic filtration experiments consisting of three steps at the first step the pure water filtration through the membrane samples was carried out at the above mentioned conditions the second step included the filtration of bsa solution 1 0 g l 1 in pbs buffer solution ph 7 2 7 4 through the membrane then the membrane was taken out and rinsed in deionized water for 3 h to remove the reversibly adsorbed proteins finally the washed membrane was employed at the third step to study the pure water permeation of the membrane for 1 h the stable flux in each step was defined as jw1 jbsa and jw2 respectively determined by the following eq 3 3 j v a t where j l m 2 h 1 represents the flux v l is the volume of the permeated liquid t h is the operation time of permeation and a is the effective filtration area based on the fluxes flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes was calculated using eq 4 as follows 4 frr j w2 j w1 100 furthermore the rejection of na2so4 and nacl was performed using 1000 ppm feed solution under same conditions via a conductivity meter oakton con 110 for the feed and permeate both the bsa rejection ratio rbsa and salt rejection rnacl and rna2so4 were calculated by the following equation 5 r 1 c permeate c feed 100 where cpermeate mg l 1 and cfeed mg l 1 represent the protein concentration or ion concentration in permeate and feed respectively the protein concentration was analyzed with a uv vis spectroscopy

characteristics of the synthesized go g pmsa the process of zwitterionic modification of go is illustrated in fig 2 firstly the amino terminal silanes were introduced onto both the edge sites and basal planes of go through a silane coupling reaction carried out between the hydroxyl groups provided by go as anchoring points and aptes making it easy to attach polymer chain to the go surface and also improve the chemical stability of go then pmsa was introduced to the surface of go nh2 by surface initiated redox polymerization during the grafting reaction free radical sites were created on the surface of go nh2 by the redox reaction of methylene groups bonded with an amine group on go nh2 with ce iv hno3 finally the radical active sites initiated the graft polymerization of msa vinyl monomers not only the successful synthesis of go nh2 but also the surface initiated redox polymerization of msa from go surface was revealed by ftir and tga analyses the ftir spectra of go go nh2 and go g pmsa are displayed in fig 3 the go spectrum exhibits an intense and broad stretching oh bond absorption at 3400 cm 1 reveling the presence of numerous hydroxyl groups in addition the go spectrum also shows the characteristic peaks at 1730 cm 1 co st 1623 cm 1 cc st 1228 cm 1 co st 1053 cm 1 coc and 868 cm 1 coc after the modification of go with aptes the nh stretching vibration at 3410 cm 1 the nh bending peak at 1616 cm 1 the ch bending peak at 1480 cm 1 and the si o stretching peak at 1100 cm 1 can be observed moreover the presence of ch2 and the ch stretching vibrations at 2854 and 2925 cm 1 verifies successful covalent interactions between aptes and the surface of go compared with the ftir spectrum of go nh2 the strong peak at 1385 cm 1 and the weak peak at 1220 cm 1 are characteristic peaks of so and the peak appearing at 943 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of oso in the ftir spectrum of go g pmsa in addition the broad absorption band between 3680 and 3000 cm 1 assigned to the nh oh stretching vibrations can be also observed these results demonstrated the successful coordination of pmsa onto go through covalent bands 28 30 tga analysis was used to study the thermal properties of the functionalized go the tga thermograms of the samples are shown in fig 4 by which it is demonstrated that the modified go possesses a different thermal decomposition behavior in comparison with pristine go indicating the successful attachment of the modifier molecules on the surface of go pristine go is thermally unstable and show significant weight losses at about 100 0c and 200 0c corresponding to the loss of absorbed water and labile oxygen containing functional groups respectively the small weight loss between 280 0c and 600 0c indicates that the oxygen containing functional groups have all but degraded below 200 0c it is noteworthy that go nh2 exhibited lower weight loss at about 200 0c as compared to pristine go demonstrating the degradation or reduction of some oxygen containing functional groups on go during the organo modification with aptes 31 comparing the tga curves provided by go nh2 and go g pmsa the final char value of the polymer modified go at temperatures higher than 600 c was more than that of amino silane modified go mainly owing to the presence of the grafted polymer chains onto the surface of go the difference between the weight loss for go nh2 and go g pmsa was attributed to the amount of the redox graft polymerization the grafting percentage was calculated as 41 for go g pmsa using the following equation 9 g m 800 m800 m800 100 where m 800 and m800 exhibit the residual weights of go nh2 and go g pmsa respectively at 800 c the ftir and tga results completely demonstrated that go g pmsa was successfully synthesized via surface initiated redox polymerization these obtained nanosheets were applied as a membrane making additive for the modification of pvdf membranes 3 2 morphologies and surface composition of the nanocomposite membranes in order to investigate the effects of the doped go g pmsa on the pvdf membrane morphology cross section sem micrographs of pristine pvdf membrane a go g pmsa pvdf membranes b d and go pvdf membranes e and f were provided with two different resolutions as depicted in fig 5 according to the images all the membranes possessed a typical asymmetric porous structure comprising of three layers a selective and dense skin layer on the top surface a finger like middle layer and a sponger like layer on the bottom surface compared with the pristine pvdf membrane beside the sponger structures with slightly increased pore size some finger like structures with relatively longer and wider voids could also be observed for pvdf nanocomposite membranes a possible reason for this observation can be given on the basis of the surface properties of go and go g pmsa such as the concentration of the active sites and surface functional groups the hydrophilic nanosheet components in the casting solution were capable of accelerating the interpenetration rate between non solvent water and solvent dmf in the casting solution during the phase inversion process contributing to extended porosity bigger cavities finger hole formation as well as changes in the macrovoids structure 32 same behavior was reported by zhang et al 33 and xu et al 20 for a go mwcnt pvdf membrane and a functionalized go pvdf one respectively on the other hand the finger like pores in the structure of the go g pmsa embedded membranes were slightly wider than those of the go embedded membranes the hydrophilic nature of zwitterionic chains on the go g pmsa surface was able to enhance the penetration rate of water molecules into the cast solution during the phase inversion process and therefore led to the formation of larger pore channels 20 fig 6 shows edx spectrum and sem edx elemental mapping micrographs of the m ii sample the high element concentration of nitrogen sulfur and oxygen as antifouling hopping sites were clearly observed demonstrating the successful introduction of go g pmsa onto the surface of the nanocomposite membrane additionally the homogeneous distribution of nitrogen oxygen and sulfur in the micrographs indicated that there were no go g pmsa agglomerations in the membranes matrix therefore zwitterionic modification of go can be considered as a superb rout for attaining ideal nanocomposite membranes for water desalination application ensuring an efficient antifouling performance by the membranes the surface roughness of the pristine and nanocomposite membranes was studied by analyzing the membrane surface topology using afm measurements two and three dimensional afm images of the membranes with different amounts of go g pmsa and go are presented in fig 7 generally the brightest areas in afm images illustrate the highest point of the membrane surface and the dark regions indicate membrane valleys or pores moreover the roughness parameters of the membranes surface obtained in an afm scanning size of 5 μm 5 μm are presented in table 2 the surface roughness parameters are reflected in terms of the average root mean square rms roughness the mean surface roughness sa the mean difference between the highest peaks and the lowest valleys sz and the root mean square of z data sq it is well recognized that roughness parameters influence membranes fouling 34 low surface roughness can increase the fouling resistance ability on the modified membrane surface leading to the enhancement of flux recovery ratio frr 35 as can be seen the surface roughness of the pvdf membrane exhibited an obvious change arising from the addition of nanosheets into the casting solution according to the roughness results the surface roughness of the nanocomposite membranes was lower than that of the pristine pvdf membrane evidently when go g pmsa content increased from 0 to 1 the roughness parameters values decreased and the membrane surface became smoother the results indicated that the proper dispersion of the modified go and so low electrostatic interactions could lead to a lower amount of agglomeration on the membrane however the afm images showed that by increase in the unmodified go content from 0 75 wt to 1 wt the surface roughness also increased the increase in the roughness could be related to the accumulation of unmodified go sheets on the membrane surface in high amount of go 36 it is noteworthy that in the most previous studies by the addition of go to the casting solution the surface of nanocomposite membranes became rougher 32 37 for instance zinadini et al 17 reported that the surface roughness increased when the go content increased from 0 5 wt arising from the accumulation of go on the membrane surface nevertheless because of good modification and therefore good dispersion of go in the membrane matrix nanocomposite membranes possessing smoother surface were achieved even in high concentration of go g pmsa similar observations were achieved by zhao et al 38 and xu et al 20 for isocyanate modified go psf membranes and organosilane modified go pvdf ones respectively 3 3 contact angle pure water flux and porosity of the membranes to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membranes surface static water contact angle and pure water flux pwf of the prepared nanocomposite membranes were measured in general with decrease in the contact angle of water the membrane hydrophilicity enhances it has been well proven that an increase in the hydrophilicity of membranes surface results in the reduction of not only the penetration pressure of water molecules but also the adsorption of pollutants and proteins on the membranes surface as can be seen in fig 8 not only did the unfilled pvdf membrane exhibit the highest water contact angle of 89 but the contact angle also dramatically decreased to 65 by increase in the go g pmsa content in the polymer matrix from 0 to 1 decreasing trend of the static contact angle after the incorporation of hydrophilic go g pmsa was mainly attributed to the introduction of the sulfonic and tertiary amine hydrophilic groups onto the top layer of the nanocomposite membranes able to adsorb large amounts of free water molecules and so form a hydration layer generally to reduce the interface energy during the phase inversion process hydrophilic modified go sheets spontaneously migrates towards the top surface of membranes and lead to a more hydrophilic membrane surface 39 32 this behavior is also clear from the sem mapping data of the m ii sample confirming the presence of functional groups on the nanocomposite membrane surface as depicted in fig 6 additionally the digital photographs of the prepared membranes displayed that the top surface non solvent exposed side in the phase inversion process was darker in comparison to the bottom surface glass side as shown in fig 9 40 no significant decrease in the water contact angle was also observed by the addition of 1 wt unmodified go this phenomenon could occur due to the agglomeration of unmodified go on the membrane surface in high blending ratios triggering the reduction of functional groups on the membrane surface these results were in a good agreement with those obtained from afm analysis as can be seen in fig 8 the water contact angle of the go pvdf nanocomposite membranes was higher than that of the go g pmsa pvdf nanocomposite membranes indicating that the modification of go had been able to improve the wetting ability of go g pmsa pvdf membranes through not only the formation of a hydration layer on the membrane surface but also an excellent dispersion of the modified nanosheets in the membrane matrix the pwf results obtained for the prepared membranes are also represented in fig 8 all the nanocomposite membranes showed higher pwf amount in comparison with the m0 sample pwf increased from 17 1 l m 2 h 1 to 42 9 l m 2 h 1 with the increase in the go g pmsa content from 0 to 1 wt described by the compromise between two factors 1 the addition of go g pmsa to the membrane matrix provided a lower efficient filtration area due to the decrease in the surface roughness with increasing nanosheets content table 2 hence it was expected that the nanocomposite membranes possessed a lower water flux than the nascent pvdf membrane 16 2 the addition of go g pmsa led to an increase in the membrane hydrophilicity fig 8 resulting in a promotion in water permeability herein the second factor has played a prominent role in the determination of the membrane water permeability indeed the hydrophilic properties of go g pmsa improved the membrane surface hydrophilicity enhanced pwf by absorbing water molecules inside the pvdf membrane matrix and thus made it easier for water molecules to pass through the nanocomposite membrane 41 according to fig 8 despite the enhancement in the hydrophilicity of m v it exhibited lower pwf amount in comparison with m iv explained by not only the blockage of some pores but also the reduced pore radius provided by m v induced from the agglomeration in the membrane matrix containing 1 wt unmodified go see table 3 triggering less permeability for the membrane similar behavior has been reported for go pes membranes 39 and hpei go pes ones 42 as presented in table 3 the incorporation of nanosheets into the membrane structure increased the mean pore radius and porosity of the prepared blended membranes it could be attributed to the increase in the solvent and non solvent exchange during the phase inversion process arising from the presence of the hydrophilic go in the polymeric matrix which led to a higher porosity in the membrane this trend of increasing is well matched with the pwf amounts acquired for the membranes fig 8 however a further increase in the doped unmodified go to 1 wt resulted in a less porosity and smaller pore size triggering the flux decline of m v it could be attributed to the delayed phase separation and increased viscosity induced from the agglomeration of the doped go at high concentrations 43 3 4 anti fouling performance of membranes it is known that organic fouling is one of the main problems taking place when a membrane is employed in separation and purification processes hence in this study bsa protein was chosen as a foulant agent to investigate the anti fouling performance of the prepared membranes in order to evaluate the anti protein fouling performance of pvdf nanocomposite membranes in details irreversible fouling ratio reversible fouling ratio total protein fouling and water flux recovery ratio were measured using cyclic filtration tests by pure water and bsa solution according to the results of time dependent fluxes fig 10 all the nanocomposite membranes possessed a higher jw and jbsa compared to m0 arising from the decrease in membrane resistance to water and bsa solution permeation after the incorporation of hydrophilic nanosheets discussed in the former section in addition it can be seen in fig 10 that the fluxes decreased for all the membranes when pure water was replaced by bsa solution in the cell arising from the membrane fouling phenomenon caused by adsorbed protein on the membrane surface nevertheless the decreasing trend of jbsa reduced in the presence of go g pmsa in fact the pure membrane was prone to be fouled because of its hydrophobic nature while hydrophilic go could decrease the membrane fouling for nanocomposite membranes the scheme for the bsa rejection by the nanocomposite membrane containing go g pmsa is illustrated in fig 11 it has been reported that zwitterionic sulfobetaine chains could keep the bsa molecules from contacting the hydrophobic pvdf causing high retention between protein molecules and the membrane surface 12 in the final step the fouled membranes were recovered by being rinsed with distilled water and pure water fluxes were measured again the frr values of various membranes are presented in fig 12 the frr values of the membranes increased from 40 2 for m0 to 95 3 for m iii it is well known that the higher frr values the better anti fouling ability in the membrane filtration the results indicated that the regenerating capability of the go g pmsa pvdf membranes was significantly better than that of the pristine membrane and the go pvdf ones hence the surface roughness of the pvdf membrane decreased as a result of blending membrane matrix with zwitterionic nanosheets preventing not only the adsorption but also the deposition of protein foulants onto the membrane surface 44 the obtained frr trend can also be explained through the results provided by contact angle analysis see fig 12 based on which a hydrophobic surface increases the fouling possibility of the membrane due to the increasing bsa surface interactions while a hydrophilic surface not only takes up some water molecules but also exhibits a strong repulsive force with bsa molecules reversible fouling which can be removed by water washing takes place through the weak adsorption of foulants while in irreversible fouling the foulants are strongly bound to the membrane it was found that the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance of the go g pmsa blended membranes were considerably lower than those of the pristine membrane and go blended membranes as depicted in fig 13 m0 exhibited the highest irreversible fouling amount due to the more hydrophobic adsorption existing between its surface and bsa irreversible fouling was reduced from 59 8 to 4 7 with the addition of the go g pmsa amount from 0 to 1 in fact zwitterionic groups on the modified membranes surface provided antifouling sites which could effectively prevent the pollutants from aggregating on the membrane surface the improved fouling resistance of pvdf nanocomposite membranes with go g pmsa as filler was better than that of other reported nanocomposite membranes using various types of nanofillers see table 4 it was found that the zwitterionic functionalization of go provided a convenient strategy to produce graphene based nanocomposite membranes with high water flux and excellent anti fouling performance 3 5 salt rejection of the membranes to evaluate the salt rejection performance of the prepared membranes nacl and na2so4 rejection was measured under the operating pressure of 0 7 mpa and in a 1000 ppm salt solution as shown in fig 14 the go g pmsa pvdf membranes displayed higher rejection than other prepared membranes despite their relatively larger pore size such a behavior suggested that the rejection was largely influenced by the interactions of salt ions and pmsa chains because the zwitterionic brushes possessed a strong binding affinity to salt ions the modified membranes could efficiently trap the ions by electrostatic interactions between their sulfonate and ammonium groups and salt ions additionally after the addition of electrolyte solution negative and positive ions could penetrate to the collapsed pmsa chains and disrupt the inter and intra chain association of zwitterion chains leading to an extended conformation of sma polymer chains reducing the effective pore size of the membrane 47 4 conclusion experimental results demonstrated that the anti fouling modification of pvdf membranes through the blending process of the anchored zwitterionic additive into the hydrophobic membrane was a convenient strategy to achieve extraordinary antifouling performance and hemocompatibility the anti fouling zwitterionic polymers were successfully grafted to the surface of go through the redox initiated surface graft polymerization method then novel pvdf nanocomposite membranes were developed via the phase inversion process by dispersing go g pmsa into the casting polymeric solution the addition of go g pmsa led to wider finger like pores a larger mean pore size along with a higher porosity edx mapping analysis confirmed the presence of go g pmsa on the membrane surface data provided by water contact angle measurements indicated the increased surface hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite membranes furthermore with 0 75 wt go g pmsa content the pure water flux jw reached the maximum value of 42 9 l m 2 h 1 the salt retention of the blended membranes was also improved by incorporating go g pmsa evaluation of the anti fouling performance of the membranes was also performed by ternary cyclic filtration of pure water and bsa solution the results showed that the go g pmsa pvdf nanocomposite membranes had superior protein anti fouling properties compared to the nascent pvdf and go pvdf membranes indicating that the foulants could be less likely adsorbed onto the go g pmsa embedded membranes due to the hydrophilic and natural characteristics of the zwitterionic chains on the membranes surface together with the high anti fouling properties the acquired results proved that the nanocomposite membranes were promising for high performance membranes in innumerable separation applications acknowledgement authors greatly acknowledge the university of tehran for the financial support of this work 
14290,herein novel anti fouling nanocomposite membranes were developed by the incorporating of zwitterionic modified graphene oxide go g pmsa sheets bearing so3 and nh3 groups into the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf matrix the go g pmsa nanosheets were synthesized by growing of pmsa zwitterionic brushes on go surface by the redox graft polymerization via the graft from strategy causing the twofold advantages of increasing the go dispersibility in the membrane matrix and giving more antifouling property to go the incorporation of the zwitterionic additive in the pvdf membranes significantly improved water affinity and surface hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite membranes comparing to pure pvdf membranes and go pvdf membranes as prepared go g pmsa pvdf membranes showed evident improvement

in addition to these special advantages the strong inherent hydrophobic characteristic and low surface energy of pvdf triggering severe membrane protein fouling sharp flux decline low rejection of contaminates and a change in cut off size have limited its applications in the membrane separation process of aqueous solutions hence it is indispensable to design and prepare low fouling or non fouling pvdf membranes by advanced techniques for practical uses 3 4 it is generally accepted that the hydrophilic modification is an effective applied strategy to reduce the fouling trend of polymeric membranes and therefore enhance their performance during separation process 5 various approaches have been applied to improve the hydrophilicity and antifouling ability of the pvdf membranes including the membrane surface hydrophilic modification blending with hydrophilic polymers or fillers and direct modification of the membrane materials 2 6 introducing of the hydrophilic polymers to the membrane matrix or surface which can be carried out whether directly or indirectly has been proved to be a convenient approach in preparing membranes with better property and performance among these polymers zwitterionic polymers such as polysulfobetaine polyphosphobetaine and polycarboxybetaine with super antifouling properties have received enormous attention from researchers sulfobetaine surfaces can bind a remarkable amount of water molecules to form a free water hydration layer via electrostatically induced hydration thus the strong hydration of sulfobetaine surfaces based on the positive and negative groups with strong hydrophilicity can prevent nonspecific protein adsorption in the film application process 7 8 up to now various methods such as blending of zwitterionic copolymers membrane surface coating with zwitterionic polymers and membrane surface grafting with zwitterionic brushes have been applied to enhance the protein adsorption resistant properties of the hydrophobic membranes 9 12 nevertheless the use of zwitterionic materials in the large scale membrane applications is restricted owing to harsh conditions and multi step reactions of these methods as well as poor dissolutions of zwitterionic materials in the organic solvents 13 incorporation of inorganic nanomaterials such as tio2 14 zno 15 carbon nanotube cnt 16 and graphene oxide go 17 into the polymer membrane matrix to fabricate nanocomposite membranes has been a point of considerable interest over the last decades for it is simple and can be produced at an industrial scale with ease 18 go an atomic thin carbon material can be used as a novel nanomaterial in fabrication of high performance membranes for water separation because of its flexibility in chemical functionalization high surface area and superior chemical stability the main challenge in the membrane application of go nanosheets is its strong tendency to aggregation in the polymer matrix by л л stacking appropriate chemical modification of go is very effective in providing better processing and interaction with other compounds on the other hand functionalization of go provides them with functional groups for enhancing several properties such as charges and specific interactions with water contaminants in order to produce additives with potential applications in the membrane separation process 19 20 one of the most popular strategies to improve the go miscibility with the polymer matrix is grafting of water soluble polymer to from their surface via polymerization techniques 21 zwittterionic modification of nanofillers carried out by grafting of zwitteronic polymers to their surface can overcome the problems such as the agglomeration of the nanofillers in the membrane matrix immiscibility between organic phase and inorganic phase and also insolubility of the zwitterionic materials in the organic solvents until now most research groups have used zwitterionic functionalized nanofillers to improve the biocompatibility of materials 22 23 however only a few papers have reported the synthesis of the zwitterionic functionalized nanofillers for improving the membrane fouling control by the blending method recently he et al 24 prepared zwitterionic sio2 nanoparticles by grafting lysine onto the sio2 nanoparticles surface and blending them with pvdf to prepare an asymmetric ultrafiltration membrane via phase inversion method the results indicated that the zwitterionic nanoparticles could enhance antifouling performance of hydrophobic membranes liu et al 25 also observed a remarkable improvement in the filtration performance and antifouling property of the pvdf composite membrane prepared via blending with tio2 pmma psbma polymethyl methacrylate polysulfobetaine methacrylate nanoparticles as zwitterionic fillers wang et al 26 prepared a pes ultrafiltration membrane blended with hnts mpc halloysite nanotubes 2 methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine to improve the hydrophilicity and antifouling performance of the hybrid membrane to the best of our knowledge the use of polyzwitterionic grafted go has never been reported to modify the asymmetric membranes for water purification applications in this paper poly 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl dimethyl 3 sulfopropyl ammonium hydroxide grafted go go g pmsa containing ammonium and sulfonic acid groups was prepared and used as a new blending additive to prepare go g pmsa pvdf nanocomposite membranes by the phase inversion process the cerium ce iv induced graft polymerization of msa was carried out in the presence of functionalized go as flat macromolecular backbone the effect of the addition of zwitterionic nanosheets on the separation performance and fouling resistant properties of prepared nanocomposite membranes was systematically investigated the nanocomposite membranes structure and properties were characterized using afm fesem edx porosity and water contact angle measurements the main objective

material was dissolved in the above solution at 50 0c followed by further stirring the mixture for 24 h to obtain a homogeneous casting solution after that bubbles were completely removed from the solution it was casted on a glass plate with a constant casting rate using a 200 μm thick casting blade then the glass plate was dipped into a coagulation bath distilled water at 30 0c without any evaporation time after the membrane formation the membranes were washed with fresh distilled water to remove the residual dmf and kept in distilled water for 24 h prior to testing the composition of the casting solutions for all membranes are given in table 1 the percentages of the nanosheets denote the corresponding weight percentages of nanosheets regarding overall concentration of polymer 2 6 characterization to investigate the chemical changes in the structure of go during the modification process ft ir analysis bruker equinox 55 was employed the thermal properties of the modified go were measured by thermogravimetric analysis tga sta 6000 perkin elmer through which the samples 5 mg were heated to 800 0c at a heating rate of 20 0c per minute under nitrogen atmosphere the cross section morphology of the prepared membranes was studied by fesem hitachi s 41600 in which cross cut samples were prepared by fracturing the membranes in liquid nitrogen and a thin layer of gold was coated on the surface of all samples before microscopic analysis fesem zeiss supra 35 v p equipped with an edx system was also utilized to study the composition and chemical element distribution on the surface of the pvdf nanocomposite membrane the surface roughness of the prepared membranes was studied by an afm instrument ara nanoscope full plus iran using the tapping mode in which the sample squares of the membranes approximately 1 cm2 were fixed on a specimen holder before being scanned the hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes was characterized using static contact angle measurements

time m3 s 1 and tmp is the operation pressure 0 7 mpa 2 8 filtration and antifouling performance experiments a homemade dead end stirred cell filtration system see fig 1 was employed to investigate the filtration and antifouling performance of the prepared membranes all membranes were pressurized with di water at 0 7 mpa for 30 min so that a steady flux could be provided moreover prior to the filtration test the sample membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h the feed pressure of 0 7 mpa and ambient temperature were applied to carry out the cyclic filtration experiments consisting of three steps at the first step the pure water filtration through the membrane samples was carried out at the above mentioned conditions the second step included the filtration of bsa solution 1 0 g l 1 in pbs buffer solution ph 7 2 7 4 through the membrane then the membrane was taken out and rinsed in deionized water for 3 h to remove the reversibly adsorbed proteins finally the washed membrane was employed at the third step to study the pure water permeation of the membrane for 1 h the stable flux in each step was defined as jw1 jbsa and jw2 respectively determined by the following eq 3 3 j v a t where j l m 2 h 1 represents the flux v l is the volume of the permeated liquid t h is the operation time of permeation and a is the effective filtration area based on the fluxes flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes was calculated using eq 4 as follows 4 frr j w2 j w1 100 furthermore the rejection of na2so4 and nacl was performed using 1000 ppm feed solution under same conditions via a conductivity meter oakton con 110 for the feed and permeate both the bsa rejection ratio rbsa and salt rejection rnacl and rna2so4 were calculated by the following equation 5 r 1 c permeate c feed 100

characteristics of the synthesized go g pmsa the process of zwitterionic modification of go is illustrated in fig 2 firstly the amino terminal silanes were introduced onto both the edge sites and basal planes of go through a silane coupling reaction carried out between the hydroxyl groups provided by go as anchoring points and aptes making it easy to attach polymer chain to the go surface and also improve the chemical stability of go then pmsa was introduced to the surface of go nh2 by surface initiated redox polymerization during the grafting reaction free radical sites were created on the surface of go nh2 by the redox reaction of methylene groups bonded with an amine group on go nh2 with ce iv hno3 finally the radical active sites initiated the graft polymerization of msa vinyl monomers not only the successful synthesis of go nh2 but also the surface initiated redox polymerization of msa from go surface was revealed by ftir and tga analyses the ftir spectra of go go nh2 and go g pmsa are displayed in fig 3 the go spectrum exhibits an intense and broad stretching oh bond absorption at 3400 cm 1 reveling the presence of numerous hydroxyl groups in addition the go spectrum also shows the characteristic peaks at 1730 cm 1 co st 1623 cm 1 cc st 1228 cm 1 co st 1053 cm 1 coc and 868 cm 1 coc after the modification of go with aptes the nh stretching vibration at 3410 cm 1 the nh bending peak at 1616 cm 1 the ch bending peak at 1480 cm 1 and the si o stretching peak at 1100 cm 1 can be observed moreover the presence of ch2 and the ch stretching vibrations at 2854 and 2925 cm 1 verifies successful covalent interactions between aptes and the surface of go compared with the ftir spectrum of go nh2 the strong peak at 1385 cm 1 and the weak peak at 1220 cm 1 are characteristic peaks of so and the peak appearing at 943 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of oso in the ftir spectrum of go g pmsa in addition the broad absorption band between 3680 and 3000 cm 1 assigned to the nh oh stretching vibrations can be also observed these results demonstrated the successful coordination of pmsa onto go through covalent bands 28 30 tga analysis was used to study the thermal properties of the functionalized go the tga thermograms of the samples are shown in fig 4 by which it is demonstrated that the modified go possesses a different thermal decomposition behavior in comparison with pristine go indicating the successful attachment of the modifier molecules on the surface of go pristine go is thermally unstable and show significant weight losses at about 100 0c and 200 0c corresponding to the loss of absorbed water and labile oxygen containing functional groups respectively the small weight loss between 280 0c and 600 0c indicates that the oxygen containing functional groups have all but degraded below 200 0c it is noteworthy that go nh2 exhibited lower weight loss at about 200 0c as compared to pristine go demonstrating the degradation or reduction of some oxygen containing functional groups on go during the organo modification with aptes 31 comparing the tga curves provided by go nh2 and go g pmsa the final char value of the polymer modified go at temperatures higher than 600 c was more than that of amino silane modified go mainly owing to the presence of the grafted polymer chains onto the surface of go the difference between the weight loss for go nh2 and go g pmsa was attributed to the amount of the redox graft polymerization the grafting percentage was calculated as 41 for go g pmsa using the following equation 9 g m 800 m800 m800 100 where m 800 and m800 exhibit the residual weights of go nh2 and go g pmsa respectively at 800 c the ftir and tga results completely demonstrated that go g pmsa was successfully synthesized via surface initiated redox polymerization these obtained nanosheets were applied as a membrane making additive for the modification of pvdf membranes 3 2 morphologies and surface composition of the nanocomposite membranes in order to investigate the effects of the doped go g pmsa on the pvdf membrane morphology cross section sem micrographs of pristine pvdf membrane a go g pmsa pvdf membranes b d and go pvdf membranes e and f were provided with two different resolutions as depicted in fig 5 according to the images all the membranes possessed a typical asymmetric porous structure comprising of three layers a selective and dense skin layer on the top surface a finger like middle layer and a sponger like layer on the bottom surface compared with the pristine pvdf membrane beside the sponger structures with slightly increased pore size some finger like structures with relatively longer and wider voids could also be observed for pvdf nanocomposite membranes a possible reason for this observation can be given on the basis of the surface properties of go and go g pmsa such as the concentration of the active sites and surface functional groups the hydrophilic nanosheet components in the casting solution were capable of accelerating the interpenetration rate between non solvent water and solvent dmf in the casting solution during the phase inversion process contributing to extended porosity bigger cavities finger hole formation as well as changes in the macrovoids structure 32 same behavior was reported by zhang et al 33 and xu et al 20 for a go mwcnt pvdf membrane and a functionalized go pvdf one respectively on the other hand the finger like pores in the structure of the go g pmsa embedded membranes were slightly wider than those of the go embedded membranes the hydrophilic nature of zwitterionic chains on the go g pmsa surface was able to enhance the penetration rate of water molecules into the cast solution during the phase inversion process and therefore led to the formation of larger pore channels 20 fig 6 shows edx spectrum and sem edx elemental mapping micrographs of the m ii sample the high element concentration of nitrogen sulfur and oxygen as antifouling hopping sites were clearly observed demonstrating the successful introduction of go g pmsa onto the surface of the nanocomposite membrane additionally the homogeneous distribution of nitrogen oxygen and sulfur in the micrographs indicated that there were no go g pmsa agglomerations in the membranes matrix therefore zwitterionic modification of go can be considered as a superb rout for attaining ideal nanocomposite membranes for water desalination application ensuring an efficient antifouling performance by the membranes the surface roughness of the pristine and nanocomposite membranes was studied by analyzing the membrane surface topology using afm measurements two and three dimensional afm images of the membranes with different amounts of go g pmsa and go are presented in fig 7 generally the brightest areas in afm images illustrate the highest point of the membrane surface and the dark regions indicate membrane valleys or pores moreover the roughness parameters of the membranes surface obtained in an afm scanning size of 5 μm 5 μm are presented in table 2 the surface roughness parameters are reflected in terms of the average root mean square rms roughness the mean surface roughness sa the mean difference between the highest peaks and the lowest valleys sz and the root mean square of z data sq it is well recognized that roughness parameters influence membranes fouling 34 low surface roughness can increase the fouling resistance ability on the modified membrane surface leading to the enhancement of flux recovery ratio frr 35 as can be seen the surface roughness of the pvdf membrane exhibited an obvious change arising from the addition of nanosheets into the casting solution according to the roughness results the surface roughness of the nanocomposite membranes was lower than that of the pristine pvdf membrane evidently when go g pmsa content increased from 0 to 1 the roughness parameters values decreased and the membrane surface became smoother the results indicated that the proper dispersion of the modified go and so low electrostatic interactions could lead to a lower amount of agglomeration on the membrane however the afm images showed that by increase in the unmodified go content from 0 75 wt to 1 wt the surface roughness also increased the increase in the roughness could be related to the accumulation of unmodified go sheets on the membrane surface in high amount of go 36 it is noteworthy that in the most previous studies by the addition of go to the casting solution the surface of nanocomposite membranes became rougher 32 37 for instance zinadini et al 17 reported that the surface roughness increased when the go content increased from 0 5 wt arising from the accumulation of go on the membrane surface nevertheless because of good modification and therefore good dispersion of go in the membrane matrix nanocomposite membranes possessing smoother surface were achieved even in high concentration of go g pmsa similar observations were achieved by zhao et al 38 and xu et al 20 for isocyanate modified go psf membranes and organosilane modified go pvdf ones respectively 3 3 contact angle pure water flux and porosity of the membranes to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membranes surface static water contact angle and pure water flux pwf of the prepared nanocomposite membranes were measured in general with decrease in the contact angle of water the membrane hydrophilicity enhances it has been well proven that an increase in the hydrophilicity of membranes surface results in the reduction of not only the penetration pressure of water molecules but also the adsorption of pollutants and proteins on the membranes surface as can be seen in fig 8 not only did the unfilled pvdf membrane exhibit the highest water contact angle of 89 but the contact angle also dramatically decreased to 65 by increase in the go g pmsa content in the polymer matrix from 0 to 1 decreasing trend of the static contact angle after the incorporation of hydrophilic go g pmsa was mainly attributed to the introduction of the sulfonic and tertiary amine hydrophilic groups onto the top layer of the nanocomposite membranes able to adsorb large amounts of free water molecules and so form a hydration layer generally to reduce the interface energy during the phase inversion process hydrophilic modified go sheets spontaneously migrates towards the top surface of membranes and lead to a more hydrophilic membrane surface 39 32 this behavior is also clear from the sem mapping data of the m ii sample confirming the presence of functional groups on the nanocomposite membrane surface as depicted in fig 6 additionally the digital photographs of the prepared membranes displayed that the top surface non solvent exposed side in the phase inversion process was darker in comparison to the bottom surface glass side as shown in fig 9 40 no significant decrease in the water contact angle was also observed by the addition of 1 wt unmodified go this phenomenon could occur due to the agglomeration of unmodified go on the membrane surface in high blending ratios triggering the reduction of functional groups on the membrane surface these results were in a good agreement with those obtained from afm analysis as can be seen in fig 8 the water contact angle of the go pvdf nanocomposite membranes was higher than that of the go g pmsa pvdf nanocomposite membranes indicating that the modification of go had been able to improve the wetting ability of go g pmsa pvdf membranes through not only the formation of a hydration layer on the membrane surface but also an excellent dispersion of the modified nanosheets in the membrane matrix the pwf results obtained for the prepared membranes are also represented in fig 8 all the nanocomposite membranes showed higher pwf amount in comparison with the m0 sample pwf increased from 17 1 l m 2 h 1 to 42 9 l m 2 h 1 with the increase in the go g pmsa content from 0 to 1 wt described by the compromise between two factors 1 the addition of go g pmsa to the membrane matrix provided a lower efficient filtration area due to the decrease in the surface roughness with increasing nanosheets content table 2 hence it was expected that the nanocomposite membranes possessed a lower water flux than the nascent pvdf membrane 16 2 the addition of go g pmsa led to an increase in the membrane hydrophilicity fig 8 resulting in a promotion in water permeability herein the second factor has played a prominent role in the determination of the membrane water permeability indeed the hydrophilic properties of go g pmsa improved the membrane surface hydrophilicity enhanced pwf by absorbing water molecules inside the pvdf membrane matrix and thus made it easier for water molecules to pass through the nanocomposite membrane 41 according to fig 8 despite the enhancement in the hydrophilicity of m v it exhibited lower pwf amount in comparison with m iv explained by not only the blockage of some pores but also the reduced pore radius provided by m v induced from the agglomeration in the membrane matrix containing 1 wt unmodified go see table 3 triggering less permeability for the membrane similar behavior has been reported for go pes membranes 39 and hpei go pes ones 42 as presented in table 3 the incorporation of nanosheets into the membrane structure increased the mean pore radius and porosity of the prepared blended membranes it could be attributed to the increase in the solvent and non solvent exchange during the phase inversion process arising from the presence of the hydrophilic go in the polymeric matrix which led to a higher porosity in the membrane this trend of increasing is well matched with the pwf amounts acquired for the membranes fig 8 however a further increase in the doped unmodified go to 1 wt resulted in a less porosity and smaller pore size triggering the flux decline of m v it could be attributed to the delayed phase separation and increased viscosity induced from the agglomeration of the doped go at high concentrations 43 3 4 anti fouling performance of membranes it is known that organic fouling is one of the main problems taking place when a membrane is employed in separation and purification processes hence in this study bsa protein was chosen as a foulant agent to investigate the anti fouling performance of the prepared membranes in order to evaluate the anti protein fouling performance of pvdf nanocomposite membranes in details irreversible fouling ratio reversible fouling ratio total protein fouling and water flux recovery ratio were measured using cyclic filtration tests by pure water and bsa solution according to the results of time dependent fluxes fig 10 all the nanocomposite membranes possessed a higher jw and jbsa compared to m0 arising from the decrease in membrane resistance to water and bsa solution permeation after the incorporation of hydrophilic nanosheets discussed in the former section in addition it can be seen in fig 10 that the fluxes decreased for all the membranes when pure water was replaced by bsa solution in the cell arising from the membrane fouling phenomenon caused by adsorbed protein on the membrane surface nevertheless the decreasing trend of jbsa reduced in the presence of go g pmsa in fact the pure membrane was prone to be fouled because of its hydrophobic nature while hydrophilic go could decrease the membrane fouling for nanocomposite membranes the scheme for the bsa rejection by the nanocomposite membrane containing go g pmsa is illustrated in fig 11 it has been reported that zwitterionic sulfobetaine chains could keep the bsa molecules from contacting the hydrophobic pvdf causing high retention between protein molecules and the membrane surface 12 in the final step the fouled membranes were recovered by being rinsed with distilled water and pure water fluxes were measured again the frr values of various membranes are presented in fig 12 the frr values of the membranes increased from 40 2 for m0 to 95 3 for m iii it is well known that the higher frr values the better anti fouling ability in the membrane filtration the results indicated that the regenerating capability of the go g pmsa pvdf membranes was significantly better than that of the pristine membrane and the go pvdf ones hence the surface roughness of the pvdf membrane decreased as a result of blending membrane matrix with zwitterionic nanosheets preventing not only the adsorption but also the deposition of protein foulants onto the membrane surface 44 the obtained frr trend can also be explained through the results provided by contact angle analysis see fig 12 based on which a hydrophobic surface increases the fouling possibility of the membrane due to the increasing bsa surface interactions while a hydrophilic surface not only takes up some water molecules but also exhibits a strong repulsive force with bsa molecules reversible fouling which can be removed by water washing takes place through the weak adsorption of foulants while in irreversible fouling the foulants are strongly bound to the membrane it was found that the reversible and irreversible fouling resistance of the go g pmsa blended membranes were considerably lower than those of the pristine membrane and go blended membranes as depicted in fig 13 m0 exhibited the highest irreversible fouling amount due to the more hydrophobic adsorption existing between its surface and bsa irreversible fouling was reduced from 59 8 to 4 7 with the addition of the go g pmsa amount from 0 to 1 in fact zwitterionic groups on the modified membranes surface provided antifouling sites which could effectively prevent the pollutants from aggregating on the membrane surface the improved fouling resistance of pvdf nanocomposite membranes with go g pmsa as filler was better than that of other reported nanocomposite membranes using various types of nanofillers see table 4 it was found that the zwitterionic functionalization of go provided a convenient strategy to produce graphene based nanocomposite membranes with high water flux and excellent anti fouling performance 3 5 salt rejection of the membranes to evaluate the salt rejection performance of the prepared membranes nacl and na2so4 rejection was measured under the operating pressure of 0 7 mpa and in a 1000 ppm salt solution as shown in fig 14 the go g pmsa pvdf membranes displayed higher rejection than other prepared membranes despite their relatively larger pore size such a behavior suggested that the rejection was largely influenced by the interactions of salt ions and pmsa chains because the zwitterionic brushes possessed a strong binding affinity to salt ions the modified membranes could efficiently trap the ions by electrostatic interactions between their sulfonate and ammonium groups and salt ions additionally after the addition of electrolyte solution negative and positive ions could penetrate to the collapsed pmsa chains and disrupt the inter and intra chain association of zwitterion chains leading to an extended conformation of sma polymer chains reducing the effective pore size of the membrane 47 4 conclusion experimental results demonstrated that the anti fouling modification of pvdf membranes through the blending process of the anchored zwitterionic additive into the hydrophobic membrane was a convenient strategy to achieve extraordinary antifouling performance and hemocompatibility the anti fouling zwitterionic polymers were successfully grafted to the surface of go through the redox initiated surface graft polymerization method then novel pvdf nanocomposite membranes were developed via the phase inversion process by dispersing go g pmsa into the casting polymeric solution the addition of go g pmsa led to wider finger like pores a larger mean pore size along with a higher porosity edx mapping analysis confirmed the presence of go g pmsa on the membrane surface data provided by water contact angle measurements indicated the increased surface hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite membranes furthermore with 0 75 wt go g pmsa content the pure water flux jw reached the maximum value of 42 9 l m 2 h 1 the salt retention of the blended membranes was also improved by incorporating go g pmsa evaluation of the anti fouling performance of the membranes was also performed by ternary cyclic filtration of pure water and bsa solution the results showed that the go g pmsa pvdf nanocomposite membranes had superior protein anti fouling properties compared to the nascent pvdf and go pvdf membranes indicating that the foulants could be less likely adsorbed onto the go g pmsa embedded membranes due to the hydrophilic and natural characteristics of the zwitterionic chains on the membranes surface together with the high anti fouling properties the acquired results proved that the nanocomposite membranes were promising for high performance membranes in innumerable separation applications acknowledgement authors greatly acknowledge the university

oxidation photocatalysis zirconium dioxide tungsten trioxide nanoparticles 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps including anti inflammatories antibiotics psychiatric drugs beta blockers skin care products detergents and other less important products are known as emerging contaminants ecs due to their recent detection and identification at trace concentration in the environment 1 2 dxm which is categorized in the therapeutic class of anti inflammatory drugs is one of the most commonly used glucocorticoids for the treatment of various diseases such as multiple myeloma renal impairment nausea and vomiting 3 5 toxicity on living organism in aquatic media is the main disadvantage derived from high dxm consumption and consequently leads to the production of large quantities of wastes 6 7 ribas et al 8 believed that hematological changes and immunotoxic effects are the consequences of diclofenac and dexamethasone exposure guiloski et al 9 studied the effect of dxm on hematological parameters and immune response in the fish species hoplias malabaricus and found that continuous exposure to dxm resulted in alteration of red blood cell count in addition to hematocrit and hemoglobin levels therefore proper removal of dxm from water bodies prevents further issues in the future for both human beings and living creatures many different methods have been employed to treat wastewater containing ppcps such as membrane bioreactor 10 adsorption 11 12 ozone oxidation 13 fenton oxidation 14 anaerobic reactors 15 electrocoagulation 16 biological treatment 17 as well as integration of these techniques 18 20 it is important to note that many studies have stated that conventional wastewater treatment plants are not always potent in the removal of resistant ppcps and consequently leads to the detection of these hazardous compounds in the ground and surface water 21 22 in case of ppcps advanced oxidation processes aops are more promising than

present contribution is the first to investigate the removal of dxm from aquatic media by wo3 and zro2 nanoparticles through photodegradation process to optimize the influential parameters the effect of ph catalyst dosage contact time dxm concentration and radiation source was investigated furthermore mineralization degree of dxm was evaluated by toc analyses to assess the applicability of the process in real situation the effluent of a hospital was taken to examine the dxm degradation under optimum conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical and equipment wo3 purity more than 99 95

tablet c22h29fo5 with the molecular weight of 392 46 g mol and solubility of 89 mg in 1 l of deionized water was obtained from aburaihan pharmaceutical company iran sulfuric acid h2so4 and sodium hydroxide naoh bought from company merk were used to adjust the ph of the solution the double distilled water was used to prepare experimental solutions all the chemicals used during the study were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification the scanning electron microscopy sem was used for inspecting surface morphology and surface topography of wo3 and zro2 sem observation was conducted by vgea tescan lmu high performance liquid chromatography hplc was used to quantify the remained concentration of dxm after each experiment hplc analysis was operated by agilent technologies 1260 infinity model equipped with uv detector at the wavelength of 254 nm a c18 analytical column was used and the flow rate of the mobile phase was 1 ml min to determine the degree of dxm mineralization from actual hospital wastewater total organic carbon toc analysis was conducted by lcsh model 2 2 photocatalyst experiment the photocatalytic activity of wo3 and zro2 under different radiation source for photocatalytic degradation of dxm was studied in a cylindrical batch photoreactor with a total volume of 314 cm3 5 cm d 40 cm h during the study three different lamps namely uvc uva and halogen were used for the activation of catalysts a quartz tube was used in order to prevent direct contact between the solution and lamps after the lamps were switched on and the reaction started at certain time intervals 2 ml of the sample was withdrawn and the concentration of dxm was determined by means of hplc the isocratic mobile phase was acetonitrile water 50 50 v v at a flow rate of 1 ml minute during the experiments the solution was agitated at a constant rate all the experiments were conducted times and the average obtained values are listed in this study the following influencing factors were considered 1 the effect of ph solution was examined by adjusting the ph solution at 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 in each experiment dxm concentration catalyst dosage and contact time were fixed at 25 mg l 500 mg l and 60 min respectively the values of ph were adjusted with 0 1h2so4 or 0 1naoh 2 the effect of catalyst dosage on photodegradation of dxm was examined by varying the wo3 dosage at 100 500 750 1000 1500 mg l and zro2 dosage at 100 500 1500 2000 and 2500 mg l the contact time was fixed at 60 min and the optimum ph was determined in the trial 1 3 to determine the maximum removal efficiency of dxm at optimum ph solution and catalyst dosage removal of dxm at the concentration of 5 10 25 50 mg l was investigated the contact time was fixed at 20 60 100 140 and 180 min 4 after obtaining the optimum conditions uva and halogen lamps were also used as another radiation sources for catalyst activation to figure out the importance of irradiation 5 additionally toc analysis was conducted at optimum conditions to define the degree of mineralization of dxm 6 at the end of the experiment photodegradation of dxm was studied in a real hospital wastewater 2 3 calculation of dxm degradation the rate of dxm degradation was conducted using eq 1 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c o c t c o 100 where c0 mg l is the initial dxm concentration and ct mg l is the residual dxm at time t 3 results and discussion 3 1 sem studies the morphologies and structure of wo3 and zro2 catalysts were examined by sem analysis and the images are shown in fig 1 from the images it can be clearly seen that wo3 nanoparticles are nearly discoidal and has sizes from 23 to 65 nm however sem images for zro2 nanoparticles revealed spherical morphology with sizes from 50 to 60 nm both catalysts present a relatively uniform particle size distribution 3 2 effect of solution ph ph is considered as an important parameter in photocatalysis processes since it greatly influences the surface charge of catalysts and degree of dxm ionization in the solution fig 2 depicts the removal efficiency of dxm by zro2 and wo3 nanoparticles at different initial ph values 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 at a fixed contact time of 60 min during the irradiation the ph was not controlled and it was adjusted before the reaction from the figure the maximum removal efficiency of dxm by zro2 and wo3 was 25 and 19 44 at ph 3 respectively it was found that with the increase in ph from 3 to 10 the removal efficiency of dxm by wo3 and zro2 suppressed to 7 and 8 12 respectively strong acidic conditions ph 3 4 indicated higher removal whereas at ph 9 minimum percentage removal of dxm was achieved the similar phenomenon was found in the previous literature 38 regarding the degradation efficiency in the photocatalytic processes it can be stated that phzpc zero point charge of the catalyst and ph of the dxm are the main factors that directly influence on removal efficiency three different supporting trends for the explanation of this mechanism of ph value were observed on the one hand dxm has a pka value of 1 8 and due to this low pka value it tends to remain on a molecular structure at low ph 37 39 however by increasing the ph value from 3 to 10 dxm is forced to change into an ionic structure effective contact between dxm and oxidation species occurs when dxm is in a molecular state since the absorption rate of dxm on to the surface of the wo3 and zro2 nanoparticles is higher in molecular form phzpc value for zro2 and wo3 was reported to be 7 9 and 5 09 respectively and the surface charge of these catalysts is obtained through the difference between the solution ph and phzpc 40 42 if ph phzpc catalyst has a negative surface charge due to the excessive oh ion and if ph phzpc catalyst has a positive surface charge due to excessive h ions 43 44 at high ph for example 10 both catalyst and dxm carry negative surface charge that may hinder the adsorption behavior and effective interaction between the nanoparticles and the target pollutant such a behavior is due to the electrostatic repulsion forces also when the ph value varies from 3 0 to 9 0 the oxidation potential of oh radicals accordingly altered from 2 70 to 2 34 v which could decrease the dxm degradation efficiency in alkaline solution 45 furthermore it must not be forgotten that at ph around phzpc nanoparticles owns the lowest colloid stability which signifies that these particles may collide and aggregate together resulting in lower surface area and efficiency via photodegradation 45 otherwise at lower ph values catalysts and dxm have positive and negative surface charge respectively so the electrostatic interaction between catalysts zro2 wo3 and dxm leads to high photodegradation efficiency it should be noted that more radical species are generated at low ph value that enhance the degradation efficiency 46 therefore in all the following experiments the ph values for both catalysts were fixed at 3 3 3 effect of catalyst dosage optimum catalyst dosage is an important factor affecting the whole process in the viewpoint of cost effectiveness and sludge production the percentage of dxm removal with various catalysts dosage at a contact time of 60 min and ph 3 is shown in fig 3 the figure indicates that when there is no catalyst almost no dxm is removed from the solution and it can be deduced that uv radiation is not effective alone for dxm removal moreover the results showed that maximum dxm removal efficiency by uv zro2 and uv wo3 happened at 2000 mg l and 750 mg l respectively and with further increase in catalysts dosage removal efficiency decreased or remained unchanged and no significant changes happened thereafter for example with an increase of zro2 and wo3 dosage takes from 100 to 2000 mg l and 100 to 750 mg l the removal efficiency increased from 18 56 to 39 56 and 7 44 to 19 12 respectively however further dosage increase to 2500 and 1500 removal efficiency approximately decreased to 39 36 and 15 36 for zro2 and wo3 respectively interestingly wo3 showed greater removal efficiency reduction compared to zro2 this phenomenon was due to the fact that with the increase in catalyst loading more available active sites are introduced for photon absorption which is beneficial to photodegradation process 47 49 on the contrary the continual increase in catalyst loading leads to a decrease in the rate of photocatalytic reactions this may be due to the fact that excessive amount of catalyst generates high turbidity that causes light dispersion and less light absorption 47 49 so collision accumulation and precipitation of excess amount of catalysts are main factors in deactivation of active molecules hence taking the photodegradation efficiency catalysts amount and financial issues a dose of 1500 mg l for zro2 and 500 mg l for wo3 were used for further experiments 3 4 effect of contact time and dxm initial concentration the effect of initial dxm concentration was investigated with various initial concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 m g l under optimum conditions and the results were presented in fig 4 as shown in the figure the removal efficiency of dxm varied from 31 51 and 8 9 for 50 ppm to 52 52 and 43 for 5 ppm for uv zro2 and uv wo3 respectively with a contact time of 60 min the figure indicates that the removal efficiency of dxm at different time intervals 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 it is observed from the figure that complete removal of 5 mg l dxm by zro2 and wo3 occurred after 140 min and 160 min of reaction time respectively which confirms that zro2 is more time saving process than wo3 furthermore at the same contact time and dxm concentration zro2 showed higher removal efficiency than wo3 for instance at a contact time of 180 min and 50 mg l dxm removal efficiency for zro2 was 75 31 and for wo3 was 29 28 similar results can also be found in other studies 47 it is evident that with the increased dxm concentration the removal efficiency of dxm decreased the presumed reason is that with the increase in dxm concentration in solution the more photocatalyst reaction is required whereas catalyst dose illumination intensity available active site and generated oh radicals are roughly constant 50 moreover during photocatalytic degradation of dxm some unwanted compounds may be produced which are able to coat catalyst and consequently decrease degradation efficiency 51 52 in addition the increase in dxm concentration decrease the path length of the photon entering into the dxm solution and the removal efficiency would reduce to an extent 53 54 similar phenomenon was reported in 46 in the terms of maximum degradation efficiency dxm concentration for further experiments was set at 5 mg l 3 5 effect of radiation source catalyst activation is one of the most important steps that directly influence the dxm removal efficiency from the solution indeed the higher catalyst activation the more reactive species are generated to degrade smx in this study different lamps with distinction wavelength namely uvc 254 nm uva 365 nm halogen more than 380 nm were used to examine the degree of activation of zro2 and wo3 for the removal of dxm under optimum conditions fig 5 indicates the removal efficiency of dxm by zro2 and wo3 with different means of activation from the figure it is apparent that the highest activation of wo3 and zro2 was occurred by halogen and uv lamps in case of zro2 the removal efficiency by uv zro2 blb zro2 and halogen zro2 at a contact time of 180 min was 81 16 75 64 and 69 36 respectively and complete removal of dxm was not reachable by zro2 however for wo3 removal efficiency by uv wo3 blb wo3 and halogen wo3 at a contact time of 180 min 120 min and 80 min was 47 100 and 100 respectively considering the obtained results the noticeable advantage of blb wo3 is its capability to remove dxm completely from the solution at a lower contact time 3 6 investigation the degree of dxm mineralization in order to evaluate the degree of mineralization of dxm during the photocatalytic degradation toc analysis was carried out at 20 60 100 140 and 180 min of reaction the results of the remained toc content versus time are depicted in fig 6 the results showed that at the contact time of 180 min the least remained toc for uv zro2 blb zro2 and halogen zro2 was 15 12 16 2 and 16 6 mg l respectively and also for uv wo3 blb wo3 and halogen wo3 was 15 55 12 36 and 8 65 mg l respectively among the obtained results halogen wo3 showed the highest degree of mineralization residual toc decreased with irradiation time in all experiments and its due to the fact that with increased in irradiation time more oxidant species are generated to mineralize organic carbon 3 7 photocatalytic degradation of dxm from a real hospital effluent the purpose of the following experiments was to survey the performance of zro2 uv zro2 blb zro2 halogen wo3 uv wo3 blb and wo3 halogen to remove dxm from real hospital wastewater rhw cod 958 mg l bod 320 mg l ph 7 3 turbidity 108 5ntu for a contact time of 180 min the rhw used in this study was collected from the effluent of a hospital in tehran iran due to the trace amount of dxm in rhw dxm was manually added to the sample to reach a fixed dxm concentration of 25 mg l in all experiments the obtained results are shown in fig 7 it can be observed from the figure that halogen wo3 revealed higher removal efficiency in comparison to other processes so that removal efficiency reaches 100 after 180 min of time contact the least removal efficiency at a contact time of 180 min was 38 2 by uv wo3 it is important to note that the removal efficiency of dxm from synthetic wastewater was higher than the real hospital effluent for instance at a contact time of 80 min the removal efficiency of dxm by halogen wo3 from synthetic wastewater and real hospital wastewater was 100 and 62 64 respectively it is because of the fact that rhw contains a wide variety of organic matters that are the strong scavenger of the generated oxidant specie 55 57 furthermore the occupation of active sites of the catalysts as well as the light dispersion by wastewater constituents is also effective in disability of photocatalytic process by preventing from electron hole pairs generation 58 59 so the more organic inorganic content in a wastewater less dxm removal will be observed considering all these results halogen wo3 still had better removal efficiency in comparison to other examined process and can be utilized for the treatment of hospital wastewater effluents 3 8 kinetic models in order to understand the dominant reactions regarding dxm degradation kinetics models have been proposed among so many suggested models pseudo first order and pseudo second order have been extensively utilized in countless studies usually the reaction of organic compounds removal accorded with pseudo second order kinetics pseudo first and pseudo second order models are as follows 60 63 2 l n c t c 0 k app t 3 1 c t 1 c 0 k app t where c0 and ct are the concentration of dxm at the first of the reaction mg l and at time t mg l during the reaction respectively and kapp is the reaction rate constant kinetic constants obtained from linear regression are listed in table 2 the validity of the model was evaluated from the correlation coefficients r2 obtained from figs 8 and 9 the higher values of r2 are indicative of applicability of the model for removal pathway the r2 values for pseudo first order model were higher than for pseudo second order it showed that pseudo first order model well describes the experimental data so it can be stated that concentration changes of dxm during illumination time t0 to t1 in photocatalytic degradation is linearly proportional to dxm concentration at time t1 additionally the order of kapp for pseudo first order model was halogen wo3 blb wo3 vu zro2 blb zro2 halogen zro2 uv wo3 so it can be deduced that at the same contact time higher dxm degradation can be obtained by halogen wo3 process than the others 4 the proposed mechanism for dxm degradation the obtained results have shown that halogen wo3 nanoparticles are able to degrade dxm completely after a determined irradiation time the possible mechanism is illustrated in fig 10 through photocatalytic degradation photons with sufficient energy strike wo3 nanoparticles and lead an electron excite from the valance band to the conductance band and thus leave a hole called electron hole pair 64 these electron hole pairs are generated by oxidation and reduction until photons are irradiated generated hydroxyl radicals are the most energetic oxidant for dxm degradation because dxm own various groups of oh which are unstable toward hydroxyl radicals after a series of successive reactions h2o and co2 are produced as final products of mineralization process 37 generated products during dxm degradation are detected by hplc or gc mass and is described in 35 5 conclusion the presence of dxm in the aquatic environment has attracted considerable attention due to its potential health risks for humans and living creatures the present study focused on the removal of dxm by zro2 uv zro2 blb zro2 halogen wo3 uv wo3 blb and wo3 halogen processes and it confirmed that the removal efficiency is strongly dependent on parameters such as ph value catalyst dosage contact time dxm concentration and irradiation source the results showed that a decrease in ph value and dxm concentration led to higher removal efficiency whereas more contact time has better efficiency additionally optimum ph value played an important role in removal efficiency and expenditures in the view of the irradiation source zro2 and wo3 revealed a higher degree of activation by blb and halogen respectively furthermore complete mineralization of dxm was reached during the present study based on the obtained results halogen wo3 is more efficient for dxm removal from hospital wastewater and synthetic wastewater containing dxm as a result halogen wo3 is one of the best alternatives for the efficient removal of dxm from hospital and pharmaceutical wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest acknowledgments the authors also

beta blockers skin care products detergents and other less important products are known as emerging contaminants ecs due to their recent detection and identification at trace concentration in the environment 1 2 dxm which is categorized in the therapeutic class of anti inflammatory drugs is one of the most commonly used glucocorticoids for the treatment of various diseases such as multiple myeloma renal impairment nausea and vomiting 3 5 toxicity on living organism in aquatic media is the main disadvantage derived from high dxm consumption and consequently leads to the production of large quantities of wastes 6 7 ribas et al 8 believed that hematological changes and immunotoxic effects are the consequences of diclofenac and dexamethasone exposure guiloski et al 9 studied the effect of dxm on hematological parameters and immune response in the fish species hoplias malabaricus and found that continuous exposure to dxm resulted in alteration of red blood cell count in addition to hematocrit and hemoglobin levels therefore proper removal of dxm from water bodies prevents further issues in the future for both human beings and living creatures many different methods have been employed to treat wastewater containing ppcps such as membrane bioreactor 10 adsorption 11 12 ozone oxidation 13 fenton oxidation 14 anaerobic reactors 15 electrocoagulation 16 biological treatment 17 as well as integration of these techniques 18 20 it is important to note that many studies have stated that conventional wastewater treatment plants are not always potent in the removal of resistant ppcps and consequently leads to the detection of these hazardous compounds in the ground and surface water 21 22 in case of ppcps advanced oxidation processes aops are more promising than other methods due to the generation of highly reactive oxidizing agents such as hydroxyl radicals that are responsible for rapid degradation of resistant pollutants in the water and wastewater 23 24

to 2500 and 1500 removal efficiency approximately decreased to 39 36 and 15 36 for zro2 and wo3 respectively interestingly wo3 showed greater removal efficiency reduction compared to zro2 this phenomenon was due to the fact that with the increase in catalyst loading more available active sites are introduced for photon absorption which is beneficial to photodegradation process 47 49 on the contrary the continual increase in catalyst loading leads to a decrease in the rate of photocatalytic reactions this may be due to the fact that excessive amount of catalyst generates high turbidity that causes light dispersion and less light absorption 47 49 so collision accumulation and precipitation of excess amount of catalysts are main factors in deactivation of active molecules hence taking the photodegradation efficiency catalysts amount and financial issues a dose of 1500 mg l for zro2 and 500 mg l for wo3 were used for further experiments 3 4 effect of contact time and dxm initial concentration the effect of initial dxm concentration was investigated with various initial concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 m g l under optimum conditions and the results were presented in fig 4 as shown in the figure the removal efficiency of dxm varied from 31 51 and 8 9 for 50 ppm to 52 52 and 43 for 5 ppm for uv zro2 and uv wo3 respectively with a contact time of 60 min the figure indicates that the removal efficiency of dxm at different time intervals 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 it is observed from the figure that complete removal of 5 mg l dxm by zro2 and wo3 occurred after 140 min and 160 min of reaction time respectively which confirms that zro2 is more time saving process than wo3 furthermore at the same contact time and dxm concentration zro2 showed higher removal efficiency than wo3 for instance at a contact time of 180 min and 50 mg l dxm removal efficiency for zro2 was 75 31 and for wo3 was 29 28 similar results can also be found in other studies 47 it is evident that with the increased dxm concentration the removal efficiency of dxm decreased the presumed reason is that with the increase in dxm concentration in solution the more photocatalyst reaction is required whereas catalyst dose illumination intensity available active site and generated oh radicals are roughly constant 50 moreover during photocatalytic degradation of dxm some unwanted compounds may be produced which are able to coat catalyst and consequently decrease degradation efficiency 51 52 in addition the increase in dxm concentration decrease the path length of the photon entering into the dxm solution and the removal efficiency would reduce to an extent 53 54 similar phenomenon was reported in 46 in the terms of maximum degradation efficiency dxm concentration for further experiments was set at 5 mg l 3 5 effect of radiation source catalyst activation is one of the most important steps that directly influence the dxm removal efficiency from the solution indeed the higher catalyst activation the more reactive species are generated to degrade smx in this study different lamps with distinction wavelength namely uvc 254 nm uva 365 nm halogen more than 380 nm were used to examine the degree of activation of zro2 and wo3 for the removal of dxm under optimum conditions fig 5 indicates the removal efficiency of dxm by zro2 and wo3 with different means of activation from the figure it is apparent that the highest activation of wo3 and zro2 was occurred by halogen and uv lamps in case of zro2 the removal efficiency by uv zro2 blb zro2 and halogen zro2 at a contact time of 180 min was 81 16 75 64 and 69 36 respectively and complete removal of dxm was not reachable by zro2 however for wo3 removal efficiency by uv wo3 blb wo3 and halogen wo3 at a contact time of 180 min 120 min and 80 min was 47 100 and 100 respectively considering the obtained results the noticeable advantage of blb wo3 is its capability to remove dxm completely from the solution at a lower contact time 3 6 investigation the degree of dxm mineralization in order to evaluate the degree of mineralization of dxm during the photocatalytic degradation toc analysis was carried out at 20 60 100 140 and 180 min of reaction the results of the remained toc content versus time are depicted in fig 6 the results showed that at the contact time of 180 min the least remained toc for uv zro2 blb zro2 and halogen zro2 was 15 12 16 2 and 16 6 mg l respectively and also for uv wo3 blb wo3 and halogen wo3 was 15 55 12 36 and 8 65 mg l respectively among the obtained results halogen wo3 showed the highest degree of mineralization residual toc decreased with irradiation time in all experiments and its due to the fact that with increased in irradiation time more oxidant species are generated to mineralize organic carbon 3 7 photocatalytic degradation of dxm from a real hospital effluent the purpose of the following experiments was to survey the performance of zro2 uv zro2 blb zro2 halogen wo3 uv wo3 blb and wo3 halogen to remove dxm from real hospital wastewater rhw cod 958 mg l bod 320 mg l ph 7 3 turbidity 108 5ntu for a contact time of 180 min the rhw used in this study was collected from the effluent of a hospital in tehran iran due to the trace amount of dxm in rhw dxm was manually added to the sample to reach a fixed dxm concentration of 25 mg l in all experiments the obtained results are shown in fig 7 it can be observed from the figure that halogen wo3 revealed higher removal efficiency in comparison to other processes so that removal efficiency reaches 100 after 180 min of time contact the least removal efficiency at a contact time of 180 min was 38 2 by uv wo3 it is important to note that the removal efficiency of dxm from synthetic wastewater was higher than the real hospital effluent for instance at a contact time of 80 min the removal efficiency of dxm by halogen wo3 from synthetic wastewater and real hospital wastewater was 100 and 62 64 respectively it is because of the fact that rhw contains a wide variety of organic matters that are the strong scavenger of the generated oxidant specie 55 57 furthermore the occupation of active sites of the catalysts as well as the light dispersion by wastewater constituents is also effective in disability of photocatalytic process by preventing from electron hole pairs generation 58 59 so the more organic inorganic content in a wastewater less dxm removal will be observed considering all these results halogen wo3 still had better removal efficiency in comparison to other examined process and can be utilized for the treatment of hospital wastewater effluents 3 8 kinetic models in order to understand the dominant reactions regarding dxm degradation kinetics models have been proposed among so many suggested models pseudo first order and pseudo second order have been extensively utilized in countless studies usually the reaction of organic compounds removal accorded with pseudo second order kinetics pseudo first and pseudo second order models are as follows 60 63 2 l n c t c 0 k app t 3 1 c t 1 c 0 k app t where c0 and ct are the concentration of dxm at the first of the reaction mg l and at time t mg l during the reaction respectively and kapp is the reaction rate constant kinetic constants obtained from linear regression are listed in table 2 the validity of the model was evaluated from the correlation coefficients r2 obtained from figs 8 and 9 the higher values of r2 are indicative of applicability of the model for removal pathway the r2 values for pseudo first order model were higher than for pseudo second order it showed that pseudo first order model well describes the experimental data so it can be stated that concentration changes of dxm during illumination time t0 to t1 in photocatalytic degradation is linearly proportional to dxm concentration at time t1 additionally the order of kapp for pseudo first order model was halogen wo3 blb wo3 vu zro2 blb zro2 halogen zro2 uv wo3 so it can be deduced that at the same contact time higher dxm degradation can be obtained by halogen wo3 process than the others 4 the proposed mechanism for dxm degradation the obtained results have shown that halogen wo3 nanoparticles are able to degrade dxm completely after a determined irradiation time the possible mechanism is illustrated in fig 10 through photocatalytic degradation photons with sufficient energy strike wo3 nanoparticles and lead an electron excite from the valance band to the conductance band and thus leave a hole called electron hole pair 64 these electron hole pairs are generated by oxidation and reduction until photons are irradiated generated hydroxyl radicals are the most energetic oxidant for dxm degradation because dxm own various groups of oh which are unstable toward hydroxyl radicals after a series of successive reactions h2o and co2 are produced as final products of mineralization process 37 generated products during dxm degradation are detected by hplc or gc mass and is described in 35 5 conclusion the presence of dxm in the aquatic environment has attracted considerable attention due to its potential health risks for humans and living creatures the present study focused on the removal of dxm by zro2 uv zro2 blb zro2 halogen wo3 uv wo3 blb and wo3 halogen processes and it confirmed that the removal efficiency is strongly dependent on parameters such as ph value catalyst dosage contact time dxm concentration and irradiation source the results showed that a decrease in ph value and dxm concentration led to higher removal efficiency whereas more contact time has better efficiency additionally optimum ph value played an important role in removal efficiency and expenditures in the view of the irradiation source zro2 and wo3 revealed a higher degree of activation by blb and halogen respectively furthermore complete mineralization of dxm was reached during the present study based on the obtained results halogen wo3 is more efficient for dxm removal from hospital wastewater and synthetic wastewater containing dxm as a result halogen wo3 is one of the best alternatives for the efficient removal of dxm from hospital and pharmaceutical wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest acknowledgments the authors also

14292,in this study the potential of uv assisted electroperoxone process uv epp was assessed into oxidative degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic 2 4 d herbicide in a batch system the influence of several experimental factors like ph of aqueous media applied current ozone concentration reaction time and initial 2 4 d concentration on the uv epp performance was evaluated using response surface methodology rsm coupling of uv with ozonation and electrolysis showed the better performance into 2 4 d removal compared to their implementation in individual and binary systems the process possesses a good efficiency in a wide range of solution ph under optimal conditions ph 5 6 1 8 mg l min ozone 0 9 a applied current and 112 min reaction over 91 removal of 58 mg l 2 4 d was achieved in addition the complete removal of 2 4 d and 85 cod and 76 toc were obtained by uv epp over 160 min reaction trapping tests verified the presence of both o2 and ho species in the degradation of 2 4 d during uv epp while superoxide radicals have contributed as dominant species the obtained results were fitted to pseudo first order kinetic model with a high correlation coefficient in conclusion uv epp integrated system can be utilized as an effective advanced oxidation process into excellent degradation mineralization of herbicides and refractory or toxic organic compounds keywords optimization photo electroproxone 2 4 d central composite design herbicide degradation 1 introduction nowadays many hazardous and toxic pollutants like pesticides pharmaceutical products personal care products and the other contaminants obtained from industrial activities have been detected in different water resources 1 in recent decades the application of herbicides and chemical fertilizers witnessed a significant growth in order to increase agricultural productions and weed control in agricultural lands 2 in some cases as reported in the literature the amount of pesticides reaches over 500 mg l in agricultural effluents which pose a serious threat to both human health being and environmental resources 3 pesticides are mainly discharged into the soil and water resources via agricultural wastewaters and manufacturing industries among pesticides 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d as a phenoxyacid herbicide has been applied widely in farmland due to some advantages such as cost effectiveness high stability in water low absorption coefficient in soil good function high availability and also a significant increase in agricultural crops 1 some of the undesirable effects of 2 4 d on human and aquatic organisms like acute toxicity neurotoxicity disorders in endocrine have been reported by epa 4 it was recognized as possibly carcinogenic to humans group 2b by international agency for research on cancer iarc 5 it is noticeable that the amounts 70 and 100 μg l have been recommended as maximum permissible concentrations of 2 4 d in drinking water resources by who and epa respectively 6 according to these problems continuous monitoring of these pollutants in water bodies and the urgent attention on developing and using efficient treatment technologies are of great importance over the last few decades the performance of adsorption electrochemical and biological processes have been studied for removal of herbicides from aqueous media however it is noticeable that in the adsorption process only transferring contaminants from one phase to another is occurred which makes it as a non destructive technique 7 8 in case of biological methods some practical problems such as requirement to high treatment times and inefficiency in complete degradation of organic matters have been restricted their application however advanced oxidation processes aops known as one of the most attractive techniques for efficient removal and mineralization of refractory pollutants specially herbicides from aqueous solution due to the presence of reactive oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals 9 11 among aops ozonation process has been introduced as promising advanced technology for degradation of organic substances because of simplicity in application and operation as well as not causing any secondary contaminants 12 however several drawbacks including longer required reaction time and consequently high energy consumption low mineralization rate low oxidation potential of ozone o3 molecules and non effective in degradation of carboxylic acid groups have totally limited the real applications of ozonation process alone 13 14 in order to overcome these restrictions and improving the performance recently o3 has been integrated with some techniques like ultraviolet uv and ultrasonic us irradiations chemical oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide h2o2 persulfate s2o8 2 and peroxymonosulfate hso5 different catalysts and electrochemical 15 16 this approach can accelerate significantly the degradation reaction rates via generation of additional reactive species in the system among these combined systems the integration of ozone and h2o2 namely called peroxone has been extensively applied as an efficient method to enhance the mineralization degree of pollutants in this process some free radicals i e ho and ho2 are produced through reaction between o3 and h2o2 molecules eqs 1 and 2 and subsequently the rate of both oxidation and mineralization reactions increased effectively 17 18 1 2o3 h2o2 2ho 3o2 2 2o3 2h2o2 h2o ho ho2 3o2 however storage and transportation of h2o2 and also its related safety concerns have been reported as most important challenges of application of peroxone process to solve these problems application of electrolysis process would be the best approach since h2o2 can be generated continuously in situ using carbon based electrodes herein oxygen molecules are reduced electrolytically by two electron cathodes to generate h2o2 as described in eq 3 19 in addition the decomposition of o3 molecules can be occurred at the cathode to generate free radicals based on eqs 4 and 5 which accelerate the degradation mineralization efficiency 20 3 o2 2h 2e h2o2 4 o3 e o3 5 o3 h2o ho o2 ho hence the combination of ozonation with electrolysis called electro peroxone process epp can be a cost effective and environmental friendly process due to in situ cathodic h2o2 production from oxygen reduction easy operation and lack of requirement of ph adjustment 21 in the epp a mixture flow of o2 and o3 gas bubbled into epp reactor through passing o2 feed gas via ozone generators afterwards the separated o2 from ozone generator is converted electrochemically into h2o2 and then in situ formed h2o2 reacts with o3 molecules to produce reactive oxidizing species according to eqs 1 and 2 22 in conventional ozonation the bubbled o2 has not influenced on the degradation process of contaminants while plays an important role in in situ cathodic h2o2 production over epp thus this coupling i e installing electrodes in conventional ozonation reactor enhanced substantially the degradation efficiency of pollutants due to the presence of ho e0 2 8 v which are more powerful in oxidizing of all types of organics compared to o3 e0 2 07 v other reactions happen during epp can be explained by the eqs 6 and 7 as follows 23 24 6 2o3 oh ho o2 2o2 7 o3 h2o e ho o2 oh it is worth to mention that higher o3 doses are actually used within the epp over conventional ozonation process which is challenged in terms of cost effectiveness and also energy consumption 22 an efficient approach to reduce o3 dosage and enhancement of process performance is coupling epp with uv light i e photo electro peroxone uv epp herein uv light can play a critical role in improvement of the oxidation efficiency of organic compounds thereby either indirect generation of ho species via reactions with o3 and h2o2 molecules eqs 8 and 9 or direct photo oxidation reaction eqs 10 13 20 8 o3 h2o hv 2ho o2 9 h2o2 hv 2ho 10 c hν c 11 c o 2 c o 2 12 r x h ν r x 13 r o 2 r o 2 for these reasons the objective of this study was development of epp through combination with uv light for efficient degradation of 2 4 d indeed an integration of conventional ozonation electrochemical and photolysis techniques was applied to enhance the degradation mineralization rate of organic matters it expected that coupling these techniques with each other can accelerate significantly the decontamination efficiency due to the synergistic effect and additional production of reactive oxidizing species in the system in this regards the effect of some operational factors including solution ph dosage current direct reaction time and initial 2 4 d concentration was evaluated on the uv epp performance degradation kinetic mineralization degree and quenching studies were also performed under optimal operational conditions furthermore a possible mechanism for the generation of reactive species and the degradation of pollutant during uv epp was supposed 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and reagents 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d c8h6cl2o3 98 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich inc in hplc grade and its characteristics are

obtained from merck co in analytical grade and used as received without further purification cod vials were purchased from laviband deionized water di water was used for preparation of aqueous media 2 2 photo electroproxone process set up all tests of uv epp were conducted in a 500 ml cylindrical plexiglass cell with dimensions of 5 0 cm diameter and 25 cm high all the experiments were carried out in a batch reactor at ambient temperature of 25 2 c different quantities 2 4 d herbicide were added to di water for preparation of stock solution 200 mg l electrochemical cell composed of graphene and titanium electrodes as cathode and the anode respectively with dimensions of 15 2 cm iman gostar inc iran which placed in distance 2 cm from each other an o3 containing o2 gas was bubbled continuously into the reactor via a ceramic diffuser by passing o2 feed gas through ozone generator o180 f dst canada the concentration of o3 in the solution reaction was adjusted by changing the flow rate of the feed o2 both electrodes were connected to a dc power supply p405 adak china to apply electrical current into the reactor a uv c lamp philips with power of 6 w and λ 254 nm was used as a light source which covered by a cylindrical quartz vessel and placed vertically in the middle of the reactor during uv epp the samples were mixed magnetically using a magnetic stirrer to a certain time the reactions of uv epp were begun by simultaneous application of the ozone generator uv lamp and dc power supply fig 1 shows the applied equipment and connections assigned to uv epp at the end of each test aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken from the reactor and then filtered by 0 22 μm syringe filters before injection into high performance liquid chromatography hplc for measuring the quantities of 2 4 d all tests were carried out three times and mean values reported as the final results the degradation percentage of 2 4 d in the uv epp was calculated using the following equation 14 2 4 d removal c 0 c t c 0 100 where co and ct are the initial and residual concentrations of 2 4 d mg l at time t respectively 2 3 effectual factors and process optimization in this work the performance of uv epp into 2 4 d degradation was assessed as a function of initial solution ph o3 and 2 4 d concentrations direct current and reaction time the effect of these operational parameters on the process efficiency and the optimization were performed using central composite design ccd as an approach in response surface methodology rsm by means of design expert 11 0 software the studied operating factors and their levels are illustrated in table 2 according to the ccd design the number of 50 experiments were designed for investigation the influence of the experimental factors on the 2 4 d degradation as given in table 3 after optimization of process trapping degradation kinetic and mineralization degree studies were performed furthermore to determine the synergistic effect a series of comparative tests on individual and combined processes i e uv electrolysis o3 uv electrolysis uv o3 o3 electrolysis and uv o3 electrolysis uv epp were conducted under the same operational conditions according to ccd approach an empirical second order polynomial model for the 2 4 d removal by uv epp was described by eq 15 15 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β i i x i 2 i 1 k 1 j i 1 k β i j x i x j ε where y is a response variable of pollutant removal percentage b0 is the intercept βi βii and βij are respectively the linear quadratic and interaction effect coefficients of studied variables xi and xj are coded experimental levels of the variables k is the number of the independent variables and ε is the residual error the coded values of the variables were obtained using eq 16 for comparison between different factors with different units 16 x i x i x 0 δ x where xi is the coded value of the variable δx is the difference between the high and the median values of the variables xi refers to the actual values of the variables and x0 is the median value of the variable herein analysis of variance anova p and f values were carried out for evaluation of the statistical significance of the fitted models and to find out the interaction between response and the studied factors this issue was also assessed using the correlation coefficients including r2 r2 adj r2 predict 2 4 analytical methods the hplc shimadzu lc 20 equipped with uv vis detector and the column 100 5 c18 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm was applied for measuring the amounts of 2 4 d wavelength uv detection and the temperature of column hold were kept constant at 283 nm and 25 c respectively an aqueous mixture containing phosphate buffer 50 mm and methanol 30 70 volume ratio was used as mobile phase at the flow

reflux was applied for measurement of chemical oxygen demand cod as reported in the standard methods 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 rsm model development and statistical analysis according to the presented responses in table 4 the statistical analysis on obtained results were done to rsm development and determination of optimal conditions for 2 4 d removal by uv epp during anova analysis the fisher variance ratio the f value is an authenticated statistical index for determining how well the factors describe the variation in the mean of data considering this index a high f value and low p value 0 05 is introduced as a significant model statistically on the basis of the fisher s f test design expert offered quadratic model as the best fit model for description of the relationship between the predicted and experimental values the results of the anova test as represented in table 5 showed a high reliability and a very low probability value p model f 0 0001 for the quadratic model compared to the other models which indicates that it can explain properly the coded relationship between the actual data and the predicted values of the responses as observed the values of correlation coefficients i e r2 r2 adj and r2 predict were much greater than those obtained for other models reflecting the high validity and goodness of the model in predicting the responses the value of r2 equal to 0 96 demonstrates that more than 96 of the total variability can be explained by the quadratic model and less than 4 of the experimental data are not descriptive by the model a very good accordance between the values of r2 r2 adj and r2 predict suggests the high prediction ability of the model for new responses 26 the f value of 3308 47 and p value of 0 0001 reveal that the model is appropriate for explaining the relationship between the experimental and predicted response values moreover the values 4 0 for the adequate precision ap ratio of model elucidates an adequate model discrimination 27 the excellent agreement between the predicted and observed data was also verified by depictive the plot of normal probability of the studentized residuals fig 2 a and the actual versus predicted data fig 2b from fig 2 it can be noted that the errors were normally distributed indicating that the model predicted values were fitted well to all the experimental data according to fig 3 the residuals corresponding all runs were scattered randomly around 3 0 implying the excellent correlation with high adequacy between predicted values and the actual experimental data regarding the anova results and quadratic model a polynomial equation assigned to the 2 4 d removal was described in terms of coded factors as follows 17 2 4 d removal 92 06 0 4a 2 75b 5 15c 1 3d 5 05e 0 12ab 0 375ac 0 06ad 0 1875ae 0 375bc 0 19bd 0 19be 0 06cd 0 19ce 6 825a2 3 45b2 3 7c2 1 45d2 2 325e2 this equation shows the positive and negative influences of studied agents on 2 4 d degradation among experimental factors the applied current and solution ph showed the maximum and minimum influence on the response i e 2 4 d removal respectively since the maximum and minimum coefficients belonged to c and a variables in addition a low value of coefficient of variation cv 10 was obtained for quadratic model which confirms the precision of the experiments and model reproducibility 28 as table 4 shows the findings of anova elucidate that the linear effects of all factors were statistically significant furthermore a significant effect was observed for all interaction effects between all studied variables except for ab ad cd and de the lack of fit value was found to be insignificant which is statistically displaying that the correlation between variables and 2 4 d removal is a significant model 3 2 the effect of operating parameters on the removal of 2 4 d over uv epp in epps the solution ph affects the generation of hydrogen peroxide in cathode electrode ionization degree and solubility of ozone h2o2 and 2 4 d forming reactive oxidizing species as well as the kinetics of reactions the interactive effect of solution ph and ozone concentration on decontamination of 2 4 d by uv epp system is displayed in fig 4 a as observed the effect of ph on the process performance was important and the maximum removal efficiency of 2 4 d 93 was occurred at ph value of 6 0 it can be seen that the degradation ratio was increased substantially with increasing solution ph until 6 0 and then decreased sharply when ph value raised to 10 0 in accordance with the literature uv eep showed a better performance in the 2 4 d removal at weak acidic and neutral conditions and low efficiency was observed at alkaline media 23 29 low efficiency at alkaline conditions can be attributed to the self decompose of electro generated h2o2 to water and oxygen molecules 20 it should be noted that the potential oxidation of reactive species is reduced in alkaline media although ho can be produced in the conventional ozonation process via reaction between o3 and ho ions and ho2 eqs 18 and 19 at alkaline environments in the epp formed under this conditions ho2 can scavenge ho species eq 20 and subsequently reduce the degradation efficiency 18 o3 ho ho2 o2 19 ho2 o3 ho o2 o2 20 ho2 ho h2o ho in contrast the acidic conditions are favorable to generate h2o2 as the main source of ho radicals moreover in these media ho radicals can be generated through reaction between the formed ozonized radicals and h ions according to eq 21 30 on the other hands at strong acidic environment ph 2 4 the generation rate of hydroxide ions was decreased because h ions are transformed to hydrogen molecules besides the potential decomposition of ozone molecules to produce ho is very low at acidic conditions from the obtained results it can be concluded that uv epp has a favorable performance at close neutral conditions which can be an advantage from economic and operational aspects 21 2o3 h ho2 ho o2 fig 4 a also exhibits that increasing the ozone concentration accelerates significantly the 2 4 d removal in uv epp the degradation percentages of 2 4 d were improved significantly from 50 to 93 with increasing the ozone dosage from 0 25 to 2 0 mg l min respectively where experimental conditions were set at ph 6 0 0 75 a applied current and 90 min reaction time it is noticeable that the formation of peroxone reagents and consequently the generation rate of free radicals was enhanced at higher concentrations of ozone similar results have also been reported in the literature for studies on the removal of different organics by uv epp 20 21 in addition the production rate of ho can be accelerated via ozone electro reduction at the cathode at higher dosages of ozone 19 at lower ozone concentrations however it is a rate limiting factor for epp and decomposition of h2o2 molecules and generation of reactive species 31 according to fig 4 a the uv epp efficiency decreased at higher ozone dosages 2 0 mg l min implying that the 2 0 mg l min was a sufficient dosage for ozone for efficient degradation of 2 4 d in this system obviously declining the performance at higher ozone concentrations might be originated from quenching of free radicals by ozone leading to suppression of 2 4 d removal over uv epp 32 the simultaneous effects of applied current and ozone concentration on performance of uv epp for 2 4 d removal are presented in fig 4 b accordingly a similar trend with fig 5 a was observed for various concentrations of ozone in interaction with different values of applied current the degradation rate of 2 4 d was increased considerably as applied current raised from 0 25 to 1 0 a and then reduced by using further amounts of applied current these results indicated that an improvement in applied current until a certain amount has a favorable effect on the performance of uv epp in the 2 4 d decontamination which is in good agreement with the reported results in the literature for uv epps 19 20 24 it is noticeable that the more cathodic activation of ozone molecules can be occurred in the reaction mixture by increasing the applied current in the epp furthermore the generation of h2o2 in the solution reaction was improved at higher applied currents resulting in enhancement of peroxone reagents production according to the formed additional ho species in the system 17 21 thus both the production of h2o2 and the activation of ozone were promoted significantly as applied current in the system enhanced however decreasing the removal efficiency at applied current 2 0 a may be alluded to the oxidation of h2o2 molecules at the anode surface and formation of hydroperoxyl species ho2 eqs 22 and 23 with lower redox potential compared to hydroxyl radicals so the reduction of the degradation efficiency of pollutant 24 33 moreover at excessive values of applied current the concentration of h2o2 can be decreased through a side reaction eq 24 at the cathode instead of electro generation reaction of h2o2 18 34 22 h2o2 2h o2 2e 23 h2o2 h ho2 e 24 o2 4e 4h h2o the combined influence of reaction time and applied current on degradation of 2 4 d by uv epp is illustrated in fig 4 c it can be seen that 2 4 d removal efficiency enhanced with an increase in the reaction time this issue can be due to the further generation of free radicals during treatment by the uv epp this trend also observed in 3d plot assigned to the interactive effect of reaction time and initial 2 4 d concentration as shown in fig 5 d indicating the passing the treatment time was favorable to improve the degradation efficiency fig 4 d also exhibits that the removal rate of 2 4 d has an indirect relationship with initial contaminant concentration it was worth to mention that the number of free radicals available to react with pollutant molecules is constant in the system where the operating factors are fixed in solution reaction hence at lower concentrations of 2 4 d the degradation rate is high due to the fact that the sufficient number of reactive species coexisted in the system while the number of free radicals is the rate limiting factor at higher concentrations of 2 4 d 9 35 3 3 optimum operational conditions of 2 4 d removal by uv epp for determination of the optimal dosage of experimental variables of 2 4 d degradation by uv epp design expert software was applied so the intended purpose for the 2 4 d removal efficiency i e response defined as maximum while the studied operational factors were set at in range with this background ph 5 6 1 8 mg l min ozone 0 9 a applied current and 112 min reaction were chosen for the removal of 58 mg l 2 4 d accordingly the maximum removal efficiency was predicted by software found to be 96 4 with significant desirability 1 0 whereas it was obtained 91 25 via experiments this minimal difference for the values of predicted and observed demonstrates the high accuracy and the reliability of ccd approach in rsm for modeling 2 4 d removal over uv epp 3 4 synergist effect between ozonation electrolysis and photolysis herein the role of all used techniques in uv epp into removal of 2 4 d was compared separately and simultaneously under optimal conditions and the related results are depicted in fig 6 results indicated that individual systems i e uv ozonation and electrolysis have a weak performance in removal of 2 4 d this means that uv ozonation and electrolysis processes alone have not sufficient potential in the degradation of organics as can be seen in fig 5 binary processes i e uv o3 uv electrolysis and o3 electrolysis showed a better performance in the removal rate of 2 4 d compared to single systems this observation confirms the synergistic effect between various processes resulting in more generation of reactive oxidizing species and efficient degradation of 2 4 d subsequently however a significant enhancement in the 2 4 d removal efficiency was achieved when all processes were applied simultaneously as ternary system uv o3 electrolysis or uv epp over this process more than 94 of 2 4 d was removed during 112 min reaction which was considerably greater than the other processes these results implied a strong synergistic effect for applied processes in the uv epp which can be associated with more generation of hydrogen peroxide and as well as extra production of free radicals in the system via i photolysis of both h2o2 and o3 molecules and ii electro chemical reduction of molecules at the cathode 21 36 based on the results the synergistic effect of 12 was obtained for applied techniques in uv epp into removal of 2 4 d in conclusion coupling of uv irradiation with epp as an efficient treatment method can provide a satisfactory result in the degradation mineralization of organic matters 3 5 mineralization studies in this work cod and toc were used as indices of mineralization of the removal 2 4 d by uv epp the experiments were conducted at optimized conditions and the results are presented in fig 6 after 160 min treatment by uv epp the removal efficiencies of 100 85 and 76 were achieved for 2 4 d cod and toc respectively these observations elucidated that the uv epp possesses a high mineralization degree in the degradation of 2 4 d herein although 2 4 d was removed completely the mineralization rates were lower than 100 which can be related to the production of persistent organic by products during oxidation reactions which are mostly more resistant towards free oxidizing radicals meanwhile the complete removal of cod and toc by uv epp probably is achievable at more reaction times of treatment table 6 showed the comparison between the performance of uv eep with other aops into removal and mineralization of 2 4 d as observed uv eep showed better performance in both 2 4 d and toc removal compared to other studies therefore it can be concluded that the uv epp was an excellent technique for degradation of 2 4 d under optimum operational parameters so it can be utilized as a promising methods for efficient degradation of organic pollutants 3 6 effect of radical scavengers in uv epp in this step scavenging experiments were performed to identify the reactive oxidizing species which contributed in 2 4 d removal during uv epp for this purpose the effect of some scavenging agents like benzoquinone bq and tert butyl alcohol t buoh was evaluated on the 2 4 d removal by uv epp bq is used widely as a specific scavenger of superoxide radicals o2 and tba used to quench hydroxyl radicals ho the related tests were carried out at optimal conditions in the presence of 20 mm of scavengers based on fig 7 the uv epp efficiency in the removal of 2 4 d declined substantially in the presence of scavenging agents over 120 min reaction the removal efficiency from 94 in the absent of scavengers was decreased significantly to 57 and 66 in the presence of bq and tba respectively these results confirmed that both o2 and ho species involved and played a key role in the degradation of 2 4 d during treatment by uv epp as observed however the inhibitory for bq was higher than tba demonstrating that the o2 radicals were the major oxidizing radicals responsible for 2 4 d degradation compared to ho species 3 7 kinetic of reaction in order to study kinetic modeling the experimental data of removal of 2 4 d by uv epp were described by pseudo first order model under optimized conditions this model can be expressed using the following equation 42 24 ln c0 c kapp t where ct and c0 are the residual and initial pollutant concentrations mg l t is the contact time min and kobs is the rate constant 1 min the values of kobs are in fact the slope of the linear curve of ln ct c0 versus time fig 8 shows the linear pseudo first order kinetic model for the 2 4 d removal by uv epp within 120 min reaction as observed the kinetic of 2 4 d degradation was in good agreement with model since a significant correlation coefficient r2 0 99 obtained between the experimental data and the pseudo first order model under these conditions the apparent rate constant of 2 4 d degradation was found to be 0 0009 min 1 reaction rate constant k obs 4 conclusion this work investigated the performance of 2 4 d herbicide removal via photo electroperoxone process uv epp as an efficient advanced oxidation process the electrochemically and photocatalytic activated h2o2 enhanced the production of ho it showed an excellent performance into removal of 2 4 d 100 cod 85 and toc 76 under optimum conditions during 160 min reaction a strong quenching effect was observed for bq in comparison with tba indication superoxide radicals participated as dominant species in the degradation process of 2 4 d rather than hydroxyl radicals a considerable synergistic effect was achieved between the used approaches in uv epp the experimental results suggest that uv epp as a hybrid advanced oxidation process has a higher efficiency than single systems i e ozonation electrolysis and photolysis according to these results uv epp is a promising and valuable system for implementation in a wide range of environmental clean up applications owing to high degradation mineralization efficiency into organics and synergistic effect between applied techniques acknowledgment this study was

14292,in this study the potential of uv assisted electroperoxone process uv epp was assessed into oxidative degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic 2 4 d herbicide in a batch system the influence of several experimental factors like ph of aqueous media applied current ozone concentration reaction time and initial 2 4 d concentration on the uv epp performance was evaluated using response surface methodology rsm coupling of uv with ozonation and electrolysis showed the better performance into 2 4 d removal compared to their implementation in individual and binary systems the process possesses a good efficiency in a wide range of solution ph under optimal conditions ph 5 6 1 8 mg l min ozone 0 9 a applied current and 112 min reaction over 91 removal of 58 mg l 2 4 d was achieved in addition the complete removal of 2 4 d and 85 cod and 76 toc were obtained by uv epp over 160 min reaction trapping tests verified the presence of both o2 and ho species in the degradation of 2 4 d during uv epp while superoxide radicals have contributed as dominant species the obtained results were fitted to pseudo first order kinetic model with a high correlation coefficient in conclusion uv epp integrated system can be utilized as an effective advanced oxidation process into excellent degradation mineralization of herbicides and refractory or toxic organic compounds keywords optimization photo electroproxone 2 4 d central composite design herbicide degradation 1 introduction nowadays many hazardous and toxic pollutants like pesticides pharmaceutical products personal care products and the other contaminants obtained from industrial activities have been detected in different water resources 1 in recent decades the application of herbicides and chemical fertilizers witnessed a significant growth in order to increase agricultural productions and weed control in agricultural lands 2 in some cases as reported in the literature the amount of pesticides reaches over 500 mg l in agricultural effluents which pose a serious threat to both human health being and environmental resources 3 pesticides are mainly discharged into the soil and water resources via agricultural wastewaters and manufacturing industries among pesticides 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d as a phenoxyacid herbicide has been applied widely in farmland due to some advantages such as cost effectiveness high stability in water low absorption coefficient in soil good function high availability and also a significant increase in agricultural crops 1 some of the undesirable effects of 2 4 d on human and aquatic organisms like acute toxicity neurotoxicity disorders in endocrine have been reported by epa 4 it was recognized as possibly carcinogenic to humans group 2b by international agency for research on cancer iarc 5 it is noticeable that the amounts 70 and 100 μg l have been recommended as maximum permissible concentrations of 2 4 d in drinking water resources by who and epa respectively 6 according to these problems continuous monitoring of these pollutants in water bodies and the urgent attention on developing and using efficient treatment technologies are of great importance over the last few decades the performance of adsorption electrochemical and biological processes have been studied for removal of herbicides from aqueous media however it is noticeable that in the adsorption process only transferring contaminants from one phase to another is occurred which makes it as a non destructive technique 7 8 in case of biological methods some practical problems such as requirement to high treatment times and inefficiency in complete degradation of organic matters have been restricted their application however advanced oxidation processes aops known as one of the most attractive techniques for efficient removal and mineralization of refractory pollutants specially herbicides from aqueous solution due to the presence of reactive oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radicals 9 11 among aops ozonation process has been introduced as promising advanced technology for degradation of organic substances because of simplicity in application and operation as well as not causing any secondary contaminants 12 however several drawbacks including longer required reaction time and consequently high energy consumption low mineralization rate low oxidation potential of ozone o3 molecules and non effective in degradation of carboxylic acid groups have totally limited the real applications of ozonation process alone 13 14 in order to overcome these restrictions and improving the performance recently o3 has been integrated with some techniques like ultraviolet uv and ultrasonic us irradiations chemical oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide h2o2 persulfate s2o8 2 and peroxymonosulfate hso5 different catalysts and electrochemical 15 16 this approach can accelerate significantly the degradation reaction rates via generation of additional reactive species in the system among these combined systems the integration of ozone and h2o2 namely called peroxone has been extensively applied as an efficient method to enhance the mineralization degree of pollutants in this process some free radicals i e ho and ho2 are produced through reaction between o3 and h2o2 molecules eqs 1 and 2 and subsequently the rate of both oxidation and mineralization reactions increased effectively 17 18 1 2o3 h2o2 2ho 3o2 2 2o3 2h2o2 h2o ho ho2 3o2 however storage and transportation of h2o2 and also its related safety concerns have been reported as most important challenges of application of peroxone process to solve these problems application of electrolysis process would be the best approach since h2o2 can be generated continuously in situ using carbon based electrodes herein oxygen molecules are reduced electrolytically by two electron cathodes to generate h2o2 as described in eq 3 19 in addition the decomposition of o3 molecules can be occurred at the cathode to generate free radicals based on eqs 4 and 5 which accelerate the degradation mineralization efficiency 20 3 o2 2h 2e h2o2 4 o3 e o3 5 o3 h2o ho o2 ho hence the combination of ozonation with electrolysis called electro peroxone process epp can be a cost effective and environmental friendly process due to in situ cathodic h2o2 production from oxygen reduction easy operation and lack of requirement of ph adjustment 21 in the epp a mixture flow of o2 and o3 gas bubbled into epp reactor through passing o2 feed gas via ozone generators afterwards the separated o2 from ozone generator is converted electrochemically into h2o2 and then in situ formed h2o2 reacts with o3 molecules to produce reactive oxidizing species according to eqs 1 and 2 22 in conventional ozonation the bubbled o2 has not influenced on the degradation process of contaminants while plays an important role in in situ cathodic h2o2 production over epp thus this coupling i e installing electrodes in conventional ozonation reactor enhanced substantially the degradation efficiency of pollutants due to the presence of ho e0 2 8 v which are more powerful in oxidizing of all types of organics compared to o3 e0 2 07 v other reactions happen during epp can be explained by the eqs 6 and 7 as follows 23 24 6 2o3 oh ho o2 2o2 7 o3 h2o e ho o2 oh it is worth to mention that higher o3 doses are actually used within the epp over conventional ozonation process which is challenged in terms of cost effectiveness and also energy consumption 22 an efficient approach to reduce o3 dosage and enhancement of process performance is coupling epp with uv light i e photo electro peroxone uv epp herein uv light can play a critical role in improvement of the oxidation efficiency of organic compounds thereby either indirect generation of ho species via reactions with o3 and h2o2 molecules eqs 8 and 9 or direct photo oxidation reaction eqs 10 13 20 8 o3 h2o hv 2ho o2 9 h2o2 hv 2ho 10 c hν c 11 c o 2 c o 2 12 r x h ν r x 13 r o 2 r o 2 for these reasons the objective of this study was development of epp through combination with uv light for efficient degradation of 2 4 d indeed an integration of conventional ozonation electrochemical and photolysis techniques was applied to enhance the degradation mineralization rate of organic matters it expected that coupling these techniques with each other can accelerate significantly the decontamination efficiency due to the synergistic effect and additional production of reactive oxidizing species in the system in this regards the effect of some operational factors including solution ph dosage current direct reaction time and initial 2 4 d concentration was evaluated on the uv epp performance degradation kinetic mineralization degree and quenching studies were also performed under optimal operational conditions furthermore a possible mechanism for the generation of reactive species and the degradation of pollutant during uv epp was supposed 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and reagents 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d c8h6cl2o3 98 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich inc in hplc grade and its characteristics are

obtained from merck co in analytical grade and used as received without further purification cod vials were purchased from laviband deionized water di water was used for preparation of aqueous media 2 2 photo electroproxone process set up all tests of uv epp were conducted in a 500 ml cylindrical plexiglass cell with dimensions of 5 0 cm diameter and 25 cm high all the experiments were carried out in a batch reactor at ambient temperature of 25 2 c different quantities 2 4 d herbicide were added to di water for preparation of stock solution 200 mg l electrochemical cell composed of graphene and titanium electrodes as cathode and the anode respectively with dimensions of 15 2 cm iman gostar inc iran which placed in distance 2 cm from each other an o3 containing o2 gas was bubbled continuously into the reactor via a ceramic diffuser by passing o2 feed gas through ozone generator o180 f dst canada the concentration of o3 in the solution reaction was adjusted by changing the flow rate of the feed o2 both electrodes were connected to a dc power supply p405 adak china to apply electrical current into the reactor a uv c lamp philips with power of 6 w and λ 254 nm was used as a light source which covered by a cylindrical quartz vessel and placed vertically in the middle of the reactor during uv epp the samples were mixed magnetically using a magnetic stirrer to a certain time the reactions of uv epp were begun by simultaneous application of the ozone generator uv lamp and dc power supply fig 1 shows the applied equipment and connections assigned to uv epp at the end of each test aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken from the reactor and then filtered by 0 22 μm syringe filters before injection into high performance liquid chromatography hplc for measuring the quantities of 2 4 d all tests were carried out three times and mean values reported as the final results the degradation percentage of 2 4 d in the uv epp was calculated using the following equation 14 2 4 d removal c 0 c t c 0 100 where co and ct are the initial and residual concentrations of 2 4 d mg l at time t respectively 2 3 effectual factors and process optimization in this work the performance of uv epp into 2 4 d degradation was assessed as a function of initial solution ph o3 and 2 4 d concentrations direct current and reaction time the effect of these operational parameters on the process efficiency and the optimization were performed using central composite design ccd as an approach in response surface methodology rsm by means of design expert 11 0 software the studied operating factors and their levels are illustrated in table 2 according to the ccd design the number of 50 experiments were designed for investigation the influence of the experimental factors on the 2 4 d degradation as given in table 3 after optimization of process trapping degradation kinetic and mineralization degree studies were performed furthermore to determine the synergistic effect a series of comparative tests on individual and combined processes i e uv electrolysis o3 uv electrolysis uv o3 o3 electrolysis and uv o3 electrolysis uv epp were conducted under the same operational conditions according to ccd approach an empirical second order polynomial model for the 2 4 d removal by uv epp was described by eq 15 15 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k β i i x i 2 i 1 k 1 j i 1 k β i j x i x j ε where y is a response variable of pollutant removal percentage b0 is the intercept βi βii and βij are respectively the linear quadratic and interaction effect coefficients of studied variables xi and xj are coded experimental levels of the variables k is the number of the independent variables and ε is the residual error the coded values of the variables were obtained using eq 16 for comparison between different factors with different units 16 x i x i x 0 δ x where xi is the coded value of the variable δx is the difference between the high and the median values of the variables xi refers to the actual values of the variables and x0 is the median value of the variable herein analysis of variance anova p and f values were carried out for evaluation of the statistical significance of the fitted models and to find out the interaction between response and the studied factors this issue was also assessed using the correlation coefficients including r2 r2 adj r2 predict 2 4 analytical methods the hplc shimadzu lc 20 equipped with uv vis detector and the column 100 5 c18 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm was applied for measuring the amounts of 2 4 d wavelength uv detection and the temperature of column hold were kept constant at 283 nm and 25 c respectively an aqueous mixture containing phosphate buffer 50 mm and methanol 30 70 volume ratio was used as mobile phase at the flow rate of 1 5 ml min in order to measure the concentrations of total organic carbon toc the samples were analyzed by a toc analyzer model multi c n 3100 analytikjena titrimetric approach 5220 c closed reflux was applied for measurement of chemical oxygen demand cod as reported in the standard methods 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 rsm model development and statistical analysis according to the presented responses in table 4 the statistical analysis on obtained results were done to rsm development and determination of optimal conditions for 2 4 d removal by uv epp during anova analysis the fisher variance ratio the f value is an authenticated statistical index for determining how well the factors describe the variation in the mean of data considering this index a high f value and low p value 0 05 is introduced as a significant model statistically on the basis of the fisher s f test design expert offered quadratic model as the best fit model for description of the relationship between the predicted and experimental values the results of the anova test as represented in table 5 showed a high reliability and a very low probability value p model f 0 0001 for the quadratic model compared to the other models which indicates that it can explain properly the coded relationship between the actual data and the predicted values of the responses as observed the values of correlation coefficients i e r2 r2 adj and r2 predict were much greater than those obtained for other models reflecting the high validity and goodness of the model in predicting the responses the value of r2 equal to 0 96 demonstrates that more than 96 of the total variability can be explained by the quadratic model and less than 4 of the experimental data are not descriptive by the model a very good accordance between the values of r2 r2 adj and r2 predict suggests the high prediction ability of the model for new responses 26 the f value of 3308 47 and p value of 0 0001 reveal that the model is appropriate for explaining the relationship between the experimental and predicted response values moreover the values 4 0 for the adequate precision ap ratio of model elucidates an adequate model discrimination 27 the excellent agreement between the predicted and observed data was also verified by depictive the plot of normal probability of the studentized residuals fig 2 a and the actual versus predicted data fig 2b from fig 2 it can be noted that the errors were normally distributed indicating that the model predicted values were fitted well to all the experimental data according to fig 3 the residuals corresponding all runs were scattered randomly around 3 0 implying the excellent correlation with high adequacy between predicted values and the actual experimental data regarding the anova results and quadratic model a polynomial equation assigned to the 2 4 d removal was described in terms of coded factors as follows 17 2 4 d removal 92 06 0 4a 2 75b 5 15c 1 3d 5 05e 0 12ab 0 375ac 0 06ad 0 1875ae 0 375bc 0 19bd 0 19be 0 06cd 0 19ce 6 825a2 3 45b2 3 7c2 1 45d2 2 325e2 this equation shows the positive and negative influences of studied agents on 2 4 d degradation among experimental factors the applied current and solution ph showed the maximum and minimum influence on the response i e 2 4 d removal respectively since the maximum and minimum coefficients belonged to c and a variables in addition a low value of coefficient of variation cv 10 was obtained for quadratic model which confirms the precision of the experiments and model reproducibility 28 as table 4 shows the findings of anova elucidate that the linear effects of all factors were statistically significant furthermore a significant effect was observed for all interaction effects between all studied variables except for ab ad cd and de the lack of fit value was found to be insignificant which is statistically displaying that the correlation between variables and 2 4 d removal is a significant model 3 2 the effect of operating parameters on the removal of 2 4 d over uv epp in epps the solution ph affects the generation of hydrogen peroxide in cathode electrode ionization degree and solubility of ozone h2o2 and 2 4 d forming reactive oxidizing species as well as the kinetics of reactions the interactive effect of solution ph and ozone concentration on decontamination of 2 4 d by uv epp system is displayed in fig 4 a as observed the effect of ph on the process performance was important and the maximum removal efficiency of 2 4 d 93 was occurred at ph value of 6 0 it can be seen that the degradation ratio was increased substantially with increasing solution ph until 6 0 and then decreased sharply when ph value raised to 10 0 in accordance with the literature uv eep showed a better performance in the 2 4 d removal at weak acidic and neutral conditions and low efficiency was observed at alkaline media 23 29 low efficiency at alkaline conditions can be attributed to the self decompose of electro generated h2o2 to water and oxygen molecules 20 it should be noted that the potential oxidation of reactive species is reduced in alkaline media although ho can be produced in the conventional ozonation process via reaction between o3 and ho ions and ho2 eqs 18 and 19 at alkaline environments in the epp formed under this conditions ho2 can scavenge ho species eq 20 and subsequently reduce the degradation efficiency 18 o3 ho ho2 o2 19 ho2 o3 ho o2 o2 20 ho2 ho h2o ho in contrast the acidic conditions are favorable to generate h2o2 as the main source of ho radicals moreover in these media ho radicals can be generated through reaction between the formed ozonized radicals and h ions according to eq 21 30 on the other hands at strong acidic environment ph 2 4 the generation rate of hydroxide ions was decreased because h ions are transformed to hydrogen molecules besides the potential decomposition of ozone molecules to produce ho is very low at acidic conditions from the obtained results it can be concluded that uv epp has a favorable performance at close neutral conditions which can be an advantage from economic and operational aspects 21 2o3 h ho2 ho o2 fig 4 a also exhibits that increasing the ozone concentration accelerates significantly the 2 4 d removal in uv epp the degradation percentages of 2 4 d were improved significantly from 50 to 93 with increasing the ozone dosage from 0 25 to 2 0 mg l min respectively where experimental conditions were set at ph 6 0 0 75 a applied current and 90 min reaction time it is noticeable that the formation of peroxone reagents and consequently the generation rate of free radicals was enhanced at higher concentrations of ozone similar results have also been reported in the literature for studies on the removal of different organics by uv epp 20 21 in addition the production rate of ho can be accelerated via ozone electro reduction at the cathode at higher dosages of ozone 19 at lower ozone concentrations however it is a rate limiting factor for epp and decomposition of h2o2 molecules and generation of reactive species 31 according to fig 4 a the uv epp efficiency decreased at higher ozone dosages 2 0 mg l min implying that the 2 0 mg l min was a sufficient dosage for ozone for efficient degradation of 2 4 d in this system obviously declining the performance at higher ozone concentrations might be originated from quenching of free radicals by ozone leading to suppression of 2 4 d removal over uv epp 32 the simultaneous effects of applied current and ozone concentration on performance of uv epp for 2 4 d removal are presented in fig 4 b accordingly a similar trend with fig 5 a was observed for various concentrations of ozone in interaction with different values of applied current the degradation rate of 2 4 d was increased considerably as applied current raised from 0 25 to 1 0 a and then reduced by using further amounts of applied current these results indicated that an improvement in applied current until a certain amount has a favorable effect on the performance of uv epp in the 2 4 d decontamination which is in good agreement with the reported results in the literature for uv epps 19 20 24 it is noticeable that the more cathodic activation of ozone molecules can be occurred in the reaction mixture by increasing the applied current in the epp furthermore the generation of h2o2 in the solution reaction was improved at higher applied currents resulting in enhancement of peroxone reagents production according to the formed additional ho species in the system 17 21 thus both the production of h2o2 and the activation of ozone were promoted significantly as applied current in the system enhanced however decreasing the removal efficiency at applied current 2 0 a may be alluded to the oxidation of h2o2 molecules at the anode surface and formation of hydroperoxyl species ho2 eqs 22 and 23 with lower redox potential compared to hydroxyl radicals so the reduction of the degradation efficiency of pollutant 24 33 moreover at excessive values of applied current the concentration of h2o2 can be decreased through a side reaction eq 24 at the cathode instead of electro generation reaction of h2o2 18 34 22 h2o2 2h o2 2e 23 h2o2 h ho2 e 24 o2 4e 4h h2o the combined influence of reaction time and applied current on degradation of 2 4 d by uv epp is illustrated in fig 4 c it can be seen that 2 4 d removal efficiency enhanced with an increase in the reaction time this issue can be due to the further generation of free radicals during treatment by the uv epp this trend also observed in 3d plot assigned to the interactive effect of reaction time and initial 2 4 d concentration as shown in fig 5 d indicating the passing the treatment time was favorable to improve the degradation efficiency fig 4 d also exhibits that the removal rate of 2 4 d has an indirect relationship with initial contaminant concentration it was worth to mention that the number of free radicals available to react with pollutant molecules is constant in the system where the operating factors are fixed in solution reaction hence at lower concentrations of 2 4 d the degradation rate is high due to the fact that the sufficient number of reactive species coexisted in the system while the number of free radicals is the rate limiting factor at higher concentrations of 2 4 d 9 35 3 3 optimum operational conditions of 2 4 d removal by uv epp for determination of the optimal dosage of experimental variables of 2 4 d degradation by uv epp design expert software was applied so the intended purpose for the 2 4 d removal efficiency i e response defined as maximum while the studied operational factors were set at in range with this background ph 5 6 1 8 mg l min ozone 0 9 a applied current and 112 min reaction were chosen for the removal of 58 mg l 2 4 d accordingly the maximum removal efficiency was predicted by software found to be 96 4 with significant desirability 1 0 whereas it was obtained 91 25 via experiments this minimal difference for the values of predicted and observed demonstrates the high accuracy and the reliability of ccd approach in rsm for modeling 2 4 d removal over uv epp 3 4 synergist effect between ozonation electrolysis and photolysis herein the role of all used techniques in uv epp into removal of 2 4 d was compared separately and simultaneously under optimal conditions and the related results are depicted in fig 6 results indicated that individual systems i e uv ozonation and electrolysis have a weak performance in removal of 2 4 d this means that uv ozonation and electrolysis processes alone have not sufficient potential in the degradation of organics as can be seen in fig 5 binary processes i e uv o3 uv electrolysis and o3 electrolysis showed a better performance in the removal rate of 2 4 d compared to single systems this observation confirms the synergistic effect between various processes resulting in more generation of reactive oxidizing species and efficient degradation of 2 4 d subsequently however a significant enhancement in the 2 4 d removal efficiency was achieved when all processes were applied simultaneously as ternary system uv o3 electrolysis or uv epp over this process more than 94 of 2 4 d was removed during 112 min reaction which was considerably greater than the other processes these results implied a strong synergistic effect for applied processes in the uv epp which can be associated with more generation of hydrogen peroxide and as well as extra production of free radicals in the system via i photolysis of both h2o2 and o3 molecules and ii electro chemical reduction of molecules at the cathode 21 36 based on the results the synergistic effect of 12 was obtained for applied techniques in uv epp into removal of 2 4 d in conclusion coupling of uv irradiation with epp as an efficient treatment method can provide a satisfactory result in the degradation mineralization of organic matters 3 5 mineralization studies in this work cod and toc were used as indices of mineralization of the removal 2 4 d by uv epp the experiments were conducted at optimized conditions and the results are presented in fig 6 after 160 min treatment by uv epp the removal efficiencies of 100 85 and 76 were achieved for 2 4 d cod and toc respectively these observations elucidated that the uv epp possesses a high mineralization degree in the degradation of 2 4 d herein although 2 4 d was removed completely the mineralization rates were lower than 100 which can be related to the production of persistent organic by products during oxidation reactions which are mostly more resistant towards free oxidizing radicals meanwhile the complete removal of cod and toc by uv epp probably is achievable at more reaction times of treatment table 6 showed the comparison between the performance of uv eep with other aops into removal and mineralization of 2 4 d as observed uv eep showed better performance in both 2 4 d and toc removal compared to other studies therefore it can be concluded that the uv epp was an excellent technique for degradation of 2 4 d under optimum operational parameters so it can be utilized as a promising methods for efficient degradation of organic pollutants 3 6 effect of radical scavengers in uv epp in this step scavenging experiments were performed to identify the reactive oxidizing species which contributed in 2 4 d removal during uv epp for this purpose the effect of some scavenging agents like benzoquinone bq and tert butyl alcohol t buoh was evaluated on the 2 4 d removal by uv epp bq is used widely as a specific scavenger of superoxide radicals o2 and tba used to quench hydroxyl radicals ho the related tests were carried out at optimal conditions in the presence of 20 mm of scavengers based on fig 7 the uv epp efficiency in the removal of 2 4 d declined substantially in the presence of scavenging agents over 120 min reaction the removal efficiency from 94 in the absent of scavengers was decreased significantly to 57 and 66 in the presence of bq and tba respectively these results confirmed that both o2 and ho species involved and played a key role in the degradation of 2 4 d during treatment by uv epp as observed however the inhibitory for bq was higher than tba demonstrating that the o2 radicals were the major oxidizing radicals responsible for 2 4 d degradation compared to ho species 3 7 kinetic of reaction in order to study kinetic modeling the experimental data of removal of 2 4 d by uv epp were described by pseudo first order model under optimized conditions this model can be expressed using the following equation 42 24 ln c0 c kapp t where ct and c0 are the residual and initial pollutant concentrations mg l t is the contact time min and kobs is the rate constant 1 min the values of kobs are in fact the slope of the linear curve of ln ct c0 versus time fig 8 shows the linear pseudo first order kinetic model for the 2 4 d removal by uv epp within 120 min reaction as observed the kinetic of 2 4 d degradation was in good agreement with model since a significant correlation coefficient r2 0 99 obtained between the experimental data and the pseudo first order model under these conditions the apparent rate constant of 2 4 d degradation was found to be 0 0009 min 1 reaction rate constant k obs 4 conclusion this work investigated the performance of 2 4 d herbicide removal via photo electroperoxone process uv epp as an

14293,this study evaluated the performance of an inverse fluidized bed ifb bioreactor with anerobic biomass immobilized onto kaldness k1 media as the biosupport material for selenite removal and recovery as selenium nanoparticle from waste stream the effect of different process parameter and nutrient supplement on selenium removal was first studied in a batch system using serum bottles the results revealed that among the different nitrogen substrates ammonium bicarbonate was most suitable whereas lactate was found to be the preferred carbon substrate with 98 selenite removal efficiency and 90 cod removal later studies with the continuously operated ifb bioreactor operated at different hydraulic retention time hrt and different influent selenite concentrations revealed an efficient removal of selenite at 24 h hrt and 1 0 mm of influent se iv furthermore selenium nanoparticles formed at the bottom of the bioreactor were successfully recovered with a recovery efficiency in the range 35 58 with a maximum recovery obtained at 1 0 mm selenite concentration and 24 h hrt the extracellular produced selenium nanoparticles were found to be spherical in shape with 90 150 nm in size fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy confirmed the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps as capping agent on the outer surface of se nanoparticles keywords biological selenite reduction inverse fluidized bed bioreactor selenium nanoparticle wastewater treatment anaerobic microbial consortium 1 introduction selenium se is an essential trace element with extensive role in industries as well as in human health and it presents in four oxidation states i e se6 selenate se4 selenite se0 elemental se and se2 selenide 1 2 other less common species of se are selenoamino acids cystein and methionine as well as volatile methylated compounds including dimethyl selenide dimethyl diselenide and dimethyl selenone 3 4 in general se oxyanions i e selenate seo4 2 and selenite seo3 2 have high water solubility and are well known for its potential toxicity towards living beings even at low concentrations 5 the primary apprehension regarding se pollution is that it bioaccumulates which leads to biomagnification and has potential disastrous effect on aquatic ecosystems 6 on the contrary elemental se se0 is highly insoluble in water and it exhibits the least toxic effect among the different forms 7 the natural source of se is due to weathering of seleniferous soils and rocks whereas anthropogenic sources of se pollution include mining refinement of metals flue gases and other industrial activities 8 9 compared with the natural sources anthropogenic activities greatly contribute to se pollution in the environment as large quantities of se containing wastewater associated with it are released into the environment thereby causing serious pollution problem se containing wastewaters are generally treated by physicochemical and biological methods physicochemical methods are effective but high cost high energy consumption need for disposal of by products and solid liquid separation problem are some drawbacks of these methods 10 11 in order to minimize and overcome the limitations of physicochemical methods biological methods have gained importance in the recent times 12 13 biological selenium removal involves selenium reducing bacteria serb which reduce se4 se6 present in wastewater to se0 by oxidizing carbon substrate and use the produced energy for its growth and maintenance 3 biological selenium removal methods are highly promising due to low cost of operation high treatment efficiency and suitability for low concentration of effluent as well as for its sustainable and environment friendly approach 1 14 dissimilatory reduction of selenium oxyanions supports the anaerobic respiration of a number of microorganisms which utilizes selenium as a terminal electron acceptor conversion of soluble selenate and selenite to nanoparticle of elemental selenium greatly reduces the toxicity and bioavailability of selenium thereby contributing to bioremediation and production of selenium nanospheres for various useful applications 7 applications of such nanoparticle of selenium includes its use as semiconductors with antimicrobial coating 15 for light emitting diodes and solar cells as well as for biological imaging 16 18 and heavy metal adsorption 19 thus microbial synthesis of selenium nanoparticles coupled to selenium wastewater treatment is both industrially attractive and economically viable however an important concern related to the biological treatment of se oxyanions is the generation of colloidal se0 nanoparticle that should be collected before discharging treated effluent into the environment different types of bioreactor systems have been tested for selenium removal and precipitation of biogenic se0 including continuously stirred tank reactor cstr 20 packed bed reactor pbr 21 up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor 22 membrane biofilm bioreactor mbr 23 however recovery could not be achieved using these reactors because elemental se0 precipitate partly onto the biomass therefore a solid liquid separation step is often needed in the downstream of such bioreactor systems but without escalating the cost of operation in this context a promising bioreactor configuration for selenate selenite reduction and recovery in a single unit is the inverse fluidized bed ifb reactor containing low density floatable biosupport material which is fluidized downward in this reactor system biofilm develops over the biosupport material and it remains at the top of the reactor whereas the precipitates formed get separated from the biomass due to fluidization and settle at the bottom thereby enabling an easy recovery of the bioprecipitates 24 25 villa gomez et al 26 reported a high removal and recovery of heavy metals by sulfate reduction using an ifb reactor however ifb reactor has not been reported thus far for selenite removal and recovery as nanoparticles different types of biosupport materials were previously reported for their use in ifb system such as polystyrene beads 26 sponge cubes 27 waste lignocellulosic materials 28 etc compared with these materials kaldness k1 biosupport material which is often used in moving bed biofilm reactor offers a high surface area and high biomass retention capabilities hence this study is primarily focused on continuous se removal and recovery in a single stage process using an ifb reactor the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt and inlet se iv concentrations on continuous se removal and recovery were studied batch experiments were performed in order to investigate the effect of various process parameters viz different carbon and nitrogen sources ph temperature cod selenite and c n ratios on selenite removal detailed characterization of the se nanoparticle was further carried out in order to gain insight into the mechanism of nanoparticle formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 effect of nutrient and process parameters on selenite reduction batch experiments were performed using glass serum bottles of 120 ml capacity each containing 50 ml mineral salt medium msm with 10 v v of anaerobic biomass as inoculum the anaerobic biomass obtained from a large scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating combined industrial and domestic effluent located in kavoor mangalore karnataka india and composition of nutrient media used for biomass growth were described in an earlier work 29 in order to study the effect of different carbon sources on se removal glucose sodium lactate ethanol acetate and succinate equivalent to 1 g l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod were considered the medium ph was adjusted to 7 and serum bottles were incubated at 30 c for 5 days in a shaking incubator set at 150 rpm samples were collected after every 24 h and centrifuged at 16 000 g for 15 min and concentration of selenite and cod in the supernatant were determined as mentioned in section 2 4 similarly the effect of different nitrogen sources on se removal was examined using ammomium chloride ammonium nitrate ammonium bicarbonate and urea for this experiment sodium lactate was used as the carbon source based on the results of the previous experiments in order to study the effect of ph and temperature on selenite reduction experiments were performed by varying the medium ph and temperature one variable at a time in the range 3 10 and 25 45 c respectively effect of different cod se ratio 0 5 1 1 5 1 7 2 3 6 on se4 removal was studied at a fixed initial selenite concentration of 1 mm and by varying the concentration of sodium lactate measured in terms of cod similar experiments were performed to examine the effect of different c n ratio 0 1 1 5 7 10 and 16 on selenite removal by the anaerobic sludge biomass 2 2 continuous experiments 2 2 1 experimental setup ifb bioreactor used in this study was constructed using an acrylic cylinder of diameter 0 055 m and height 0 61 m with a conical bottom and a total volume of 1 4 l the working volume of the bioreactor was 1 l fig 1 shows a schematic of the reactor setup the flow distributor and gas outlet were provided on top of the reactor the influent wastewater was supplied by using a peristaltic pump connected to the influent tank of the reactor the flowrate was maintained in such a way that the expansion of the bed was not more than 50 of the reactor volume the reactor was connected to an equalizer to maintain a constant liquid level in the reactor which as well served as a secondary settler from which se precipitates from the reactor were recovered the bioreactor was operated at an ambient room temperature 27 2 ⁰c with kaldness k1 as the biosupport material this biosupport has been extensively studied for various wastewater treatment systems and it is most commonly used in moving bed biofilm reactors 30 31 in order to obtain a high pollutant removal without crowding the reactor 30 v v of the bioreactor was filled with the kaldness carrier according to villa gomez et al 26 2 2 2 se iv removal and recovery as se 0 nanoparticle for initial biofilm formation onto the carrier material and startup of the reactor it was inoculated with 100 ml of anaerobic sludge biomass and supplied with mineral salt media msm and sodium lactate 1 0 g l 1 as the carbon source following this initial startup phase of 30 days synthetic wastewater containing se iv along with msm and sodium lactate was fed into the bioreactor table 1 depicts the different operating conditions followed for studying the continuous selenite removal using the ifb bioreactor the experiments were performed in two phases i and ii to study the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt and inlet selenite concentration on selenite removal in phase i the hrt was varied from 48 to 12 h whereas the inlet selenite concentration was kept constant at 0 1 mm in the second phase the influent selenite concentration was increased to 0 5 1 0 2 5 mm and finally to 5 mm with a fixed hrt of 24 h which showed the best selenite reduction efficiency in the previous phase the temperature of ifb was not controlled and operated at an ambient temperature of 27 c which is close to the optimum temperature observed from the earlier batch study during the experiments samples were withdrawn from the bioreactor outlet at regular time interval each sample was analyzed thrice and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation selenite removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 1 s e l e n i t e r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c i c 0 c i 100 where ci and co are the concentration of selenite in mm in the inlet and outlet streams respectively of the reactor elemental selenium collected from the bottom of the reactor and equalizer during each operating condition were used to calculate the se recovery efficiency a provision for opening and withdrawing the settled selenium nanoparticles during the bioreactor operation was made at the bottom of the bioreactor similarly for selenium nanoparticle recovery from the equalizer top lid was opened and the settled content was poured out without disturbing the bioreactor operation the se recovery in the ifb reactor was defined as follows 2 s e l e n i u m r e c o v e r y e f f i c i e n c y s t s b s e q s t 100 where seq is selenium precipitate mg in the equalizer sb is selenium precipitate mg in sample from the bottom of the reactor and st is total selenium mg fed to the reactor 2 3 characterization of selenium nanoparticles characterization of the bioprecipitates formed due to selenite reduction in this study was carried out using different techniques including fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy field emission transmission electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fetem eds field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and x ray diffraction xrd for ftir analysis samples were centrifuged at 16 000 g for 15 min the pellet and supernatant obtained were dried and analyzed using a ftir spectroscope ir affinity 1 shimadzu japan the nanoparticle precipitates were observed under xrd rigaku ttrax iii japan to evaluate its crystallinity for fetem jeol jem2100 japan analysis combined with eds the precipitates obtained was fixed onto a copper grid coated with carbon to determine the shape and size of nanoparticles the precipitates were dried overnight at 30 c fixed on an adhesive tape covered metallic grid and gold coated using a sputter coater following which the precipitates were examined using fesem zeiss sigma germany 2 4 analytical methods for se4 analysis a spectrophotometry based method was used as described by mal et al 32 for cod and nitrogen measurements spectrophotometric method was used 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nutrient and process parameters on selenite reduction 3 1 1 effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on selenite reduction fig 2 shows the effect of different carbon sources on selenite reduction and cod removal efficiency by the anaerobic sludge biomass among the five carbon sources tested maximum selenite reduction efficiency of 96 and 98 was obtained with glucose and sodium lactate respectively the reduction efficiency was less with the other carbon sources fig 2a high selenite reduction efficiency in this study is attributed to the activity of serb present in the biomass however the poor efficiency obtained using the carbon sources other than glucose and sodium lactate is due to inability of the serb to completely oxidize these carbon sources as revealed by corresponding low cod removal values shown fig 2b from previous studies it is well understood that selenite reduction is thermodynamically more favorable with glucose than with sodium lactate 34 however in this study the results are comparable for these two carbon sources owing to low cost of sodium lactate compared with glucose sodium lactate was chosen as the carbon substrate for further experiments the effect of different nitrogen sources on selenite reduction efficiency by anaerobic sludge biomass is illustrated in fig 3 among the four nitrogen sources examined ammonium nitrate resulted in high se removal i e 98 along with 86 nitrogen utilization a very low efficiency of both selenite reduction and nitrogen utilization was obtained using urea as the nitrogen source fig 3 serb are known to uptake nitrogen in the form of ammonium 35 and hence ammonium nitrate proved to be the most preferred nitrogen source for selenite reduction in this study moreover compared to other forms of nitrogen such as nitrate or nitrite ammonia is utilized by the bacterium without any additional cellular energy 36 3 1 2 effect of medium ph and temperature on selenite reduction the effect of ph and temperature on selenite reduction was investigated to determine their optimum values fig 4 it could be seen that the selenite reduction was significantly affected by the ph of the nutrient medium the optimum ph is thus found to be 7 the optimum temperature for selenite reduction was found to be 30 c and above which the selenite removal efficiency reduced in general it is reported that at a ph value below 7 selenite is present as the single charged anion hseo3 and above ph 7 it is present as the double charged anion seo3 2 37 this study indicates the form at neutral ph i e selenite in the form seo3 2 is preferred for se reduction by anaerobic sludge biomass on the other hand biological activity such as enzymatic and biochemical pathways require an optimal temperature range and above which it does not function properly furthermore the biomass showed significant growth and substrate utilization at an ambient temperature moreover selenium nanoparticle formation by such bacteria is mostly reported at ambient temperature and neutral ph range 3 3 1 3 effect of different cod se ratio and c n ratio on selenite reduction fig 5 shows the effect of different cod se ratio on se reduction and cod removal by anaerobic biomass the selenite removal efficiencies were 74 6 85 3 98 7 90 6 78 63 66 4 for cod se ratios of 0 5 1 1 5 1 7 2 and 3 6 respectively the maximum selenite removal efficiency was found at cod se ratio of 1 5 which is close to the stoichiometric optimum ratio of 1 further increase in the cod se ratio lowered the selenite removal efficiency however in case of cod removal it gradually decreased with an increase in cod se ratio from 0 5 to 3 6 i e from 96 22 to 44 6 fig 5b the following stoichiometric equations can thus be used to describe selenite reduction with lactate as the carbon source and electron donor 38 3 c2h4ohcoo seo3 2 h ch3coo se0 hco3 h2o as seen from the afore mentioned reaction the stoichiometric cod se ratio for selenite reduction is 1 however lactate is used not only for selenite reduction but also for biomass growth cellular maintenance and for other fermentative products therefore the actual cod available for selenite reduction is less than the initial cod provided to the system hence the optimum cod se ratio 1 5 obtained in this study is very likely moreover a reduced selenite removal efficiency above cod se ratio of 1 7 is attributed to diversion of electron flux towards selenium assimilation than dissimilation at a high organic load on the other hand incomplete utilization of lactate at a high cod concentration led to the gradual decrease of cod removal efficiency from 96 22 to 44 6 with an increase in cod se ratio from 0 5 to 3 6 from these results it could be surmised that a high organic load caused substrate inhibition on the biomass activity affecting both selenite reduction and cod removal fig 6 shows the effect of different c n ratios on selenite reduction and cod removal efficiency by the anaerobic sludge biomass using ammonium nitrate as the nitrogen source the selenite removal efficiency was more than 80 for all the c n ratios used however maximum selenite reduction of 97 8 was achieved at an optimum c n ratio of 1 0 on the other hand the cod removal decreased with increase in c n ratio and a maximum cod removal of 90 45 was obtained at a low c n ratio of 0 1 the regulation of nitrogen uptake is an essential mechanism for microorganisms to cope up with resource imbalances and it is independent of the carbon metabolism 39 a c n ratio in the range 10 16 was reported to be optimum for sulphate reducing bacteria srb activity a maximum ratio in the range 45 1 120 1 is suggested to avoid any significant reduction in srb activity due to growth limitations under a nitrogen stressed environment excess nitrogen 600 mg l 1 is shown to be toxic to srb community 40 however the result can vary depending on the type of microorganism and substrates used similar mechanism is applicable for serb because of the analogous properties of selenium and sulfur in this study c n ratio of 1 was found to be optimum for both selenite and cod removal which is in agreement with the literature that nutrient removal efficiency is maximum at a moderate c n ratio 41 3 1 4 effect of initial selenite concentration on selenite reduction the effect of initial selenite concentration on selenite removal is depicted in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that more than 95 selenite reduction could be obtained for an initial selenite concentration in the range 0 1 0 5 mm and above which the selenite removal decreased in case of 50 mm initial se concentration the selenite removal value was very low 53 4 similar to the selenite removal efficiency values cod removal also lowered with an enhancement in the initial selenite concentration however the cod removal was maintained at 70 even upto 10 mm concentration a possible reason for these results could be attributed to the low tolerance of the anaerobic biomass towards selenium 3 7 wang et al 42 reported that se reducing bacteria are able to tolerate selenite upto 1 mm concentration and beyond which it exerts some sort of toxic effect on its metabolism 3 2 continuous selenite removal and recovery using ifb reactor 3 2 1 selenite and cod removal fig 8 a shows the selenite removal profile along with influent and effluent selenite concentration using the continuously operated ifb reactor during the first phase of the reactor operation to examine the effect of hrt the influent selenite and lactate concentrations were kept constant at 0 1 mm and 10 mm respectively at 48 h hrt a very high selenite removal efficiency of 99 was achieved within 7 days after the hrt was reduced to 36 and 24 h a slight drop in the selenite removal efficiency was observed but it remained at more than 90 the reactor performance significantly deteriorated at 12 h hrt and the selenite removal value reached to 70 it is reported that hrt plays a very important role in bioreactor performance and an optimum hrt value depends upon the bioreactor used nature of microorganism and type of pollutant being handled in the system 43 most of the previous bioreactor studies for continuous selenite removal have reported different optimum hrt values for selenite removal for example cheng et al 44 reported a very high selenite removal rate for an influent selenite concentration of 10 mm at 5 d hrt using an ifb bioreactor the authors observed that long hrt enabled microorganisms present in the reactor to achieve a high removal efficiency of selenite from synthetic wastewater in the present study selenite removal was comparable at both 36 and 24 h hrt the poor performance at low hrt of 12 h is probably due to insufficient contact time available for anaerobic sludge biomass to efficiently utilize cod for selenite reduction 35 another key parameter which is influenced by hrt is mixing due to biosupport bed expansion bed expansion is directly proportional to liquid flowrate into the bioreactor which greatly influences the ifb performance and at a low hrt value the bed expansion will be maximum from the experimental results a high agitation and bed expansion was not found to be favourable for achieving a high selenite reduction efficiency and its recovery as nanoparticle hence in order to understand the governing mechanism detailed hydrodynamic study of the system needs to be performed during the phase ii of continuous bioreactor operation influent selenite concentration was varied from 0 1 mm to 5 mm whereas the cod concentration and hrt were kept constant at 1 g l 1 and 24 h respectively from fig 8a a gradual decrease in the selenite removal efficiency is observed with an increase in the influent selenite concentration the steady state selenite removal values were 94 89 3 and 81 for 0 5 1 and 2 5 mm concentration of selenite respectively however the selenite removal value dropped to 74 at 5 mm influent selenite concentration the low selenite removal at high influent selenite concentration is mainly attributed to low cod to selenite ratio as observed previously in the batch experiments in general se concentration in waste streams does not exceed 0 1 mm however in order to check the efficiency of the ifb system to handle even high selenite loading conditions it was operated at an influent selenite loading condition more than 0 1 mm these high selenite concentration serves as shock loading condition for the bioreactor and the results demonstrated that even at such high loading condition the ifb system performed satisfactorily these results are similar to the previously reported studies on continuous selenite removal using different bioreactor systems for example cheng et al 44 achieved more than 94 selenate removal using floating spherical particles in a 4 l ifb bioreactor in another study soda et al 22 evaluated continuous selenite removal using two different bioreactors and found that uasb type reactor was more efficient than suspended type anaerobic bioreactor in treating selenite containing wastewater with more than 90 selenite removal achieved within 15 days of the continuous reactor operation immobilization of anaerobic biomass over biosupport material creates a layered structured biofilm which is more resilient than suspended biomass towards toxic effects of pollutants even at a high loading condition in the bioreactor the use of kaldness k1 as biosupport material in this study is known for providing a large surface area for biofilm growth in comparison with other biosupport materials commonly used thus selenite removal in this study was very high even at a high influent selenite loading condition fig 8b shows the cod removal profile during the continuous selenite removal experiments with the ifb reactor it can be seen from the results that cod removal was very high 80 during both the phases of bioreactor operation except in case of 12 h hrt the cod removal efficiency dropped to around 72 an increase in the selenite concentration showed minimal effect on the cod removal efficiency except for a high influent selenite concentration of 5 mm however the best cod removal value was obtained at low influent selenite concentration and a high hrt value cod removal in such bioreactor systems is indicative of activity of the microorganisms present the high cod utilization efficiency in the ifb reactor indicates that selenite did not inhibit the activity of anaerobic biomass particularly at low selenite loading condition during the initial phase of continuous bioreactor operation fig 9 compares selenite removal rate with different selenite loading rates applied in the ifb bioreactor straight line passing through the origin of the figure indicates a stable performance of the bioreactor and deviation from the line is undesirable for the process it is clear that the removal rate was stable for the low selenite loading rates below 0 04 mm h at loading rates 0 104 and 0 208 mm h the selenite removal rate was low indicating that selenite loading rates beyond these values are detrimental to the reactor performance however there are several ways for improving the bioreactor performance at high selenite loading conditions such as by increasing the hrt or cod loading which provides sufficient contact time and optimum cod se ratio respectively for the microorganisms present the high selenite and cod removal efficiency is mainly attributed to the attached biomass on the biosupport materials in the ifb system however the presence and role played by suspended biomass in the system cannot be ruled out which needs further analysis to confirm 3 2 2 selenium recovery in ifb bioreactor the gradual change in colour of ifb reactor liquid inside from black to red clearly indicated the accumulation of elemental selenium as nanoparticles in the bioreactor due to the ifb reactor configuration the selenium nanoparticles formed inside the reactor settled at the bottom of the bioreactor and the equalizer for an easy recovery the percentage of se recovered during each operating condition with the ifb bioreactor system are presented in table 1 during phase i of bioreactor operation at 48 36 and 24 h hrt 41 45 of se loaded into the bioreactor was recovered as se nanoparticle however at 12 h hrt the se recovery was around 35 which is mainly due to poor selenite removal under this condition during phase ii the percentage se recovery increased with an increase in the influent selenite concentration in the reactor and it was in the range 50 60 the recovery efficiency obtained in this study correlates well with previous literature for example villa gomez et al 26 reported 40 60 recovery for different heavy metals using sulfidogenic ifb bioreactor system the variation in se recovery with hrt is due to the fact that a prolonged residence time allows agglomeration of small sized se nanoparticles into larger ones with a quicker sedimentation rate to the bottom of the reactor on the contrary at a low hrt the recovery was low due to insufficient time for se precipitates to grow and settle quickly the variation in se removal and recovery efficiency table 1 can be partly explained due to the adsorption and accumulation of selenium by the biomass moreover small size se nanoparticles 45 nm known as fines generally do not settle at the bottom of the reactor and get washed out along with the effluent stream which are however recoverable by an ancillary separation unit 3 3 characterization of biogenic selenium nanoparticles fig 10 a shows xrd spectra of the selenium nanaoparticles recovered from the ifb reactor which reveals wide peak due to amorphous or poorly crystalline nature of the nanoparticles formed which is typically similar to the elemental selenium nanoparticle produced by biological methods 45 among the many peaks in the xrd spectra characteristic peak at 2 theta values of 23 4 and 30 0 corresponding to the 100 and 101 crystallographic planes respectively indicate the presence of trigonal selenium whereas characteristic peak at 2 theta value of 26 9 corresponding to 220 plane indicates the presence of β monoclinic selenium 46 these results are in agreement with selenium nanoparticle synthesized by using the bacterial strains shewanella sp e coli and pantoea agglomerans 47 functional groups involved in selenium reduction and capping of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles were identified from ftir spectra shown in fig 10b major absorbance bands in the ftir spectrum of selenium nanoparticles are observed at 3433 1631 1384 1074 756 cm 1 the wide band at 3433 cm 1 corresponds to hydroxyl groups 48 the bands showed at 1631 cm 1 can be ascribed to amide i due to the carbonyl and nh stretching vibrations in the amide linkages of the proteins the peak at 1074 cm 1 is due to the c o stretching vibrations of ether groups whereas the peak at 1384 cm 1 could be attributed to ch3 bending vibrations in lipids 19 overall the organic groups detected by ftir match with those present in the extracellular polymeric substances eps that is composed of sugars lipids and proteins 19 eps has been previously shown to act as capping agent for synthesis of biological selenium nanoparticles by anaerobic biomass 19 the major absorbance bands obtained for selenite loaded biomass are found at 3400 1645 1381 816 752 cm 1 respectively differences in peaks observed in the ftir spectra of selenite loaded biomass from that of the selenium nanoparticles can be attributed to the fact that the surface of selenium nanoparticles is covered with protein and other extracellular polymeric substances eps whereas selenium loaded biomass contains many other compounds associated with microbial cell structure various enzymes present in different microorganisms have been known to play a critical role in selenite reduction which are extracellular reductase e g nitrate reductase membrane associated reductase periplasmic dissimilatory nitrite reductase and selenite reductase enzymes 49 50 the mechanism of selenium nanoparticle formation from selenite involves enzymatic reduction of selenite to elemental selenium followed by its capping and stabilization due to eps secreted by anaerobic biomass fig 11 in order to understand the structure and composition of the selenium nanoparticles fetem eds and fesem analyses were carried out and the results were shown in fig 12 the selenium nanoparticles are spherical in shape and ranged from 90 to 150 nm in size the selenium present in the nanoparticles was also established by the eds spectra fig 12b additional peaks due to carbon and oxygen are attributed to the eps involved in capping of the nanoparticles fetem micrograph of the samples with biomass confirmed the extracellular localisation of selenium nanoparticles fesem analysis further confirmed the spherical shape of the selenium nanoparticles fig 12c these findings correlate with the reports on characterization of selenium nanoparticles synthesized using bacillus cereus bacillus megaterium bacillus mycoides and streptomyces minutiscleroticus 51 53 amorphous nature of biogenic se0 is also reported more widely than the crystalline se structures 54 however amorphous particles offer certain advantages to microorganism in avoiding selenite toxicity and its spherical shape is also less damaging to the cell integrity 1 7 in order to further establish the commercial viability of the ifb system for selenite removal and recovery from wastewater its techno economic feasibility and scale up are warranted moreover other suitable biosupport materials including low cost waste substrates that could also serve as the electron donor for selenite reduction may be explored furthermore kinetic studies aimed at modelling and prediction of ifb performance based on artificial intelligence can be taken up 4 conclusions the results from this study clearly demonstrated the superior performance of ifb reactor in terms of both selenite removal and recovery as selenium nanoparticles the nutrient supplement process parameters as well as the influent selenite concentration were found to have significant impact on selenite removal the mechanism of selenium nanoparticles formation from selenite by anaerobic biomass was confirmed to be enzymatic reduction followed by capping due to eps the recovery of selenium nanoparticle in a single stage process is another major advantage of this process which will certainly improve the wastewater treatment cost in industries which generate selenite rich wastewater it can also be reasonably said that this biological selenite remediation process will provide a cheap and environmental friendly

14293,this study evaluated the performance of an inverse fluidized bed ifb bioreactor with anerobic biomass immobilized onto kaldness k1 media as the biosupport material for selenite removal and recovery as selenium nanoparticle from waste stream the effect of different process parameter and nutrient supplement on selenium removal was first studied in a batch system using serum bottles the results revealed that among the different nitrogen substrates ammonium bicarbonate was most suitable whereas lactate was found to be the preferred carbon substrate with 98 selenite removal efficiency and 90 cod removal later studies with the continuously operated ifb bioreactor operated at different hydraulic retention time hrt and different influent selenite concentrations revealed an efficient removal of selenite at 24 h hrt and 1 0 mm of influent se iv furthermore selenium nanoparticles formed at the bottom of the bioreactor were successfully recovered with a recovery efficiency in the range 35 58 with a maximum recovery obtained at 1 0 mm selenite concentration and 24 h hrt the extracellular produced selenium nanoparticles were found to be spherical in shape with 90 150 nm in size fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy confirmed the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps as capping agent on the outer surface of se nanoparticles keywords biological selenite

industries as well as in human health and it presents in four oxidation states i e se6 selenate se4 selenite se0 elemental se and se2 selenide 1 2 other less common species of se are selenoamino acids cystein and methionine as well as volatile methylated compounds including dimethyl selenide dimethyl diselenide and dimethyl selenone 3 4 in general se oxyanions i e selenate seo4 2 and selenite seo3 2 have high water solubility and are well known for its potential toxicity towards living beings even at low concentrations 5 the primary apprehension regarding se pollution is that it bioaccumulates which leads to biomagnification and has potential disastrous effect on aquatic ecosystems 6 on the contrary elemental se se0 is highly insoluble in water and it exhibits the least toxic effect among the different forms 7 the natural source of se is due to weathering of seleniferous soils and rocks whereas anthropogenic sources of se pollution include mining refinement of metals flue gases and other industrial activities 8 9 compared with the natural sources anthropogenic activities greatly contribute to se pollution in the environment as large quantities of se containing wastewater associated with it are released into the environment thereby causing serious pollution problem se containing wastewaters are generally treated by physicochemical and biological methods physicochemical methods are effective but high cost high energy consumption need for disposal of by products and solid liquid separation problem are some drawbacks of these methods 10 11 in order to minimize and overcome the limitations of physicochemical methods biological methods have gained importance in the recent times 12 13 biological selenium removal involves selenium reducing bacteria serb which reduce se4 se6 present in wastewater to se0 by oxidizing carbon substrate and use the produced energy for its growth and maintenance 3 biological selenium removal methods are highly promising due to low cost of operation high treatment efficiency and suitability for low concentration of effluent as well as for its sustainable and environment friendly approach 1 14 dissimilatory reduction of selenium oxyanions supports the anaerobic respiration of a number of microorganisms which utilizes selenium as a terminal electron acceptor conversion of soluble selenate and selenite to nanoparticle of elemental selenium greatly reduces the toxicity and bioavailability of selenium thereby contributing to bioremediation and production of selenium nanospheres for various useful applications 7 applications of such nanoparticle of selenium includes its use as semiconductors with antimicrobial coating 15 for light emitting diodes and solar cells as well as for biological imaging 16 18 and heavy metal adsorption 19 thus microbial synthesis of selenium nanoparticles coupled to selenium wastewater treatment is both industrially attractive and economically viable however an important concern related to the biological treatment of se oxyanions is the generation of colloidal se0 nanoparticle that should be collected before discharging treated effluent into the environment different types of bioreactor systems have been tested for selenium removal and precipitation of biogenic se0 including continuously stirred tank reactor cstr 20 packed bed reactor pbr 21 up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor 22 membrane biofilm bioreactor mbr 23 however recovery could not be achieved using these reactors because elemental se0 precipitate partly onto the biomass therefore a solid liquid separation step is often needed in the downstream of such bioreactor systems but without escalating the cost of operation in this context a promising bioreactor configuration for selenate selenite reduction and recovery in a single unit is the inverse fluidized bed ifb reactor containing low density floatable biosupport material which is fluidized downward in this reactor system biofilm develops over the biosupport material and it remains at the top of the reactor whereas the precipitates formed get separated from the biomass due to fluidization and settle at the bottom thereby enabling an easy recovery of the bioprecipitates 24 25 villa gomez et al 26 reported a high removal and recovery of heavy metals by sulfate reduction using an ifb reactor however ifb reactor has not been reported thus far for selenite removal and recovery as nanoparticles different types of biosupport materials were previously reported for their use in ifb system such as polystyrene beads 26 sponge cubes 27 waste lignocellulosic materials 28 etc compared with these materials kaldness k1 biosupport material which is often used in moving bed biofilm reactor offers a high surface area and high biomass retention capabilities hence this study is primarily focused on continuous se removal and recovery in a single stage process using an ifb reactor the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt and inlet se iv concentrations on continuous se removal and recovery were studied batch experiments were performed in order to investigate the effect of various process parameters viz different carbon and nitrogen sources ph temperature cod selenite and c n ratios on selenite removal detailed characterization of the se nanoparticle was further carried out in order to gain insight into the mechanism of nanoparticle formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 effect of nutrient and process parameters on selenite reduction batch experiments were performed using glass serum bottles of 120 ml capacity each containing 50 ml mineral salt medium msm with 10 v v of anaerobic biomass as inoculum the anaerobic biomass obtained from a large scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating combined industrial and domestic effluent located in kavoor mangalore karnataka india and composition of nutrient media used for biomass growth were described in an earlier work 29 in order to study the effect of different carbon sources on se removal glucose sodium lactate ethanol acetate and succinate equivalent to 1 g l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod were considered the medium ph was adjusted to 7 and serum bottles were incubated at 30 c for 5 days in a shaking incubator set at 150 rpm samples were collected after every 24 h and centrifuged at 16 000 g for 15 min and concentration of selenite and cod in the supernatant were determined as mentioned in section 2 4 similarly the effect of different nitrogen sources on se removal was examined using ammomium chloride ammonium nitrate ammonium bicarbonate and urea for this experiment sodium lactate was used as the carbon source based on the results of the previous experiments in order to study the effect of ph and temperature on selenite reduction experiments were performed by varying the medium ph and temperature one variable at a time in the range 3 10 and 25 45 c respectively effect of different cod se ratio 0 5 1 1 5 1 7 2 3 6 on se4 removal was studied at a fixed initial selenite concentration of 1 mm and by varying the concentration of sodium lactate measured in terms of cod similar experiments were performed to examine the effect of different c n ratio 0 1 1 5 7 10 and 16 on selenite removal by the anaerobic sludge biomass 2 2 continuous experiments 2 2 1 experimental setup ifb bioreactor used in this study was constructed using an acrylic cylinder of diameter 0 055 m and height 0 61 m with a conical bottom and a total volume of 1 4 l the working volume of the bioreactor was 1 l fig 1 shows a schematic of the reactor setup the flow distributor and gas outlet were provided on top of the reactor the influent wastewater was supplied by using a peristaltic pump connected to the influent tank of the reactor the flowrate was maintained in such a way that the expansion of the bed was not more than 50 of the reactor volume the reactor was connected to an equalizer to maintain a constant liquid level in the reactor which as well served as a secondary settler from which se precipitates from the reactor were recovered the bioreactor was operated at an ambient room temperature 27 2 ⁰c with kaldness k1 as the biosupport material this biosupport has been extensively studied for various wastewater treatment systems and it is most commonly used in moving bed biofilm reactors 30 31 in order to obtain a high pollutant removal without crowding the reactor 30 v v of the bioreactor was filled with the kaldness carrier according to villa gomez et al 26 2 2 2 se iv removal and recovery as se 0 nanoparticle for initial biofilm formation onto the carrier material and startup of the reactor it was inoculated with 100 ml of anaerobic sludge biomass and supplied with mineral salt media msm and sodium lactate 1 0 g l 1 as the carbon source following this initial startup phase of 30 days synthetic wastewater containing se iv along with msm and sodium lactate was fed into the bioreactor table 1 depicts the different operating conditions followed for studying the continuous selenite removal using the ifb bioreactor the experiments were performed in two phases i and ii to study the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt and inlet selenite concentration on selenite removal in phase i the hrt was varied from 48 to 12 h whereas the inlet selenite concentration was kept constant at 0 1 mm in the second phase the influent selenite concentration was increased to 0 5 1 0 2 5 mm and finally to 5 mm with a fixed hrt of 24 h which showed the best selenite reduction efficiency in the previous phase the temperature of ifb was not controlled and operated at an ambient temperature of 27 c which is close to the optimum temperature observed from the earlier batch study during the experiments samples were withdrawn from the bioreactor outlet at regular time interval each sample was analyzed thrice and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation selenite removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 1 s e l e n i t e r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c i c 0 c i 100 where ci and co are the concentration of selenite in mm in the inlet and outlet streams respectively of the reactor elemental selenium collected from the bottom of the reactor and equalizer during each operating condition were used to calculate the se recovery efficiency a provision for opening and withdrawing the settled selenium nanoparticles during the bioreactor operation was made at the bottom of the bioreactor similarly for selenium nanoparticle recovery from the equalizer top lid was opened and the settled content was poured out without disturbing the bioreactor operation the se recovery in the ifb reactor was defined as follows 2 s e l e n i u m r e c o v e r y e f f i c i e n c y s t s b s e q s t 100 where seq is selenium precipitate mg in the equalizer sb is selenium precipitate mg in sample from the bottom of the reactor and st is total selenium mg fed to the reactor 2 3 characterization of selenium nanoparticles characterization of the bioprecipitates formed due to selenite reduction in this study was carried out using different techniques including fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy field emission transmission electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fetem eds field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and x ray diffraction xrd for ftir analysis samples were centrifuged at 16 000 g for 15 min the pellet and supernatant obtained were dried and analyzed using a ftir spectroscope ir affinity 1 shimadzu japan the nanoparticle precipitates were observed under xrd rigaku ttrax iii japan to evaluate its crystallinity for fetem jeol jem2100 japan analysis combined with eds the precipitates obtained was fixed onto a copper grid coated with carbon to determine the shape and size of nanoparticles the precipitates were dried overnight at 30 c fixed on an adhesive tape covered metallic grid and gold coated using a sputter coater following which the precipitates were examined using fesem zeiss sigma germany 2 4 analytical methods for se4 analysis a spectrophotometry based method was used as described by mal et al 32 for cod and nitrogen measurements spectrophotometric method was used 33 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nutrient and process parameters on selenite reduction 3 1 1 effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on selenite reduction fig 2 shows the effect of different carbon sources on selenite reduction and cod removal efficiency by the anaerobic sludge biomass among the five carbon sources tested maximum selenite reduction efficiency of 96 and 98 was obtained with glucose and sodium lactate respectively the reduction efficiency was less with the other carbon sources fig 2a high selenite reduction efficiency in this study is attributed to the activity of serb present in the biomass however the poor efficiency obtained using the carbon sources other than glucose and sodium lactate is due to inability of the serb to completely oxidize these carbon sources as revealed by corresponding low cod removal values shown fig 2b from previous studies it is well understood that selenite reduction is thermodynamically more favorable with glucose than with sodium lactate 34 however in this study the results are comparable for these two carbon sources owing to low cost of sodium lactate compared with glucose sodium lactate was chosen as the carbon substrate for further experiments the effect of different nitrogen sources on selenite reduction efficiency by anaerobic sludge biomass is illustrated in fig 3 among the four nitrogen sources examined ammonium nitrate resulted in high se removal i e 98 along with 86 nitrogen utilization a very low efficiency of both selenite reduction and nitrogen utilization was obtained using urea as the nitrogen source fig 3 serb are known to uptake nitrogen in the form of ammonium 35 and hence ammonium nitrate proved to be the most preferred nitrogen source for selenite reduction in this study moreover compared to other forms of nitrogen such as nitrate or nitrite ammonia is utilized by the bacterium without any additional cellular energy 36 3 1 2 effect of medium ph and temperature on selenite reduction the effect of ph and temperature on selenite reduction was investigated to determine their optimum values fig 4 it could be seen that the selenite reduction was significantly affected by the ph of the nutrient medium the optimum ph is thus found to be 7 the optimum temperature for selenite reduction was found to be 30 c and above which the selenite removal efficiency reduced in general it is reported that at a ph value below 7 selenite is present as the single charged anion hseo3 and above ph 7 it is present as the double charged anion seo3 2 37 this study indicates the form at neutral ph i e selenite in the form seo3 2 is preferred for se reduction by anaerobic sludge biomass on the other hand biological activity such as enzymatic and biochemical pathways require an optimal temperature range and above which it does not function properly furthermore the biomass showed significant growth and substrate utilization at an ambient temperature moreover selenium nanoparticle formation by such bacteria is mostly reported at ambient temperature and neutral ph range 3 3 1 3 effect of different cod se ratio and c n ratio on selenite reduction fig 5 shows the effect of different cod se ratio on se reduction and cod removal by anaerobic biomass the selenite removal efficiencies were 74 6 85 3 98 7 90 6 78 63 66 4 for cod se ratios of 0 5 1 1 5 1 7 2 and 3 6 respectively the maximum selenite removal efficiency was found at cod se ratio of 1 5 which is close to the stoichiometric optimum ratio of 1 further increase in the cod se ratio lowered the selenite removal efficiency however in case of cod removal it gradually decreased with an increase in cod se ratio from 0 5 to 3 6 i e from 96 22 to 44 6 fig 5b the following stoichiometric equations can thus be used to describe selenite reduction with lactate as the carbon source and electron donor 38 3 c2h4ohcoo seo3 2 h ch3coo se0 hco3 h2o as seen from the afore mentioned reaction the stoichiometric cod se ratio for selenite reduction is 1 however lactate is used not only for selenite reduction but also for biomass growth cellular maintenance and for other fermentative products therefore the actual cod available for selenite reduction is less than the initial cod provided to the system hence the optimum cod se ratio 1 5 obtained in this study is very likely moreover a reduced selenite removal efficiency above cod se ratio of 1 7 is attributed to diversion of electron flux towards selenium assimilation than dissimilation at a high organic load on the other hand incomplete utilization of lactate at a high cod concentration led to the gradual decrease of cod removal efficiency from 96 22 to 44 6 with an increase in cod se ratio from 0 5 to 3 6 from these results it could be surmised that a high organic load caused substrate inhibition on the biomass activity affecting both selenite reduction and cod removal fig 6 shows the effect of different c n ratios on selenite reduction and cod removal efficiency by the anaerobic sludge biomass using ammonium nitrate as the nitrogen source the selenite removal efficiency was more than 80 for all the c n ratios used however maximum selenite reduction of 97 8 was achieved at an optimum c n ratio of 1 0 on the other hand the cod removal decreased with increase in c n ratio and a maximum cod removal of 90 45 was obtained at a low c n ratio of 0 1 the regulation of nitrogen uptake is an essential mechanism for microorganisms to cope up with resource imbalances and it is independent of the carbon metabolism 39 a c n ratio in the range 10 16 was reported to be optimum for sulphate reducing bacteria srb activity a maximum ratio in the range 45 1 120 1 is suggested to avoid any significant reduction in srb activity due to growth limitations under a nitrogen stressed environment excess nitrogen 600 mg l 1 is shown to be toxic to srb community 40 however the result can vary depending on the type of microorganism and substrates used similar mechanism is applicable for serb because of the analogous properties of selenium and sulfur in this study c n ratio of 1 was found to be optimum for both selenite and cod removal which is in agreement with the literature that nutrient removal efficiency is maximum at a moderate c n ratio 41 3 1 4 effect of initial selenite concentration on selenite reduction the effect of initial selenite concentration on selenite removal is depicted in fig 7 it can be clearly seen that more than 95 selenite reduction could be obtained for an initial selenite concentration in the range 0 1 0 5 mm and above which the selenite removal decreased in case of 50 mm initial se concentration the selenite removal value was very low 53 4 similar to the selenite removal efficiency values cod removal also lowered with an enhancement in the initial selenite concentration however the cod removal was maintained at 70 even upto 10 mm concentration a possible reason for these results could be attributed to the low tolerance of the anaerobic biomass towards selenium 3 7 wang et al 42 reported that se reducing bacteria are able to tolerate selenite upto 1 mm concentration and beyond which it exerts some sort of toxic effect on its metabolism 3 2 continuous selenite removal and recovery using ifb reactor 3 2 1 selenite and cod removal fig 8 a shows the selenite removal profile along with influent and effluent selenite concentration using the continuously operated ifb reactor during the first phase of the reactor operation to examine the effect of hrt the influent selenite and lactate concentrations were kept constant at 0 1 mm and 10 mm respectively at 48 h hrt a very high selenite removal efficiency of 99 was achieved within 7 days after the hrt was reduced to 36 and 24 h a slight drop in the selenite removal efficiency was observed but it remained at more than 90 the reactor performance significantly deteriorated at 12 h hrt and the selenite removal value reached to 70 it is reported that hrt plays a very important role in bioreactor performance and an optimum hrt value depends upon the bioreactor used nature of microorganism and type of pollutant being handled in the system 43 most of the previous bioreactor studies for continuous selenite removal have reported different optimum hrt values for selenite removal for example cheng et al 44 reported a very high selenite removal rate for an influent selenite concentration of 10 mm at 5 d hrt using an ifb bioreactor the authors observed that long hrt enabled microorganisms present in the reactor to achieve a high removal efficiency of selenite from synthetic wastewater in the present study selenite removal was comparable at both 36 and 24 h hrt the poor performance at low hrt of 12 h is probably due to insufficient contact time available for anaerobic sludge biomass to efficiently utilize cod for selenite reduction 35 another key parameter which is influenced by hrt is mixing due to biosupport bed expansion bed expansion is directly proportional to liquid flowrate into the bioreactor which greatly influences the ifb performance and at a low hrt value the bed expansion will be maximum from the experimental results a high agitation and bed expansion was not found to be favourable for achieving a high selenite reduction efficiency and its recovery as nanoparticle hence in order to understand the governing mechanism detailed hydrodynamic study of the system needs to be performed during the phase ii of continuous bioreactor operation influent selenite concentration was varied from 0 1 mm to 5 mm whereas the cod concentration and hrt were kept constant at 1 g l 1 and 24 h respectively from fig 8a a gradual decrease in the selenite removal efficiency is observed with an increase in the influent selenite concentration the steady state selenite removal values were 94 89 3 and 81 for 0 5 1 and 2 5 mm concentration of selenite respectively however the selenite removal value dropped to 74 at 5 mm influent selenite concentration the low selenite removal at high influent selenite concentration is mainly attributed to low cod to selenite ratio as observed previously in the batch experiments in general se concentration in waste streams does not exceed 0 1 mm however in order to check the efficiency of the ifb system to handle even high selenite loading conditions it was operated at an influent selenite loading condition more than 0 1 mm these high selenite concentration serves as shock loading condition for the bioreactor and the results demonstrated that even at such high loading condition the ifb system performed satisfactorily these results are similar to the previously reported studies on continuous selenite removal using different bioreactor systems for example cheng et al 44 achieved more than 94 selenate removal using floating spherical particles in a 4 l ifb bioreactor in another study soda et al 22 evaluated continuous selenite removal using two different bioreactors and found that uasb type reactor was more efficient than suspended type anaerobic bioreactor in treating selenite containing wastewater with more than 90 selenite removal achieved within 15 days of the continuous reactor operation immobilization of anaerobic biomass over biosupport material creates a layered structured biofilm which is more resilient than suspended biomass towards toxic effects of pollutants even at a high loading condition in the bioreactor the use of kaldness k1 as biosupport material in this study is known for providing a large surface area for biofilm growth in comparison with other biosupport materials commonly used thus selenite removal in this study was very high even at a high influent selenite loading condition fig 8b shows the cod removal profile during the continuous selenite removal experiments with the ifb reactor it can be seen from the results that cod removal was very high 80 during both the phases of bioreactor operation except in case of 12 h hrt the cod removal efficiency dropped to around 72 an increase in the selenite concentration showed minimal effect on the cod removal efficiency except for a high influent selenite concentration of 5 mm however the best cod removal value was obtained at low influent selenite concentration and a high hrt value cod removal in such bioreactor systems is indicative of activity of the microorganisms present the high cod utilization efficiency in the ifb reactor indicates that selenite did not inhibit the activity of anaerobic biomass particularly at low selenite loading condition during the initial phase of continuous bioreactor operation fig 9 compares selenite removal rate with different selenite loading rates applied in the ifb bioreactor straight line passing through the origin of the figure indicates a stable performance of the bioreactor and deviation from the line is undesirable for the process it is clear that the removal rate was stable for the low selenite loading rates below 0 04 mm h at loading rates 0 104 and 0 208 mm h the selenite removal rate was low indicating that selenite loading rates beyond these values are detrimental to the reactor performance however there are several ways for improving the bioreactor performance at high selenite loading conditions such as by increasing the hrt or cod loading which provides sufficient contact time and optimum cod se ratio respectively for the microorganisms present the high selenite and cod removal efficiency is mainly attributed to the attached biomass on the biosupport materials in the ifb system however the presence and role played by suspended biomass in the system cannot be ruled out which needs further analysis to confirm 3 2 2 selenium recovery in ifb bioreactor the gradual change in colour of ifb reactor liquid inside from black to red clearly indicated the accumulation of elemental selenium as nanoparticles in the bioreactor due to the ifb reactor configuration the selenium nanoparticles formed inside the reactor settled at the bottom of the bioreactor and the equalizer for an easy recovery the percentage of se recovered during each operating condition with the ifb bioreactor system are presented in table 1 during phase i of bioreactor operation at 48 36 and 24 h hrt 41 45 of se loaded into the bioreactor was recovered as se nanoparticle however at 12 h hrt the se recovery was around 35 which is mainly due to poor selenite removal under this condition during phase ii the percentage se recovery increased with an increase in the influent selenite concentration in the reactor and it was in the range 50 60 the recovery efficiency obtained in this study correlates well with previous literature for example villa gomez et al 26 reported 40 60 recovery for different heavy metals using sulfidogenic ifb bioreactor system the variation in se recovery with hrt is due to the fact that a prolonged residence time allows agglomeration of small sized se nanoparticles into larger ones with a quicker sedimentation rate to the bottom of the reactor on the contrary at a low hrt the recovery was low due to insufficient time for se precipitates to grow and settle quickly the variation in se removal and recovery efficiency table 1 can be partly explained due to the adsorption and accumulation of selenium by the biomass moreover small size se nanoparticles 45 nm known as fines generally do not settle at the bottom of the reactor and get washed out along with the effluent stream which are however recoverable by an ancillary separation unit 3 3 characterization of biogenic selenium nanoparticles fig 10 a shows xrd spectra of the selenium nanaoparticles recovered from the ifb reactor which reveals wide peak due to amorphous or poorly crystalline nature of the nanoparticles formed which is typically similar to the elemental selenium nanoparticle produced by biological methods 45 among the many peaks in the xrd spectra characteristic peak at 2 theta values of 23 4 and 30 0 corresponding to the 100 and 101 crystallographic planes respectively indicate the presence of trigonal selenium whereas characteristic peak at 2 theta value of 26 9 corresponding to 220 plane indicates the presence of β monoclinic selenium 46 these results are in agreement with selenium nanoparticle synthesized by using the bacterial strains shewanella sp e coli and pantoea agglomerans 47 functional groups involved in selenium reduction and capping of the synthesized selenium nanoparticles were identified from ftir spectra shown in fig 10b major absorbance bands in the ftir spectrum of selenium nanoparticles are observed at 3433 1631 1384 1074 756 cm 1 the wide band at 3433 cm 1 corresponds to hydroxyl groups 48 the bands showed at 1631 cm 1 can be ascribed to amide i due to the carbonyl and nh stretching vibrations in the amide linkages of the proteins the peak at 1074 cm 1 is due to the c o stretching vibrations of ether groups whereas the peak at 1384 cm 1 could be attributed to ch3 bending vibrations in lipids 19 overall the organic groups detected by ftir match with those present in the extracellular polymeric substances eps that is composed of sugars lipids and proteins 19 eps has been previously shown to act as capping agent for synthesis of biological selenium nanoparticles by anaerobic biomass 19 the major absorbance bands obtained for selenite loaded biomass are found at 3400 1645 1381 816 752 cm 1 respectively differences in peaks observed in the ftir spectra of selenite loaded biomass from that of the selenium nanoparticles can be attributed to the fact that the surface of selenium nanoparticles is covered with protein and other extracellular polymeric substances eps whereas selenium loaded biomass contains many other compounds associated with microbial cell structure various enzymes present in different microorganisms have been known to play a critical role in selenite reduction which are extracellular reductase e g nitrate reductase membrane associated reductase periplasmic dissimilatory nitrite reductase and selenite reductase enzymes 49 50 the mechanism of selenium nanoparticle formation from selenite involves enzymatic reduction of selenite to elemental selenium followed by its capping and stabilization due to eps secreted by anaerobic biomass fig 11 in order to understand the structure and composition of the selenium nanoparticles fetem eds and fesem analyses were carried out and the results were shown in fig 12 the selenium nanoparticles are spherical in shape and ranged from 90 to 150 nm in size the selenium present in the nanoparticles was also established by the eds spectra fig 12b additional peaks due to carbon and oxygen are attributed to the eps involved in capping of the nanoparticles fetem micrograph of the samples with biomass confirmed the extracellular localisation of selenium nanoparticles fesem analysis further confirmed the spherical shape of the selenium nanoparticles fig 12c these findings correlate with the reports on characterization of selenium nanoparticles synthesized using bacillus cereus bacillus megaterium bacillus mycoides and streptomyces minutiscleroticus 51 53 amorphous nature of biogenic se0 is also reported more widely than the crystalline se structures 54 however amorphous particles offer certain advantages to microorganism in avoiding selenite toxicity and its spherical shape is also less damaging to the cell integrity 1 7 in order to further establish the commercial viability of the ifb system for selenite removal and recovery from wastewater its techno economic feasibility and scale up are warranted moreover other suitable biosupport materials including low cost waste substrates that could also serve as the electron donor for selenite reduction may be explored furthermore kinetic studies aimed at modelling and prediction of ifb performance based on artificial intelligence can be taken up 4 conclusions the results from this study clearly demonstrated the superior performance of ifb reactor in terms of both selenite removal and recovery as selenium nanoparticles the nutrient supplement process parameters as well as the influent selenite concentration were found to have significant impact on selenite removal the mechanism of selenium nanoparticles formation from selenite by anaerobic biomass was confirmed to be enzymatic reduction followed by capping due to eps the recovery of selenium nanoparticle in a single stage process is another major advantage of this process which will certainly improve the wastewater treatment cost in industries which generate selenite rich wastewater it can also be reasonably said that this biological selenite remediation process will provide a cheap and environmental friendly

14294,in this study a greenhouse experiment of complete randomized design with three replications was conducted to investigate the potential of medicago sativa zea mays helianthus annus sorghum bicolor phragmites australis and caroxylon imbricatum in the removal of toxic pollutants from a produced water pw the collected local oil refinery wastewater was also characterized physically and chemically the concentration of the total dissolved solids tds chloride sodium boron ions and sodium adsorption ratio were 300 g l 122 g l 61 g l 0 038 g l and 139 9 meq l respectively results showed that except m sativa tolerated up to 10 diluted pw with a 30 decrease in length and biomass compared to control treatment all other plants could not survive however caroxylon imbricatum tolerated up to 20 diluted pw without any significant differences in the morphological characteristics the fourier transform infrared ftir results for c imbricatum tissues showed that cellulose structure had the greatest role in the metal adsorption and transportation inside the plant tissue this conclusion is verified by the shifting or disappearance in transmission bands at 1028 1334 2852 and 2921 cm 1 after pw treatment the soil with sandy loam texture used in this study showed a huge accumulation of sodium ions up to 17 6 103 mg kg the organic contents of the pw were below the detection limits of the gas chromatography gc and ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc instruments the results of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs extraction showed accumulation of less polar pahs in 30 irrigated soil keywords wastewater produced water phytoremediation metals organic pollutants 1 introduction sustainable management of water resources as a challenging concern is more complex in the gulf council countries gcc due to the harsh arid environment and increasing anthropogenic input of pollutants from different sectors the countries such as qatar rich in oil and gas but poor in water resource require sustainable development of water resource schemes the increasing population growth in the state of qatar has coupled with remarkable industrialization add more stress to the existing renewable water resources 1 3 qatar is considered as one of the highest water consuming countries in the world 99 of the country s municipal demand covered from desalinated water in addition to the annual growth in demand is about 10 1 over the last two decades the development of gulf societies has been thanks to the advances in desalination technologies powered by cheap fossil fuels there is however an obvious need to use new wastewater treatment method and a management plan to meet the local water demand according to qatar s development 1 produced water pw is produced from industrial activities such as gas oil tight sands coal bed methane and gas shale production on the quality and quantity of oil refinery pw greatly depends on the location and type of the petroleum compounds 4 pw is one of highest waste connected with oil and gas production in which the global ratio of wastewater to oil is 3 1 that means water cut is 70 5 while in qatar can reach 4 1 in some oil production fields 6 with increasing extraction offshore oil and gas industries and its development in harsh arctic environments needs for more active and intelligent offshore wastewater management increased in harsh arctic environmental areas are more sensitive to changes in water quality than more temperate climates however the number and scope of studies of offshore wastewater management in harsh arctic environments are limited the quality of pw differs significantly according to geographical location type of hydrocarbon manufactured and the geochemistry of the producing formation in general the total dissolved solids tds concentration are ranging from 100 to over 400 000 mg l sludge sodium particulates bicarbonate and chloride ions are the most commonly occurring inorganic constituents in pw benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex mixtures are the most commonly occurring organic pollutants in pw 4 the types the degree and cost of treatment required are dependent on the pollutants and their concentrations in the pw 7 different kinds of treatment processes could be used for pw treatment however selecting an appropriate treatment process varies according to initial composition of pw and the final target proposes after the treatment process the quality of the end product defined the purpose of use irrigation industries use stream flow and livestock watering most of the treatment processes such as filtration chemical processes and reverse osmosis are highly expensive which are more suitable for drinking purposes but are uneconomic for plant irrigation or livestock uses 8 around the world there is an increasing trend to apply innovative technology for pw remediation using phytoremediation or plant remediation 9 phytoremediation is a developing biotechnology highly suggested for the following reasons i low cost and solar driven remediation technology ii effective in superficial position with low contaminant level iii efficient in remediation of wide range of environmental pollutants iv useful in place of mechanical cleanup method and v environmentally friendly treatment 10 different plant species were successfully used in phytoremediation some were terrestrial and others were aquatic while terrestrial species have been found more effective in phytoremediation applications as they have larger root systems which enhance higher contaminations uptake so trees and grass species were commonly used bhupinder 2013 10 explored alfalfa sunflower indian mustard thalspi sp maize and sorghum which were more suitable due to their characteristics such as high biomass production biofuel production and fast growth 11 therefore the aims of this environmental study include characterization of one of a locally pw in qatar and applying it for the irrigation of four crop plant species helianthus annuus sunflower zea mays maize sorghum bicolor grain sorghum and medicago sativa alfalfa in addition two other species from qatari flora namely phragmites australis ghab and caroxylon imbricatum previously known as salsoa imbricata known to be salt tolerant and survive under contaminated soils were used 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil preparation the soil was collected from the mesaieed area in qatar the collected soil was kept dry in sunlight outside the greenhouse and then sieved at 2 mm sieve plate then it was mixed with peat moss purchased from the local market the peat moss composition is shown in table 1 the plant samples were then planted in 20 cm diameter plastic pots the soil was then mixed with peat moss by ratio 3 1 vol vol using five kg pot one hundred and eight pots were used for plantation experiment then 500 g of the mixed soil was packed in a plastic bag labeled as a control soil before treatment and transferred to the laboratory for further analysis 2 2 plantation seeds of four crop plant species sunflower maize alfalfa and grain sorghum were purchased from the local market while the seedlings of phragmitis sp ghab and caroxylon sp were collected from el khour area north of doha and the protected field of qatar university campus respectively seeds of the crop plants were sown in 18 pots as four seeds in each pot while the qatari plants were transferred directly from the natural habitat to the pots in the greenhouse each pot had one seedling for a total of 20 pots 18 pots were used in experiments and two pots for recovery if needed the irrigation was then started with tap water for the first ten days until healthy seedlings were obtained for all species then the pots were randomly

and medicago sativa were washed by 10 hypochlorite solution for fungal growth inhibition and then they were plated on filter paper in petri dish and watered with pw at different percentages 0 1 2 5 5 and 10 for four days under light and sterile conditions the effect of pw on germination of root and shoot systems were examined 3 results and discussion 3 1 water used in irrigation samples of tap water and pw used in the experiments were physically and chemically analyzed results are shown in tables 2 4 it can be concluded that the pw was a hypersaline according to 24 and the tds was more than 300 g l which confirms that the pw from a conventional oil well the results of cl na ca k and mg were 122 61 10 7 1 85 and 2 2 g l respectively these results were also coincided with 6 and 25 26 however nitrate and sulfate ions came in lowest concentrations 500 and 50 mg l respectively with similar trends to literature 27 30 the results of trace metals came in a lower range comparing to published results li was 4 mg l when it is range was 3 235 mg l b was 38 6 mg l comparing to 0 158 151 mg l be was 0 44 μg l when it was ranging between 0 1 4 μg l pb was 52 5 μg l compared to 2 10 200 μg l and zn was 63 μg l comparing to 5 35 000 μg l 5 27 29 30 boron is considered as one of the essential elements to cell wall structure and function in plant 31 but it is needed in moderately low quantities if excessive boron becomes toxic toxicity symptoms typically show first on older leaf tips and edges as either a yellowing spotting or drying of leaf tissues 32 the toxicity consequences for growth and yield were less serious for combined boron effect and salinity than what might be expected if impacts of the individual variables were additive 33 it was also noticed that organic contents btex of the pw were almost negligible this could be due to various reasons namely delay in delivering the pw to the laboratory slow mixing before collecting the samples from 1 m3 tank and the high temperature during delivery the average temperature during collected samples june month was 35 38 0c fig 1 a and b shows the gc chromatograms for the pw and the btex standard respectively the btex peaks appeared at retention time from 7 to 12 min fig 1b while at this time in sample chromatogram fig 1a the areas were very close to the noise of baseline which is referred to a low concentration of btex however the chromatogram showed that the sample was rich in the volatile organics beyond retention time from 20 to 30 min indicating the presence of heavier compounds which might be in the diesel range the btex results came incompatible with that illustrated in the literature as the btex were the highest organic concentration in pw 5 6 25 26 btex had the highest solubility products among the organic contamination 34 neff et al 2011 25 investigated the concentration of btex in pw and the results were 11170 278 1 4648 6 and 1156 8 μg l respectively neff 2002 2 also investigated three offshore productions and the btex results were 84 to 2300 μg l benzene 89 to 800 μg l toluene 26 to 110 μg l ethyl benzene and 13 to 480 μg l xylene dorea et al 2007 35 conducted a study on permian basin oil field and the results of btex were as following 1500 to 778 510 μg l benzene 100 μg l toluene 2010 to 399 840 μg l ethylbenzene and 10 to 460 μg l xylene ahan 2014 6 showed that the total btex was ranged from 4500 to 6740 μg l fig 2 a and b shows the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pahs chromatograms compared to standard result chromatogram it was shown that pahs results was 0 292 mg l fig 2b represents the pahs extracted from pw the resulting chromatogram shows very crowded peaks which are shifted toward the more polar compounds as their peaks started early at 11 min and finished at 30 min while in the standard chromatogram fig 2a the peaks started at 17 min and finished at 37 min according to the c18 column the more delayed peaks are the more nonpolar compounds some interferences such as high salinity increase pahs compounds in the pw rich in high polar compounds the result of 0 292 mg l pahs in the pw was moderate value comparing with 0 04 to 3 mg l in review study of 34 and 0 003 to 4540 mg l for 35 clearly the chemical oxygen demand cod was much higher than biological oxygen demand bod5 indicating low biodegradable of organic contents the results of this study were also compared with the values of fakhrul razi et al 2009 5 the comparison results are shown in table 5 it was noticed that the pw after dilution ten times had salinity slightly less than seawater 31 000 and 35 000 mg l respectively the sodium adsorption ratio sar was much higher 70 56 42 28 and 13 99 meq l for the pw percentages 50 40 30 20 and 10 respectively compared to control 0 13 meq l as the guidelines of 37 and 32 for irrigation water if irrigation water with a high sar was applied to soil for a long period the sodium in the water will displace the calcium and magnesium in the soil this will cause a decrease in the ability of the soil to form stable aggregates and a loss of soil structure and tilt this will also leads to a decrease in infiltration and permeability of the soil to water leading to problems with crop production according to soil texture the limit of sar is different such as for sandy soil the impact will be less problematic if sar was nine while it will have severe problems if the soil was fine texture 32 3 2 greenhouse experiment most of the plant species did not tolerate irrigation with the pw above 10 for more than one week except for caroxylon sp which was tolerated well at 30 for 20 days and at 20 for 35 days same as control which was irrigated with tap water fig 3 the average surviving days under pw percentages irrigation for different plant species are represented in fig 4 based on the number of surviving days of different plant species under pw irrigation it could be concluded that the main challenge of using pw in irrigation was the pw s salinity even at 20 irrigation the effect of high salinity appeared as dehydration for the green plants which is known as an osmotic shock due to an increase of ionic strength in irrigated solution more than in plant tissues 38 fig 5 shows the loss percentage of moisture for each plant species caroxylon sp has regular trend in the moisture loss with increasing the percentage of pw from control to 10 pw usage the species loss about 24 7 of its weight as moisture from 10 to 20 the plant loss about 30 of its weight as moisture while from 20 to 30 loss percentage was 15 weight then this loss percentage starts to reduce with increasing the pw percentage from 40 to 50 up to only 8 the main conclusion could be that caroxylon sp had a regular mechanism for moisture loss with pw irrigation and these mechanisms start to be dysfunctional after 20 pw while other plant species were completely irregular in their behavior mechanisms for moisture loss this could be due to difference in behaviors between halophytes and glycophytes under salinity conditions 39 caroxylon sp as halophyte tolerates drought and soil salinity with succulent leaves which means that the plant contains more stored water contents 38 under the effect of the pw irrigation the moisture lost percentages from caroxylon sp were higher than other species and has negative linear correlation with pw percentages statistical analysis for caroxylon sp showed no significant difference between the control experiment and the 10 and 20 pw irrigation while there were significant differences between the control and other experimental treatment irrigated with pw more than 20 in contrast caroxylon sp irrigated with 20 pw was more similar to that one grown in natural habitat rather than control treatment which irrigated with tap water the leaves shape hardness aggregation and stem hardness were completely different in tap water irrigation this may be due to the effect of salinity which agreed with 40 the caroxylon plant might be use salts in saline water to support its tissue structure and hardness or in the tolerance modifications which were similar in the natural habitats with 20 pw irrigation 38 40 41 3 2 1 metal analysis the metals results for the whole plant tissue of caroxylon sp are shown in fig 6 the metals were divided into two groups regarding their behavior the first group contains al ba co cr cs cu fe li mn pb v and zn fig 6a their concentrations in the plant were decreased compared to the 20 pw irrigation this could be explained by the fact that the feeding concentration was very small or the ion exchange mechanism was involved to give the plant chance to accumulate and tolerate the highest ions concentration similar conclusions were illustrated by others 42 44 for some sewage irrigated soils most concentration of metals in all the crops grown on sewage effluent irrigated soils were below the background levels the second group is na k ca mg b and nh4 fig 6b their concentrations were highly increased with 20 pw irrigation compared to control as a type of accumulation in response to pw irrigation 3 2 2 carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n percentages the great impact was seen on the c which was decreased from 35 9 to 16 13 with irrigation with the 20 pw this gave indication for biomass decreasing as impact for pw irrigation however this decreasing in carbon percentage became stable at 16 after 20 up to 40 pw irrigation the change in n was slightly small between control and 20 pw irrigation as it was 2 45 and 2 21 respectively while this change in nitrogen percentage increased after 20 to 30 of pw irrigation reaching to 1 6 the change in carbon and nitrogen percentages give indication that 20 of pw consider as critical tolerance point for caroxylon sp irrigation fig 6c carbon was highly affected comparing to nitrogen this might be due to c represent the biomass structure of storing materials inside the plant tissues while n represent the critical compounds such as proteins and amino acids 45 3 2 3 fourier transform infrared ftir spectra the ftir spectra fig 7 a and b were acquired using universal attenuated total reflectance uatr znse diamond crystal with no special sample preparation the changes in the ftir spectra were used to illustrate the changes in plant tissues structure with pw irrigation it was noticed from the ftir figures that the most effective component structure could be cellulose which is represent the highest percentages of plant tissue structure here the main functional groups oh co and ch2 oh were shifted and or disappeared under the adsorption of various metals this conclusion agreed with study of kumar et al 2017 46 on cellulose as bio sorbents 3 2 4 plant species growth after 10 days post treatment of 30 pw all plant species showed a complete damage except caroxylon sp caroxylon as halophyte has two types of resistance mechanisms i the first is the woody roots which have reduced cortex and endodermis and exoderms act as barriers for variable resistance of water flow ii the second is the succulent complex leaves 38 several morphological and anatomical structures met with halophyte plants give them the tolerance adaptation mechanisms such as salt secretary trichomes salt glands and salt accumulation 38 caroxylon sp are able to partition toxic salts into vacuoles or to exclude salt at the root zone so it does not affect cell metabolism and division 47 48 in case of medicago sativa alfalfa all pw treatments showed significant differences compared to control treatment medicago sativa alfalfa survived at 10 pw but with intensity reduction up to 33 of total number of individuals per pot in addition to reduction in shoot system length with an increase in root shoot ratio which give indication that plant try to reach more deeper soil layers fig 8 fig 8 compares between the growth of shoot and root of alfalfa at 10 pw irrigation with that one irrigated with tap water there was no significant difference in the root growth under 10 pw irrigation while the shoot growth has significance difference this notification gives an indication that pw affects the aboveground parts of the plant without effect on below ground parts those differences between the plant parts behavior might be as plant tolerance mechanisms to overcome the pw pollutants effect the shortage in shoot system agreed well with the results obtained by 49 after they recorded a decrease in growth as 7 2 in height and 5 9 in stem diameter of arundo sp after pw irrigation alfalfa survived with 10 pw irrigation in the greenhouse and was able to accumulate the highest concentration of b na li pb and zn in its tissues these results are compatible with torresdey et al 50 however it is not considered as a hyper accumulator according to definition illustrated by 51 55 fig 9 distributes the trace metals into two groups the first group in which the trace metals concentrations decreased with irrigation such as al ba co cr cs fe mn v ca ni and k those decreases might be due to ions exchange with the second group of metals where the ions and metals concentrations were very high in pw such as na b pb and zn while phragmites sp failed to grow due to its growth depend on what is known as running rhizomes so planting it in greenhouse pots limits its growth even in case of control normal growth was limited and not stable 3 3 germination test results the effect of pw on germination of root and shoot systems were examined the results of mean germination comparisons are shown in table 6 it can be concluded that growth of shoot system in case of sorghum did not show significant differences at 1 and 2 5 of pw compared to control while in case of medicago sp only 1 had no significance however the growth of the root system was only succeeded in case of 1 pw on medicago sp fig 10 a b that means the root systems of medicago sp was more tolerant to pw which was compatible with the greenhouse results at only 1 of pw there is no significant difference with tap water in length of shoot and root while at 2 5 5 and 10 of pw there are significant differences germination percentage seedling growth shoot length and root length were inhibited in 5 and 10 of pw while they were decreased in 2 5 pw however at 1 pw there were no differences in shoot and root growth rate compared to control caused as osmotic pressure due to higher salinity and toxicity 56 the osmotic pressure of the pw of high salt concentrations makes growth inhibition which agreed with the study of 57 3 4 soil results the composition of the collected soils was a sandy loam texture according to the usda triangle clay 12 7 silt 4 46 and sand 83 the dissolved salts in soil were increased exponentially with pw irrigation with a displacement of major anions and cations as illustrated in fig 11 a after tap water irrigation most ion concentration in soil decreased this decrease in ion concentration may due to plant utilization and or washing by tap water irrigation 60 the main notice from above results that the soil characterization changed in two ways first the ions abundance was completely changed from calcium to sodium as cation and from sulfate to chloride as anions second change was the regular and exponential increase of na and cl ions with the increase of pw concentration while in case ca mg and so4 ions the increasing was irregular these might be a result of the differences in plant consumption and utilization as illustrated in fig 11a fig 11b illustrates the changes in sar value in the soil before the irrigation with pw and after irrigation with different percentages of pw from the graph there is very small difference between control soils before irrigation with tap water and after that difference may be due to irrigation creates washing for soil and plant consumption for salts ions na ca mg are the same while with pw irrigation the sar value increased from 0 7 at control to 9 8 meq l in 20 pw it jumped from normal value to restricted value but no differences between 10 and 20 as the plant consumption factor still interfere in salts accumulation and distribution between plant tissues and soils however in case of 30 the sar value jumped to severely restricted when it was 29 meq l due to the absence of plant consumption and all salts accumulated only in soil accumulation of salts in soil not only increase the sodicity and salinity but also has second impacts on the physical properties of soil such as permeability as the sar increases to severe effect the permeability of soil to water infiltration is decreased to cause more difficult to supply the crop with water and may greatly add to cropping difficulties through crusting of seedbeds waterlogging of surface soil and accompanying disease if too many quantities of soluble salts accumulate in the rhizosphere the crops have more difficulties in uptaking enough water from the salty soil solution 43 61 63 this decreased water extraction by the plant can result in slow or poor growth and may be shown by symptoms similar in appearance to those of drought such as early wilting the metals in soil were divided into three groups according to the behavior changes first group of metals had the same behavior of as ba co cr cs cu fe li mn pb and v fig 12 a which slightly variation or little increased with increase the percentage of pw in irrigation second group contained al na k and b fig 12b were sharply increased with pw percentage increasing while the third group contained ca mg and zn fig 12c which were decreased with pw percentage increase all these differences in behavior would be coming from the concentration of metals in feeding irrigation water the trace metals used in irrigation were very small while na k b ca mg and zn were very high concentration however with the differences in their plant utilization na k and b were increased and accumulated in soil while ca mg and zn were consumed and their concentration reduced throughout control 10 and 20 irrigation however at 30 irrigation the plant utilization is lost so the concentration increased again fig 12d one of the major constraints for pw irrigation includes sits negative impacts on soil quality regarding the accumulation of heavy metal ions and the contamination of ground water on long term usage however the pw dilutions utilized for this experiment had a value of trace metals below the permissible limits the changes in soil properties agreed with 43 61 63 it appears that the accumulation of carbon compounds have the same behavior of nitrogen compounds these may be due to both presents in the same structure or both are related to the same bioavailability hardness carbon accumulation percentage is correlated with the organic accumulation incoming title it is clear that from control to 10 20 pw accumulation is smooth and gradually increases while it has sharpness at 30 pw fig 13 a b the organic accumulation was below detection limits of uplc and gc in most irrigated soil samples after one month irrigation with 10 and 20 of pw while it started to detected at 30 pw irrigation at the same period of irrigation on both types pahs and diesel range with slight differences in concentration and individuals the main notification is that organics accumulated in soil were the less polar or completely nonpolar compounds as they shifted to more retention time up to 41 min more than the standard of pahs used which ends at 37 min also completely differed than pahs were extracted from the pw itself fig 2b which ends at 30 min these indicate that the original pahs from the pw were divided into two groups first which is more polar start disappear from rhizosphere soil might be throw plant degradation or migrate more deeper in soil layers with water and a second group which was less polar or non polar which accumulated in rhizosphere zone 4 conclusion and recommendation in this study the used pw showed a great impact on both plant and soil even after dilution ten times with tap water on plant growth level most the used crop species completely died except the halophyte species caroxylon imbricatum which tolerated irrigation of pw at level of 20 after that level the morphological growth and heavy metals accumulation start completely disturbed in addition medicago sativa tolerated 10 pw irrigation with a reduction in total growth intensity and length up to 33 of initial growth on soil level the main noted impacts were the huge increase in the sodicity and sar levels which interfere the soil physical characteristics as permeability and water flow so even after success in using diluted pw in irrigation of tolerated species the used soil must be treated after a period of the plantation to eliminate the accumulated salts and make some balance between na ca and mg to reduce the resulted sar by adding the gypsum salts acknowledgments the authors are grateful to total e p golfe ltd qatar for providing the produced water samples and funding this project special thanks to the central laboratories unit for

14294,in this study a greenhouse experiment of complete randomized design with three replications was conducted to investigate the potential of medicago sativa zea mays helianthus annus sorghum bicolor phragmites australis and caroxylon imbricatum in the removal of toxic pollutants from a produced water pw the collected local oil refinery wastewater was also characterized physically and chemically the concentration of the total dissolved solids tds chloride sodium boron ions and sodium adsorption ratio were 300 g l 122 g l 61 g l 0 038 g l and 139 9 meq l respectively results showed that except m sativa tolerated up to 10 diluted pw with a 30 decrease in length and biomass compared to control treatment all other plants could not survive however caroxylon imbricatum tolerated up to 20 diluted pw without any significant differences in the morphological characteristics the fourier transform infrared ftir results for c imbricatum tissues showed that cellulose structure had the greatest role in the metal adsorption and transportation inside the plant tissue this conclusion is verified by the shifting or disappearance in transmission bands at 1028 1334 2852 and 2921 cm 1 after pw treatment the soil with sandy loam texture used in this study showed a huge accumulation of sodium ions up to 17 6 103 mg kg the organic contents of the pw were below the detection limits of the gas chromatography gc and ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc instruments the results of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs extraction showed accumulation of less polar pahs in 30 irrigated soil keywords wastewater produced water phytoremediation metals organic pollutants 1 introduction sustainable management of water resources as a challenging concern is more complex in the gulf council countries gcc due to the harsh arid environment and increasing anthropogenic input of pollutants from different sectors the countries such as qatar rich in oil and gas but poor in water resource require sustainable development of water resource schemes the increasing population growth in the state of qatar has coupled with remarkable industrialization add more stress to the existing renewable water resources 1 3 qatar is considered as one of the highest water consuming countries in the world 99 of the country s municipal demand covered from desalinated water in addition to the annual growth in demand is about 10 1 over the last two decades the development of gulf societies has been thanks to the advances in desalination technologies powered by cheap fossil fuels there is however an obvious need to use new wastewater treatment method and a management plan to meet the local water demand according to qatar s development 1 produced water pw is produced from industrial activities such as gas oil tight sands coal bed methane and gas shale production on the quality and quantity of oil refinery pw greatly depends on the location and type of the petroleum compounds 4 pw is one of highest waste connected with oil and gas production in which the global ratio of wastewater to oil is 3 1 that means water cut is 70 5 while in qatar can reach 4 1 in some oil production fields 6 with increasing extraction offshore oil and gas industries and its development in harsh arctic environments needs for more active and intelligent offshore wastewater management increased in harsh arctic environmental areas are more sensitive to changes in water quality than more temperate climates however the number and scope of studies of offshore wastewater management in harsh arctic environments are limited the quality of pw differs significantly according to geographical location type of hydrocarbon manufactured and the geochemistry of the producing formation in general the total dissolved solids tds concentration are ranging from 100 to over 400 000 mg l sludge sodium particulates bicarbonate and chloride ions are the most commonly occurring inorganic constituents in pw benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex mixtures are the most commonly occurring organic pollutants in pw 4 the types the degree and cost of treatment required are dependent on the pollutants and their concentrations in the pw 7 different kinds of treatment processes could be used for pw treatment however selecting an appropriate treatment process varies according to initial composition of pw and the final target proposes after the treatment process the quality of the end product defined the purpose of use irrigation industries use stream flow and livestock watering most of the treatment processes such as filtration chemical processes and reverse osmosis are highly expensive which are more suitable for drinking purposes but are uneconomic for plant irrigation or livestock uses 8 around the world there is an increasing trend to apply innovative technology for pw remediation using phytoremediation or plant remediation 9 phytoremediation is a developing biotechnology highly suggested for the following reasons i low cost and solar driven remediation technology ii effective in superficial position with low contaminant level iii efficient in remediation of wide range of environmental pollutants iv useful in place of mechanical cleanup method and v environmentally friendly treatment 10 different plant species were successfully used in phytoremediation some were terrestrial and others were aquatic while terrestrial species have been found more effective in phytoremediation applications as they have larger root systems which enhance higher contaminations uptake so trees and grass species were commonly used bhupinder 2013 10 explored alfalfa sunflower indian mustard thalspi sp maize and sorghum which were more suitable due to their characteristics such as high biomass production biofuel production and fast growth 11 therefore the aims of this environmental study include characterization of one of a locally pw in qatar and applying it for the irrigation of four crop plant species helianthus annuus sunflower zea mays maize sorghum bicolor grain sorghum and medicago sativa alfalfa in addition two other species from qatari flora namely phragmites australis ghab and caroxylon imbricatum previously known as salsoa imbricata known to be salt tolerant and survive under contaminated soils were used 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil preparation the soil was collected from the mesaieed area in qatar the collected soil was kept dry in sunlight outside the greenhouse and then sieved at 2 mm sieve plate then it was mixed with peat moss purchased from the local market the peat moss composition is shown in table 1 the plant samples were then planted in 20 cm diameter plastic pots the soil was then mixed with peat moss by ratio 3 1 vol vol using five kg pot one hundred and eight pots were used for plantation experiment then 500 g of the mixed soil was packed in a plastic bag labeled as a control soil before treatment and transferred to the laboratory for further analysis 2 2 plantation seeds of four crop plant species sunflower maize alfalfa and grain sorghum were purchased from the local market while the seedlings of phragmitis sp ghab and caroxylon sp were collected from el khour area north of doha and the protected field of qatar university campus respectively seeds of the crop plants were sown in 18 pots as four seeds in each pot while the qatari plants were transferred directly from the natural habitat to the pots in the greenhouse each pot had one seedling for a total of 20 pots 18 pots were used in experiments and two pots for recovery if needed the irrigation was then started with tap water for the first ten days until healthy seedlings were obtained for all species then the pots were randomly divided into six groups each group contained three pots for each plant species group1 control tap water group2 treatment 1 10 pw group3 treatment 2 20 pw group4 treatment 3 30 pw group5 treatment 4 40

water was used for irrigation in the first ten days of plantation and continued for the control group each pot was irrigated with 150 ml every three days for each treatment group samples of 1 0 l for both pw and tap water were collected in the separate dark clean and sterile glass bottles and were transferred to the laboratory for chemical analysis 2 4 water characterization 2 4 1 physical

and medicago sativa were washed by 10 hypochlorite solution for fungal growth inhibition and then they were plated on filter paper in petri dish and watered with pw at different percentages 0 1 2 5 5 and 10 for four days under light and sterile conditions the effect of pw on germination of root and shoot systems were examined 3 results and discussion 3 1 water used in irrigation samples of tap water and pw used in the experiments were physically and chemically analyzed results are shown in tables 2 4 it can be concluded that the pw was a hypersaline according to 24 and the tds was more than 300 g l which confirms that the pw from a conventional oil well the results of cl na ca k and mg were 122 61 10 7 1 85 and 2 2 g l respectively these results were also coincided with 6 and 25 26 however nitrate and sulfate ions came in lowest concentrations 500 and 50 mg l respectively with similar trends to literature 27 30 the results of trace metals came in a lower range comparing to published results li was 4 mg l when it is range was 3 235 mg l b was 38 6 mg l comparing to 0 158 151 mg l be was 0 44 μg l when it was ranging between 0 1 4 μg l pb was 52 5 μg l compared to 2 10 200 μg l and zn was 63 μg l comparing to 5 35 000 μg l 5 27 29 30 boron is considered as one of the essential elements to cell wall structure and function in plant 31 but it is needed in moderately low quantities if excessive boron becomes toxic toxicity symptoms typically show first on older leaf tips and edges as either a yellowing spotting or drying of leaf tissues 32 the toxicity consequences for growth and yield were less serious for combined boron effect and salinity than what might be expected if impacts of the individual variables were additive 33 it was also noticed that organic contents btex of the pw were almost negligible this could be due to various reasons namely delay in delivering the pw to the laboratory slow mixing before collecting the samples from 1 m3 tank and the high temperature during delivery the average temperature during collected samples june month was 35 38 0c fig 1 a and b shows the gc chromatograms for the pw and the btex standard respectively the btex peaks appeared at retention time from 7 to 12 min fig 1b while at this time in sample chromatogram fig 1a the areas were very close to the noise of baseline which is referred to a low concentration of btex however the chromatogram showed that the sample was rich in the volatile organics beyond retention time from 20 to 30 min indicating the presence of heavier compounds which might be in the diesel range the btex results came incompatible with that illustrated in the literature as the btex were the highest organic concentration in pw 5 6 25 26 btex had the highest solubility products among the organic contamination 34 neff et al 2011 25 investigated the concentration of btex in pw and the results were 11170 278 1 4648 6 and 1156 8 μg l respectively neff 2002 2 also investigated three offshore productions and the btex results were 84 to 2300 μg l benzene 89 to 800 μg l toluene 26 to 110 μg l ethyl benzene and 13 to 480 μg l xylene dorea et al 2007 35 conducted a study on permian basin oil field and the results of btex were as following 1500 to 778 510 μg l benzene 100 μg l toluene 2010 to 399 840 μg l ethylbenzene and 10 to 460 μg l xylene ahan 2014 6 showed that the total btex was ranged from 4500 to 6740 μg l fig 2 a and b shows the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pahs chromatograms compared to standard result chromatogram it was shown that pahs results was 0 292 mg l fig 2b represents the pahs extracted from pw the resulting chromatogram shows very crowded peaks which are shifted toward the more polar compounds as their peaks started early at 11 min and finished at 30 min while in the standard chromatogram fig 2a the peaks started at 17 min and finished at 37 min according to the c18 column the more delayed peaks are the more nonpolar compounds some interferences such as high salinity increase pahs compounds in the pw rich in high polar compounds the result of 0 292 mg l pahs in the pw was moderate value comparing with 0 04 to 3 mg l in review study of 34 and 0 003 to 4540 mg l for 35 clearly the chemical oxygen demand cod was much higher than biological oxygen demand bod5 indicating low biodegradable of organic contents the results of this study were also compared with the values of fakhrul razi et al 2009 5 the comparison results are shown in table 5 it was noticed that the pw after dilution ten times had salinity slightly less than seawater 31 000 and 35 000 mg l respectively the sodium adsorption ratio sar was much higher 70 56 42 28 and 13 99 meq l for the pw percentages 50 40 30 20 and 10 respectively compared to control 0 13 meq l as the guidelines of 37 and 32 for irrigation water if irrigation water with a high sar was applied to soil for a long period the sodium in the water will displace the calcium and magnesium in the soil this will cause a decrease in the ability of the soil to form stable aggregates and a loss of soil structure and tilt this will also leads to a decrease in infiltration and permeability of the soil to water leading to problems with crop production according to soil texture the limit of sar is different such as for sandy soil the impact will be less problematic if sar was nine while it will have severe problems if the soil was fine texture 32 3 2 greenhouse experiment most of the plant species did not tolerate irrigation with the pw above 10 for more than one week except for caroxylon sp which was tolerated well at 30 for 20 days and at 20 for 35 days same as control which was irrigated with tap water fig 3 the average surviving days under pw percentages irrigation for different plant species are represented in fig 4 based on the number of surviving days of different plant species under pw irrigation it could be concluded that the main challenge of using pw in irrigation was the pw s salinity even at 20 irrigation the effect of high salinity appeared as dehydration for the green plants which is known as an osmotic shock due to an increase of ionic strength in irrigated solution more than in plant tissues 38 fig 5 shows the loss percentage of moisture for each plant species caroxylon sp has regular trend in the moisture loss with increasing the percentage of pw from control to 10 pw usage the species loss about 24 7 of its weight as moisture from 10 to 20 the plant loss about 30 of its weight as moisture while from 20 to 30 loss percentage was 15 weight then this loss percentage starts to reduce with increasing the pw percentage from 40 to 50 up to only 8 the main conclusion could be that caroxylon sp had a regular mechanism for moisture loss with pw irrigation and these mechanisms start to be dysfunctional after 20 pw while other plant species were completely irregular in their behavior mechanisms for moisture loss this could be due to difference in behaviors between halophytes and glycophytes under salinity conditions 39 caroxylon sp as halophyte tolerates drought and soil salinity with succulent leaves which means that the plant contains more stored water contents 38 under the effect of the pw irrigation the moisture lost percentages from caroxylon sp were higher than other species and has negative linear correlation with pw percentages statistical analysis for caroxylon sp showed no significant difference between the control experiment and the 10 and 20 pw irrigation while there were significant differences between the control and other experimental treatment irrigated with pw more than 20 in contrast caroxylon sp irrigated with 20 pw was more similar to that one grown in natural habitat rather than control treatment which irrigated with tap water the leaves shape hardness aggregation and stem hardness were completely different in tap water irrigation this may be due to the effect of salinity which agreed with 40 the caroxylon plant might be use salts in saline water to support its tissue structure and hardness or in the tolerance modifications which were similar in the natural habitats with 20 pw irrigation 38 40 41 3 2 1 metal analysis the metals results for the whole plant tissue of caroxylon sp are shown in fig 6 the metals were divided into two groups regarding their behavior the first group contains al ba co cr cs cu fe li mn pb v and zn fig 6a their concentrations in the plant were decreased compared to the 20 pw irrigation this could be explained by the fact that the feeding concentration was very small or the ion exchange mechanism was involved to give the plant chance to accumulate and tolerate the highest ions concentration similar conclusions were illustrated by others 42 44 for some sewage irrigated soils most concentration of metals in all the crops grown on sewage effluent irrigated soils were below the background levels the second group is na k ca mg b and nh4 fig 6b their concentrations were highly increased with 20 pw irrigation compared to control as a type of accumulation in response to pw irrigation 3 2 2 carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n percentages the great impact was seen on the c which was decreased from 35 9 to 16 13 with irrigation with the 20 pw this gave indication for biomass decreasing as impact for pw irrigation however this decreasing in carbon percentage became stable at 16 after 20 up to 40 pw irrigation the change in n was slightly small between control and 20 pw irrigation as it was 2 45 and 2 21 respectively while this change in nitrogen percentage increased after 20 to 30 of pw irrigation reaching to 1 6 the change in carbon and nitrogen percentages give indication that 20 of pw consider as critical tolerance point for caroxylon sp irrigation fig 6c carbon was highly affected comparing to nitrogen this might be due to c represent the biomass structure of storing materials inside the plant tissues while n represent the critical compounds such as proteins and amino acids 45 3 2 3 fourier transform infrared ftir spectra the ftir spectra fig 7 a and b were acquired using universal attenuated total reflectance uatr znse diamond crystal with no special sample preparation the changes in the ftir spectra were used to illustrate the changes in plant tissues structure with pw irrigation it was noticed from the ftir figures that the most effective component structure could be cellulose which is represent the highest percentages of plant tissue structure here the main functional groups oh co and ch2 oh were shifted and or disappeared under the adsorption of various metals this conclusion agreed with study of kumar et al 2017 46 on cellulose as bio sorbents 3 2 4 plant species growth after 10 days post treatment of 30 pw all plant species showed a complete damage except caroxylon sp caroxylon as halophyte has two types of resistance mechanisms i the first is the woody roots which have reduced cortex and endodermis and exoderms act as barriers for variable resistance of water flow ii the second is the succulent complex leaves 38 several morphological and anatomical structures met with halophyte plants give them the tolerance adaptation mechanisms such as salt secretary trichomes salt glands and salt accumulation 38 caroxylon sp are able to partition toxic salts into vacuoles or to exclude salt at the root zone so it does not affect cell metabolism and division 47 48 in case of medicago sativa alfalfa all pw treatments showed significant differences compared to control treatment medicago sativa alfalfa survived at 10 pw but with intensity reduction up to 33 of total number of individuals per pot in addition to reduction in shoot system length with an increase in root shoot ratio which give indication that plant try to reach more deeper soil layers fig 8 fig 8 compares between the growth of shoot and root of alfalfa at 10 pw irrigation with that one irrigated with tap water there was no significant difference in the root growth under 10 pw irrigation while the shoot growth has significance difference this notification gives an indication that pw affects the aboveground parts of the plant without effect on below ground parts those differences between the plant parts behavior might be as plant tolerance mechanisms to overcome the pw pollutants effect the shortage in shoot system agreed well with the results obtained by 49 after they recorded a decrease in growth as 7 2 in height and 5 9 in stem diameter of arundo sp after pw irrigation alfalfa survived with 10 pw irrigation in the greenhouse and was able to accumulate the highest concentration of b na li pb and zn in its tissues these results are compatible with torresdey et al 50 however it is not considered as a hyper accumulator according to definition illustrated by 51 55 fig 9 distributes the trace metals into two groups the first group in which the trace metals concentrations decreased with irrigation such as al ba co cr cs fe mn v ca ni and k those decreases might be due to ions exchange with the second group of metals where the ions and metals concentrations were very high in pw such as na b pb and zn while phragmites sp failed to grow due to its growth depend on what is known as running rhizomes so planting it in greenhouse pots limits its growth even in case of control normal growth was limited and not stable 3 3 germination test results the effect of pw on germination of root and shoot systems were examined the results of mean germination comparisons are shown in table 6 it can be concluded that growth of shoot system in case of sorghum did not show significant differences at 1 and 2 5 of pw compared to control while in case of medicago sp only 1 had no significance however the growth of the root system was only succeeded in case of 1 pw on medicago sp fig 10 a b that means the root systems of medicago sp was more tolerant to pw which was compatible with the greenhouse results at only 1 of pw there is no significant difference with tap water in length of shoot and root while at 2 5 5 and 10 of pw there are significant differences germination percentage seedling growth shoot length and root length were inhibited in 5 and 10 of pw while they were decreased in 2 5 pw however at 1 pw there were no differences in shoot and root growth rate compared to control caused as osmotic pressure due to higher salinity and toxicity 56 the osmotic pressure of the pw of high salt concentrations makes growth inhibition which agreed with the study of 57 3 4 soil results the composition of the collected soils was a sandy loam texture according to the usda triangle clay 12 7 silt 4 46 and sand 83 the dissolved salts in soil were increased exponentially with pw irrigation with a displacement of major anions and cations as illustrated in fig 11 a after tap water irrigation most ion concentration in soil decreased this decrease in ion concentration may due to plant utilization and or washing by tap water irrigation 60 the main notice from above results that the soil characterization changed in two ways first the ions abundance was completely changed from calcium to sodium as cation and from sulfate to chloride as anions second change was the regular and exponential increase of na and cl ions with the increase of pw concentration while in case ca mg and so4 ions the increasing was irregular these might be a result of the differences in plant consumption and utilization as illustrated in fig 11a fig 11b illustrates the changes in sar value in the soil before the irrigation with pw and after irrigation with different percentages of pw from the graph there is very small difference between control soils before irrigation with tap water and after that difference may be due to irrigation creates washing for soil and plant consumption for salts ions na ca mg are the same while with pw irrigation the sar value increased from 0 7 at control to 9 8 meq l in 20 pw it jumped from normal value to restricted value but no differences between 10 and 20 as the plant consumption factor still interfere in salts accumulation and distribution between plant tissues and soils however in case of 30 the sar value jumped to severely restricted when it was 29 meq l due to the absence of plant consumption and all salts accumulated only in soil accumulation of salts in soil not only increase the sodicity and salinity but also has second impacts on the physical properties of soil such as permeability as the sar increases to severe effect the permeability of soil to water infiltration is decreased to cause more difficult to supply the crop with water and may greatly add to cropping difficulties through crusting of seedbeds waterlogging of surface soil and accompanying disease if too many quantities of soluble salts accumulate in the rhizosphere the crops have more difficulties in uptaking enough water from the salty soil solution 43 61 63 this decreased water extraction by the plant can result in slow or poor growth and may be shown by symptoms similar in appearance to those of drought such as early wilting the metals in soil were divided into three groups according to the behavior changes first group of metals had the same behavior of as ba co cr cs cu fe li mn pb and v fig 12 a which slightly variation or little increased with increase the percentage of pw in irrigation second group contained al na k and b fig 12b were sharply increased with pw percentage increasing while the third group contained ca mg and zn fig 12c which were decreased with pw percentage increase all these differences in behavior would be coming from the concentration of metals in feeding irrigation water the trace metals used in irrigation were very small while na k b ca mg and zn were very high concentration however with the differences in their plant utilization na k and b were increased and accumulated in soil while ca mg and zn were consumed and their concentration reduced throughout control 10 and 20 irrigation however at 30 irrigation the plant utilization is lost so the concentration increased again fig 12d one of the major constraints for pw irrigation includes sits negative impacts on soil quality regarding the accumulation of heavy metal ions and the contamination of ground water on long term usage however the pw dilutions utilized for this experiment had a value of trace metals below the permissible limits the changes in soil properties agreed with 43 61 63 it appears that the accumulation of carbon compounds have the same behavior of nitrogen compounds these may be due to both presents in the same structure or both are related to the same bioavailability hardness carbon accumulation percentage is correlated with the organic accumulation incoming title it is clear that from control to 10 20 pw accumulation is smooth and gradually increases while it has sharpness at 30 pw fig 13 a b the organic accumulation was below detection limits of uplc and gc in most irrigated soil samples after one month irrigation with 10 and 20 of pw while it started to detected at 30 pw irrigation at the same period of irrigation on both types pahs and diesel range with slight differences in concentration and individuals the main notification is that organics accumulated in soil were the less polar or completely nonpolar compounds as they shifted to more retention time up to 41 min more than the standard of pahs used which ends at 37 min also completely differed than pahs were extracted from the pw itself fig 2b which ends at 30 min these indicate that the original pahs from the pw were divided into two groups first which is more polar start disappear from rhizosphere soil might be throw plant degradation or migrate more deeper in soil layers with water and a second group which was less polar or non polar which accumulated in rhizosphere zone 4 conclusion and recommendation in this study the used pw showed a great impact on both plant and soil even after dilution ten times with tap water on plant growth level most the used crop species completely died except the halophyte species caroxylon imbricatum which tolerated irrigation of pw at level of 20 after that level the morphological growth and heavy metals accumulation start completely disturbed in addition medicago sativa tolerated 10 pw irrigation with a reduction in total growth intensity and length up to 33 of initial growth on soil level the main noted impacts were the huge increase in the sodicity and sar levels which interfere the soil physical characteristics as permeability and water flow so even after success in using diluted pw in irrigation of tolerated species the used soil must be treated after a period of the plantation to eliminate the accumulated salts and make some balance between na ca and mg to reduce the resulted sar by adding the
