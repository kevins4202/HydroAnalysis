765,the budyko framework bf has been used to predict evaporation e at annual or monthly time scales but few studies have analyzed the errors in the predicted e in a systematic manner this study develops an error decomposition framework which expresses the errors in the bf predicted annual and monthly e as a function of 1 the anomalies i e deviations from the long term mean of precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet runoff r and catchment water storage change δs 2 the long term mean water storage change and 3 the mean difference between the predicted and actual e the error variance of bf predicted e can be decomposed into the variance and covariance terms of p pet r and δs the relative contribution of each of these controlling factors to the total error variance of e are evaluated at 14 major river basins in china with the mean annual aridity index ranging between 0 55 and 11 78 it is found that climatic factors p and pet and catchment responses r and δs play different roles in the errors of predicted e among diverse climates of 14 basins under the humid energy limited condition the variance and covariance terms of p pet r and δs are comparably important in the contribution to the prediction error variance of e in contrast under the arid water limited condition the error variance of predicted e is dominated by the magnitude of δs anomalies results of this study suggest that the incorporation of δs into bf can improve the predictability of annual and monthly e more under the arid climates than humid climates keywords evaporation budyko framework prediction error controlling factors 1 introduction understanding the partitioning of precipitation p into evapotranspiration e runoff r and change in terrestrial water storage and its controls by various climatic factors and heterogeneous landscape characteristics over different time scales are of fundamental challenges for hydrologists budyko 1958 postulated that the long term mean catchment scale e is controlled mainly by available water represented by p and energy represented by potential evapotranspiration pet according to the budyko hypothesis the actual e is controlled by p under arid climates while under humid climates it is constrained mainly by pet based on the budyko hypothesis numerous water energy balance equations have been derived e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 2004 porporato et al 2004 yang et al 2008 gerrits et al 2009 which provide a fundamental framework for quantitative descriptions of long term mean annual water balance in terms of climatic variables zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2007 yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 although the budyko framework bf was originally proposed to be applied at the long term mean time scale under the assumption of the steady state water balance recent efforts were directed to extend bf to assess catchment scale water balance at annual or monthly time scales e g koster and suarez 1999 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 zhang et al 2008 yang et al 2007 2009 potter and zhang 2009 cheng et al 2011 carmona et al 2014 yu et al 2013 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 tekleab et al 2011 du et al 2016 wu et al 2017a 2017b wang et al 2018 the overall results from these studies indicated that bf has the potential to characterize water balance at finer time scales in spite of the decrease in prediction accuracy donohue et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 estimation of annual e by bf has been proven reliable in non humid regions yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2004 but tends to be less accurate in humid regions likely due to more complex interactions between climate factors and catchment properties wu et al 2017b wang et al 2018 water storage changes δs play an important role in annual or monthly water balance and can be a key factor controlling the intra annual and interannual variability of e particularly in extremely arid regions wu et al 2017a zhang et al 2008 emphasized the inaccuracy of using bf to estimate e at annual or finer time scales due to the omission of the effects of δs for the application of bf to shorter time scales the incorporate δs into bf was suggested for better closing the water budget zhang et al 2008 wang 2012 zeng cai 2015 wang et al 2018 however wu et al 2017b found that most improvements in predicted annual and monthly e due to the incorporation of δs into bf are in arid regions and little improvement was found in humid regions the dynamics of annual and monthly catchment water balance are generally at the non steady state and controlled not only by the differences in water supply p and energy supply pet but also by other factors related to vegetation topography and other catchment properties feng et al 2012 carmona et al 2014 zeng and cai 2016 despite numerous efforts can be found in the assessment of bf prediction at annual or monthly time scales e g zhang et al 2008 yang et al 2007 2009 potter and zhang 2009 cheng et al 2011 carmona et al 2014 yu et al 2013 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 tekleab et al 2011 du et al 2016 wu et al 2017b wang et al 2018 none or few studies have attempted a systematic analysis on the errors in the predicted e by bf accurate evaluation of predication errors and understanding of the potential sources of prediction errors are essential to enhance the predictability of bf at annual or monthly time scales the aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the accuracy of bf predicted annual and monthly e in an analytical framework by using a unique multiple sources long term 1984 2008 datasets covering most water budget variables including p e r and δs over the entire china recently developed by zhang et al 2018 we address the following important science questions in this study 1 what are the major factors controlling the errors in bf predicted e under diverse climatic conditions and catchment properties 2 how do climatic variables p and pet and catchment response runoff r and δs affect the errors in bf predicted e at the interannual and intra annual time scales 3 why the incorporation of δs into bf can improve the accuracy of predicted e more under arid climates than humid climates this paper is organized as follows in section 2 an error decomposition analysis framework of bf is proposed for evaluating the errors in predicted e and the major controlling factors in the errors of predicted e are identified for different climatic conditions section 3 introduces the terrestrial water budget dataset used in this study and the study domain i e 14 major river basins covering the entire china in section 4 the proposed error decomposition analysis framework is applied to 14 basins in china to assess the errors in bf predicted annual and monthly e section 5 discusses the physical meanings and implications of the error analysis results before the main findings from this study are summarized in section 6 2 theoretical framework for error analysis 2 1 error decomposition several equations describing the coupling of water and energy balances are termed as the budyko curves among which the following fu s equation is one of the most widely used fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 1 e i p i f ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i ω 1 ω where ϕ i p e t i p i is the aridity index at the ith time interval and ω is a parameter representing the effects of other factors such as land vegetation characteristics and climate seasonality on the water energy balance partitioning li et al 2013 wu et al 2017a in this paper the parameter ω is estimated by the least square method for the 14 major river basins as shown in fig 1 at both annual and monthly time scales the linear approximation off φ i near the long term mean aridity index ϕ i e p e t p can be written as follows zeng and cai 2015 2 f ϕ i f ϕ f ϕ ϕ i ϕ f ϕ f ϕ δ ϕ i where f ϕ denotes the first order derivative of f φ i the anomaly i e the deviation from the long term mean of the aridity index at the ith time interval δφ i can be expressed as 3 δ ϕ i ϕ i ϕ p e t i p i p e t p p e t i p p e t p i p i p p e t i p p p e t p p e t p e t p i p i p δ p e t i ϕ δ p i p i where δ p e t i p e t i p e t and δ p i p i p in this study the e from the terrestrial water budget dataset of zhang et al 2018 hereafter as the actual eo see the details of this dataset in section 3 will be compared with the e predicted by bf hereafter as the predicted ep the anomaly ofep at the ith time interval δe p i can be expressed as 4 δ e p i e p i e p p i f ϕ i p f ϕ substituting eq 2 into eq 4 yields 5 δ e p i p i f ϕ f ϕ δ ϕ i p f ϕ substitutingδφ i from eq 3 into eq 5 yields 6 δ e p i f ϕ ϕ f ϕ δ p i f ϕ δ p e t i the error of ep at the ith time interval eri can be expressed as 7 e r i e p i e o i δ e r i e r where δeri is the anomaly of er at the ith time interval which can be expressed as 8 δ e r i e r i e r e p i e o i e p e o e p i e p e o i e o δ e p i δ e o i i e the difference between the anomalies of ep and eo according to the terrestrial water balance equation δe o i can be expressed in terms of p r and δs as follows 9 δ e o i e o i e o p i r i δ s i p r δ s p i p r i r δ s i δ s δ p i δ r i δ s i δ s where δpi and δri represent the anomalies of p and r respectively substituting eqs 6 and 9 into eq 8 yields 10 e r i e r f ϕ ϕ f ϕ 1 δ p i f ϕ δ p e t i δ r i δ s i δ s therefore the error of ep at the ith time interval eri can be expressed as 11 e r i w p δ p i w p e t δ p e t i δ r i δ s i δ s e r where w p f ϕ ϕ f ϕ 1 and w p e t f ϕ are the weighting functions explicitly expressed as functions of the long term aridity index ϕ and the parameter ω eq 11 shows that the error of ep at the ith time interval can be decomposed into six terms representing respectively the effects of the anomalies of p pet r and δs the long term mean water storage change δ s and the long term mean difference between ep and eo the sensitivity of the weighting functions wp and wpet to the long term mean water supply p and energy supply p e t is illustrated in fig 2 as seen wp wpet varies within the range of 1 to 0 0 to 1 given a fixed p the influence of wp tends to be weaker as the basin becomes hotter i e larger pet and vice versa given a fixed p e t the influence of wp tends to be more significant as the basin becomes wetter i e larger p and vice versa similarly wpet approaches one under the humid cool climate i e large p and small pet and approaches zero under the dry hot climate i e small p and large pet that is the contributions of p and pet anomalies to the errors in ep are significant under the humid cool climate i e large p and small pet but can be negligible under the arid hot climate i e small p and large pet since bf is relatively accurate at the long term mean time scale zhang et al 2008 wu et al 2017b e r is generally small compared with the other five terms in eq 11 also the mean water storage change δ s without the human influence such as pumping and water impoundment is generally small and hence negligible thus eq 11 can be further simplified as 12 e r i w p δ p i w p e t δ p e t i δ r i δ s i which states that the error of ep at the ith time interval is the function of the corresponding anomalies of p pet r and δs and the weighting functions wp and wpet 2 2 error variance decomposition by neglecting the mean water storage change δ s and taking the square of eq 10 summing over n sample and scaled by n 1 the sample error variance can be expressed as 13 σ 2 e r w 2 p σ 2 p w 2 p e t σ 2 p e t σ 2 r σ 2 δ s 2 w p w p e t c o v p p e t 2 w p c o v p r 2 w p c o v p δ s 2 w p e t c o v p e t r 2 w p e t c o v p e t δ s 2 c o v r δ s where σ2 and cov represent the variance and covariance term respectively the total variance of errors in the bf predicted e ep is decomposed into the variance and covariance terms of p pet r and δs including the variance of climate forcing σ2 p andσ2 pet the coincidence of water and energy supply cov p pet and the catchment response to climate forcing i e all the two variance and five covariance terms associated with r and δs in eq 13 under the extremely arid climates the weighting functions wp and wpet are both negligible fig 2 in this case eqs 12 and 13 can be reduced to the following form 14a e r i δ r i δ s i 14b σ 2 e r σ 2 r σ 2 δ s 2 c o v r δ s eq 14 indicates that the variance of r andδs and the covariance between them together determine the error variance under the extremely arid climates as almost all p are consumed by e under the extremely arid climates and r is negligible δs can be the only factor in determining the errors of ep in contrast under humid climates wp wpet is close to 1 to 1 indicating that the variances of p and pet have the largest contributions to the errors in ep in this case of humid climates the variances of all hydro climatic variables i e p pet r and δs and their covariance terms contribute to the errors in ep as shown in eq 13 3 study area and data the global long term 1984 2010 monthly terrestrial water budget dataset including p e r and δs was recently developed at the 0 5 grid resolution by zhang et al 2018 by using a constrained kalman filter data assimilation technique available at http stream princeton edu 8080 opendap measures wc multisources wb 050 this dataset is based on multiple data sources including in situ ground observations remote sensing retrievals land surface model simulations and global reanalysis data this dataset can effectively bridge the gaps between sparsely gauged regions and the regions with abundant ground observations compared to most large scale e dataset from only one single data source this dataset is considered as best available global monthly e datasets more detailed descriptions of data sources data assimilation procedures and uncertainty quantification can be found in zhang et al 2018 the 0 5 resolution 25 year 1984 2008 monthly data of p e r and δs over the entire china were used in this study in addition the 1984 2008 monthly pet dataset at the global 1 grid resolution provided by the terrestrial hydrology research group of princeton university sheffield et al 2006 2012 were disaggregated into the 0 5 0 5 grids over the entire china using the linear interpolation to be used in this study the mainland of china can be divided into 14 major river basins as shown in fig 1 there 14 major river basins under widely diverse climates with the mean annual aridity index ϕ ranging from 0 55 to 11 78 are chosen to be the study areas table 1 according to mcvicar et al 2012 they can be broadly classified into three groups based on the aridity index 1 the energy limited condition with ϕ 0 76 including the southeast drainage basin ϕ 0 55 and pearl river basin ϕ 0 66 2 the intermediate condition with ϕ ranging from 0 76 to 1 35 including the yangtze ϕ 0 85 southwest drainage ϕ 1 08 and huaihe river ϕ 1 21 basins and 3 the water limited condition with ϕ 1 35 including the remaining 9 basins the mean annual e is rather small in the northwest regions mostly under the water limited condition and tends to increase significantly toward the southeast regions mostly under the energy limited condition fig 1 4 results 4 1 geographical patterns of the errors in predicted e the evaluation of the predicted annual and monthly e by comparisons with the actual e data from zhang et al 2018 over the 14 major river basins of china is summarized in table 1 the following statistical indicators are used in the evaluation nse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient re the relative percentage of prediction errors e r the mean prediction errors and σ er the standard deviation of prediction errors also the 1984 2008 predicted annual e and the actual e are compared in fig 3 for each of 14 basins from table 1 the accuracy of both annual and monthly predicted e tends to increase with a larger nse as moving from humid to arid basins e contains larger biases with a larger re at monthly than annual scale for most basins suggesting that bf is more accurate to predict annual than monthly e the predicted e has the long term 1984 2008 mean errors the relative errors in percentage ranging across 14 basins 0 17 4 53 mm 0 02 1 18 for annual e and 1 73 12 52 mm 7 9 38 9 for monthly e table 1 for the mean monthly e the xinjiang basin has the largest underestimation 7 90 while the qiangtang basin has the largest overestimation 38 92 the temporal variability of the prediction errors in e as quantified by the standard deviation of errors σ er and the relative variability to the variability of actual e i e σ er σ e tend to be larger in more humid basins with smaller aridity indices particularly for annual e specifically the prediction errors in both annual and monthly e show larger interannual intra annual variability in the haihe southwest drainage basin than other more humid basins 4 2 analysis of the components of errors in the predicted e the 1984 2008 annual fig 4 and monthly fig 5 time series of the prediction errors i e ep minuseo are compared with that calculated from eq 11 at 14 major river basins in china as seen from fig 4 the eq 11 performs well for all basins at annual time scale with the nse ranging between 0 910 and 0 998 fig 4 however the discrepancy of eq 11 tends to be larger at the monthly time scale fig 5 particularly for the southeast drainage ϕ 0 55 nse 0 556 pearl ϕ 0 66 nse 0 446 and haihe ϕ 2 28 nse 0 512 where the discrepancies between two monthly time series of prediction errors are apparently larger than all other basins overall the eq 11 predicts reasonably well the errors in both predicted annual and monthly e with a high mean correlation coefficient r of 0 991 annual and 0 878 monthly respectively fig 6 a and b the wettest southeast drainage basin ϕ 0 55 and the driest hexi ϕ 11 78 basin table 1 are chosen to be the most representative energy limited and water limited basin in the following analysis respectively the respective contribution from each of the six terms in eq 11 to the prediction errors in annual e is compared in fig 7 a for the southeast drainage basin ϕ 0 55 both p and r anomaly terms exhibit relatively larger interannual variability than other four terms for the hexi basin ϕ 11 78 the interannual variability of δs term is considerably larger than that in the southeast drainage basin and this term has the largest contribution to the prediction error of e the p and r anomaly terms are always with the opposite sign and thus their combined effects become somewhat cancelled out the mean error e r is smaller than the other five terms in eq 11 and hence negligible and it generally decreases from humid to arid basins it is of interests to note that the mean δs term is negligible in the southeast drainage basin but is relatively large in the hexi basin suggesting that the long term mean storage change needs to be considered in analyzing the prediction errors of bf in the hexi basin similar to that found above for the predicted annual e in the southeast drainage basin the errors in predicted monthly e are affected by all hydro climate variables considered p pet r and δs fig 7 b in contrast for the hexi basin the temporal variability of δs dominates the errors in predicted monthly e finally the mean prediction errors e r of monthly e are negative positive in the southeast drainage basin hexi basin suggesting that bf tends to under predicts over predicts the long term mean e in the southeast drainage hexi basin overall both the mean error and mean δs terms in eq 11 are relatively small compared with other four terms and hence can be negligible in the prediction errors of monthly e 4 3 analysis of error variance in the predicted e the error variance derived in eq 13 is compared to that based on theep minuseo at the annual and monthly time scales fig 6 c and d as seen the error variance has large variability across 14 basins ranging between 0 2800 mm2 year 2 annual and 0 400 mm2 month 2 monthly the r between the predicted and the actual error variances at annual and monthly time scales are 0 996 and 0 916 respectively indicating that eq 13 can well predict the actual error variances of e at both time scales the absolute variance is generally larger in more humid basins table 2 but the prediction is more accurate in arid than humid basins as shown in fig 6 c and d the total annual and monthly error variance of the predicted e and the relative contribution from each term in eq 13 are plotted in fig 8 and also summarized in table 2 as shown in fig 8 the contributions from the terms associated with p and pet tend to decrease from the humid to arid basins particularly at the annual time scale on the contrary the contributions to the variances from the δs term σ2 δs and r term σ2 r and their covariance term 2cov r δs tend to increase from the humid to arid basins in humid basins the variance terms of p wp 2σ2 p and r σ2 r and their covariance term 2wpcov p r together account for more than 50 of both annual error variance in the southeast drainage 75 1 pearl 74 7 and yangtze 66 7 basins and monthly error variance in the southeast drainage 61 5 pearl 59 8 and yangtze 58 2 basins the variance terms of δs σ2 δs and r σ2 r and their covariance term 2wpcov p r together has the most positive contributions to the error variance in the extremely arid basins such as the inner mongolia 60 8 and heixi 52 7 basins at the annual time scale and the inner mongolia 63 4 xinjiang 52 5 and heixi 80 8 basins at the monthly time scale it is interesting to note that the variance term of pet i e wpet σ2 pet is generally small compared with other terms at both time scales suggesting that the effects of pet on error variance can be neglected in addition a positive negative contribution from the cov p pet term to the annual monthly error variance is found at all 14 basins since the weighting function2wpwpet in eq 13 is always negative thus the positive negative contribution is caused by the negative positive cov p pet due to the out of phase interannual in phase seasonal pattern between them 5 discussion 5 1 impact of catchment characteristics on error variance of e the parameter ω in eq 1 represents catchment characteristics which are relates to many factors such as vegetation coverage yang et al 2009 li et al 2013 the effective rooting depth and plant root characteristics cong et al 2015 donohue et al 2012 previous studies have reported some empirical relationships between ω and various catchment characteristics e g yang et al 2007 2009 li et al 2013 in general a large ω results in higher e and lower r and a catchment with sufficient storage capacity more vegetation coverage and a flat terrain correspond to a large ω zeng and cai 2015 the effect of different ω on the weighting functions of p and pet in eq 13 is investigated in fig 9 as seen a small ω has more contributions from p to the error variance than a large ω and the difference tends to be more significant in arid regions fig 9 a as shown in fig 9 b for a large ω the contribution from pet to the error variance tends to be more significant under wetter climates aridity index 1 35 while for a small ω the contribution from pet tends to be more significant under drier climates aridity index 1 35 the contribution from the covariance term of p and pet i e wpwpet is significant under humid climates for a large ω fig 9 c the above analyses imply that vegetation conditions can contribute to the error variance of predicted e under various climatic conditions however the clear effects of the vegetation type on error variance remains to be explored since pet has different sensitivities to climate in different vegetated areas williams et al 2012 future work needs to be focused on the relationship between catchment physical properties and ω to better understand the role of vegetation and other catchment characteristics in the error variance of predicted e 5 2 the error decomposition framework in this study the prediction errors and error variance of the bf predicted e are quantified and the main sources of errors under contrasting climatic conditions are identified at both annual and monthly time scales which potentially can provide a new possibility for improving the water balance prediction from the budyko framework at the finer time scales the error decomposition method i e eq 11 is derived based on the linear approximation of the budyko equation eq 2 by neglecting the effects of higher order terms in fact the budyko curve governing the long term water balance is nonlinear and hence the linear approximation can lead to an uncertainty in predicted e yang et al 2014 pointed out that the error due to the first order approximation can vary as p pet and ω change as shown in eq 13 the error variance in predicted e is affected by the variability of climate seasonality through the coincidence of water and energy supply 2wpwpetcov p pet in case of the first order approximation the error variability in predicted e is likely to be larger due to strong climate seasonality at the intra annual seasonal scale whereby leading to a less reliable estimation of error such as in the southeast drainage pearl huaihe and haihe basin fig 5 therefore a more accurate error analysis method considering the higher order effects is expected to improve the predictability of bf and assess the error sources of predicted e this study incorporates the influences of catchment water storage change including soil moisture surface water storage and groundwater storage into bf analytically and quantify the error variance of the predicted e the error variance is influenced by storage changes via the covariance terms in eq 13 and the error source is found to be dominated by water storage changes in arid regions such as the hexi basin fig 7 in addition the extreme intensity rain and snowfall can also have important influences on the temporal variability of water balances in summer winter likely resulting in a large variation of seasonal e therefore the response of extreme intensity rain and snowfall to climate should also be incorporated into the framework of error analysis in this study as discussed above the temporal variability of errors in predicted e mainly reflects the hydro climatic variability of the basin suggesting that understanding the temporal variability of prediction errors can provide useful information related to the sensitivity of water budgets to climate changes and anthropogenic intervention in general e is not only influenced by natural factors such as climate and vegetation but also by human activities such as groundwater pumping and irrigation destouni et al 2012 lo and famiglietti 2013 pokhrel et al 2015 zeng and cai 2015 2016 pan et al 2017 human intervention is potentially another important source of errors in the predicted e by bf particularly for regions with intense human activities such as the haihe basin in china the human adaptation to climate is likely to be characterized by the covariances between catchment water storage changes and climate forcing i e cov p δs andcov pet δs the proposed error analysis framework in this study can be applied to evaluate the impacts of human activities on the predictability of bf recent studies have reported the use of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to detect human induced changes of e at regional scale pan et al 2017 future research can be directed to characterize anthropogenic signals by using grace terrestrial water storage data over the regions to improve the predictability of bf 5 3 discussion of the case study in this study we applied the error decomposition analysis to 14 major river basins in china to investigate how climatic variables and catchment properties affect the errors in the bf predicted e under diverse climates the results underscore the significant roles of both climate forcing p and pet and catchment response r and δs in the errors of the bf predicted e under humid climates and the dominant role of δs in the prediction errors under arid climates fig 7 the latter also provides a physical support for incorporating δs into bf which can considerably improve the bf predictions of e at shorter time scales annual and monthly in arid regions but less effective in humid regions a finding consistent with that reported by wu et al 2017b although the error decomposition method generally works well for most of the 14 river basins in this study large residual errors can be identified in certain years for some basins such as southeast drainage 2003 and 2004 at annual time scale fig 4 and southeast drainage pearl huaihe and haihe at monthly time scale fig 5 the residual errors can in part be attributed to the linear approximation of the budyko equation eq 2 and other possible error sources such as the extreme intensity rainfall as discussed above on the other hand the water budget data used in this study were created by combining multiple data sources through the data assimilation techniques the non closure errors in the individual water budget products inevitably result in large uncertainty in the spatio temporal variability of estimated water budgets zhang et al 2018 which also contribute to the residual errors for example the qiangtang basin which is more arid than the southeast drainage basin but less arid than the hexi basin has the smallest contribution of δs and the largest contribution of r to the error variance of e among all basins considered fig 8 this is possible largely due to the effects of residual errors caused by error uncertainty in data source in addition the variability of climate seasonality can strongly affect water balance particularly at the intra annual scale wu et al 2017a indicated that the interaction covariance between p and pet can dampen the interannual variance of e and increase the intra annual variance over the 14 river basins studied correspondingly this study found an in phase seasonal pattern between pet and p for all 14 river basins which tends to dampen the error variance of predicted e at monthly time scale fig 8 for future work it would be interesting to examine how the out of phase seasonal pattern between p and pet for both water limited and energy limited conditions affects the error variability in bf predicted e at the intra annual time scale 6 conclusions this study attempts to quantify the dominant controls on the errors of the bf predicted e by developing an analytical framework of error decomposition which was applied to 14 major river basins in china with the long term 1984 2008 mean annual aridity index ranging from 0 55 to 11 78 in this framework the errors and error variance of the predicted annual and monthly e are expressed analytically as a function of the anomalies i e the deviations from the long term mean in each time step and the variances and covariances of p pet r and δs the contribution to the errors of predicted e from each controlling factor p pet r and δs is evaluated the limitation of the developed error decomposition framework and the effect of catchment characteristics on the prediction errors are discussed the results show that the temporal variability of the errors of predicted annual and monthly e and the ratio of this temporal variability of errors to that of e tend to be larger under more humid climates the climate forcing factors p and pet and catchment responses r and δs play considerably different roles in the makeup of prediction errors of e depending on climatic conditions in humid regions the variance and covariance terms of p pet r and δs are comparably more important in the contribution to prediction errors for the studied humid ϕ 1 35 basins in china the variance and covariance terms of p and r account for most of the error variance in the predicted annual e e g southeast drainage 75 1 pearl 74 7 and yangtze 66 7 and the predicted monthly e e g southeast drainage 61 5 pearl 59 8 and yangtze 58 2 in arid regions the variance and covariance terms of δs and r account for most of the error variance in the predicted annual e e g inner mongolia 60 8 and heixi 52 7 and the predicted monthly e e g inner mongolia 63 4 xinjiang 52 5 and heixi 80 8 in particular the error of bf predicted e can be mainly attributed to the temporal variability of δs under extremely arid climates due to the negligible r fluctuations this study provides a physical quantitative support that the incorporation of δs into bf can improve the predictability of annual and monthly e under the arid climates more than humid climates acknowledgments this work was supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities grant no 21617301 and the national natural science foundation of china grant

765,the budyko framework bf has been used to predict evaporation e at annual or monthly time scales but few studies have analyzed the errors in the predicted e in a systematic manner this study develops an error decomposition framework which expresses the errors in the bf predicted annual and monthly e as a function of 1 the anomalies i e deviations from the long term mean of precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet runoff r and catchment water storage change δs 2 the long term mean water storage change and 3 the mean difference between the predicted and actual e the error variance of bf predicted e can be decomposed into the variance and covariance terms of p pet r and δs the relative contribution of each of these controlling factors to the total error variance of e are evaluated at 14 major river basins in china with the mean annual aridity index ranging between 0 55 and 11 78 it is found that climatic factors p and pet and catchment responses r and δs play different roles in the errors of predicted e among diverse climates of 14 basins under the humid energy limited condition the variance and covariance terms of p pet r and δs are comparably important in the contribution to the prediction error variance of e in contrast under the arid water limited condition the error variance of predicted e is dominated by the magnitude of δs anomalies results of

scale e is controlled mainly by available water represented by p and energy represented by potential evapotranspiration pet according to the budyko hypothesis the actual e is controlled by p under arid climates while under humid climates it is constrained mainly by pet based on the budyko hypothesis numerous water energy balance equations have been derived e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 2004 porporato et al 2004 yang et al 2008 gerrits et al 2009 which provide a fundamental framework for quantitative descriptions of long term mean annual water balance in terms of climatic variables zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2007 yang et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 although the budyko framework bf was originally proposed to be applied at the long term mean time scale under the assumption of the steady state water balance recent efforts were directed to extend bf to assess catchment scale water balance at annual or monthly time scales e g koster and suarez 1999 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2002 zhang et al 2008 yang et al 2007 2009 potter and zhang 2009 cheng et al 2011 carmona et al 2014 yu et al 2013 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 tekleab et al 2011 du et al 2016 wu et al 2017a 2017b wang et al 2018 the overall results from these studies indicated that bf has the potential to characterize water balance at finer time scales in spite of the decrease in prediction accuracy donohue et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 estimation of annual e by bf has been proven reliable in non humid regions yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2004 but tends to be less accurate in humid regions likely due to more complex interactions between climate factors and catchment properties wu et al 2017b wang et al 2018 water storage changes δs play an important role in annual or monthly water balance and can be a key factor controlling the intra annual and interannual variability of e particularly in extremely arid regions wu et al 2017a zhang et al 2008 emphasized the inaccuracy of using bf to estimate e at annual or finer time scales due to the omission of the effects of δs for the application of bf to shorter time scales the incorporate δs into bf was suggested for better closing the water budget zhang et al 2008 wang 2012 zeng cai 2015 wang et al 2018 however wu et al 2017b found that most improvements in predicted annual and monthly e due to the incorporation of δs into bf are in arid regions and little improvement was found in humid regions the dynamics of annual and monthly catchment water balance are generally at the non steady state and controlled not only by the differences in water supply p and energy supply pet but also by other factors related to vegetation topography and other catchment properties feng et al 2012 carmona et al 2014 zeng and cai 2016 despite numerous efforts can be found in the assessment of bf prediction at annual or monthly time scales e g zhang et al 2008 yang et al 2007 2009 potter and zhang 2009 cheng et al 2011 carmona et al 2014 yu et al 2013 chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 tekleab et al 2011 du et al 2016 wu et al 2017b wang et al 2018 none or few studies have attempted a systematic analysis on the errors in the predicted e by bf accurate evaluation of predication errors and understanding of the potential sources of prediction errors are essential to enhance the predictability of bf at annual or monthly time scales the aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the accuracy of bf predicted annual and monthly e in an analytical framework by using a unique multiple sources long term 1984 2008 datasets covering most water budget variables including p e r and δs over the entire china recently developed by zhang et al 2018 we address the following important science questions in this study 1 what are the major factors controlling the errors in bf predicted e under diverse climatic conditions and catchment properties 2 how do climatic variables p and pet and catchment response runoff r and δs affect the errors in bf predicted e at the interannual and intra annual time scales 3 why the incorporation of δs into bf can improve the accuracy of predicted e more under arid climates than humid climates this paper is organized as follows in section 2 an error decomposition analysis framework of bf is proposed for evaluating the errors in predicted e and the major controlling factors in the errors of predicted e are identified for different climatic conditions section 3 introduces the terrestrial water budget dataset used in this study and the study domain i e 14 major river basins covering the entire china in section 4 the proposed error decomposition analysis framework is applied to 14 basins in china to assess the errors in bf predicted annual and monthly e section 5 discusses the physical meanings and implications of the error analysis results before the main findings from this study are summarized in section 6 2 theoretical framework for error analysis 2 1 error decomposition several equations describing the coupling of water and energy balances are termed as the budyko curves among which the following fu s equation is one of the most widely used fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 1 e i p i f ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i ω 1 ω where ϕ i p e t i p i is the aridity index at the ith time interval and ω is a parameter representing the effects of other factors such as land vegetation characteristics and climate seasonality on the water energy balance partitioning li et al 2013 wu et al 2017a in this paper the parameter ω is estimated by the least square method for the 14 major river basins as shown in fig 1 at both annual and monthly time scales the linear approximation off φ i near the long term mean aridity index ϕ i e p e t p can be written as follows zeng and cai 2015 2 f ϕ i f ϕ f ϕ ϕ i ϕ f ϕ f ϕ δ ϕ i where f ϕ denotes the first order derivative of f φ i the anomaly i e the deviation from the long term mean of the aridity index at the ith time interval δφ i can be expressed as 3 δ ϕ i ϕ i ϕ p e t i p i p e t p p e t i p p e t p i p i p p e t i p p p e t p p e t p e t p i p i p δ p e t i ϕ δ p i p i where δ p e t i p e t i p e t and δ p i p i p in this study the e from the terrestrial water budget dataset of zhang et al 2018 hereafter as the actual eo see the details of this dataset in section 3 will be compared with the e predicted by bf hereafter as the predicted ep the anomaly ofep at the ith time interval δe p i can be expressed as 4 δ e p i e p i e p p i f ϕ i p f ϕ substituting eq 2 into eq 4 yields 5 δ e p i p i f ϕ f ϕ δ ϕ i p f ϕ substitutingδφ i from eq 3 into eq 5 yields 6 δ e p i f ϕ ϕ f ϕ δ p i f ϕ δ p e t i the error of ep at the ith time interval eri can be expressed as 7 e r i e p i e o i δ e r i e r where δeri is the anomaly of er at the ith time interval which can be expressed as 8 δ e r i e r i e r e p i e o i e p e o e p i e p e o i e o δ e p i δ e o i i e the difference between the anomalies of ep and eo according to the terrestrial water balance equation δe o i can be expressed in terms of p r and δs as follows 9 δ e o i e o i e o p i r i δ s i p r δ s p i p r i r δ s i δ s δ p i δ r i δ s i δ s where δpi and δri represent the anomalies of p and r respectively substituting eqs 6 and 9 into eq 8 yields 10 e r i e r f ϕ ϕ f ϕ 1 δ p i f ϕ δ p e t i δ r i δ s i δ s therefore the error of ep at the ith time interval eri can be expressed as 11 e r i w p δ p i w p e t δ p e t i δ r i δ s i δ s e r where w p f ϕ ϕ f ϕ 1 and w p e t f ϕ are the weighting functions explicitly expressed as functions of the long term aridity index ϕ and the parameter ω eq 11 shows that the error of ep at the ith time interval can be decomposed into six terms representing respectively the effects of the anomalies of p pet r and δs the long term mean water storage change δ s and the long term mean difference between ep and eo the sensitivity of the weighting functions wp and wpet to the long term mean water supply p and energy supply p e t is illustrated in fig 2 as seen wp wpet varies within the range of 1 to 0 0 to 1 given a fixed p the influence of wp tends to be weaker as the basin becomes hotter i e larger pet and vice versa given a fixed p e t the influence of wp tends to be more significant as the basin becomes wetter i e larger p and vice versa similarly wpet approaches one under the humid cool climate i e large p and small pet and approaches zero under the dry hot climate i e small p and large pet that is the contributions of p and pet anomalies to the errors in ep are significant under the humid cool climate i e large p and small pet but can be negligible under the arid hot climate i e small p and large pet since bf is relatively accurate at the long term mean time scale zhang et al 2008 wu et al 2017b e r is generally small compared with the other five terms in eq 11 also the mean water storage change δ s without the human influence such as pumping and water impoundment is generally small and hence negligible thus eq 11 can be further simplified as 12 e r i w p δ p i w p e t δ p e t i δ r i δ s i which states that the error of ep at the ith time interval is the function of the corresponding anomalies of p pet r and δs and the weighting functions wp and wpet 2 2 error variance decomposition by neglecting the mean water storage change δ s and taking the square of eq 10 summing over n sample and scaled by n 1 the sample error variance can be expressed as 13 σ 2 e r w 2 p σ 2 p w 2 p e t σ 2 p e t σ 2 r σ 2 δ s 2 w p w p e t c o v p p e t 2 w p c o v p r 2 w p c o v p δ s 2 w p e t c o v p e t r 2 w p e t c o v p e t δ s 2 c o v r δ s where σ2 and cov represent the variance and covariance term respectively the total variance of errors in the bf predicted e ep is decomposed into the variance and covariance terms of p pet r and δs including the variance of climate forcing σ2 p andσ2 pet the coincidence of water and energy supply cov p pet and the catchment response to climate forcing i e all the two variance and five covariance terms associated with r and δs in eq 13 under the extremely arid climates the weighting functions wp and wpet are both negligible fig 2 in this case eqs 12 and 13 can be reduced to the following form 14a e r i δ r i δ s i 14b σ 2 e r σ 2 r σ 2 δ s 2 c o v r δ s eq 14 indicates that the variance of r andδs and the covariance between them together determine the error variance under the extremely arid climates as almost all p are consumed by e under the extremely arid climates and r is negligible δs can be the only factor in determining the errors of ep in contrast under humid climates wp wpet is close to 1 to 1 indicating that the variances of p and pet have the largest contributions to the errors in ep in this case of humid climates the variances of all hydro climatic variables i e p pet r and δs and their covariance terms contribute to the errors in ep as shown in eq 13 3 study area and data the global long term 1984 2010 monthly terrestrial water budget dataset including p e r and δs was recently developed at the 0 5 grid resolution by zhang et al 2018 by using a constrained kalman filter data assimilation technique available at http stream princeton edu 8080 opendap measures wc multisources wb 050 this dataset is based on multiple data sources including in situ ground observations remote sensing retrievals land surface model simulations and global reanalysis data this dataset can effectively bridge the gaps between sparsely gauged regions and the regions with abundant ground observations compared to most large scale e dataset from only one single data source this dataset is considered as best available global monthly e datasets more detailed descriptions of data sources data assimilation procedures and uncertainty quantification can be found in zhang et al 2018 the 0 5 resolution 25 year 1984 2008 monthly data of p e r and δs over the entire china were used in this study in addition the 1984 2008 monthly pet dataset at the global 1 grid resolution provided by the terrestrial hydrology research group of princeton university sheffield et al 2006 2012 were disaggregated into the 0 5 0 5 grids over the entire china using the linear interpolation to be used in this study the mainland of china can be divided into 14 major river basins as shown in fig 1 there 14 major river basins under widely diverse climates with the mean annual aridity index ϕ ranging from 0 55 to 11 78 are chosen to be the study areas table 1 according to mcvicar et al 2012 they can be broadly classified into three groups based on the aridity index 1 the energy limited condition with ϕ 0 76 including the southeast drainage basin ϕ 0 55 and pearl river basin ϕ 0 66 2 the intermediate condition with ϕ ranging from 0 76 to 1 35 including the yangtze ϕ 0 85 southwest drainage ϕ 1 08 and huaihe river ϕ 1 21 basins and 3 the water limited condition with ϕ 1 35 including the remaining 9 basins the mean annual e is rather small in the northwest regions mostly under the water limited condition and tends to increase significantly toward the southeast regions mostly under the energy limited condition fig 1 4 results 4 1 geographical patterns of the errors in predicted e the evaluation of the predicted annual and monthly e by comparisons with the actual e data from zhang et al 2018 over the 14 major river basins of china is summarized in table 1 the following statistical indicators are used in the evaluation nse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient re the relative percentage of prediction errors e r the mean prediction errors and σ er the standard deviation of prediction errors also the 1984 2008 predicted annual e and the actual e are compared in fig 3 for each of 14 basins from table 1 the accuracy of both annual and monthly predicted e tends to increase with a larger nse as moving from humid to arid basins e contains larger biases with a larger re at monthly than annual scale for most basins suggesting that bf is more accurate to predict annual than monthly e the predicted e has the long term 1984 2008 mean errors the relative errors in percentage ranging across 14 basins 0 17 4 53 mm 0 02 1 18 for annual e and 1 73 12 52 mm 7 9 38 9 for monthly e table 1 for the mean monthly e the xinjiang basin has the largest underestimation 7 90 while the qiangtang basin has the largest overestimation 38 92 the temporal variability of the prediction errors in e as quantified by the standard deviation of errors σ er and the relative variability to the variability of actual e i e σ er σ e tend to be larger in more humid basins with smaller aridity indices particularly for annual e specifically the prediction errors in both annual and monthly e show larger interannual intra annual variability in the haihe southwest drainage basin than other more humid basins 4 2 analysis of the components of errors in the predicted e the 1984 2008 annual fig 4 and monthly fig 5 time series of the prediction errors i e ep minuseo are compared with that calculated from eq 11 at 14 major river basins in china as seen from fig 4 the eq 11 performs well for all basins at annual time scale with the nse ranging between 0 910 and 0 998 fig 4 however the discrepancy of eq 11 tends to be larger at the monthly time scale fig 5 particularly for the southeast drainage ϕ 0 55 nse 0 556 pearl ϕ 0 66 nse 0 446 and haihe ϕ 2 28 nse 0 512 where the discrepancies between two monthly time series of prediction errors are apparently larger than all other basins overall the eq 11 predicts reasonably well the errors in both predicted annual and monthly e with a high mean correlation coefficient r of 0 991 annual and 0 878 monthly respectively fig 6 a and b the wettest southeast drainage basin ϕ 0 55 and the driest hexi ϕ 11 78 basin table 1 are chosen to be the most representative energy limited and water limited basin in the following analysis respectively the respective contribution from each of the six terms in eq 11 to the prediction errors in annual e is compared in fig 7 a for the southeast drainage basin ϕ 0 55 both p and r anomaly terms exhibit relatively larger interannual variability than other four terms for the hexi basin ϕ 11 78 the interannual variability of δs term is considerably larger than that in the southeast drainage basin and this term has the largest contribution to the prediction error of e the p and r anomaly terms are always with the opposite sign and thus their combined effects become somewhat cancelled out the mean error e r is smaller than the other five terms in eq 11 and hence negligible and it generally decreases from humid to arid basins it is of interests to note that the mean δs term is negligible in the southeast drainage basin but is relatively large in the hexi basin suggesting that the long term mean storage change needs to be considered in analyzing the prediction errors of bf in the hexi basin similar to that found above for the predicted annual e in the southeast drainage basin the errors in predicted monthly e are affected by all hydro climate variables considered p pet r and δs fig 7 b in contrast for the hexi basin the temporal variability of δs dominates the errors in predicted monthly e finally the mean prediction errors e r of monthly e are negative positive in the southeast drainage basin hexi basin suggesting that bf tends to under predicts over predicts the long term mean e in the southeast drainage hexi basin overall both the mean error and mean δs terms in eq 11 are relatively small compared with other four terms and hence can be negligible in the prediction errors of monthly e 4 3 analysis of error variance in the predicted e the error variance derived in eq 13 is compared to that based on theep minuseo at the annual and monthly time scales fig 6 c and d as seen the error variance has large variability across 14 basins ranging between 0 2800 mm2 year 2 annual and 0 400 mm2 month 2 monthly the r between the predicted and the actual error variances at annual and monthly time scales are 0 996 and 0 916 respectively indicating that eq 13 can well predict the actual error variances of e at both time scales the absolute variance is generally larger in more humid basins table 2 but the prediction is more accurate in arid than humid basins as shown in fig 6 c and d the total annual and monthly error variance of the predicted e and the relative contribution from each term in eq 13 are plotted in fig 8 and also summarized in table 2 as shown in fig 8 the contributions from the terms associated with p and pet tend to decrease from the humid to arid basins particularly at the annual time scale on the contrary the contributions to the variances from the δs term σ2 δs and r term σ2 r and their covariance term 2cov r δs tend to increase from the humid to arid basins in humid basins the variance terms of p wp 2σ2 p and r σ2 r and their covariance term 2wpcov p r together account for more than 50 of both annual error variance in the southeast drainage 75 1 pearl 74 7 and yangtze 66 7 basins and monthly error variance in the southeast drainage 61 5 pearl 59 8 and yangtze 58 2 basins the variance terms of δs σ2 δs and r σ2 r and their covariance term 2wpcov p r together has the most positive contributions to the error variance in the extremely arid basins such as the inner mongolia 60 8 and heixi 52 7 basins at the annual time scale and the inner mongolia 63 4 xinjiang 52 5 and heixi 80 8 basins at the monthly time scale it is interesting to note that the variance term of pet i e wpet σ2 pet is generally small compared with other terms at both time scales suggesting that the effects of pet on error variance can be neglected in addition a positive negative contribution from the cov p pet term to the annual monthly error variance is found at all 14 basins since the weighting function2wpwpet in eq 13 is always negative thus the positive negative contribution is caused by the negative positive cov p pet due to the out of phase interannual in phase seasonal pattern between them 5 discussion 5 1 impact of catchment characteristics on error variance of e the parameter ω in eq 1 represents catchment characteristics which are relates to many factors such as vegetation coverage yang et al 2009 li et al 2013 the effective rooting depth and plant root characteristics cong et al 2015 donohue et al 2012 previous studies have reported some empirical relationships between ω and various catchment characteristics e g yang et al 2007 2009 li et al 2013 in general a large ω results in higher e and lower r and a catchment with sufficient storage capacity more vegetation coverage and a flat terrain correspond to a large ω zeng and cai 2015 the effect of different ω on the weighting functions of p and pet in eq 13 is investigated in fig 9 as seen a small ω has more contributions from p to the error variance than a large ω and the difference tends to be more significant in arid regions fig 9 a as shown in fig 9 b for a large ω the contribution from pet to the error variance tends to be more significant under wetter climates aridity index 1 35 while for a small ω the contribution from pet tends to be more significant under drier climates aridity index 1 35 the contribution from the covariance term of p and pet i e wpwpet is significant under humid climates for a large ω fig 9 c the above analyses imply that vegetation conditions can contribute to the error variance of predicted e under various climatic conditions however the clear effects of the vegetation type on error variance remains to be explored since pet has different sensitivities to climate in different vegetated areas williams et al 2012 future work needs to be focused on the relationship between catchment physical properties and ω to better understand the role of vegetation and other catchment characteristics in the error variance of predicted e 5 2 the error decomposition framework in this study the prediction errors and error variance of the bf predicted e are quantified and the main sources of errors under contrasting climatic conditions are identified at both annual and monthly time scales which potentially can provide a new possibility for improving the water balance prediction from the budyko framework at the finer time scales the error decomposition method i e eq 11 is derived based on the linear approximation of the budyko equation eq 2 by neglecting the effects of higher order terms in fact the budyko curve governing the long term water balance is nonlinear and hence the linear approximation can lead to an uncertainty in predicted e yang et al 2014 pointed out that the error due to the first order approximation can vary as p pet and ω change as shown in eq 13 the error variance in predicted e is affected by the variability of climate seasonality through the coincidence of water and energy supply 2wpwpetcov p pet in case of the first order approximation the error variability in predicted e is likely to be larger due to strong climate seasonality at the intra annual seasonal scale whereby leading to a less reliable estimation of error such as in the southeast drainage pearl huaihe and haihe basin fig 5 therefore a more accurate error analysis method considering the higher order effects is expected to improve the predictability of bf and assess the error sources of predicted e this study incorporates the influences of catchment water storage change including soil moisture surface water storage and groundwater storage into bf analytically and quantify the error variance of the predicted e the error variance is influenced by storage changes via the covariance terms in eq 13 and the error source is found to be dominated by water storage changes in arid regions such as the hexi basin fig 7 in addition the extreme intensity rain and snowfall can also have important influences on the temporal variability of water balances in summer winter likely resulting in a large variation of seasonal e therefore the response of extreme intensity rain and snowfall to climate should also be incorporated into the framework of error analysis in this study as discussed above the temporal variability of errors in predicted e mainly reflects the hydro climatic variability of the basin suggesting that understanding the temporal variability of prediction errors can provide useful information related to the sensitivity of water budgets to climate changes and anthropogenic intervention in general e is not only influenced by natural factors such as climate and vegetation but also by human activities such as groundwater pumping and irrigation destouni et al 2012 lo and famiglietti 2013 pokhrel et al 2015 zeng and cai 2015 2016 pan et al 2017 human intervention is potentially another important source of errors in the predicted e by bf particularly for regions with intense human activities such as the haihe basin in china the human adaptation to climate is likely to be characterized by the covariances between catchment water storage changes and climate forcing i e cov p δs andcov pet δs the proposed error analysis framework in this study can be applied to evaluate the impacts of human activities on the predictability of bf recent studies have reported the use of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace to detect human induced changes of e at regional scale pan et al 2017 future research can be directed to characterize anthropogenic signals by using grace terrestrial water storage data over the regions to improve the predictability of bf 5 3 discussion of the case study in this study we applied the error decomposition analysis to 14 major river basins in china to investigate how climatic variables and catchment properties affect the errors in the bf predicted e under diverse climates the results underscore the significant roles of both climate forcing p and pet and catchment response r and δs in the errors of the bf predicted e under humid climates and the dominant role of δs in the prediction errors under arid climates fig 7 the latter also provides a physical support for incorporating δs into bf which can considerably improve the bf predictions of e at shorter time scales annual and monthly in arid regions but less effective in humid regions a finding consistent with that reported by wu et al 2017b although the error decomposition method generally works well for most of the 14 river basins in this study large residual errors can be identified in certain years for some basins such as southeast drainage 2003 and 2004 at annual time scale fig 4 and southeast drainage pearl huaihe and haihe at monthly time scale fig 5 the residual errors can in part be attributed to the linear approximation of the budyko equation eq 2 and other possible error sources such as the extreme intensity rainfall as discussed above on the other hand the water budget data used in this study were created by combining multiple data sources through the data assimilation techniques the non closure errors in the individual water budget products inevitably result in large uncertainty in the spatio temporal variability of estimated water budgets zhang et al 2018 which also contribute to the residual errors for example the qiangtang basin which is more arid than the southeast drainage basin but less arid than the hexi basin has the smallest contribution of δs and the largest contribution of r to the error variance of e among all basins considered fig 8 this is possible largely due to the effects of residual errors caused by error uncertainty in data source in addition the variability of climate seasonality can strongly affect water balance particularly at the intra annual scale wu et al 2017a indicated that the interaction covariance between p and pet can dampen the interannual variance of e and increase the intra annual variance over the 14 river basins studied correspondingly this study found an in phase seasonal pattern between pet and p for all 14 river basins which tends to dampen the error variance of predicted e at monthly time scale fig 8 for future work it would be interesting to examine how the out of phase seasonal pattern between p and pet for both water limited and energy limited conditions affects the error variability in bf predicted e at the intra annual time scale 6 conclusions this study attempts to quantify the dominant controls on the errors of the bf predicted e by developing an analytical framework of error decomposition which was applied to 14 major river basins in china with the long term 1984 2008 mean annual aridity index ranging from 0 55 to 11 78 in this framework the errors and error variance of the predicted annual and monthly e are expressed analytically as a function of the anomalies i e the deviations from the long term mean in each time step and the variances and covariances of p pet r and δs the contribution to the errors of predicted e from each controlling factor p pet r and δs is evaluated the limitation of the developed error decomposition framework and the effect of catchment characteristics on the prediction errors are discussed the results show that the temporal variability of the errors of predicted annual and monthly e and the ratio of this temporal variability of errors to that of e tend to be larger under more humid climates the climate forcing factors p and pet and catchment responses r and δs play considerably different roles in the makeup of prediction errors of e depending on climatic conditions in humid regions the variance and covariance terms of p pet r and δs are comparably more important in the contribution to prediction errors for the studied humid ϕ 1 35 basins in china the variance and covariance terms of p and r account for most of the error variance in the predicted annual e e g southeast drainage 75 1 pearl 74 7 and yangtze 66 7 and the predicted monthly e e g southeast drainage 61 5 pearl 59 8 and yangtze 58 2 in arid regions the variance and covariance terms of δs and r account for most of the error variance in the predicted annual e e g inner mongolia 60 8 and heixi 52 7 and the predicted monthly e e g inner mongolia 63 4 xinjiang 52 5 and heixi 80 8 in particular the error of bf predicted e can be mainly attributed to the temporal variability of δs under extremely arid climates due to the negligible r fluctuations this study provides a physical quantitative support that the incorporation of δs into bf can improve the predictability of annual and monthly e under the arid climates more than humid climates acknowledgments this work was supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities grant no 21617301 and the national natural science foundation of china grant

al 2016 di carlo et al 2000 performed similar experiments on sandpacks with different wettabilities demonstrating how the arrangement of the three phases pore occupancy and the existence of wetting layers might affect the relative permeabilities however despite a large body of core scale experimental measurements of three phase flow the pore occupancy has not been determined directly alizadeh and piri 2014 to understand the pore scale physics oren et al 1992 visualized the remobilization of oil caused by the double drainage mechanism of gas displacing oil displacing water during gas injection from waterflood residual oil saturation in a two dimensional 2d micromodel this was observed in a water wet system where oil spreads spontaneously over the water while gas invades the centres of the pores sandwiching the oil phase in layers that are gradually drained increasing the oil recovery keller et al 1997 replicated the pore space pattern of a berea sandstone in a silicon wafer micromodel and observed the formation of stable oil layers and the occurrence of both double drainage and double imbibition water displacing oil displacing gas events sohrabi et al 2008 2004 sorbie and dijke 2010 studied the behaviour of the three phases during wag injection in 2d systems in which the wettability was altered to determine recovery and pore occupancies for repeated cycles of water and gas injection these observations in micromodels allowed van dijke et al to develop pore scale network simulators of three phase flow van dijke et al 2004 2006 that can account for arbitrary wettability in particular they modelled multiple displacement events where one phase displaces another and so on in a chain of arbitrary length van dijke et al 2004 piri and blunt 2005 developed another pore network model representing immiscible three phase flow which computed relative permeabilities and capillary pressures using a random network representing the pore space of berea sandstone for different wettability conditions more recently improvements have been achieved with pore network models including multiple displacement and precise criteria for the formation and collapse of layers based on thermodynamic constraints al dhahli et al 2013 zolfaghari and piri 2017a b a reliable benchmark for pore network simulators would be the direct visualization of three phase flow in situ i e inside the three dimensional 3d pore space instead of 2d idealised micromodels in the last decade the advent of x ray micro computed tomography µ ct has allowed the direct visualization of multiphase flow blunt et al 2013 images have been obtained for two phase flow with both laboratory based µ ct scanners alhammadi et al 2017 herring et al 2017 and at synchrotron sources which enables the pore scale dynamics to be captured with a time resolution of tens of seconds andrew et al 2015 reynolds et al 2017 schlüter et al 2016 singh et al 2017 a few authors have reported in situ studies of immiscible three phase flow in porous rocks iglauer et al 2013 2014 obtained synchrotron and laboratory based µ ct images at ambient conditions of a clashach sandstone saturated with brine oil and gas to compare the effect of different displacement sequences on oil recovery and gas storage they demonstrated that for a water wet system gas injection in a virgin oil reservoir leads to lower residual oil saturations and higher gas trapping than when gas is injected after waterflooding in the mixed wet case studied in iglauer et al 2014 however this was not observed khishvand et al 2016 applied a detailed analysis of high resolution two and three phase images of a berea sandstone at ambient temperature and a pressure of 5 52 mpa to characterize multiple displacement events and relate them to the wettability state defined by local contact angles feali et al 2012 investigated the role of oil layers comparing a spreading system cs 0 where c s σ g w σ g w σ o w is the spreading coefficient with a non spreading one cs 0 they showed that for cs 0 oil layers were present and a low oil saturation was reached while if cs 0 the oil phase was disconnected giving lower recovery in this work we use x ray tomography to study three phase flow in a carbonate rock at subsurface temperature and pressure conditions to quantitatively characterize a pore occupancy b multiple displacement processes c wettability associated with spreading oil layers and d trapping to achieve this we design a sequence consisting of oil injection into a fully water saturated pore space oi waterflooding wf1 gas injection gi and second waterflooding wf2 3d images of the pore space saturated with three phases can be analysed with a maximal ball based pore morphology analysis to quantify pore occupancy in this paper we employ the maximal ball mb method bultreys et al 2015 the largest sphere occupying the pore space are found from a dry scan of the sample dong and blunt 2009 raeini et al 2017 and these are compared to the grey scale images to obtain a relation between the dimension of the pores and the phase sitting in its centre this 3d quantification of pore occupancy enables the validation of network model predictions of displacement processes bultreys et al 2018 van dijke et al 2004 along with the phase occupancy statistics the monitoring of multiple displacements is crucial for accurate modelling of three phase flow alizadeh and piri 2014 van dijke et al 2004 we will obtain high resolution images to visualize the multiple displacement mechanisms of double drainage and double imbibition which has previously only been characterized in 2d micromodels keller et al 1997 finally we visualize the formation of spreading oil layers in the presence of gas and water allowing for an increase in oil recovery through their drainage alizadeh 2014 ranaee et al 2015 vizika and lombard 1996 these layers also influence the competition between snap off and piston like displacement blunt 2017 causing differences in trapping mechanisms between the two non wetting phases oil and gas our study also provides quantitative information of the local thickness and connectivity of oil and water layers which along with wettability characterization is then used to interpret the degree of trapping we determine if we have layers of sufficient thickness to contribute to hydrodynamic conductivity and displacement processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a ketton sample was selected as the rock for this study with a mean diameter of 4 9 mm and a mean length of 19 5 mm the porosity was measured to be 29 8 with a helium porosimeter and 15 2 with image analysis on the micro ct scans obtained in these studies the difference between the two values is due to the presence of microporosity within the oolith grains with pore dimensions lower than the resolution of the images which is therefore not captured with traditional segmentation of the x ray data the composition of the rock is 99 calcite andrew et al 2014 tanino and blunt 2012 the sample was cleaned with methanol to remove any impurities and dried in a vacuum oven at 95 c for 24 hours kamaljit et al 2016 the selection of the fluid phases was driven by a trade off between the aim of replicating a reservoir system whilst being able to distinguish between them in the x ray images fig 1 shows the x ray attenuation coefficients for solid aqueous oil and gas phases with and without the addition of dopants khishvand et al 2016 national institute of standards and technology 201 in the photon energy range we set in the micro ct scanner 20 80 kev the attenuations for pure gas water and decane are quite similar which would make unambiguous segmentation of the phases difficult for this reason different dopants were added to both the water and the oil phase a mixture with 7 by weight of potassium iodide ki in water was used as the brine phase while a solution 50 by weight of iododecane in decane was used as the oil phase the gas phase was chosen to be nitrogen as it is fully immiscible with both oil and brine the x ray contrast between the doped phases has been judged with both contrast scans figure s1 in the supplementary information and by inspection of the grey scale histograms figure s2 in the supplementary information table 1 lists the densities viscosities and interfacial tensions of the phases used in the experiments in this work we found no evidence that the wettability of the system changed on exposure to radiation as seen by brown et al 2014 the laboratory instrument uses a relatively weak x ray source and the contact angles we measure see later are consistent with measurements on undoped systems kamaljit et al 2016 2 2 methods 2 2 1 flow experiment the flow experiment was performed using the flow loop shown in fig 2 five pumps teledyne isco lincoln ne usa were used for confining receiving and brine oil and n2 injection a carbon fibre hassler type flow cell was used to keep the rock under pressure with a confining fluid water the sample was placed in a viton sleeve and connected to the peek tubing of the hydraulic circuit with two steel end pieces the flow cell was placed in a zeiss xradia 500 versa 3d ct scanner for image acquisition the sample was first flushed with carbon dioxide to remove all the air from the pores then 100 pore volumes of brine with a flow rate of 0 1 ml min were injected to ensure 100 water saturation the pressure of the brine inside the sample was then raised to experimental conditions 8 mpa with a confining pressure of 9 5 mpa to fully insulate the sample and prevent any bypass of the fluid along its walls kamaljit et al 2016 the temperature of the sample was then raised to experimental conditions 60 c with an electric heater wrapped around the carbon fibre sleeve and a thermocouple fixed in contact with the sample inside the viton sleeve a proportional integral derivative pid controller is used to ensure a constant temperature in the rock sample 2 2 1 1 flooding sequence four injections were performed to simulate the displacement sequence in a reservoir under capillary force dominated flow conditions all the injections were performed with a flow rate of 0 015 ml min firstly oil was injected in the brine saturated sample at the top of the flow cell oil injection oi for 35 minutes with a total volume corresponding to 5 pore volumes pv then the first waterflooding wf1 was performed simulating secondary recovery with water injection in the reservoir for a total of 15 pv from the bottom of the sample the third and fourth floods were respectively gas injection gi from the top and second water injection wf2 from the bottom both of them for a total of 5 pv these simulate a tertiary recovery strategy details about the injections including values of capillary number which were always in the capillary dominated regime are provided in table 2 2 2 2 imaging scans with two different resolutions were acquired after each injection first a 0 4 magnification lens was employed at the detector to maximize the field of view and the relative position of source and detector was set to have a resolution of 5 µm per voxel side then two scans were performed with a lens with 4 magnification to obtain high resolution images for a smaller field of view with 2 µm per voxel side the low resolution scan was built by stitching together 4 separate scans at different heights fig 3 to obtain an image of almost the whole sample with dimensions larger than the elementary representative volume to measure saturations and connectivity the high resolution scans were performed at two locations at the mid bottom and mid top of the rock to investigate the pore scale mechanisms of trapping and to measure contact angle the high resolution images required more projections and longer exposure time as shown in table 2 after oi we increased both the number of projections and the exposure time for the following scans to obtain higher quality images for wf1 gi and wf2 2 2 3 image processing the reconstruction of the x ray images was performed with the software included in the zeiss versa 500 micro ct which allows corrections for centre shift and beam hardening andrew et al 2014 the 5 µm resolution images were stitched together taking advantage of the wide overlapping region between each scan at least 25 of the whole height of each scanned image fig 3 all the images were registered using the dry scan as a reference allowing direct comparison after each injection step a non local means edge preserving filter was applied to smooth the grey scale images and improve watershed segmentation buades et al 2008 the non local means filter assigns to each voxel the weighted average of the grey scale values of the n voxels in the neighbourhood of the selected one the similarity value is the weight used in the averaging procedure and the lower it is the less the images are smoothed the segmentation of the lower resolution images was performed using a watershed method with the possibility of selecting different gradient values for different phases 2d histogram segmentation function of avizo jones et al 2007 the seeded watershed segmentation algorithm first searches for the seeds of the three phases i e the portions of the pore space where the high certainty exists about the phase present which are far from the interfaces these seeds are then grown proportionally to a certain gradient value until all the voxels of the image are assigned to some phase the advantage of this algorithm is that it preserves the continuity of the phases with acceptable accuracy schlüter et al 2014 however the shape of the interface between the phases which is important for computing quantities such as contact angles and curvature is affected by uncertainties and may be altered by the filtering procedure alhammadi et al 2017 when dealing with the high resolution images the weka machine learning segmentation method arganda carreras et al 2017 was applied using image j software on non filtered images obtaining higher quality results especially when considering small details at the interfaces however weka is much more cpu intensive than watershed segmentation and it was not possible to apply it to the bigger dataset at lower resolution 2 2 4 pore occupancy to analyse the pore occupancy we identified local dilations and constrictions in the pore space using the maximal ball method as a part of generalized network extraction algorithm of raeini et al 2017 to obtain the description of the pore space shown in fig 4 the diameter of the maximal ball is considered to be the pore diameter the spheres representing the pores local dilations in the pore space are superimposed on grey scale wet images for each of the injection steps as shown in fig 5 bultreys et al 2018 the mean grey scale value associated to the voxels inside each sphere refer to fig 5 is computed this results in a distribution of mean grey scale values where due to the averaging over the voxels in each sphere the grey scale probability distribution clearly identifies different peaks corresponding to the different phases the grey scale thresholds classifying the phases are set as the minima in the probability density functions as shown in fig 6 with this procedure the pore centres were segmented into those where brine oil or gas resides as shown in the supplementary information figure s3 the centre of each pore defined by the spheres always corresponds to one phase only as the oil and water layers even when they are thicker after first and second waterflooding do not reach the centre of the pore 3 results and discussion in section 3 1 we first present the saturation of the three phases in the volume imaged with the low resolution scan after each displacement step then in sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 we respectively show i a characterization of three phase displacements in terms of pore size and pore occupancy ii a 3d visualization of double displacement mechanisms namely double drainage and double imbibition and iii a detailed description of contact angles oil layer formation and trapping mechanisms in a high resolution image saturations and pore occupancy were computed on 5 µm resolution images of a large part of the rock sample fig 7 increasing the statistical significance of these results for the detailed characterization of pore scale phenomena of double displacements oil layer formation trapping mechanisms and contact angle measurements we relied on the dataset with higher resolution fig 8 3 1 saturations the saturation of the phases after each step was quantified from the segmented images by the ratio of the voxels assigned to the selected material to the total number of voxels assigned to the pore space the saturation points at the end of each injection are shown in the ternary diagram in fig 9 with the distribution of the phases shown in fig 10 starting with the core fully saturated with water oil was injected oi green arrow in fig 9 the water and oil saturation after oi were 37 6 and 62 4 respectively then wf1 blue arrow in fig 9 allowed production of oil and final saturations of 48 0 and 52 0 for water and oil were measured the oil recovery with water injection was 17 which is lower than previous studies on similar systems kamaljit et al 2016 the reason for this is that not all the oil was trapped at the end of wf1 as evident in fig 10 there is a large cluster of oil connected to the outlet that could be partially displaced on further water injection the third injection introduced gas in the sample gi red arrow in fig 9 this allowed for a production of both water and oil with saturations of 4 0 30 5 and 65 5 for water oil and gas respectively at the end of the gi step at this point the oil recovery with respect to initial oil saturation was 51 the last step was the second waterflooding wf2 blue arrow in fig 9 allowing for gas trapping and further oil recovery the final saturations were 28 6 18 6 and 52 8 for water oil and gas respectively and the recovery factor was 70 with respect to the initial oil saturation these results show how the injection of gas after waterflooding and possibly another injection of water may significantly increase oil recovery gas injection displaced connected oil but also led to the rearrangement of disconnected oil clusters and their partial production as evident in fig 10 further evidence for the displacement of trapped oil is provided later in the paper 3 2 pore occupancy using the procedure described in section 2 2 4 the pore centres identified by maximum ball spheres were assigned to the three phases we obtained bar graphs approximating the probability density functions of the pore sizes occupied by each phase fig 11 the heights f i α of the bars were obtained as follows 1 f i α n i α n i where n i α is the number of pores associated with the phase α for each i th bin while ni is the total number of pores in each i th bin from the results shown in fig 11 we can see that as expected in a water wet system during oi oil invaded the largest pores while water remained confined in the smaller ones with wf1 oil is pushed away from some medium small sized pores replaced by water and produced during gi gas is the most non wetting phase and invades the centre of the larger pores while oil and water are squeezed into smaller pores a noticeable movement of oil happens during gas injection it is displaced by gas which replaces oil in the centre of the larger pores the oil that was trapped during wf1 is as a consequence reconnected in cavities smaller than those occupied before and it is produced some connected oil is also likely directly displaced by gas wf2 causes both a further production of oil which drains in layers along with trapping of the gas phase both inside layers of oil and surrounded only by water the results shown in fig 11 agree with our current understanding of three phase flow in a water wet medium blunt 2017 water oil and gas occupy respectively small medium and larger sized pores however there is some spreading in the thresholds between pores occupied by different phases instead of a sharp demarcation there can be some small pores still occupied by oil and intermediate ones where water and gas are present pore filling in fact is not only driven by the dimension of the pores but other factors have an influence as well such as connectivity cooperative pore filling blunt 2017 and variations in local contact angles alhammadi et al 2017 alratrout et al 2017 3 3 double drainage and double imbibition the high resolution images allowed detailed 3d rendering of the segmented data and the visualization of pore scale phenomena such as double displacement mechanisms after wf1 some oil was trapped in the pore space fig 12 a surrounded by water with the injection of gas gas displaced water and when it could contact oil it directly displaced oil as they compete for the space in the centre of the larger pores mass conservation hence constrains oil to move towards the medium sized pores occupied by water fig 12b this gas displacing oil displacing water is a double displacement mechanism called double drainage as both gas and oil are non wetting phases oren et al 1992 with wf2 we observed the opposite mechanism injected brine being the most wetting phase reconnected through the small and medium pores however since these were partially occupied by oil the latter is mobilized again it was pushed towards larger pores and subsequently part of it is produced and part surrounded gas trapping the latter fig 12c this double displacement is called double imbibition as the two most wetting phases are driving the invasion of the pore space these double displacement mechanisms have a strong influence on the dynamics of three phase flow van dijke et al 2004 and future work will involve a detailed characterization of these phenomena to benchmark and improve pore scale models 3 4 contact angles spreading oil layers and trapping the value of the effective contact angle between oil and water after waterflooding is recognised as a direct measure of the wettability of the system alratrout et al 2017 andrew et al 2014 blunt 2017 jafari and jung 2017 khishvand et al 2016 scanziani et al 2017 this effective contact angle is different than the intrinsic one measured on a smooth surface rabbani et al 2017 we have selected a subvolume of the pore space illustrated in fig 13 and performed the automatic estimation of contact angle developed by scanziani et al 2017 on the images after wf1 fig 13b this method measures the contact angle on the segmented images by fitting a curve to the interface between the fluids using the physical constraint of constant curvature given by the young laplace law when the fluids are in equilibrium the result is illustrated in fig 14 which shows a distribution of contact angles measured through the water phase at 3139 points around a mean value of 47 5 degrees with a standard deviation of 19 1 degrees this result is in line with those found in literature for similar systems kamaljit et al 2016 scanziani et al 2017 and confirms a weakly water wet behaviour coherent with the results of pore occupancy illustrated in section 3 2 the distribution of contact angle instead of a unique value is a consequence of a variation in the selected domain of sub resolution features such as roughness and pore geometry andrew et al 2014 from table 1 the spreading coefficient is 2 mn m which is close to zero we do see the presence of oil layers throughout the pore space when gas and water are present see fig 13c and d therefore we assume that the effective gas oil contact angle is close to zero in our images we were unable to determine clear contacts between gas oil and the solid which again is consistent with the presence of oil layers it is difficult to measure the gas water contact angle directly as oil layers prevent frequent direct contacts of water with gas however this could be estimated using the bartell osterhof relation bartell and osterhof 1927 blunt 2001 panel c of fig 13 refers to the system after gas injection the oil is sandwiched in spreading layers in the corners of the pore space the thickness of these spreading layers was measured fitting maximum spheres to the structures hildebrand and ruegsegger 1997 a 3d map of their thickness is provided in fig 15 during an imbibition process capillary dominated flow in the pores is regulated by the competition between snap off and piston like displacement blunt 2017 this competition is controlled by the aspect ratio or the relative dimension of adjacent pores and throats the geometry of the pore space the connectivity the flow rate and the wettability fig 13 illustrates two different imbibition processes single brine displacing oil imbibition during wf1 panel a to panel b and double brine displacing oil displacing gas imbibition during wf2 panel c to panel d these two phenomena took place in the very same pore space with very similar capillary numbers hence the main difference in the competition between snap off and piston like displacement is given by the contact angle between the displaced and injected phases for lower contact angles snap off and trapping are more favoured during the single imbibition where water displaces oil the oil water angle has been measured to indicate only weakly water wet conditions fig 14 and piston like displacement is favoured in contrast the double imbibition process during wf2 leads to a snapped off ganglion of gas hence gas trapping by oil is preferred over oil trapping by water in the same pores this behaviour has been observed indirectly on measurements in sand packs of the amount of gas trapped by water alone oil trapped by water alone and gas trapped when oil is present at low saturation amaechi et al 2014 more gas was trapped under three phase conditions in the presence of oil and water the pore scale interpretation of this confirmed by our observations is the following due to the simultaneous presence of three phases causing the formation of oil spreading layers oil is strongly wetting to gas with a contact angle close to zero this favours snap off whereas if oil is trapped by water the contact angle is higher and piston like advance is more favoured this explains that oil layers in addition to allowing oil reconnection and production also influence and increase the amount of gas trapping facilitating the potential storage of carbon dioxide when this gas is used for tertiary oil recovery fig 15 provides a comparison between the thickness of brine layers after wf1 and oil layers after gi in general the oil spreading layers are thicker and more pervasive than the wetting brine ones which are confined to the narrowest corners of the pore space oil layer maps may be used in future for computing their permeability and to estimate the velocity of oil flow through them and hence the oil relative permeability in any event the water and oil layers thicknesses are of the order of 10 µm or larger and are connected over the mm scale which is sufficient to contribute significantly to the phase conductance and displacement processes blunt 2017 4 conclusions and future work in this paper we have developed a methodology to obtain a detailed 3d pore scale in situ analysis of immiscible three phase flow at elevated temperatures and pressures with a focus on pore occupancy double displacement mechanisms and the influence of water and oil layer thickness and wettability on non wetting phase snap off and trapping the three phases were injected in the rock initially fully saturated with brine in this order i oil injection oi first waterflooding wf1 gas injection gi and second waterflooding wf2 the quality of the images allowed us to have detailed insight of the pore scale phenomena and in particular 1 we quantified the saturation after each injection step describing the increase in oil recovery due to its remobilization via gi followed by wf2 with a behaviour similar to that previously observed feali et al 2012 iglauer et al 2013 2 we obtained a statistical representation of pore occupancy which is crucial for obtaining improvements in existing three phase network models water resides in the smallest pores and gas in the largest ones blunt 2017 the pore sizes filled with oil the intermediate wet phase depends on the amounts of oil and gas present 3 double drainage and double imbibition previously observed in micromodels keller et al 1997 oren et al 1992 have been imaged and described in 3d pore structures of carbonate rock 4 we have shown how contact angle and fluid distribution play a role in the competition between piston like displacement and snap off leading to preferential trapping of gas in the presence of oil layers as previously observed in sandpacks amaechi et al 2014 5 we obtained quantitative maps of the local water and oil layer thickness which indicate that they are sufficiently thick to contribute to flow and displacement future work could look at mixed wet conditions and the resultant pore occupancies to test the theoretical predictions of van dijke and sorbie 2002 furthermore different rocks and flooding sequences could be studied these experiments could serve as benchmarks for quantitative comparison with and testing of pore scale modelling tools 5 data availability the raw and segmented 3d images of the rock after each injection are available at the digital rock portal

766,x ray micro tomography is used to image the pore scale configurations of fluid in a rock saturated with three phases brine oil and gas mimicking a subsurface reservoir at high pressure and temperature we determine pore occupancy during a displacement sequence that involves waterflooding gas injection and water re injection in the water wet sample considered brine occupied the smallest pores gas the biggest while oil occupied pores of intermediate size and is displaced by both water and gas double displacement events have been observed where gas displaces oil that displaces water or vice versa the thickness of water and oil layers have been quantified as have the contact angles between gas and oil and oil and water these results are used to explain the nature of trapping in three

in porous media is also important for studies of napl non aqueous phase liquids removal in unsaturated soils nakamura and kikumoto 2014 many previous studies of three phase flow have focused on the measurement of relative permeabilities alizadeh and piri 2014 with steady state experiments at the centimetre scale oak et al 1990 obtained three phase relative permeabilities of water dodecane and nitrogen measuring saturations using x ray absorption on a 7 6 cm long berea sandstone core with 5 cm diameter the relative permeabilities were obtained using darcy s law and the pressure drop across the core in a water wet medium the relative permeability of water krw was only a function of the water saturation sw as the most wetting phase it was hypothesized that water always occupies the narrowest regions of the pore space similarly the gas relative permeability krg depended only on gas saturation sg as it is was assumed to occupy the largest pores as the most non wetting phase the oil relative permeability kro in contrast was a function of the saturation of the other phases it is thought that the oil occupies pores of intermediate size blunt 2017 moghadasi et al 2016 ranaee et al 2016 di carlo et al 2000 performed similar experiments on sandpacks with different wettabilities demonstrating how the arrangement of the three phases pore occupancy and the existence of wetting layers might affect the relative permeabilities however despite a large body of core scale experimental measurements of three phase flow the pore occupancy has not been determined directly alizadeh and piri 2014 to understand the pore scale physics oren et al 1992 visualized the remobilization of oil caused by the double drainage mechanism of gas displacing oil displacing water during gas injection from waterflood residual oil saturation in a two dimensional 2d micromodel this was observed in a water wet system where oil spreads spontaneously over the water while gas invades the centres of the pores sandwiching the oil phase in layers that are gradually drained increasing the oil recovery keller et al 1997 replicated the pore space pattern of a berea sandstone in a silicon wafer micromodel and observed the formation of stable oil layers and the occurrence of both double drainage and double imbibition water displacing oil displacing gas events sohrabi et al 2008 2004 sorbie and dijke 2010 studied the behaviour of the three phases during wag injection in 2d systems in which the wettability was altered to determine recovery and pore occupancies for repeated cycles of water and gas injection these observations in micromodels allowed van dijke et al to develop pore scale network simulators of three phase flow van dijke et al 2004 2006 that can account for arbitrary wettability in particular they modelled multiple displacement events where one phase displaces another and so on in a chain of arbitrary length van dijke et al 2004 piri and blunt 2005 developed another pore network model representing immiscible three phase flow which computed relative permeabilities and capillary pressures using a random network representing the pore space of berea sandstone for different wettability conditions more recently improvements have been achieved with pore network models including multiple displacement and precise criteria for the formation and collapse of layers based on thermodynamic constraints al dhahli et al 2013 zolfaghari and piri 2017a b a reliable benchmark for pore network simulators would be the direct visualization of three phase flow in situ i e inside the three dimensional 3d pore space instead of 2d idealised micromodels in the last decade the advent of x ray micro computed tomography µ ct has allowed the direct visualization of multiphase flow blunt et al 2013 images have been obtained for two phase flow with both laboratory based µ ct scanners alhammadi et al 2017 herring et al 2017 and at synchrotron sources which enables the pore scale dynamics to be captured with a time resolution of tens of seconds andrew et al 2015 reynolds et al 2017 schlüter et al 2016 singh et al 2017 a few authors have reported in situ studies of immiscible three phase flow in porous rocks iglauer et al 2013 2014 obtained synchrotron and laboratory based µ ct images at ambient conditions of a clashach sandstone saturated with brine oil and gas to compare the effect of different displacement sequences on oil recovery and gas storage they demonstrated that for a water wet system gas injection in a virgin oil reservoir leads to lower residual oil saturations and higher gas trapping than when gas is injected after waterflooding in the mixed wet case studied in iglauer et al 2014 however this was not observed khishvand et al 2016 applied a detailed analysis of high resolution two and three phase images of a berea sandstone at ambient temperature and a pressure of 5 52 mpa to characterize multiple displacement events and relate them to the wettability state defined by local contact angles feali et al 2012 investigated the role of oil layers comparing a spreading system cs 0 where c s σ g w σ g w σ o w is the spreading coefficient with a non spreading one cs 0 they showed that for cs 0 oil layers were present and a low oil saturation was reached while if cs 0 the oil phase was disconnected giving lower recovery in this work we use x ray tomography to study three phase flow in a carbonate rock at subsurface temperature and pressure conditions to quantitatively characterize a pore occupancy b multiple displacement processes c wettability associated with spreading oil layers and d trapping to achieve this we design a sequence consisting of oil injection into a fully water saturated pore space oi waterflooding wf1 gas injection gi and second waterflooding wf2 3d images of the pore space saturated with three phases can be analysed with a maximal ball based pore morphology analysis to quantify pore occupancy in this paper we employ the maximal ball mb method bultreys et al 2015 the largest sphere occupying the pore space are found from a dry scan of the sample dong and blunt 2009 raeini et al 2017 and these are compared to the grey scale images to obtain a relation between the dimension of the pores and the phase sitting in its centre this 3d quantification of pore occupancy enables the validation of network model predictions of displacement processes bultreys et al 2018 van dijke et al 2004 along with the phase occupancy statistics the monitoring of multiple displacements is crucial for accurate modelling of three phase flow alizadeh and piri 2014 van dijke et al 2004 we will obtain high resolution images to visualize the multiple displacement mechanisms of double drainage and double imbibition which has previously only been characterized in 2d micromodels keller et al 1997 finally we visualize the formation of spreading oil layers in the presence of gas and water allowing for an increase in oil recovery through their drainage alizadeh 2014 ranaee et al 2015 vizika and lombard 1996 these layers also influence the competition between snap off and piston like displacement blunt 2017 causing differences in trapping mechanisms between the two non wetting phases oil and gas our study also provides quantitative information of the local thickness and connectivity of oil and water layers which along with wettability characterization is then used to interpret the degree of trapping we determine if we have layers of sufficient thickness to contribute to hydrodynamic conductivity and displacement processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a ketton sample was selected as the rock for this study with a mean diameter of 4 9 mm and a mean length of 19 5 mm the porosity was measured to be 29 8 with a helium porosimeter and 15 2 with image analysis on the micro ct scans obtained in these studies the difference between the two values is due to the presence of microporosity within the oolith grains with pore dimensions lower than the resolution of the images which is therefore not captured with traditional segmentation of the x ray data the composition of the rock is 99 calcite andrew et al 2014 tanino and blunt 2012 the sample was cleaned with methanol to remove any impurities and dried in a vacuum oven at 95 c for 24 hours kamaljit et al 2016 the selection of the fluid phases was driven by a trade off between the aim of replicating a reservoir system whilst being able to distinguish between them in the x ray images fig 1 shows the x ray attenuation coefficients for solid aqueous oil and gas phases with and without the addition of dopants khishvand et al 2016 national institute of standards and technology 201 in the photon energy range we set in the micro ct scanner 20 80 kev the attenuations for pure gas water and decane are quite similar which would make unambiguous segmentation of the phases difficult for this reason different dopants were added to both the water and the oil phase a mixture with 7 by weight of potassium iodide ki in water was used as the brine phase while a solution 50 by weight of iododecane in decane was used as the oil phase the gas phase was chosen to be nitrogen as it is fully immiscible with both oil and brine the x ray contrast between the doped phases has been judged with both contrast scans figure s1 in the supplementary information and by inspection of the grey scale histograms figure s2 in the supplementary information table 1 lists the densities viscosities and interfacial tensions of the phases used in the experiments in this work we found no evidence that the wettability of the system changed on exposure to radiation as seen by brown et al 2014 the laboratory instrument uses a relatively weak x ray source and the contact angles we measure see later are consistent with measurements on undoped systems kamaljit et al 2016 2 2 methods 2 2 1 flow experiment the flow experiment was performed using the flow loop shown in fig 2 five pumps teledyne isco lincoln ne usa were used for confining receiving and brine oil and n2 injection a carbon fibre hassler type flow cell was used to keep the rock under pressure with a confining fluid water the sample was placed in a viton sleeve and connected to the peek tubing of the hydraulic circuit with two steel end pieces the flow cell was placed in a zeiss xradia 500 versa 3d ct scanner for image acquisition the sample was first flushed with carbon dioxide to remove all the air from the pores then 100 pore volumes of brine with a flow rate of 0 1 ml min were injected to ensure 100 water saturation the pressure of the brine inside the sample was then raised to experimental conditions 8 mpa with a confining pressure of 9 5 mpa to fully insulate the sample and prevent any bypass of the fluid along its walls kamaljit et al 2016 the temperature of the sample was then raised to experimental conditions 60 c with an electric heater wrapped around the carbon fibre sleeve and a thermocouple fixed in contact with the sample inside the viton sleeve a proportional integral derivative pid controller is used to ensure a constant temperature in the rock sample 2 2 1 1 flooding sequence four injections were performed to simulate the displacement sequence in a reservoir under capillary force dominated flow conditions all the injections were performed with a flow rate of 0 015 ml min firstly oil was injected in the brine saturated sample at the top of the flow cell oil injection oi for 35 minutes with a total volume corresponding to 5 pore volumes pv then the first waterflooding wf1 was performed simulating secondary recovery with water injection in the reservoir for a total of 15 pv from the bottom of the sample the third and fourth floods were respectively gas injection gi from the top and second water injection wf2 from the bottom both of them for a total of 5 pv these simulate a tertiary recovery strategy details about the injections including values of capillary number which were always in the capillary dominated regime are provided in table 2 2 2 2 imaging scans with two different resolutions were acquired after each injection first a 0 4 magnification lens was employed at the detector to maximize the field of view and the relative position of source and detector was set to have a resolution of 5 µm per voxel side then two scans were performed with a lens with 4 magnification to obtain high resolution images for a smaller field of view with 2 µm per voxel side the low resolution scan was built by stitching together 4 separate scans at different heights fig 3 to obtain an image of almost the whole sample with dimensions larger than the elementary representative volume to measure saturations and connectivity the high resolution scans were performed at two locations at the mid bottom and mid top of the rock to investigate the pore scale mechanisms of trapping and to measure contact angle the high resolution images required more projections and longer exposure time as shown in table 2 after oi we increased both the number of projections and the exposure time for the following scans to obtain higher quality images for wf1 gi and wf2 2 2 3 image processing the reconstruction of the x ray images was performed with the software included in the zeiss versa 500 micro ct which allows corrections for centre shift and beam hardening andrew et al 2014 the 5 µm resolution images were stitched together taking advantage of the wide overlapping region between each scan at least 25 of the whole height of each scanned image fig 3 all the images were registered using the dry scan as a reference allowing direct comparison after each injection step a non local means edge preserving filter was applied to smooth the grey scale images and improve watershed segmentation buades et al 2008 the non local means filter assigns to each voxel the weighted average of the grey scale values of the n voxels in the neighbourhood of the selected one the similarity value is the weight used in the averaging procedure and the lower it is the less the images are smoothed the segmentation of the lower resolution images was performed using a watershed method with the possibility of selecting different gradient values for different phases 2d histogram segmentation function of avizo jones et al 2007 the seeded watershed segmentation algorithm first searches for the seeds of the three phases i e the portions of the pore space where the high certainty exists about the phase present which are far from the interfaces these seeds are then grown proportionally to a certain gradient value until all the voxels of the image are assigned to some phase the advantage of this algorithm is that it preserves the continuity of the phases with acceptable accuracy schlüter et al 2014 however the shape of the interface between the phases which is important for computing quantities such as contact angles and curvature is affected by uncertainties and may be altered by the filtering procedure alhammadi et al 2017 when dealing with the high resolution images the weka machine learning segmentation method arganda carreras et al 2017 was applied using image j software on non filtered images obtaining higher quality results especially when considering small details at the interfaces however weka is much more cpu intensive than watershed segmentation and it was not possible to apply it to the bigger dataset at lower resolution 2 2 4 pore occupancy to analyse the pore occupancy we identified local dilations and constrictions in the pore space using the maximal ball method as a part of generalized network extraction algorithm of raeini et al 2017 to obtain the description of the pore space shown in fig 4 the diameter of the maximal ball is considered to be the pore diameter the spheres representing the pores local dilations in the pore space are superimposed on grey scale wet images for each of the injection steps as shown in fig 5 bultreys et al 2018 the mean grey scale value associated to the voxels inside each sphere refer to fig 5 is computed this results in a distribution of mean grey scale values where due to the averaging over the voxels in each sphere the grey scale probability distribution clearly identifies different peaks corresponding to the different phases the grey scale thresholds classifying the phases are set as the minima in the probability density functions as shown in fig 6 with this procedure the pore centres were segmented into those where brine oil or gas resides as shown in the supplementary information figure s3 the centre of each pore defined by the spheres always corresponds to one phase only as the oil and water layers even when they are thicker after first and second waterflooding do not reach the centre of the pore 3 results and discussion in section 3 1 we first present the saturation of the three phases in the volume imaged with the low resolution scan after each displacement step then in sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 we respectively show i a characterization of three phase displacements in terms of pore size and pore occupancy ii a 3d visualization of double displacement mechanisms namely double drainage and double imbibition and iii a detailed description of contact angles oil layer formation and trapping mechanisms in a high resolution image saturations and pore occupancy were computed on 5 µm resolution images of a large part of the rock sample fig 7 increasing the statistical significance of these results for the detailed characterization of pore scale phenomena of double displacements oil layer formation trapping mechanisms and contact angle measurements we relied on the dataset with higher resolution fig 8 3 1 saturations the saturation of the phases after each step was quantified from the segmented images by the ratio of the voxels assigned to the selected material to the total number of voxels assigned to the pore space the saturation points at the end of each injection are shown in the ternary diagram in fig 9 with the distribution of the phases shown in fig 10 starting with the core fully saturated with water oil was injected oi green arrow in fig 9 the water and oil saturation after oi were 37 6 and 62 4 respectively then wf1 blue arrow in fig 9 allowed production of oil and final saturations of 48 0 and 52 0 for water and oil were measured the oil recovery with water injection was 17 which is lower than previous studies on similar systems kamaljit et al 2016 the reason for this is that not all the oil was trapped at the end of wf1 as evident in fig 10 there is a large cluster of oil connected to the outlet that could be partially displaced on further water injection the third injection introduced gas in the sample gi red arrow in fig 9 this allowed for a production of both water and oil with saturations of 4 0 30 5 and 65 5 for water oil and gas respectively at the end of the gi step at this point the oil recovery with respect to initial oil saturation was 51 the last step was the second waterflooding wf2 blue arrow in fig 9 allowing for gas trapping and further oil recovery the final saturations were 28 6 18 6 and 52 8 for water oil and gas respectively and the recovery factor was 70 with respect to the initial oil saturation these results show how the injection of gas after waterflooding and possibly another injection of water may significantly increase oil recovery gas injection displaced connected oil but also led to the rearrangement of disconnected oil clusters and their partial production as evident in fig 10 further evidence for the displacement of trapped oil is provided later in the paper 3 2 pore occupancy using the procedure described in section 2 2 4 the pore centres identified by maximum ball spheres were assigned to the three phases we obtained bar graphs approximating the probability density functions of the pore sizes occupied by each phase fig 11 the heights f i α of the bars were obtained as follows 1 f i α n i α n i where n i α is the number of pores associated with the phase α for each i th bin while ni is the total number of pores in each i th bin from the results shown in fig 11 we can see that as expected in a water wet system during oi oil invaded the largest pores while water remained confined in the smaller ones with wf1 oil is pushed away from some medium small sized pores replaced by water and produced during gi gas is the most non wetting phase and invades the centre of the larger pores while oil and water are squeezed into smaller pores a noticeable movement of oil happens during gas injection it is displaced by gas which replaces oil in the centre of the larger pores the oil that was trapped during wf1 is as a consequence reconnected in cavities smaller than those occupied before and it is produced some connected oil is also likely directly displaced by gas wf2 causes both a further production of oil which drains in layers along with trapping of the gas phase both inside layers of oil and surrounded only by water the results shown in fig 11 agree with our current understanding of three phase flow in a water wet medium blunt 2017 water oil and gas occupy respectively small medium and larger sized pores however there is some spreading in the thresholds between pores occupied by different phases instead of a sharp demarcation there can be some small pores still occupied by oil and intermediate ones where water and gas are present pore filling in fact is not only driven by the dimension of the pores but other factors have an influence as well such as connectivity cooperative pore filling blunt 2017 and variations in local contact angles alhammadi et al 2017 alratrout et al 2017 3 3 double drainage and double imbibition the high resolution images allowed detailed 3d rendering of the segmented data and the visualization of pore scale phenomena such as double displacement mechanisms after wf1 some oil was trapped in the pore space fig 12 a surrounded by water with the injection of gas gas displaced water and when it could contact oil it directly displaced oil as they compete for the space in the centre of the larger pores mass conservation hence constrains oil to move towards the medium sized pores occupied by water fig 12b this gas displacing oil displacing water is a double displacement mechanism called double drainage as both gas and oil are non wetting phases oren et al 1992 with wf2 we observed the opposite mechanism injected brine being the most wetting phase reconnected through the small and medium pores however since these were partially occupied by oil the latter is mobilized again it was pushed towards larger pores and subsequently part of it is produced and part surrounded gas trapping the latter fig 12c this double displacement is called double imbibition as the two most wetting phases are driving the invasion of the pore space these double displacement mechanisms have a strong influence on the dynamics of three phase flow van dijke et al 2004 and future work will involve a detailed characterization of these phenomena to benchmark and improve pore scale models 3 4 contact angles spreading oil layers and trapping the value of the effective contact angle between oil and water after waterflooding is recognised as a direct measure of the wettability of the system alratrout et al 2017 andrew et al 2014 blunt 2017 jafari and jung 2017 khishvand et al 2016 scanziani et al 2017 this effective contact angle is different than the intrinsic one measured on a smooth surface rabbani et al 2017 we have selected a subvolume of the pore space illustrated in fig 13 and performed the automatic estimation of contact angle developed by scanziani et al 2017 on the images after wf1 fig 13b this method measures the contact angle on the segmented images by fitting a curve to the interface between the fluids using the physical constraint of constant curvature given by the young laplace law when the fluids are in equilibrium the result is illustrated in fig 14 which shows a distribution of contact angles measured through the water phase at 3139 points around a mean value of 47 5 degrees with a standard deviation of 19 1 degrees this result is in line with those found in literature for similar systems kamaljit et al 2016 scanziani et al 2017 and confirms a weakly water wet behaviour coherent with the results of pore occupancy illustrated in section 3 2 the distribution of contact angle instead of a unique value is a consequence of a variation in the selected domain of sub resolution features such as roughness and pore geometry andrew et al 2014 from table 1 the spreading coefficient is 2 mn m which is close to zero we do see the presence of oil layers throughout the pore space when gas and water are present see fig 13c and d therefore we assume that the effective gas oil contact angle is close to zero in our images we were unable to determine clear contacts between gas oil and the solid which again is consistent with the presence of oil layers it is difficult to measure the gas water contact angle directly as oil layers prevent frequent direct contacts of water with gas however this could be estimated using the bartell osterhof relation bartell and osterhof 1927 blunt 2001 panel c of fig 13 refers to the system after gas injection the oil is sandwiched in spreading layers in the corners of the pore space the thickness of these spreading layers was measured fitting maximum spheres to the structures hildebrand and ruegsegger 1997 a 3d map of their thickness is provided in fig 15 during an imbibition process capillary dominated flow in the pores is regulated by the competition between snap off and piston like displacement blunt 2017 this competition is controlled by the aspect ratio or the relative dimension of adjacent pores and throats the geometry of the pore space the connectivity the flow rate and the wettability fig 13 illustrates two different imbibition processes single brine displacing oil imbibition during wf1 panel a to panel b and double brine displacing oil displacing gas imbibition during wf2 panel c to panel d these two phenomena took place in the very same pore space with very similar capillary numbers hence the main difference in the competition between snap off and piston like displacement is given by the contact angle between the displaced and injected phases for lower contact angles snap off and trapping are more favoured during the single imbibition where water displaces oil the oil water angle has been measured to indicate only weakly water wet conditions fig 14 and piston like displacement is favoured in contrast the double imbibition process during wf2 leads to a snapped off ganglion of gas hence gas trapping by oil is preferred over oil trapping by water in the same pores this behaviour has been observed indirectly on measurements in sand packs of the amount of gas trapped by water alone oil trapped by water alone and gas trapped when oil is present at low saturation amaechi et al 2014 more gas was trapped under three phase conditions in the presence of oil and water the pore scale interpretation of this confirmed by our observations is the following due to the simultaneous presence of three phases causing the formation of oil spreading layers oil is strongly wetting to gas with a contact angle close to zero this favours snap off whereas if oil is trapped by water the contact angle is higher and piston like advance is more favoured this explains that oil layers in addition to allowing oil reconnection and production also influence and increase the amount of gas trapping facilitating the potential storage of carbon dioxide when this gas is used for tertiary oil recovery fig 15 provides a comparison between the thickness of brine layers after wf1 and oil layers after gi in general the oil spreading layers are thicker and more pervasive than the wetting brine ones which are confined to the narrowest corners of the pore space oil layer maps may be used in future for computing their permeability and to estimate the velocity of oil flow through them and hence the oil relative permeability in any event the water and oil layers thicknesses are of the order of 10 µm or larger and are connected over the mm scale which is sufficient to contribute significantly to the phase conductance and displacement processes blunt 2017 4 conclusions and future work in this paper we have developed a methodology to obtain a detailed 3d pore scale in situ analysis of immiscible three phase flow at elevated temperatures and pressures with a focus on pore occupancy double displacement mechanisms and the influence of water and oil layer thickness and wettability on non wetting phase snap off and trapping the three phases were injected in the rock initially fully saturated with brine in this order i oil injection oi first waterflooding wf1 gas injection gi and second waterflooding wf2 the quality of the images allowed us to have detailed insight of the pore scale phenomena and in particular 1 we quantified the saturation after each injection step describing the increase in oil recovery due to its remobilization via gi followed by wf2 with a behaviour similar to that previously observed feali et al 2012 iglauer et al 2013 2 we obtained a statistical representation of pore occupancy which is crucial for obtaining improvements in existing three phase network models water resides in the smallest pores and gas in the largest ones blunt 2017 the pore sizes filled with oil the intermediate wet phase depends on the amounts of oil and gas present 3 double drainage and double imbibition previously observed in micromodels keller et al 1997 oren et al 1992 have been imaged and described in 3d pore structures of carbonate rock 4 we have shown how contact angle and fluid distribution play a role in the competition between piston like displacement and snap off leading to preferential trapping of gas in the presence of oil layers as previously observed in sandpacks amaechi et al 2014 5 we obtained quantitative maps of the local water and oil layer thickness which indicate that they are sufficiently thick to contribute to flow and displacement future work could look at mixed wet conditions and the resultant pore occupancies to test the theoretical predictions of van dijke and sorbie 2002 furthermore different rocks and flooding sequences could be studied these experiments could serve as benchmarks for quantitative comparison with and testing of pore scale modelling tools 5 data availability the raw and segmented 3d images of the rock after each injection are available at the digital rock portal

767,we present an experimental and theoretical analysis of non boussinesq inertial large reynolds number flow gravity currents gcs flowing in rectangular cross sections attention is focused on the effects of the open upper boundary which become pronounced when the density contrast between the current and the ambient is significant non boussinesq case the study is conducted deriving first a two layer shallow water sw model for the release of a constant fluid volume into an ambient of given height with a free surface boundary condition with an arbitrary density ratio r between the ambient and the intruding fluid the jump conditions at the front are provided by the novel extension of benjamin 1968 analysis subject to energy dissipation and sub critical speed requests as detailed in ungarish 2017 the resulting sw lock release problem is solved via a finite difference approach lock release experiments are then conducted in this configuration with r 0 837 0 950 full depth and part depth locks and two different lock lengths experimental results obtained for the front position and speed of the intruding current its thickness and the free surface depression of the ambient fluid a signature of these experiments marking the position of the intruding front agree to various degrees with their theoretical counterparts with a better agreement for the front position and depression than for the other quantities but demonstrating in all cases the consistency of the trend some of the experiments were repeated with a top lid boundary condition to discern its effect on the current propagation these effects turn out to be relatively minor except for the obvious absence of interface height depression the range of density ratio r examined is further extended by conducting a numerical simulations with r 0 7 using a numerical commercial computational fluid dynamics code cfd based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans a comparison among sw theory experiments and the numerical simulations is conducted in terms of the trough behind the current nose leading to an overestimation of theoretical results with respect to experiments the length of the through adequately scales with the lock length keywords gravity currents non boussinesq experiments shallow water free surface 1 introduction classical models of gravity currents gcs typically envisage a gc produced by lock release advancing in an ambient fluid while the two fluid system is contained from above by a fixed boundary see ungarish 2009 and the references therein in most analyses the density of the current ρ 1 is slightly different from the ambient fluid s ρ 2 hence the ratio r ρ 2 ρ 1 1 this is the boussinesq case whereas the condition r 0 9 is defined as the non boussinesq case the lock released gc in a channel of rectangular cross section with a fixed top in non boussinesq conditions has been studied experimentally numerically and analitically birman et al 2005 bonometti et al 2008 2011 dai 2014 étienne et al 2005 gröbelbauer et al 1993 jacobson and testik 2013 lowe et al 2005 rotunno et al 2011 turnbull and mcelwaine 2008 ungarish 2007 2011 we emphasize that these studies are relevant to systems with a fixed top boundary however in several real cases and especially in natural environments gcs develop in an ambient fluid with a free surface often in the presence of free surface waves see e g robinson et al 2013 stancanelli et al 2018 or of an imposed or generated flux longo et al 2016 taghavi et al 2010 the effect of the open boundary on the motion of the lock released or lock exchange gc is a relatively uninvestigated topic the presence of the open surface introduces a significant complication in the analysis of the gc because the height of the upper boundary is now a variable of distance x and time t which must be calculated or measured in the laboratory moreover the deviation from the fixed top case turns out to be proportional to 1 r and hence a reliable investigation must cover the more complex non boussinesq regime this lack of knowledge has motivated the present investigation the present paper attempts to clarify and model some salient effects of the gc system with an open surface the progress in the understanding of the gc with fixed top has been strongly facilitated by the availability of the classical benjamin 1968 solution which is valid for both boussinesq and non boussinesq systems with fixed top benjamin s speed and dissipation formulas serve as essential components in shallow water models and in the interpretation of simulation and laboratory data on the other hand no counterpart solution was available for the free surface systems until recently a recent paper by ungarish 2017 has demonstrated that the classical benjamin 1968 solution can be extended to solve the free surface case with a new front condition qualitatively the open surface problem introduces a decrease effect or depression χ in the height of the ambient fluid h as a footprint of the advancing nose of the current since the ratio χ h is proportional to δρ ρ 2 δ ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 in boussinesq conditions the effect is small and usually neglected with little or no comment for non boussinesq conditions the depression can be relevant and to higher orders interferes with the gc front speed and height experimental data for open surface systems are available but only for boussinesq systems with the exception of very recent experiments reported in sciortino et al 2018 on the other hand most of the shallow water sw two layer results are for covered channel for the one layer very deep current the presence absence of the cover is insignificant some sw two layer open surface results have been presented by adduce et al 2011 but i they are in the boussinesq domain and ii use an ad hoc adjustment for the front condition not a jump relationship a front condition for the open top non boussinesq gravity current was also suggested by sciortino et al 2018 this result is based on a weak solution rankine hugoniot derivation which in contrast to benjamin and ungarish 2017 does not satisfy rigorously flow force equilibrium energy dissipation validity and sub critical speed propagation and hence it is mostly of academic value sciortino et al 2018 performed accurate experiments for full depth release currents with open surface in the non boussinesq regime 0 6 r 0 86 they reported reduction of speed of propagation accompanied by a depression of the surface both effects are more enhanced as r decreases unfortunately they did not consider partial depth release systems and did not compare with time dependent solutions of the lock release problem to our knowledge navier stokes simulations for this problem are also unavailable in the present paper we advance existing knowledge on gcs by i developing a new two layer sw model for the non boussinesq case ii solving numerically the resulting lock release problem iii validating the numerical results with experiments iv comparing sw and experimental results with a more complex computational fluid dynamics code cfd in particular we performed a validation of the sw model with the experiments with accurate measurements of the space and time varying free surface depression modulated by the advancing current with the detection of a bounded wave following the front and of free waves generated by the impulsive release of the denser fluid in the lock the detection of the bounded wave is the most prominent validation of a two layer model without lid with a shape of the trough of the wave computed with the sw model in fairly good agreement with the experimental shape as a further confirmation of the correctness of the assumptions we found that in presence of the lid a classical condition in gcs flow in channels a bounded wave of the pressure field develops again with a good agreement between theory of the sw model and experiments the comparison was made with a conversion of the experimental pressure into hydraulic head that means that the top boundary condition only affects the manifestation free surface wave and pressure wave of an intrinsic characteristic of the flow well captured by the model to corroborate and to improve the knowledge of the structure of the flow field we performed direct measurements of the velocity of the current also with the aim to present more data for future extended and more comprehensive models however we deliberately choose to take the sw model as simple as possible and self contained i e with assumptions not requiring the experimental estimation of parameters with rigorous respect of the control volume balances and of the energy based conditions more comprehensive models can be developed and implemented in numerical computations including e g entrainment and density variations effects turbulent structure friction coupling between free surface waves and current secondary circulation in the head of the current but they all require the introduction of adjustable parameters for an appropriate reproduction of the experiments unless the numeric value of the parameters is constant in a wide variety of conditions a quite rare event the introduction of the adjustable parameters reduces the generality and the reliability of the model we also remark that the more detailed cfd models are a very time consuming tool that renders difficult the calibration of the adjustable parameters and also the simulation of the flow with an adequate combination of the conditions the maximum density of the currents in the experiments was limited by some practical aspects since it is difficult to obtain newtonian fluid with small viscosity high viscosity reduces the reynolds number of the experiments and high mass density by adding salts to water however the design of our experiments was dictated by the need of an amplification of the depression of the free surface generated by the advancing current with a high value of the ambient fluid depth a relatively long lock two different values of the lock length were tested for detecting its possible effect on the phenomena under study and a long channel the high value of the ambient fluid depth in addition to an amplification of the depression of the free surface had other important advantages i the coherent structures travelling toward the free surface and generated by the current advancing in the ambient fluid hit the free surface and modify its shape see e g longo 2010 longo 2011 but are smoothed out and diffused during their long travel with a reduction of their disturbing effects the mechanism of generation and transport of these coherent structure is detailed in nakagawa and nezu 1981 for wall boundary layers ii partial depth experiments which are a further validation of the model in a variety of conditions are possible with a still accurate measurement of the depression of the free surface also the length of the channel was fixed in order to delay the appearance of the free waves reflected by the end wall the reflected waves are not modelled in the sw model and represent an undesirable interference the active or passive absorption of the free surface waves is feasible but in practice in order to reduce the uncertainties it is preferable to have a time window during the experiments where the sections of measurements are not yet affected by the reflected waves and the current advances as if it were in an infinitely long channel as last notice in the experimental conditions characterized by a large depth of the ambient fluid the experiments were characterized by high reynolds number with a very limited effect of viscous forces which are neglected in the adopted sw model the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the gc conceptual model is detailed while the finite differences approach adopted and the numerical results obtained are presented in sections 3 and 4 respectively the experimental layout is described in section 5 and the experimental results are outlined in section 6 finally section 7 includes the discussion and the conclusions appendix a describes the cfd code used for direct simulation of the flow field and presents detailed results and comparisons for the velocity field and the free surface evolution 2 sw model consider a two layer system with densities ρ

thickness of the current in the lock and x 0 is the length of the lock and the equations are formulated in terms of the layer thicknesses h 1 2 and z averaged x velocities u 1 2 in this framework the z acceleration terms are negligibly small and hence the pressure is hydrostatic subject to p 0 at z h 1 h 2 continuity at z h 1 and thus given by 1 p 2 z g ρ 2 h 1 h 2 z h 1 z h 1 h 2 2 p 1 z g ρ 2 h

terms are like in the covered channel case see chapters 2 3 5 in ungarish 2009 scale h i i 1 2 with h 0 in the lock x with x 0 of the lock ui with u ϵ g h 0 1 2 t with x 0 u pressure with ρ 2 u 2 ρ 2 g h 0 the formal reynolds number of the system is defined as re 0 uh 0 ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the current fluid hereafter the variables are non dimensional unless differently stated the free parameters of the problem are ϵ or r ρ 2 ρ 1 1 ϵ 1 and h height ratio of unperturbed ambient to h 0 the dimensionless equations of motion are 4 h i t h i u i x 0 i 1 2 5 u 1 t u 1 u 1 x 1 ϵ x

const with the open top condition that the pressure at z h 1 h 2 is a constant as detailed in eqs 1 3 we consider a current of fixed volume released from rest from a lock the initial and boundary conditions are h 1 1 h 1 h 2 h u 1 u 2 0 for 0 x 1 and t 0 x n t 0 1 at x 0 u 1 u 2 0 t at the nose x x n t u n u 1 f r h 1 1 2 h 2 h h 1 χ and u 2 u 1 h 1 χ h 2 where χ is the depression of the surface at the nose fr and χ are the jump conditions formulated in ungarish 2017 for given ϵ and h they are functions of h 1 only see section 2 1 again the free parameters of the problem are ϵ and h the difficulty and major difference from covered top is that the pressure terms are now formally o 1 ϵ this is because the layers of fluid contribute ρgh pressure terms while the momentum terms are like ρg h this introduces some new time and speed scale in the problem as elaborated in section 2 2 it is convenient to introduce the scaled surface height variable 7 ϕ x t h 1 h 2 h ϵ we expect that ϕ is of the order unity for a wide range of ϵ including the boussinesq systems with ϵ 1 the boundary jump conditions at the nose discussed below impose ϕ x n t χ ϵ h 1 1 f r 2 2 h 1 1 for any ϵ we argue and later confirm that this sets the order of magnitude of ϕ as 0 5h 1 0 5 for the whole domain of interest 0 x xn t using the ϕ variable the momentum equations read 8 u 1 t u 1 u 1 x 1 1 ϵ x ϕ

model equation we observe that the simplified one layer model does not preserve the influence of the open surface expressed by h 2 or ϕ 2 1 conditions at the nose at x x n t we use the jump conditions derived by ungarish 2017 using the control volume method of benjamin and employing two downstream profiles vortex sheet and vortex wave the jump satisfies balances of volume flow force pressure loop and vorticity and is then subject to physical energy dissipation and sub critical speed restrictions we note in passing that a different weak solution type front condition has also been suggested by sciortino et al 2018 but without performing a flow force analysis energy validity assessment and criticality consideration as presented in ungarish 2017 we use here the more rigorous results which are easily implemented as follows the dense current propagates with u 1 f r h 1 1 2 while the total height of the upper surface is reduced from h to h χ let a h 1 h χ χ h for given a and ϵ the values fr

critical conditions the eigenvalues λ of the system 4 6 are given by the equation 12 ϵ u 1 λ 2 u 2 λ 2 u 1 λ 2 h 2 u 2 λ 2 h 1 1 1 ϵ h 1 h 2 0 the eigenvalues are in the background of the development and implementation of the sw finite difference scheme they indicate a hyperbolic problem and are used to calculate the critical nose restriction reported in the following eq 18 2 2 1 the unperturbed fluid domain here u 1 u 2 0 we obtain the reduction 13 ϵ λ 4 h 1 h 2 λ 2 1 1 ϵ h 1 h 2 0 which yields 14 λ 2 1 2 1 2 ϵ h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 2 4 ϵ 1 ϵ h 1 h 2 1 2 for small ϵ by a series expansion we find four eigenvalues 15 λ 1 2 h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 1 2 λ 3 4 h 1 h 2 ϵ 1 2 we note that for small ϵ the boussinesq system very rapid perturbation waves λ 3 4 appear in the open surface configuration which have no counterpart in the covered system we recall that the fixed top system h 1 h 1 h has only two characteristics which for the unperturbed fluid domain coincide with λ 1 2 for any ϵ 0 2 2 2 the critical nose at the front x x n t the dense fluid satisfies the jump condition u 1 f r h 1 1 2 the critical situation is when this also satisfies u 1 λ substitution of these conditions into 12 gives 16 u 2 u 1 2 h 2 1 ϵ x x n while the jump condition at the nose imposes 17 u 1 f r h 1 1 2 u 2 u 1 a χ 1 a χ h 2 h 1 a χ where a h 1 h χ χ h combining the equations we obtain the critical nose restriction 18 f r 2 a 1 a χ 3 1 ϵ we emphasize that both a and χ are scaled with the height of the unperturbed ambient h thus in practice the thickness of the current h and of the surface depression χ will increase with h with the input dimensionless parameters ϵ and h 0 h unchanged 3 finite difference approach the sw lock release problem contains four variables u 1 u 2 h 1 and h 2 or ϕ of x and t with jump conditions at xn t and characteristics given by a 4th order equation we could not find analytical solutions and therefore we developed a simple finite difference solver we use the conservation variables h 1 h 2 q 1 q 2 where q i h i u i a manipulation of 4 8 and 9 yields 19 h i t q i x 0 i 1 2 20 q 1 t x q 1 2 h 1 1 1 ϵ 1 2 h 1 2 1 1 ϵ h 1 ϕ x 21 q 2 t x q 2 2 h 2 h 2 ϕ x where again 22 ϕ x t h 1 h 2 h ϵ the variable ϕ is a robust quantity for a wide range of ϵ the values of ϵ may be small for the boussinesq ρ 2 ρ 1 1 case order of unity when ρ 2 ρ 1 0 5 and large when ρ 2 ρ 1 is small the variable ϕ is expected to be of the order of unity for these various cases and hence a convenient variable for the numerical approach to the solution we introduce the transformation y x x n t see ungarish 2009 section 2 3 and solve on a fixed grid y 0 1 using fixed δy intervals we use a maccormack predictor corrector scheme ungarish 2009 app a2 to dampen spurious numerical oscillation we added on the rhs of each equation an artificial diffusion viscosity term of the form b δx 2 vxx where v is the main variable of the equation and b is of the order of unity δ x x n δ y the magnitude of the added term is of the order of magnitude of the truncation error of the scheme and hence the global consistency and accuracy properties of this well tested numerical method are maintained we used typically 200 400 space intervals and the time step δt was set typically to 0 2δy the evaluation of the precise cfl condition requires a cumbersome calculation which was not attempted the numerical accuracy has been tested by running some cases on different grids and with different values of b the formulation of the code is singular for h 1 and hence we approximate the full depth release by h 1 01 4 sw results we present solutions for the full depth release with r 0 905 0 837 and for h 2 with r 0 837 this corresponds to the laboratory experiments 5 4 17 and 10 table 1 we also present sw results for the case h 1 r 0 700 which corresponds to the cfd experiment c16 table 1 the results are displayed in figs 2 6 for h 1 the sw initial propagation is with critical un see 18 in scaled form the difference between the r 0 905 and 0 837 cases is very small however the change to the partial depth h 2 produces a significant increase of un and a reduction of the slumping length time during which un is constant the depression of the surface is represented by ϕ we keep in mind that this variable is scaled with ϵh 0 and since ϵ 0 105 and 0 195 in the cases considered we conclude that the physical displacement χ of the surface is small we note that there is a good correlation between ϕ and h 1 the depression is more significant over the domain where the current is thicker the interpretation is as follows a larger h 1 causes a larger return flow u 2 in the ambient and hence an increase of the kinetic energy for a particle on the streamline bernoulli s equation with a constant p 0 on the surface implies that the increase of kinetic energy must be compensated by the decrease of potential energy at the lower position therefore the sw current on the bottom has a clear fingerprint on the top surface this is confirmed by the experiments the finite difference results display some oscillations in places of sharp changes of the variables this is the manifest of the small numerical dispersion of the finite difference solver see for example morton and mayers 1994 figs 4 7 4 12 and 4 14 the relevant theory and tests with different grid intervals indicate that the influence of these oscillations on the main solution is negligible we found that the code is numerically unstable for currents outside the range of validity and criticality of the nose condition it is not clear what is the physical meaning of this observation the lock release currents produced in our experiments were stable however the flow adjusted on its own to the nose conditions and hence the energy validity and criticality are intrinsically fulfilled sw solutions were obtained for other values of h and r not shown here the behaviour of the flow field is quite similar to the reported cases overall the sw dam break with open top problem results are qualitatively and quantitatively quite close to the covered bottom results in both cases the initial propagation is with constant un the slumping stage and change from the full depth lock h 1 to part depth lock h 2 say yields an increase of un and decrease of the slumping length the major difference observed is the dip of the open top surface which provides an upper fingerprint of the location of the current the speed of propagation is slightly smaller in the open top case as discussed in more detail in section 6 5 the experimental layout and procedures to assess the theoretical models enhancing at the same time the database for this type of flows a series of specially designed laboratory experiments was performed at the hydraulic laboratory of the university of parma a rectangular cross section channel 30 cm wide and 965 cm long with glass lateral walls and stainless steel bottom wall was used with a lock length of 55 102 cm see fig 7 ab the gate was a stainless steel plate 0 2 cm thick rapidly lifted with a cable and pulleys system the opening of the gate took approximately 0 2 s in a first series of tests the ambient fluid tap water of density equal to ρ 2 0 998 g cm 3 had a free surface the intruding current was prepared in an ad hoc tank by adding sodium chloride nacl to tap water and introducing aniline dye into the latter for an easy visualization of the shape of the current advancing in the transparent ambient fluid the use of nacl allowed the intruding current to reach a maximum final density of ρ 1 1 193 g cm 3 r 0 836 ϵ 0 195 several marks with a 20 cm spacing where stuck on the bottom in order to measure the front speed a grid with 5 cm horizontally spaced and 1 cm vertically spaced lines was stuck on the side of the channel in order to measure the amplitude of the oscillations of the free surface by converting the pixel position of video images into metric coordinates the procedure of filling the tank was designed in order to avoid excessive net force on the gate initially the downstream channel was filled with tap water up to a target level corresponding to the zero level of the grid then the high density fluid was gently poured inside the lock in order to reduce the hydraulic disturbances due to the lift of the gate two horizontal polystyrene lids were fixed on both sides of the gate and maintained in contact with the surface of both the ambient and the intruding fluids in this way the oscillations of the free surface triggered by the vertical movement of the gate were minimized each experiment was recorded by three high resolution video cameras 3840 2160 pixels working at 30 frames per second f p s each of them with a field of view fov 1 m long in the horizontal direction high frequency neon lights were adopted as a uniform and stable source of illumination from the side of the channel after extraction of the frames from the videos using a commercial software it was possible to detect the profile of the free surface using a proprietary software with a time accuracy of 1 30 s in order to trigger the start of the flow the opening of the gate was detected by a micro switch which turned off several leds when the gate was lifted the leds were positioned along the channel in order to be in the fov of the video cameras and to allow synchronizing the frames of the videos three ultrasound distance meters us1 us2 us3 turckbanner q45ur were positioned on the top of the channel to record the free surface oscillations with an accuracy of 0 03 cm and a data rate of 100 hz the overall accuracy of measurements of the depression was checked for a single test by comparing the results of the ultrasound distance meters and of the image analysis fig 8 shows the comparison between the free surface elevation χ measured with both techniques at the cross sections of coordinates x 115 247 cm measured from the gate the agreement is fairly good considering that no calibration parameters are needed the small discrepancies between measurements are due to meniscus which also acts as a filter of the high frequency fluctuations fluid velocity was measured in the mid section of the channel by an array of four ultrasound velocity profilers uvp model dop 2000 signal processing s a switzerland 2005 with a carrier at 8 mhz tr0805ls and installed at x 260 cm from the gate the four probes were arranged as in fig 7 cd and in the adopted configuration acquired the three component velocity profiles in the vertical with a space resolution of 0 11 cm 120 volumes of measurements and data rate 18 hz number of profiles per second the raw data are represented by the axial velocity components for probes 1 2 and 3 acquired with a small time lag and then transformed into the cartesian coordinate system x y z with a transformation 23 u v w a u 1 u 2 u 3 where a is the matrix of transformation and u 1 u 2 u 3 are the axial

2 and 25 b a 11 0 a 13 a 21 0 a 23 a 31 0 a 31 more details on data analysis from uvp are given in longo 2011 the central probe no 4 was used to record the echo in an attempt to detect the current ambient fluid interface since the echo of the ultrasounds is stronger where a variation of acoustic impedance occurs like at the interface fig 9 shows the measured velocity components for expt 7 the validity of the assumptions used to transform the axial velocities into velocity components along the x y z axes can be appreciated by observing the good agreement between the vertical velocity w as reconstructed with eq 24 applied to measurements by probes no 1 2 3 symbols and as measured by probe no 4 continuous line the figure also shows the energy of the echo of probe no 4 with a maximum at a level that can be assumed as representative of the thickness of the current the position of the front of the current was detected using a full hd video camera canon legria hf 20 1920 1080 pixels with data rate of 25 frames per second the camera was translated parallel to the channel in order to keep the nose of the current in the fov and the marks stuck at the bottom of the channel were used to detect the front position of the current with an overall uncertainty of less than 0 2 cm a second series of experiments were performed with a lid on the top in order to compare its effects on the front speed of the current a differential manometer with an overall accuracy of 0 1 mbar was positioned at a distance of 160 cm from the gate with one port at atmospheric pressure and the second port near the lid and in contact with the ambient fluid with the aim of measuring the pressure variations due to the advancing current 5 1 the uncertainty in variables and parameters the parameters of the experiments are either directly measured or computed on the basis of the measurements mass density was measured by a densimeter with an accuracy of 10 3 g cm 3 and the corresponding uncertainty for r ρ 2 ρ 1 is δr r 0 2 the relative uncertainty in the reduced gravity g is again 0 2 the level of the ambient fluid and of the intruding fluid in the lock was fixed with an accuracy of 0 1 cm and the relative uncertainty is δh h 0 3 and δh 0 h 0 0 3 the uncertainty on the ratio h h 0 is at most equal to 0 6 the velocity scale had an uncertainty δu u 0 4 and the time scale had an uncertainty equal to δt t 1 4 by assuming an uncertainty of 1 in the value of the kinematic viscosity of the denser fluid the resulting uncertainty in reynolds number was δre 0 re 0 2 0 the free surface level of the ambient fluid measured by the ultrasonic distance meters had an uncertainty of 0 03 cm the velocity field reconstructed by using measurements by the uvp probes had an uncertainty of 4 of the measured value with a minimum of 0 3 cm s 1 the uncertainty of the vertical position where the velocity measurements are referred was 0 1 cm 6 the experiments eighteen experiments were performed fourteen with an open boundary and four with a top lid table 1 lists the main parameters for each experiment note that two additional lines include relevant data for numerical experiments conducted for a system without lid details about these computer simulations are provided in appendix a the purpose of the computer experiments is to simulate clear cut non boussinesq currents with r 0 7 thus widening the range of parameters under consideration to illustrate the general behaviour observed in the experiments a sequence of frames is shown in fig 10 for expt 17 an enlargement near the free surface is also shown for a better visualization of the free surface distortion due to the advancing gc it is seen that the free surface is elevated downstream the nose and is depressed behind the nose with a space lag almost equal to the distance between the front and the first billow fig 11 shows the dimensionless front position of the intruding current for all the experiments for an easy visualization the symbols related to experiments in partial depth have been translated of five h 4 3 and ten units h 2 in the vertical respectively and have been decimated one point each two or three is inserted in the plot the data collapse fairly well for each series of experiments it is seen that the initial slumping phase with a constant front speed is followed by a deceleration which is more evident in partial depth conditions there is no significant detectable effect of the free surface waves or of the lock length on the front speed however a small reduction of the slumping phase front speed is detected by comparing e g expt 7 open top and expt 9 top lid two experiments with identical parameters but with a different top boundary condition the open top b c allows the development of free surface waves which subtract part of the potential energy available to accelerate the current as a result a reduction of the front speed 3 is recorded see appendix a for details on the energy balance similar results are obtained by pairwise comparison of expts 11 12 10 13 8 4 where expts 11 10 4 are with a top lid and expts 12 13 4 are their open top counterparts fig 12 shows the dimensionless depression of the free surface profiles for expt 4 with lock length x 0 55 cm two families of free surface oscillations can be observed i propagating waves and ii bounded waves in addition to these waves there are secondary small oscillations coupled to the billows of the intruding current the front of the current is forerun by a solitary wave propagating with height 1 5 cm and a celerity equal to 160 cm s and is followed by a trough bounded wave with a maximum depression at 30 cm behind the nose the solitary wave is similar to the wave generated by an avalanche reaching the sea and generating a tsunami the maximum trough amplitude is equal to 2 cm and progressively decreases with the front advancement after a few seconds the initial solitary wave is reflected by the end wall and reaches with negative celerity the front of the current partially canceling the trough fig 12 also shows i the results of the sw numerical code for expt 4 and ii the profiles measured for expt 17 with the same parameters of expt 4 except for a lock length x 0 102 cm i e almost double that of expt 4 upon comparing the different curves it is observed that the experimental length of the trough is finite and fairly well predicted by the theoretical model moreover a longer lock generates a more persistent depression of the free surface the trough length adequately scales with the length of the lock in both experiments the limited length of the trough is a consequence of the limited volume of the lock which generates a current of finite length instead of a long tongue fig 13 a shows a more comprehensive comparison conducted for all tests between the depression χ deriving from the experiments and from sw theory the experimental values empty symbols are generally close to the theory solid lines with relatively minor deviations the cfd simulations filled symbols conducted for the full depth case with the free surface boundary condition see appendix a generally overestimate the sw theoretical values depressions resulting from the top lid boundary condition are also plotted for comparison crossed symbols and show deviations both in excess and in defect from the theoretical predictions fig 13 b shows the comparison among the four earlier categories of results experimental open top sw theoretical open top experimental top lid and cfd open top for the height hn at the front of the current there are discrepancies with the sw theory especially for the partial depth case but in general the trend is correctly reproduced with larger thickness of the current at the nose for partial depth than for full depth experiments the long error bars associated with experimental results indicate that the validation of the predicted hn is subject to a significant uncertainty which is a consequence also of the difficult definition of the experimental height of the current near the front a final comparison is conducted for the front velocity un and is shown in fig 13 c theoretical sw results always overestimate their experimental counterparts albeit to a variable degree but almost always larger than the error bars the overestimation is a standard result due to the approximations embedded in the sw model which neglects entrainment and dissipation and adopts the thin layer approximation the experimental data for h 1 from sciortino et al 2018 are also shown with a good overlap with the present experiments and a good agreement with theoretical predictions 6 1 the structure of the velocity field the structure of the velocity fields in gcs has a main role in addressing the complex interaction between the nose the billows and the ambient fluid and whenever a more detailed analysis is requested the sw equations rely on a uniform velocity along the vertical an in depth experimental analysis is requested to clarify the correctness of this assumption past measurements of velocity profiles in gcs with uvp are detailed in longo et al 2016 where a single probe two probes was were used to measure the velocity structure within the ambient fluid the present measurements are obtained with four probes located within the intruding current since the position of the volume of measurements gates and of the doppler shift require the value of the sound celerity c ϵ ρ where ϵ is the adiabatic bulk modulus we assumed a constant celerity in the current computed by adopting the theoretical values of the bulk modulus and the mass density of the fluid fig 14 ab shows the velocity field measured by the uvp probes for two experiments expt 4 and expt 17 having identical parameters but with lock length 55 102 cm respectively the time series of the velocity measured in a single section has been mapped into space by multiplying the time and the front speed under the hypothesis of frozen current time is mapped into space as x x n t the front speed is almost identical for the two experiments but the shape of the current is quite different with a detached body of dense fluid advancing with a limited tail in the experiment with short lock and a long thin current in the experiment with a long lock 7 discussion and conclusions motivated by the ubiquitous presence of gravity currents gcs with open top free surface in environmental and industrial applications we studied the non boussinesq regime of inertial gcs performing a series of free surface experiments in a rectangular cross section channel and developing a novel two layer sw model to interpret the experimental results the experiments were performed with different values of the density ratio r ranging from 0 950 to 0 837 measured quantities included the free surface depression of the ambient fluid the thickness and the front speed of the intruding current and the three components of the velocity by means of a uvp to extend the study to lower values of r a difficult task since non dangerous salts to be added to water to obtain heavy fluids with newtonian rheology are rare and expensive numerical simulations were conducted with r 0 7 using a numerical commercial cfd code based on rans we performed experiments for both full depth and partial depth locks further some experiments were repeated with a top lid in order to compare the effect of the boundary condition on the front speed and to measure the pressure variation a proxy for the free surface fluctuations we think that our work provides useful insights and modelling suggestions concerning the flow of a gc in a system with a free surface our work leads to the following major conclusions the high density current advancing in the fluid generates two main families of waves progressive waves faster than the front and a trough bounded to the front and lagging it in a finite length channel the reflection on the back and end walls generates further waves which modify in a complex manner the free surface elevation a depression of the open top surface is observed in all cases similar with the results of sciortino et al 2018 and providing an indication of the location of the front of the intruding current specifically the amplitude of the trough maximum depression behind the nose was chosen to compare results from the numerical sw code and the experiments the experimental amplitude of the trough generally is less than the theoretical one while the numerical simulations overestimate experimental results the front position of the intruding current collapses on the novel sw theoretical predictions fairly well showing that an initial slumping phase with a constant front speed is followed by a deceleration which is more evident in partial depth conditions the corroboration of the prediction of the thickness of the current is not sharp due to a large uncertainty but confirms the experimental correct trend for increasing r as for the front velocity theoretical results overestimate their experimental counterparts due to the approximations embedded in the sw model which neglects entrainment and dissipation and adopts the thin layer approximation the incorporation of entrainment and bottom friction in sw type models is formally possible adduce et al 2011 but in this case the solution is reliant on empirical coefficients which in general are not known for non boussinesq currents such an extension requires a dedicated investigation which must be left for the future we reiterate that the advantage of the sw model used in the present investigation is that it is self contained the solution is determined by the initial conditions geometry of the lock and the density ratio r without any adjustable constant results for experiments conducted with a covered bottom are qualitatively and quantitatively quite close to those obtained with the free surface condition except for the depression in the ambient induced in the latter case which also exhibits a slightly smaller speed of propagation a good comparison between theory and experiments is also obtained for the covered bottom case here the differential pressure variation measured at the top of the channel agrees with the theory and is also well reproduced by the cfd code as to the effect of the lock length on the overall geometry of the current and of the depression it is seen that the lock length does not affect the front speed during the slumping phase but has an evident effect on the geometry of the current behind the nose and on the length of the depression the longer the lock the longer the depression the shorter the lock the more similar to a single hump is the current the length of the through adequately scales with the lock length and is generally well reproduced by the sw model the time series of the fluid velocity with the uvp time series in a single section of the channel can be transformed into space series by assuming a frozen current behaviour and mapping t x n x the correctness of this approach at least during the slumping phase has been validated with the cfd code results acknowledgements we thank mahdi

scheme was used for time discretization and the implicit body force treatment for the body force formulation in the multiphase model was enabled this treatment improves the convergence of solutions by accounting for the partial equilibrium of the pressure gradient and body forces in the momentum equations the reynolds stress model rsm was adopted abandoning the isotropic eddy viscosity hypothesis the rsm closes the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations by solving transport equations for the reynolds stresses which appear in eq a 2 when the reynolds decomposition is applied together with an

reynolds stress model near the walls and ii to calculate the component of the pressure strain term responsible for the redistribution of normal stresses near the wall the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso scheme was adopted for the pressure velocity coupling and a second order discretization scheme was used for both momentum and volume fraction in this method under relaxation factors greater than 0 8 are recommended for all equations except for momentum and pressure factor that were set respectively equal to 0 7 and 0 3 default values also a volume fraction factor equal to 0 5 can be adopted at the beginning of the simulation a time step equal to 0 0001 s was set in order to get a stable solution then the time step was gradually increased up to 0 002 s a 1 model geometry and computational grid the experimental apparatus i e the rectangular channel was modeled in two dimensions at full scale resulting in a computational domain 9 55 m long 10 10 m in the case of extended lock and 0 5 m high see fig a 1 the domain was discretized by a mesh of more than 1 2 106 rectangular cells with a maximum face area of 3 2 mm2 the minimum cell size was set equal to 1 mm while the maximum one to 2 mm with a growing rate of 1 2 the resulting mesh is very regular with a minimum orthogonal quality equal to 0 73 orthogonal quality ranges from 0 to 1 where values close to 0 correspond to low quality finer resolutions of the mesh have been tested without experiencing significant variations in the final results fig a 1 also shows a detail of the mesh close to the bottom of the channel the no slip boundary condition was imposed at the bottom and at the sides i e upstream and downstream walls of the channel the lid which extends over the lock region was also reproduced by an horizontal wall without slip while the top of the channel was modeled with a symmetry boundary condition zero normal derivatives in the numerical model no gate was necessary and the initial condition was imposed defining the desired value of all the variables in the nodes e g the volume fraction of each phase a 2 some comparisons fig a 2 shows a comparison of the velocity field computed with the numerical simulation and measured with the uvp fig a 2 a shows the direct result from the code while fig a 2 b was obtained by using the data resulting from the numerical code sampled with the same pattern of the uvp array of probes and then applying the frozen current hypothesis fig a 2 c shows the velocity field as measured with the uvp and then reproduced under the hypothesis of frozen current we preliminarily note that the main differences between the results shown in fig a 2 a b is the absence of the billows effects in the latter there are also some differences in the nose velocity field but they are not so relevant hence the hypothesis of frozen current can be adopted with confidence in particular during the slumping phase when the hypothesis of stationarity holds upon comparing measured velocities with computed velocities different patterns are evident with large velocity values appearing in the tail and a more flattened nose to extend the comparison to the free surface behaviour the numerical model was applied with the same conditions of some experiments listed in table 1 fig a 3 shows the comparison between the experimental depression and the numerical model for expt 4 at two different times the early time profile shows a good agreement with the experiments the agreement is less good for subsequent times in particular the length of the depressed profile is well reproduced a comparison is also available for the experiments with the lid where the pressure measured by the differential manometer has been converted into height of ambient fluid column fig a 4 a shows the experimental depression compared to the results of the cfd simulation the cfd simulation overestimates the experimental value but correctly reproduces the instant of maximum depression and the shape of the height pressure time series fig a 4 b shows the measured depression as a function of the front position the maximum depression lags the front of the current the evolution of the nose of the current is shown in fig a 5 where four snapshots are shown at t 5 10 15 20 s for expt c16bis the initial complex structure of the intruding current with billows swept by the return flow current progressively evolves toward a simple structure more adherent to the scheme of thin gcs the ambient fluid flow field is also marked by the free surface oscillations which are dominant in the late stage the overall energy balance is shown in fig a 6 the energy variations non dimensional with respect to the potential energy of the current fluid in the lock before release are shown as a function of the nose position the kinetic energy increment of the current fluid is accompanied by an increment of the same magnitude also for the ambient fluid and reaches a maximum corresponding to the vertical line in the fig a 6 and then decreases most energy is exchanged in potential form between the two fluids and part of it is dissipated at a constant rate

767,we present an experimental and theoretical analysis of non boussinesq inertial large reynolds number flow gravity currents gcs flowing in rectangular cross sections attention is focused on the effects of the open upper boundary which become pronounced when the density contrast between the current and the ambient is significant non boussinesq case the study is conducted deriving first a two layer shallow water sw model for the release of a constant fluid volume into an ambient of given height with a free surface boundary condition with an arbitrary density ratio r between the ambient and the intruding fluid the jump conditions at the front are provided by the novel extension of benjamin 1968 analysis subject to energy dissipation and sub critical speed requests as detailed in ungarish 2017 the resulting sw lock release problem is solved via a finite difference approach lock release experiments are then conducted in this configuration with r 0 837 0 950 full depth and part depth locks and two different lock lengths experimental results obtained for the front position and speed of the intruding current its thickness and the free surface depression of the ambient fluid a signature of these experiments marking the position of the intruding front agree to various degrees with their theoretical counterparts with a better agreement for the front position and depression than for the other quantities but demonstrating in all cases the consistency of the trend some of the experiments were repeated with a top lid boundary condition to discern its effect on the current propagation these effects turn out to be relatively minor except for the obvious absence of interface height depression the range of density ratio r examined is further extended by conducting a numerical simulations with r 0 7 using a numerical commercial computational fluid dynamics code cfd based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans a comparison among sw theory experiments and the numerical simulations is conducted in terms of the trough behind the current nose leading to an overestimation of theoretical results with respect to experiments the length of the through adequately scales with the lock length keywords gravity currents non boussinesq experiments shallow water free surface 1 introduction classical models of gravity currents gcs typically envisage a gc produced by lock release advancing in an ambient fluid while the two fluid system is contained from above by a fixed boundary see ungarish 2009 and the references therein in most analyses the density of the current ρ 1 is slightly different from the ambient fluid s ρ 2 hence the ratio r ρ 2 ρ 1 1 this is the boussinesq case whereas the condition r 0 9 is defined as the non boussinesq case the lock released gc in a channel of rectangular cross section with a fixed top in non boussinesq conditions has been studied experimentally numerically and analitically birman et al 2005 bonometti et al 2008 2011 dai 2014 étienne et al 2005 gröbelbauer et al 1993 jacobson and testik 2013 lowe et al 2005 rotunno et al 2011 turnbull and mcelwaine 2008 ungarish 2007 2011 we emphasize that these studies are relevant to systems with a fixed top boundary however in several real cases and especially in natural environments gcs develop in an ambient fluid with a free surface often in the presence of free surface waves see e g robinson et al 2013 stancanelli et al 2018 or of an imposed or generated flux longo et al 2016 taghavi et al 2010 the effect of the open boundary on the motion of the lock released or lock exchange gc is a relatively uninvestigated topic the presence of the open surface introduces a significant complication in the analysis of the gc because the height of the upper boundary is now a variable of distance x and time t which must be calculated or measured in the laboratory moreover the deviation from the fixed top case turns out to be proportional to 1 r and hence a reliable investigation must cover the more complex non boussinesq regime this lack of knowledge has motivated the present investigation the present paper attempts to clarify and model some salient effects of the gc system with an open surface the progress in the understanding of the gc with fixed top has been strongly facilitated by the availability of the classical benjamin 1968 solution which is valid for both boussinesq and non boussinesq systems with fixed top benjamin s speed and dissipation formulas serve as essential components in shallow water models and in the interpretation of simulation and laboratory data on the other hand no counterpart solution was available for the free surface systems until recently a recent paper by ungarish 2017 has demonstrated that the classical benjamin 1968 solution can be extended to solve the free surface case with a new front condition qualitatively the open surface problem introduces a decrease effect or depression χ in the height of the ambient fluid h as a footprint of the advancing nose of the current since the ratio χ h is proportional to δρ ρ 2 δ ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 in boussinesq conditions the effect is small and usually neglected with little or no comment for non boussinesq conditions the depression can be relevant and to higher orders interferes with the gc front speed and height experimental data for open surface systems are available but only for boussinesq systems with the exception of very recent experiments reported in sciortino et al 2018 on the other hand most of the shallow water sw two layer results are for covered channel for the one layer very deep current the presence absence of the cover is insignificant some sw two layer open surface results have been presented by adduce et al 2011 but i they are in the boussinesq domain and ii use an ad hoc adjustment for the front condition not a jump relationship a front condition for the open top non boussinesq gravity current was also suggested by sciortino et al 2018 this result is based on a weak solution rankine hugoniot derivation which in contrast to benjamin and ungarish 2017 does not satisfy rigorously flow force equilibrium energy dissipation validity and sub critical speed propagation and hence it is mostly of academic value sciortino et al 2018 performed accurate experiments for full depth release currents with open surface in the non boussinesq regime 0 6 r 0 86 they reported reduction of speed of propagation accompanied by a depression of the surface both effects are more enhanced as r decreases unfortunately they did not consider partial depth release systems and did not compare with time dependent solutions of the lock release problem to our knowledge navier stokes simulations for this problem are also unavailable in the present paper we advance existing knowledge on gcs by i developing a new two layer sw model for the non boussinesq case ii solving numerically the resulting lock release problem iii validating the numerical results with experiments iv comparing sw and experimental results with a more complex computational fluid dynamics code cfd in particular we performed a validation of the sw model with the experiments with accurate measurements of the space and time varying free surface depression modulated by the advancing current with the detection of a bounded wave following the front and of free waves generated by the impulsive release of the denser fluid in the lock the detection of the bounded wave is the most prominent validation of a two layer model without lid with a shape of the trough of the wave computed with the sw model in fairly good agreement with the experimental shape as a further confirmation of the correctness of the assumptions we found that in presence of the lid a classical condition in gcs flow in channels a bounded wave of the pressure field develops again with a good agreement between theory of the sw model and experiments the comparison was made with a conversion of the experimental pressure into hydraulic head that means that the top boundary condition only affects the manifestation free surface wave and pressure wave of an intrinsic characteristic of the flow well captured by the model to corroborate and to improve the knowledge of the structure of the flow field we performed direct measurements of the velocity of the current also with the aim to present more data for future extended and more comprehensive models however we deliberately choose to take the sw model as simple as possible and self contained i e with assumptions not requiring the experimental estimation of parameters with rigorous respect of the control volume balances and of the energy based conditions more comprehensive models can be developed and implemented in numerical computations including e g entrainment and density variations effects turbulent structure friction coupling between free surface waves and current secondary circulation in the head of the current but they all require the introduction of adjustable parameters for an appropriate reproduction of the experiments unless the numeric value of the parameters is constant in a wide variety of conditions a quite rare event the introduction of the adjustable parameters reduces the generality and the reliability of the model we also remark that the more detailed cfd models are a very time consuming tool that renders difficult the calibration of the adjustable parameters and also the simulation of the flow with an adequate combination of the conditions the maximum density of the currents in the experiments was limited by some practical aspects since it is difficult to obtain newtonian fluid with small viscosity high viscosity reduces the reynolds number of the experiments and high mass density by adding salts to water however the design of our experiments was dictated by the need of an amplification of the depression of the free surface generated by the advancing current with a high value of the ambient fluid depth a relatively long lock two different values of the lock length were tested for detecting its possible effect on the phenomena under study and a long channel the high value of the ambient fluid depth in addition to an amplification of the depression of the free surface had other important advantages i the coherent structures travelling toward the free surface and generated by the current advancing in the ambient fluid hit the free surface and modify its shape see e g longo 2010 longo 2011 but are smoothed out and diffused during their long travel with a reduction of their disturbing effects the mechanism of generation and transport of these coherent structure is detailed in nakagawa and nezu 1981 for wall boundary layers ii partial depth experiments which are a further validation of the model in a variety of conditions are possible with a still accurate measurement of the depression of the free surface also the length of the channel was fixed in order to delay the appearance of the free waves reflected by the end wall the reflected waves are not modelled in the sw model and represent an undesirable interference the active or passive absorption of the free surface waves is feasible but in practice in order to reduce the uncertainties it is preferable to have a time window during the experiments where the sections of measurements are not yet affected by the reflected waves and the current advances as if it were in an infinitely long channel as last notice in the experimental conditions characterized by a large depth of the ambient fluid the experiments were characterized by high reynolds number with a very limited effect of viscous forces which are neglected in the adopted sw model the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the gc conceptual model is detailed while the finite differences approach adopted and the numerical results obtained are presented in sections 3 and 4 respectively the experimental layout is described in section 5 and the experimental results are outlined in section 6 finally section 7 includes the discussion and the conclusions appendix a describes the cfd code used for direct simulation of the flow field and presents detailed results and comparisons for the velocity field and the free surface evolution 2 sw model consider a two layer system with densities ρ 2 ρ 1 heights h 1 h 2 and z averaged x velocities u 1 u 2 x is the horizontal coordinate z the vertical with z 0 at the bottom the gravity g acts in z direction see fig 1 the height of the undisturbed ambient fluid is h and initially h 1 h 2 h but this does not hold during the motion in the activated domain x xn t where in general h 1 h 2 χ x t h in the covered fixed top system h 1 h 2 h is satisfied all the time let ɛ ρ 1 ρ 2 1 g ϵ g the justifications of the shallow water approximation for a high reynolds number gravity current have been discussed in the literature e g ungarish 2009 the interface between the lower layer 1 and upper layer 2 is assumed sharp and there is no entrainment mixing the current is assumed thin with respect to its length i e h 0 x 0 1 where h 0 is the thickness of the current in the lock and x 0 is the length of the lock and the equations are formulated in terms of the layer thicknesses h 1 2 and z averaged x velocities u 1 2 in this framework the z acceleration terms are negligibly small and hence the pressure is hydrostatic subject to p 0 at z h 1 h 2 continuity at z h 1 and thus given by 1 p 2 z g ρ 2 h 1 h 2 z h 1 z h 1 h 2 2 p 1 z g ρ 2 h 2 ρ 1 h 1 z 0 z h 1 and hence the driving pressure gradients are 3 p 1 x g ρ 1 h 1 x ρ 2 h 2 x p 2 x g ρ 2 h 1 h 2 x the equations of continuity and the expressions for the x inertia acceleration terms are like in the covered channel case see chapters 2 3 5 in ungarish 2009 scale h i i 1 2 with h 0 in the lock x with x 0 of the lock ui with u ϵ g h 0 1 2 t with x 0 u pressure with ρ 2 u 2 ρ 2 g h 0 the formal reynolds number of the system is defined as re 0 uh 0 ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the current fluid hereafter the variables are non dimensional unless differently stated the free parameters of the problem are ϵ or r ρ 2 ρ 1 1 ϵ 1 and h height ratio of unperturbed ambient to h 0 the dimensionless equations of motion are 4 h i t h i u i x 0 i 1 2 5 u 1 t u 1 u 1 x 1 ϵ x h 1 1 1 ϵ h 2 6 u 2 t u 2 u 2 x 1 ϵ x h 1 h 2 eqs 4 6 are a variant of the shallow water equations developed in ungarish 2009 chapters 2 1 and 5 2 here we replace the fixed top condition h 1 h 2 h const with the open top condition that the pressure at z h 1 h 2 is a constant as detailed in eqs 1 3 we consider a current of fixed volume released from rest from a lock the initial and boundary conditions are h 1 1 h 1 h 2 h u 1 u 2 0 for 0 x 1 and t 0 x n t 0 1 at x 0 u 1 u 2 0 t at the nose x x n t u n u 1 f r h 1 1 2 h 2 h h 1 χ and u 2 u 1 h 1 χ h 2 where χ is the depression of the surface at the nose fr and χ are the jump conditions formulated in ungarish 2017 for given ϵ and h they are functions of h 1 only see section 2 1 again the free parameters of the problem are ϵ and h the difficulty and major difference from covered top is that the pressure terms are now formally o 1 ϵ this is because the layers of fluid contribute ρgh pressure terms while the momentum terms are like ρg h this introduces some new time and speed scale in the problem as elaborated in section 2 2 it is convenient to introduce the scaled surface height variable 7 ϕ x t h 1 h 2 h ϵ we expect that ϕ is of the order unity for a wide range of ϵ including the boussinesq systems with ϵ 1 the boundary jump conditions at the nose discussed below impose ϕ x n t χ ϵ h 1 1 f r 2 2 h 1 1 for any ϵ we argue and later confirm that this sets the order of magnitude of ϕ as 0 5h 1 0 5 for the whole domain of interest 0 x xn t using the ϕ variable the momentum equations read 8 u 1 t u 1 u 1 x 1 1 ϵ x ϕ h 1 9 u 2 t u 2 u 2 x ϕ x the elimination of ϕ yields 10 u 1 t u 1 u 1 x 1 1 ϵ u 2 t u 2 u 2 x 1 1 ϵ h 1 x when u 2 1 ϵ u 1 is small the term in the brackets is negligible and we obtain the one layer model equation we observe that the simplified one layer model does not preserve the influence of the open surface expressed by h 2 or ϕ 2 1 conditions at the nose at x x n t we use the jump conditions derived by ungarish 2017 using the control volume method of benjamin and employing two downstream profiles vortex sheet and vortex wave the jump satisfies balances of volume flow force pressure loop and vorticity and is then subject to physical energy dissipation and sub critical speed restrictions we note in passing that a different weak solution type front condition has also been suggested by sciortino et al 2018 but without performing a flow force analysis energy validity assessment and criticality consideration as presented in ungarish 2017 we use here the more rigorous results which are easily implemented as follows the dense current propagates with u 1 f r h 1 1 2 while the total height of the upper surface is reduced from h to h χ let a h 1 h χ χ h for given a and ϵ the values fr and χ are provided by the solution of the system 11 1 2 f r 2 1 a χ 1 a χ 1 2 χ 1 1 2 a χ χ ϵ a 1 1 2 f r 2 constrained by the dissipation condition to a 0 5 1 ϵ approximately see ungarish 2017 for details the solution is easily obtained by iterations a convenient starting value is benjamin s f r 2 2 a 1 a 1 a a rigorous test for physical dissipation is f r 2 1 a χ 2 2 characteristics and critical conditions the eigenvalues λ of the system 4 6 are given by the equation 12 ϵ u 1 λ 2 u 2 λ 2 u 1 λ 2 h 2 u 2 λ 2 h 1 1 1 ϵ h 1 h 2 0 the eigenvalues are in the background of the development and implementation of the sw finite difference scheme they indicate a hyperbolic problem and are used to calculate the critical nose restriction reported in the following eq 18 2 2 1 the unperturbed fluid domain here u 1 u 2 0 we obtain the reduction 13 ϵ λ 4 h 1 h 2 λ 2 1 1 ϵ h 1 h 2 0 which yields 14 λ 2 1 2 1 2 ϵ h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 2 4 ϵ 1 ϵ h 1 h 2 1 2 for small ϵ by a series expansion we find four eigenvalues 15 λ 1 2 h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 1 2 λ 3 4 h 1 h 2 ϵ 1 2 we note that for small ϵ the boussinesq system very rapid perturbation waves λ 3 4 appear in the open surface configuration which have no counterpart in the covered system we recall that the fixed top system h 1 h 1 h has only two characteristics which for the unperturbed fluid domain coincide with λ 1 2 for any ϵ 0 2 2 2 the critical nose at the front x x n t the dense fluid satisfies the jump condition u 1 f r h 1 1 2 the critical situation is when this also satisfies u 1 λ substitution of these conditions into 12 gives 16 u 2 u 1 2 h 2 1 ϵ x x n while the jump condition at the nose imposes 17 u 1 f r h 1 1 2 u 2 u 1 a χ 1 a χ h 2 h 1 a χ where a h 1 h χ χ h combining the equations we obtain the critical nose restriction 18 f r 2 a 1 a χ 3 1 ϵ we emphasize that both a and χ are scaled with the height of the unperturbed ambient h thus in practice the thickness of the current h and of the surface depression χ will increase with h with the input dimensionless parameters ϵ and h 0 h unchanged 3 finite difference approach the sw lock release problem contains four variables u 1 u 2 h 1 and h 2 or ϕ of x and t with jump conditions at xn t and characteristics given by a 4th order equation we could not find analytical solutions and therefore we developed a simple finite difference solver we use the conservation variables h 1 h 2 q 1 q 2 where q i h i u i a manipulation of 4 8 and 9 yields 19 h i t q i x 0 i 1 2 20 q 1 t x q 1 2 h 1 1 1 ϵ 1 2 h 1 2 1 1 ϵ h 1 ϕ x 21 q 2 t x q 2 2 h 2 h 2 ϕ x where again 22 ϕ x t h 1 h 2 h ϵ the variable ϕ is a robust quantity for a wide range of ϵ the values of ϵ may be small for the boussinesq ρ 2 ρ 1 1 case order of unity when ρ 2 ρ 1 0 5 and large when ρ 2 ρ 1 is small the variable ϕ is expected to be of the order of unity for these various cases and hence a convenient variable for the numerical approach to the solution we introduce the transformation y x x n t see ungarish 2009 section 2 3 and solve on a fixed grid y 0 1 using fixed δy intervals we use a maccormack predictor corrector scheme ungarish 2009 app a2 to dampen spurious numerical oscillation we added on the rhs of each equation an artificial diffusion viscosity term of the form b δx 2 vxx where v is the main variable of the equation and b is of the order of unity δ x x n δ y the magnitude of the added term is of the order of magnitude of the truncation error of the scheme and hence the global consistency and accuracy properties of this well tested numerical method are maintained we used typically 200 400 space intervals and the time step δt was set typically to 0 2δy the evaluation of the precise cfl condition requires a cumbersome calculation which was not attempted the numerical accuracy has been tested by running some cases on different grids and with different values of b the formulation of the code is singular for h 1 and hence we approximate the full depth release by h 1 01 4 sw results we present solutions for the full depth release with r 0 905 0 837 and for h 2 with r 0 837 this corresponds to the laboratory experiments 5 4 17 and 10 table 1 we also present sw results for the case h 1 r 0 700 which corresponds to the cfd experiment c16 table 1 the results are displayed in figs 2 6 for h 1 the sw initial propagation is with critical un see 18 in scaled form the difference between the r 0 905 and 0 837 cases is very small however the change to the partial depth h 2 produces a significant increase of un and a reduction of the slumping length time during which un is constant the depression of the surface is represented by ϕ we keep in mind that this variable is scaled with ϵh 0 and since ϵ 0 105 and 0 195 in the cases considered we conclude that the physical displacement χ of the surface is small we note that there is a good correlation between ϕ and h 1 the depression is more significant over the domain where the current is thicker the interpretation is as follows a larger h 1 causes a larger return flow u 2 in the ambient and hence an increase of the kinetic energy for a particle on the streamline bernoulli s equation with a constant p 0 on the surface implies that the increase of kinetic energy must be compensated by the decrease of potential energy at the lower position therefore the sw current on the bottom has a clear fingerprint on the top surface this is confirmed by the experiments the finite difference results display some oscillations in places of sharp changes of the variables this is the manifest of the small numerical dispersion of the finite difference solver see for example morton and mayers 1994 figs 4 7 4 12 and 4 14 the relevant theory and tests with different grid intervals indicate that the influence of these oscillations on the main solution is negligible we found that the code is numerically unstable for currents outside the range of validity and criticality of the nose condition it is not clear what is the physical meaning of this observation the lock release currents produced in our experiments were stable however the flow adjusted on its own to the nose conditions and hence the energy validity and criticality are intrinsically fulfilled sw solutions were obtained for other values of h and r not shown here the behaviour of the flow field is quite similar to the reported cases overall the sw dam break with open top problem results are qualitatively and quantitatively quite close to the covered bottom results in both cases the initial propagation is with constant un the slumping stage and change from the full depth lock h 1 to part depth lock h 2 say yields an increase of un and decrease of the slumping length the major difference observed is the dip of the open top surface which provides an upper fingerprint of the location of the current the speed of propagation is slightly smaller in the open top case as discussed in more detail in section 6 5 the experimental layout and procedures to assess the theoretical models enhancing at the same time the database for this type of flows a series of specially designed laboratory experiments was performed at the hydraulic laboratory of the university of parma a rectangular cross section channel 30 cm wide and 965 cm long with glass lateral walls and stainless steel bottom wall was used with a lock length of 55 102 cm see fig 7 ab the gate was a stainless steel plate 0 2 cm thick rapidly lifted with a cable and pulleys system the opening of the gate took approximately 0 2 s in a first series of tests the ambient fluid tap water of density equal to ρ 2 0 998 g cm 3 had a free surface the intruding current was prepared in an ad hoc tank by adding sodium chloride nacl to tap water and introducing aniline dye into the latter for an easy visualization of the shape of the current advancing in the transparent ambient fluid the use of nacl allowed the intruding current to reach a maximum final density of ρ 1 1 193 g cm 3 r 0 836 ϵ 0 195 several marks with a 20 cm spacing where stuck on the bottom in order to measure the front speed a grid with 5 cm horizontally spaced and 1 cm vertically spaced lines was stuck on the side of the channel in order to measure the amplitude of the oscillations of the free surface by converting the pixel position of video images into metric coordinates the procedure of filling the tank was designed in order to avoid excessive net force on the gate initially the downstream channel was filled with tap water up to a target level corresponding to the zero level of the grid then the high density fluid was gently poured inside the lock in order to reduce the hydraulic disturbances due to the lift of the gate two horizontal polystyrene lids were fixed on both sides of the gate and maintained in contact with the surface of both the ambient and the intruding fluids in this way the oscillations of the free surface triggered by the vertical movement of the gate were minimized each experiment was recorded by three high resolution video cameras 3840 2160 pixels working at 30 frames per second f p s each of them with a field of view fov 1 m long in the horizontal direction high frequency neon lights were adopted as a uniform and stable source of illumination from the side of the channel after extraction of the frames from the videos using a commercial software it was possible to detect the profile of the free surface using a proprietary software with a time accuracy of 1 30 s in order to trigger the start of the flow the opening of the gate was detected by a micro switch which turned off several leds when the gate was lifted the leds were positioned along the channel in order to be in the fov of the video cameras and to allow synchronizing the frames of the videos three ultrasound distance meters us1 us2 us3 turckbanner q45ur were positioned on the top of the channel to record the free surface oscillations with an accuracy of 0 03 cm and a data rate of 100 hz the overall accuracy of measurements of the depression was checked for a single test by comparing the results of the ultrasound distance meters and of the image analysis fig 8 shows the comparison between the free surface elevation χ measured with both techniques at the cross sections of coordinates x 115 247 cm measured from the gate the agreement is fairly good considering that no calibration parameters are needed the small discrepancies between measurements are due to meniscus which also acts as a filter of the high frequency fluctuations fluid velocity was measured in the mid section of the channel by an array of four ultrasound velocity profilers uvp model dop 2000 signal processing s a switzerland 2005 with a carrier at 8 mhz tr0805ls and installed at x 260 cm from the gate the four probes were arranged as in fig 7 cd and in the adopted configuration acquired the three component velocity profiles in the vertical with a space resolution of 0 11 cm 120 volumes of measurements and data rate 18 hz number of profiles per second the raw data are represented by the axial velocity components for probes 1 2 and 3 acquired with a small time lag and then transformed into the cartesian coordinate system x y z with a transformation 23 u v w a u 1 u 2 u 3 where a is the matrix of transformation and u 1 u 2 u 3 are the axial

ambient fluid interface since the echo of the ultrasounds is stronger where a variation of acoustic impedance occurs like at the interface fig 9 shows the measured velocity components for expt 7 the validity of the assumptions used to transform the axial velocities into velocity components along the x y z axes can be appreciated by observing the good agreement between the vertical velocity w as reconstructed with eq 24 applied to measurements by probes no 1 2 3 symbols and as measured by probe no 4 continuous line the figure also shows the energy of the echo of probe no 4 with a maximum at a level that can be assumed as representative of the thickness of the current the position of the front of the current was detected using a full hd video camera canon legria hf 20 1920 1080 pixels with data rate of 25 frames per second the camera was translated parallel to the channel in order to keep the nose of the current in the fov and the marks stuck at the bottom of the channel were used to detect the front position of the current with an overall uncertainty of less than 0 2 cm a second series of experiments were performed with a lid on the top in order to compare its effects on the front speed of the current a differential manometer with an overall accuracy of 0 1 mbar was positioned at a distance of 160 cm from the gate with one port at atmospheric pressure and the second port near the lid and in contact with the ambient fluid with the aim of measuring the pressure variations due to the advancing current 5 1 the uncertainty in variables and parameters the parameters of the experiments are either directly measured or computed on the basis of the measurements mass density was measured by a densimeter with an accuracy of 10 3 g cm 3 and the corresponding uncertainty for r ρ 2 ρ 1 is δr r 0 2 the relative uncertainty in the reduced gravity g is again 0 2 the level of the ambient fluid and of the intruding fluid in the lock was fixed with an accuracy of 0 1 cm and the relative uncertainty is δh h 0 3 and δh 0 h 0 0 3 the uncertainty on the ratio h h 0 is at most equal to 0 6 the velocity scale had an uncertainty δu u 0 4 and the time scale had an uncertainty equal to δt t 1 4 by assuming an uncertainty of 1 in the value of the kinematic viscosity of the denser fluid the resulting uncertainty in reynolds number was δre 0 re 0 2 0 the free surface level of the ambient fluid measured by the ultrasonic distance meters had an uncertainty of 0 03 cm the velocity field reconstructed by using measurements by the uvp probes had an uncertainty of 4 of the measured value with a minimum of 0 3 cm s 1 the uncertainty of the vertical position where the velocity measurements are referred was 0 1 cm 6 the experiments eighteen experiments were performed fourteen with an open boundary and four with a top lid table 1 lists the main parameters for each experiment note that two additional lines include relevant data for numerical experiments conducted for a system without lid details about these computer simulations are provided in appendix a the purpose of the computer experiments is to simulate clear cut non boussinesq currents with r 0 7 thus widening the range of parameters under consideration to illustrate the general behaviour observed in the experiments a sequence of frames is shown in fig 10 for expt 17 an enlargement near the free surface is also shown for a better visualization of the free surface distortion due to the advancing gc it is seen that the free surface is elevated downstream the nose and is depressed behind the nose with a space lag almost equal to the distance between the front and the first billow fig 11 shows the dimensionless front position of the intruding current for all the experiments for an easy visualization the symbols related to experiments in partial depth have been translated of five h 4 3 and ten units h 2 in the vertical respectively and have been decimated one point each two or three is inserted in the plot the data collapse fairly well for each series of experiments it is seen that the initial slumping phase with a constant front speed is followed by a deceleration which is more evident in partial depth conditions there is no significant detectable effect of the free surface waves or of the lock length on the front speed however a small reduction of the slumping phase front speed is detected by comparing e g expt 7 open top and expt 9 top lid two experiments with identical parameters but with a different top boundary condition the open top b c allows the development of free surface waves which subtract part of the potential energy available to accelerate the current as a result a reduction of the front speed 3 is recorded see appendix a for details on the energy balance similar results are obtained by pairwise comparison of expts 11 12 10 13 8 4 where expts 11 10 4 are with a top lid and expts 12 13 4 are their open top counterparts fig 12 shows the dimensionless depression of the free surface profiles for expt 4 with lock length x 0 55 cm two families of free surface oscillations can be observed i propagating waves and ii bounded waves in addition to these waves there are secondary small oscillations coupled to the billows of the intruding current the front of the current is forerun by a solitary wave propagating with height 1 5 cm and a celerity equal to 160 cm s and is followed by a trough bounded wave with a maximum depression at 30 cm behind the nose the solitary wave is similar to the wave generated by an avalanche reaching the sea and generating a tsunami the maximum trough amplitude is equal to 2 cm and progressively decreases with the front advancement after a few seconds the initial solitary wave is reflected by the end wall and reaches with negative celerity the front of the current partially canceling the trough fig 12 also shows i the results of the sw numerical code for expt 4 and ii the profiles measured for expt 17 with the same parameters of expt 4 except for a lock length x 0 102 cm i e almost double that of expt 4 upon comparing the different curves it is observed that the experimental length of the trough is finite and fairly well predicted by the theoretical model moreover a longer lock generates a more persistent depression of the free surface the trough length adequately scales with the length of the lock in both experiments the limited length of the trough is a consequence of the limited volume of the lock which generates a current of finite length instead of a long tongue fig 13 a shows a more comprehensive comparison conducted for all tests between the depression χ deriving from the experiments and from sw theory the experimental values empty symbols are generally close to the theory solid lines with relatively minor deviations the cfd simulations filled symbols conducted for the full depth case with the free surface boundary condition see appendix a generally overestimate the sw theoretical values depressions resulting from the top lid boundary condition are also plotted for comparison crossed symbols and show deviations both in excess and in defect from the theoretical predictions fig 13 b shows the comparison among the four earlier categories of results experimental open top sw theoretical open top experimental top lid and cfd open top for the height hn at the front of the current there are discrepancies with the sw theory especially for the partial depth case but in general the trend is correctly reproduced with larger thickness of the current at the nose for partial depth than for full depth experiments the long error bars associated with experimental results indicate that the validation of the predicted hn is subject to a significant uncertainty which is a consequence also of the difficult definition of the experimental height of the current near the front a final comparison is conducted for the front velocity un and is shown in fig 13 c theoretical sw results always overestimate their experimental counterparts albeit to a variable degree but almost always larger than the error bars the overestimation is a standard result due to the approximations embedded in the sw model which neglects entrainment and dissipation and adopts the thin layer approximation the experimental data for h 1 from sciortino et al 2018 are also shown with a good overlap with the present experiments and a good agreement with theoretical predictions 6 1 the structure of the velocity field the structure of the velocity fields in gcs has a main role in addressing the complex interaction between the nose the billows and the ambient fluid and whenever a more detailed analysis is requested the sw equations rely on a uniform velocity along the vertical an in depth experimental analysis is requested to clarify the correctness of this assumption past measurements of velocity profiles in gcs with uvp are detailed in longo et al 2016 where a single probe two probes was were used to measure the velocity structure within the ambient fluid the present measurements are obtained with four probes located within the intruding current since the position of the volume of measurements gates and of the doppler shift require the value of the sound celerity c ϵ ρ where ϵ is the adiabatic bulk modulus we assumed a constant celerity in the current computed by adopting the theoretical values of the bulk modulus and the mass density of the fluid fig 14 ab shows the velocity field measured by the uvp probes for two experiments expt 4 and expt 17 having identical parameters but with lock length 55 102 cm respectively the time series of the velocity measured in a single section has been mapped into space by multiplying the time and the front speed under the hypothesis of frozen current time is mapped into space as x x n t the front speed is almost identical for the two experiments but the shape of the current is quite different with a detached body of dense fluid advancing with a limited tail in the experiment with short lock and a long thin current in the experiment with a long lock 7 discussion and conclusions motivated by the ubiquitous presence of gravity currents gcs with open top free surface in environmental and industrial applications we studied the non boussinesq regime of inertial gcs performing a series of free surface experiments in a rectangular cross section channel and developing a novel two layer sw model to interpret the experimental results the experiments were performed with different values of the density ratio r ranging from 0 950 to 0 837 measured quantities included the free surface depression of the ambient fluid the thickness and the front speed of the intruding current and the three components of the velocity by means of a uvp to extend the study to lower values of r a difficult task since non dangerous salts to be added to water to obtain heavy fluids with newtonian rheology are rare and expensive numerical simulations were conducted with r 0 7 using a numerical commercial cfd code based on rans we performed experiments for both full depth and partial depth locks further some experiments were repeated with a top lid in order to compare the effect of the boundary condition on the front speed and to measure the pressure variation a proxy for the free surface fluctuations we think that our work provides useful insights and modelling suggestions concerning the flow of a gc in a system with a free surface our work leads to the following major conclusions the high density current advancing in the fluid generates two main families of waves progressive waves faster than the front and a trough bounded to the front and lagging it in a finite length channel the reflection on the back and end walls generates further waves which modify in a complex manner the free surface elevation a depression of the open top surface is observed in all cases similar with the results of sciortino et al 2018 and providing an indication of the location of the front of the intruding current specifically the amplitude of the trough maximum depression behind the nose was chosen to compare results from the numerical sw code and the experiments the experimental amplitude of the trough generally is less than the theoretical one while the numerical simulations overestimate experimental results the front position of the intruding current collapses on the novel sw theoretical predictions fairly well showing that an initial slumping phase with a constant front speed is followed by a deceleration which is more evident in partial depth conditions the corroboration of the prediction of the thickness of the current is not sharp due to a large uncertainty but confirms the experimental correct trend for increasing r as for the front velocity theoretical results overestimate their experimental counterparts due to the approximations embedded in the sw model which neglects entrainment and dissipation and adopts the thin layer approximation the incorporation of entrainment and bottom friction in sw type models is formally possible adduce et al 2011 but in this case the solution is reliant on empirical coefficients which in general are not known for non boussinesq currents such an extension requires a dedicated investigation which must be left for the future we reiterate that the advantage of the sw model used in the present investigation is that it is self contained the solution is determined by the initial conditions geometry of the lock and the density ratio r without any adjustable constant results for experiments conducted with a covered bottom are qualitatively and quantitatively quite close to those obtained with the free surface condition except for the depression in the ambient induced in the latter case which also exhibits a slightly smaller speed of propagation a good comparison between theory and experiments is also obtained for the covered bottom case here the differential pressure variation measured at the top of the channel agrees with the theory and is also well reproduced by the cfd code as to the effect of the lock length on the overall geometry of the current and of the depression it is seen that the lock length does not affect the front speed during the slumping phase but has an evident effect on the geometry of the current behind the nose and on the length of the depression the longer the lock the longer the depression the shorter the lock the more similar to a single hump is the current the length of the through adequately scales with the lock length and is generally well reproduced by the sw model the time series of the fluid velocity with the uvp time series in a single section of the channel can be transformed into space series by assuming a frozen current behaviour and mapping t x n x the correctness of this approach at least during the slumping phase has been validated with the cfd code results acknowledgements we thank mahdi

eulerian numerical model has been implemented using ansys fluent ansys 2013 which solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans using the volume of fluid vof approach in order to track and locate the free surface or fluid fluid interface the continuity equation can be written as follows a 1 ρ t ρ v s m where ρ is the fluid density v is the velocity vector and t is the time sm is a source term which takes into account the mass added to the continuous phase from the dispersed second phase e g due to vaporization of liquid droplets eq a 1 is valid for incompressible as well as

interpenetrating fluids or phases are present for each additional phase a new variable is introduced i e the volume fraction of the phase in the computational cell the tracking of the interface s between the phases is accomplished by the solution of an additional continuity equation related to one or more of the phases for the i th phase this equation has the following form a 4 t α i ρ i α i ρ i v j 1 n m ji m ij where αi is the volume fraction 0 αi 1 of the i t h phase m i j is the mass transfer from phase i to phase j and m j i is the mass transfer from phase j to phase i the implicit scheme was used for time discretization and the implicit body force treatment for the body force formulation in the multiphase model was enabled this treatment improves the convergence of solutions by accounting for the partial equilibrium of the pressure gradient and body forces in the momentum equations the reynolds stress model rsm was adopted abandoning the isotropic eddy viscosity hypothesis the rsm closes the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations by solving transport equations for the reynolds stresses which appear in eq a 2 when the reynolds decomposition is applied together with an equation for the dissipation rate a series of numerical tests demonstrated that the rsm it the turbulence model that provide the best agreement between the results from fluent simulation and the experimental data from shin et al 2004 both the options wall bc from k equation and wall reflection effects were enabled respectively i to allow the explicit setting of boundary conditions for the reynolds stress model near the walls and ii to calculate the component of the pressure strain term responsible for the redistribution of normal stresses near the wall the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso scheme was adopted for the pressure velocity coupling and a second order discretization scheme was used for both momentum and volume fraction in this method under relaxation factors greater than 0 8 are recommended for all equations except for momentum and pressure factor that were set respectively equal to 0 7 and 0 3 default values also a volume fraction factor equal to 0 5 can be adopted at the beginning of the simulation a time step equal to 0 0001 s was set in order to get a stable solution then the time step was gradually increased up to 0 002 s a 1 model geometry and computational grid the experimental apparatus i e the rectangular channel was modeled in two dimensions at full scale resulting in a computational domain 9 55 m long 10 10 m in the case of extended lock and 0 5 m high see fig a 1 the domain was discretized by a mesh of more than 1 2 106 rectangular cells with a maximum face area of 3 2 mm2 the minimum cell size was set equal to 1 mm while the maximum one to 2 mm with a growing rate of 1 2 the resulting mesh is very regular with a minimum orthogonal quality equal to 0 73 orthogonal quality ranges from 0 to 1 where values close to 0 correspond to low quality finer resolutions of the mesh have been tested without experiencing significant variations in the final results fig a 1 also shows a detail of the mesh close to the bottom of the channel the no slip boundary condition was imposed at the bottom and at the sides i e upstream and downstream walls of the channel the lid which extends over the lock region was also reproduced by an horizontal wall without slip while the top of the channel was modeled with a symmetry boundary condition zero normal derivatives in the numerical model no gate was necessary and the initial condition was imposed defining the desired value of all the variables in the nodes e g the volume fraction of each phase a 2 some comparisons fig a 2 shows a comparison of the velocity field computed with the numerical simulation and measured with the uvp fig a 2 a shows the direct result from the code while fig a 2 b was obtained by using the data resulting from the numerical code sampled with the same pattern of the uvp array of probes and then applying the frozen current hypothesis fig a 2 c shows the velocity field as measured with the uvp and then reproduced under the hypothesis of frozen current we preliminarily note that the main differences between the results shown in fig a 2 a b is the absence of the billows effects in the latter there are also some differences in the nose velocity field but they are not so relevant hence the hypothesis of frozen current can be adopted with confidence in particular during the slumping phase when the hypothesis of stationarity holds upon comparing measured velocities with computed velocities different patterns are evident with large velocity values appearing in the tail and a more flattened nose to extend the comparison to the free surface behaviour the numerical model was applied with the same conditions of some experiments listed in table 1 fig a 3 shows the comparison between the experimental depression and the numerical model for expt 4 at two different times the early time profile shows a good agreement with the experiments the agreement is less good for subsequent times in particular the length of the depressed profile is well reproduced a comparison is also available for the experiments with the lid where the pressure measured by the differential manometer has been converted into height of ambient fluid column fig a 4 a shows the experimental depression compared to the results of the cfd simulation the cfd simulation overestimates the experimental value but correctly reproduces the instant of maximum depression and the shape of the height pressure time series fig a 4 b shows the measured depression as a function of the front position the maximum depression lags the front of the current the evolution of the nose of the current is shown in fig a 5 where four snapshots are shown at t 5 10 15 20 s for expt c16bis the initial complex structure of the intruding current with billows swept by the return flow current progressively evolves toward a simple structure more adherent to the scheme of thin gcs the ambient fluid flow field is also marked by the free surface oscillations which are dominant in the late stage the overall energy balance is shown in fig a 6 the energy variations non dimensional with respect to the potential energy of the current fluid in the lock before release are shown as a function of the nose position the kinetic energy increment of the current fluid is accompanied by an increment of the same magnitude also for the ambient fluid and reaches a maximum corresponding to the vertical line in the fig a 6 and then decreases most energy is exchanged in potential form between the two fluids and part of it is dissipated at a constant rate

768,despite some progress the importance of stemflow remains obscured partly due to computations emphasizing canopy interception loss we advocate for two metrics the stand scale funneling ratio and the stand scale infiltration funneling ratio to more accurately portray stemflow inputs and increase comparability across ecosystems these metrics yield per unit area stemflow inputs orders of magnitude greater than what would have been delivered by throughfall or precipitation alone we recommend that future studies employ these stand scale funnelling metrics to express stemflow commensurate with its ecohydrological importance and better conceptualize the role of stemflow in plant soil interactions permitting advances in critical zone science keywords stemflow funneling ratio forest hydrology hot spot dipterocarp forest lodgepole pine 1 introduction an important consideration for hydrologic studies conducted within vegetated ecosystems is determining the quantity of precipitation partitioned by the canopy into interception loss throughfall and stemflow interception loss is the evaporation during and after a precipitation event from water stored on the canopy while throughfall and stemflow characterize the subcanopy precipitation inputs throughfall passes directly through canopy openings or is released as drip or splash from canopy surfaces while stemflow reaches the ground by flowing down the stems of trees and other plants canopy precipitation partitioning studies largely focus on interception loss as it may be an appreciable fraction of the total evaporation from the landscape carlyle moses and gash 2011 throughfall and stemflow have historically been measured so that interception loss may be estimated indirectly as horton 1919 helvey and patric 1965 1 i c p t s where ic is canopy interception loss mm p is precipitation mm t is throughfall mm and s is stemflow mm the practice of expressing interception loss at the stand scale or over the canopy projection area i e the areal extent of the canopy is sufficient when the study objectives include determining evaporative losses from an area of interest however the common approach of also using the stand or canopy area to assess the quantitative importance of subcanopy precipitation inputs especially stemflow is flawed because expressions of stemflow asynchronous with its area of input masks its potential relevance for the generation of hot spots and hot moments mcclain et al 2003 this is to say that the concentration of water over small areas near tree trunks seems to affect the magnitude and timing of water inputs and biogeochemical cycling andrews et al 2011 siegert and levia 2014 levia and germer 2015 michalzik et al 2016 van stan and stubbins 2018 despite stemflow

helps abate urban stormwater flows schooling and carlyle moses 2015 in the case of dryland ecosystems stemflow leads to elevated fluxes of nutrients in soils of the proximal area surrounding the base of stems contributing to the formation of fertile islands whitford et al 1997 ridolfi et al 2008 wang et al 2011 reviews of the hydrological and or biogeochemical importance of stemflow are readily available e g parker 1983 levia and frost 2003 johnson and lehmann 2006 ikawa 2007 levia and germer 2015 however an examination of the recent literature suggests that the significance of stemflow may still be overlooked in the hydrologic community we suggest that this is largely due to stemflow being expressed as a percentage of precipitation s p closing the canopy water balance at the stand scale in forests see llorens and domingo 2007 levia et al 2011 návar 2011 and at the crown projection area scale where isolated trees and shrubs predominate such as savannas semi arid lands and urban areas e g david et al 2006 guevara escobar et al 2007 honda and durigan 2016 this water balance approach unrealistically distributes stemflow across the entire stand or canopy area rather than expressing it over the area in which it is delivered or received the objectives of this study are to i suggest metrics which express stemflow at the stand scale in ways that are commensurate with its ecohydrological importance ii derive and compare the values of these metrics from a sample of studies from different ecosystems iii determine the threshold percentage of precipitation that results on average in metric values that indicate that over the area in which it is received stemflow meets or exceeds the precipitation depth and iv evaluate based on meeting the first three objectives whether most near stem soils receive water inputs that are negligible when compared to what they would have received from precipitation or throughfall alone if however concentrated stemflow inputs are shown to be the norm even when s p is low using the two metrics advocated for will permit the magnitude of stemflow to be placed at a level commensurate with its impact on the hydrology and biogeochemistry of wooded ecosystems consequently the notion that a low s p value automatically means that stemflow is negligible to an ecosystem can be dismissed 2 theory and calculations the concentrated water input of stemflow has been quantified at the individual tree scale using the stemflow funneling ratio f p b t dimensionless herwitz 1986 2 f p b t s y t p b t where s y t is the tree scale stemflow yield l generated by a tree t having a given basal area of the stem bt m2 during a precipitation event of a given depth p mm funneling ratios unity indicate that the equivalent depth of stemflow delivered to the base of the tree exceeds the precipitation depth that would have been captured by a rain gauge with an opening area equivalent to that of the tree basal area funneling ratios 100 have been reported in several studies e g herwitz 1986 levia 2004 carlyle moses and price 2006 li et al 2009 highlighting the effectiveness of certain trees and shrubs to concentrate precipitation however the stand scale relevance of stemflow is not captured by eq 2 given the individual tree scale focus as such we suggest that the stand scale funneling ratio f p b s dimensionless termed the funneling ratio per basal area by levia and germer 2015 table 3a be used 3 f p b s s y s p b s where s y s is the stemflow yield l of the stand s and bs is the basal area of the stand m2 the stand scale funneling ratio is also a function of the relationship between the percentage of precipitation partitioned into stemflow s p and the percentage of the stand area as occupied by tree stems b s a 4 f p b s s p b s a s levia and germer 2015 table 2b provide a funneling ratio that is not based on the basal area of the tree stem but rather the ground area in which stemflow infiltrates around those stems see also tanaka et al 1996 návar 2011 f p i t 5 f p i t s y t p i t where it is the tree scale stemflow infiltration area m2 as with f p b t we suggest a stand scale version of f p i t this stand scale infiltration funneling ratio f p i s dimensionless represents the ratio between the s y s that would have infiltrated into the soil adjacent to the base of those trees compared to the precipitation that would have infiltrated into the equivalent area in the absence of vegetation cover the derivation of f p i s is akin to f p b s however the percentage of as that represents the stemflow infiltration area is as replaces bs as 6 f p i s s p i s a s the size of the stand scale infiltration area is m2 may be estimated by taking the product of the mean stemflow rate per tree s r

7 s r t n t may be estimated from the mean precipitation intensity while stemflow is being generated r mm h 1 the fraction of precipitation diverted to stemflow pd dimensionless and the stand area as 8 s r t n t p d r a s the parameter pd is termed the drainage partitioning coefficient and is derived following the methods of valente et al 1997 additionally pd may be substituted using either pt the trunk partitioning coefficient see gash 1979 or the slope of the linear regression relating stemflow depth as a function of precipitation depth see park and hatorri 2002 mckee and carlyle moses 2017 both f p b s and f p i s should be compared with the ratio between mean throughfall depth and precipitation depth t p so that a greater appreciation of the spatial variability of understory precipitation and the relative hot spot and hot moment importance of stemflow compared to throughfall may be achieved the metrics f p b s and f p i s represent a conceptual advance as they provide geoscientists the means to express stemflow quantitatively over the area in which it is delivered and received these metrics intuitively couple plant soil interactions over the actual area of input thereby connecting the canopy and subsurface for critical zone research lin 2010 3 methodology 3 1 case studies two case studies using previously unpublished data are presented in which the magnitudes of f p b s and f p i s are derived the first study was conducted in a shorea obtusa wall dipterocarpus tuberculatus roxb terminalia alata heyen ex roth dominated lowland deciduous forest in kratie

campbell scientific inc recorded precipitation and stemflow from each tree at 10 minute intervals an individual precipitation event was defined as recorded precipitation bounded by at least 5 h of no

individual trees was estimated using linear regression between precipitation and the rate of stemflow the juvenile lodgepole pine stand was commercially harvested in 1999 and re planted within the following two years the 2600 m2 stand had a density of 6620 trees ha 1 and a basal area of 10 2 m2 ha 1 information concerning the climate of the research area and the throughfall and precipitation measurement methodology are given in carlyle moses and lishman 2015 while the stemflow measurement methodology used in this study is identical to that described by mckee and carlyle moses 2017 the stemflow infiltration area of the plot was estimated by extrapolating the measured extent of stemflow movement across the surface radiating from the base of three selected tree stems during three precipitation events a 1 cm band of bright dyes flt yellow green powder dye was placed evenly around and adjacent to the base of each selected tree stem prior to the event the extent of stemflow movement along the surface and after careful excavation of the soil belowground was photographed and measured vertically from the ground surface and horizontally from the stem center with a ruler within 12 h of the end of each event 3 2 review of recent literature in addition to the two case studies we derive the values of f p b s and f p i s for recently january 2017 june 2018 inclusive

fell during 2010 distributed over 130 separate events mean event depth 11 5 mm within the tropical lowland deciduous forest stemflow data was available for 94 of the tree event combinations with the remainder estimated using linear regression relating stemflow depth to precipitation depth for individual trees r2 ranged from 0 81 to 0 94 the total volume of stemflow from all 12 trees over the one year period was 4468 l resulting in an annual s p value of 0 9 although this represents a very small fraction of the canopy water balance the annual f p b s was 4 6 suggesting that the input from stemflow at the base of these lowland tropical trees was approximately 460 of the precipitation that would have fallen over the equivalent area occupied by the tree stems at the tree scale cumulative f p b t ranged from 1 2 to 15 8 the mean rate of stemflow input s r t was found to be 0 853 l h 1 and given ksat 531 mm h 1 a mean it value of 1 6 10 3 m2 and an is value of 0 593 m2 on a per hectare basis is as 5 93 10 3 are derived using eq 6 a f p i s value of 151 8 is calculated that is the mean depth of stemflow infiltration was 15000 of the precipitation depth that would have infiltrated into the stemflow infiltration area in the absence of vegetation cover equivalent to a depth of 2 3 105 mm over the one year period within the juvenile pine stand precipitation stemflow and throughfall data were available for 36 events during the mid may to mid october growing season totaling 252 9 mm mean event depth 7 0 mm stemflow and throughfall accounted for 1 8 and 87 7 of the season long precipitation although s p was 2 of the cumulative precipitation a f p b s of 17 6 was derived given that t p during the same period was 0 877 stemflow represented an input that averaged 20 1 times that of mean throughfall the concentration of stemflow at the base of trees increased with increasing precipitation depth with f p b s ranging from an average of 1 0 for precipitation events 1 5 mm to an average of 20 6 for event depths 10 0 mm the mean f p b s for relatively small precipitation events i e 1 5 mm was 1 4 times greater than t p while for relatively large events i e 10 0 mm f p b s averaged 22 9 times mean t p event scale f p b t was found to be as large as 62 1 5 9 mm precipitation depth 1 88 m tall tree with a basal area of 14 50 10 4 m2 for comparative purposes the greatest point scale throughfall to precipitation ratio for a single event was 4 3 see carlyle moses and lishman 2015 during the tracer dye experiments no dye extended past the thin approximately 1 cm wide area around the tree stems n 9 bt range 1 80 10 3 to 3 14 10 2 m2 during any of the three precipitation events depths ranged from 5 9 to 16 0 mm suggesting that all stemflow

2 m2 assuming stemflow infiltrated within 1 cm of all stems is 11 4 m2 per hectare is as 0 114 using eq 6 f p i s 15 8 suggesting that the depth of stemflow that infiltrated into the immediate area around the stems was 1580 of the precipitation depth that would have infiltrated in the absence of the pine trees an equivalent depth of approximately 4000 mm with the mean throughfall input over the study being 223 0 mm stemflow represented a depth over is that was approximately 17 9 times greater than t p using traditional methods of expressing stand scale stemflow stemflow only represents 4 6

the calculation of f p b s albeit no studies provided the requisite surface hydraulic conductivity data for the derivation of f p i s table 1 the studies spanned five continents and included tropical subtropical mediterranean temperate subpolar and semi arid climatic conditions across all precipitation and stand characteristics presented in table 1 f p b s ranged from 0 5 for a forest dominated by european beech fagus sylvatica in germany under conditions where only precipitation event depths 3 mm were considered metzger et al 2017 to 101 6 for a young secondary montane tropical rainforest in madagascar ghimire et al 2017 under season long or annual time scales in which forests were in full leaf s p and f p b s values from mature forests and forest plantations n 18 averaged 3 0 4 4 and 8 7 9 7 with median values of 1 7 and 5 1 respectively none of the stand scale funneling ratios for these mature stands was 1 and ranged from 1 5 s p 0 4 for a larch larix principis rupprechtii plantation in china liu et al 2018 to 45 5 s p 20 1 for a mature tree of heaven ailanthus altissima stand in iran sadeghi et al 2017 levia and germer 2015 derived similar results from a review of 11 studies covering 16 forests and plantations from around the globe in which s p ranged from 1 to 14 mean 5 and f p b s ranged from 3 to 37 mean 16 the relationship between f p b s and s p for mature forests and plantations derived in both levia and germer 2015 and this study including the values from the lowland dipterocarp forest in cambodia was found to be positively linearly correlated fig 1 9 f p b s 2 42 s p 2 51 r 2 0 89 n 34 considering only mature forests in which s p 2 yields the following 10 f p b s 5 22 s p 1 58 r 2 0 52 n 11 from eq 10 a s p of 0 5 is derived as the threshold value in which f p b s reaches unity meaning only a very small fraction of stand scale precipitation needs to be diverted to the base of these mature trees as stemflow for equivalent depths over their basal areas to exceed precipitation depth in the supplemental material provided by van stan and gordon 2018 s p data are made available for 346 forests across the globe of the 346 values 18 of them 5 are listed as 1 assigning a value of 0 5 to those studies in which s p is listed as 1 80 of the studies had s p values 0 5 thus season long and annual f p b s values unity are likely the norm across the globe additionally the median s p value of the studies included in the supplemental material of van stan and gordon 2018 is 1 1 suggesting that the global median f p b s may lie between 4 and 5 which is in close agreement with the median value of 5 1 derived for mature forests and plantations reviewed in this present study the threshold s p value of 0 5 for f p b s to equal unity is a function of mean bs as from the studies used to derive eq 10 the threshold s p for any given stand may be readily equated with bs as as 11 s p b s a s where s p represents the threshold s p for f p b s to equal unity from an array of forest yield tables and forest inventory reports it may be concluded that bs for mature forests and plantations typically ranges from 10 to 60 m2 on a per hectare basis including many within the narrow range of 20 to 40 m2 per hectare e g forestry agency 1952 johnstone 1976 schober 1995 clark et al 2015 santiago garcía et al 2017 as such s p will fall in the range of 0 1 to 0 6 for most mature stands further supporting the conclusion that a very small fraction of precipitation needs to be diverted to stemflow for it to be a potential hot spot within wooded ecosystems across the globe as aforementioned no studies that have provided the requisite stand and soil hydraulic conductivity data for the derivation of f p i s have been published between january 2017 through june 2018 inclusive van stan and gordon 2018 arbitrarily argue that 1 m2 is a conservative estimate of it and is not likely to be smaller than that for mature trees while schroth et al 1999 subjectively set it to 2 m2 however derived it values in the range of 1 to 2 m2 are almost always associated with extreme precipitation conditions for example herwitz 1986 in a tropical rainforest in australia found that it for 8 trees ranged from 0 13 to 1 52 m2 mean 0 60 m2 for a precipitation event with a mean intensity of 73 7 mm h 1 schwärzel et al 2012 applied 180 l of stemflow water over a 180 minute period 60 l h 1 to an individual fagus sylvatica tree and observed that stemflow infiltrated directly into the stagnic luvisol soil in a circular area of 0 245 m2 infiltration and tree radius data provided by gómez et al 2002 suggest that it around three olive trees averaged 0 762 m2 for a large precipitation event 77 1 mm however over the entire study period of 12 events mean it was reduced to 0 108 m2 navar 2011 derived a mean it of 0 0314 m2 for tamaulipan thorn scrub in mexico while durocher 1990 found that all stemflow infiltrated into the soil in the immediate vicinity of tree stems with no surface flow observed thus it is typically 1 m2 for extreme events and for average stemflow producing events it is likely much smaller values of it 1 m2 should be expected under most forest conditions given the high surface ksat associated with forest soils compared to stemflow input rates typical of forest trees to maintain an it 1 m2 the ratio between the input rate of stemflow l h 1 and ksat mm h 1 must at least equal unity for most forest soils ksat 100 mm h 1 and may be 1000 mm h 1 hümann et al 2011 for example found that mean ksat values ranged from 193 to 846 mm h 1 across a variety of forests in southwest germany while chandler et al 2018 derived a ksat of 1239 mm h 1 in a scots pine pinus sylvestris stand in scotland similar ksat values have been reported for a range of mature forests and plantations e g murai and iwasaki 1975 herwitz 1986 durocher 1990 buczko et al 2006 di prima et al 2017 mean stemflow input rates s r t from a cross section of forest types were derived using eq 8 table 2 and found to range from approximately 0 1 to 7 7 l h 1 suggesting that it is normally between 1 10 4 to 1 10 1 m2 assuming ksat 100 mm h 1 given the tree densities commonly encountered in forests see table 2 is should normally be between 1 10 2 to 1 102 m2 per hectare with is as between 1 10 4 to 1 100 suggesting that f p i s like f p b s will normally be unity in most undisturbed forest settings thus stemflow represents on a stemflow infiltration area basis an understory input of water that is typically greater than t p and often greater than what the precipitation depth would have been in the absence of forest cover 5 conclusions we conclude and recommend based on the results of this study the following although stemflow represented 2 of incident precipitation within both a tropical lowland deciduous forest and a subpolar juvenile coniferous stand the season long or annual input of stemflow expressed over the stand basal areas and the stemflow infiltration areas greatly exceeded throughfall and the precipitation input that would have fallen on those areas in the absence of tree cover based on the results from recent studies and those presented in the review of levia and germer 2015 only a small percentage of precipitation approximately 0 5 on average needs to be diverted to stemflow for stand scale funneling ratios to equal or exceed unity the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soils of forests coupled with the modest stemflow input rates from forest trees means that most near stem soils receive water input depths that exceed those that would have infiltrated from precipitation or throughfall alone subsequent canopy partitioning studies should report stand scale funneling ratios and derive estimates of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the forest soil so that stand scale stemflow infiltration funneling ratios can be made available usage of the two stemflow metrics will areally link plant soil interactions for improved conceptualization of critical zone processes and the ecohydrological importance of stemflow future studies may for example use and expand on the stand scale stemflow funneling metrics to incorporate the stemflow enrichment ratio see levia and herwitz 2000 to better conceptualize biogeochemical processes in wooded ecosystems including

768,despite some progress the importance of stemflow remains obscured partly due to computations emphasizing canopy interception loss we advocate for two metrics the stand scale funneling ratio and the stand scale infiltration funneling ratio to more accurately portray stemflow inputs and increase comparability across ecosystems these metrics yield per unit area stemflow inputs orders of magnitude greater than what would have been delivered by throughfall or precipitation alone we recommend that future studies employ these stand scale funnelling metrics to express stemflow commensurate with its ecohydrological importance and better conceptualize the role of stemflow in plant soil interactions permitting advances in critical zone science keywords stemflow funneling ratio forest hydrology hot spot dipterocarp forest lodgepole pine 1 introduction an important consideration for hydrologic studies conducted within vegetated ecosystems is determining the quantity of precipitation partitioned by the canopy into interception loss throughfall and stemflow interception loss is the evaporation during and after a precipitation event from water stored on the canopy while throughfall and stemflow characterize the subcanopy precipitation inputs throughfall passes directly through canopy openings or is released as drip or splash from canopy surfaces while stemflow reaches the ground by flowing down the stems of trees and other plants canopy precipitation partitioning studies largely focus on interception loss as it may be an appreciable fraction of the total evaporation from the landscape carlyle moses and gash 2011 throughfall and stemflow have historically been measured so that interception loss may be estimated indirectly as horton 1919 helvey and patric 1965 1 i c p t s where ic is canopy interception loss mm p is precipitation mm t is throughfall mm and s is stemflow mm the practice of expressing interception loss at the stand scale or over the canopy projection area i e the areal extent of the canopy is sufficient when the study objectives include determining evaporative losses from an area of interest however the common approach of also using the stand or canopy area to assess the quantitative importance of subcanopy precipitation inputs especially stemflow is flawed because expressions of stemflow asynchronous with its area of input masks its potential relevance for the generation of hot spots and hot moments mcclain et al 2003 this is to say that the concentration of water over small areas near tree trunks seems to affect the magnitude and timing of water inputs and biogeochemical cycling andrews et al 2011 siegert and levia 2014 levia and germer 2015 michalzik et al 2016 van stan and stubbins 2018 despite stemflow often being a relatively small percentage of precipitation levia et al 2011 its concentration at the base of trees may cause localized overland flow and erosion e g herwitz 1986 keen et al 2010 contributes to preferential and subsurface flow e g johnson and lehmann 2006 bialkowski and buttle 2016 as well as perched water table development germer 2013 and groundwater recharge e g taniguchi et al 1996 tanaka et al 1996 tanaka 2011 stemflow has also been linked to by pass flow promoting storm runoff in certain catchments crabtree and trudgill 1985 and in conjunction with interception loss helps abate urban stormwater flows schooling and carlyle moses 2015 in the case of dryland ecosystems stemflow leads to elevated fluxes of nutrients in soils of the proximal area surrounding the base of stems contributing to the formation of fertile islands whitford et al 1997 ridolfi et al 2008 wang et al 2011 reviews of the hydrological and or biogeochemical importance of stemflow are readily available e g parker 1983 levia and frost 2003 johnson and lehmann 2006 ikawa 2007 levia and germer 2015 however an examination of the recent literature suggests that the significance of stemflow may still be overlooked in the hydrologic community we suggest that this is largely due to stemflow being expressed as a percentage of precipitation s p closing the canopy water balance at the stand scale in forests see llorens and domingo 2007 levia et al 2011 návar 2011 and at the crown projection area scale where isolated trees and shrubs predominate such as savannas semi arid lands and urban areas e g david et al 2006 guevara escobar et al 2007 honda and durigan 2016 this water balance approach unrealistically distributes stemflow across the entire stand or canopy area rather than expressing it over the area in which it is delivered or received the objectives of this study are to i suggest metrics which express stemflow at the stand scale in ways that are commensurate with its ecohydrological importance ii derive and compare the values of these metrics from a sample of studies from different ecosystems iii determine the threshold percentage of precipitation that results on average in metric values that indicate that over the area in which it is received stemflow meets or exceeds the precipitation depth and iv evaluate based on meeting the first three objectives whether most near stem soils receive water inputs that are negligible when compared to what they would have received from precipitation or throughfall alone if however concentrated stemflow inputs are shown to be the norm even when s p is low using the two metrics advocated for will permit the magnitude of stemflow to be placed at a level commensurate with its impact on the hydrology and biogeochemistry of wooded ecosystems consequently the notion that a low s p value automatically means that stemflow is negligible to an ecosystem can be dismissed 2 theory and calculations the concentrated water input of stemflow has been quantified at the individual tree scale using the stemflow funneling ratio f p b t dimensionless herwitz 1986 2 f p b t s y t p b t where s y t is the tree scale stemflow yield l generated by a tree t having a given basal area of the stem bt m2 during a precipitation event of a given depth p mm funneling ratios unity indicate that the equivalent depth of stemflow delivered to the base of the tree exceeds the precipitation depth that would have been captured by a rain gauge with an opening area equivalent to that of the tree basal area funneling ratios 100 have been reported in several studies e g herwitz 1986 levia 2004 carlyle moses and price 2006 li et al 2009 highlighting the effectiveness of certain trees and shrubs to concentrate precipitation however the stand scale relevance of stemflow is not captured by eq 2 given the individual tree scale focus as such we suggest that the stand scale funneling ratio f p b s dimensionless termed the funneling ratio per basal area by levia and germer 2015 table 3a be used 3 f p b s s y s p b s where s y s is the stemflow yield l of the stand s and bs is the basal area of the stand m2 the stand scale funneling ratio is also a function of the relationship between the percentage of precipitation partitioned into stemflow s p and the percentage of the stand area as occupied by tree stems b s a 4 f p b s s p b s a s levia and germer 2015 table 2b provide a funneling ratio that is not based on the basal area of the tree stem but rather the ground area in which stemflow infiltrates around those stems see also tanaka et al 1996 návar 2011 f p i t 5 f p i t s y t p i t where it is the tree scale stemflow infiltration area m2 as with f p b t we suggest a stand scale version of f p i t this stand scale infiltration funneling ratio f p i s dimensionless represents the ratio between the s y s that would have infiltrated into the soil adjacent to the base of those trees compared to the precipitation that would have infiltrated into the equivalent area in the absence of vegetation cover the derivation of f p i s is akin to f p b s however the percentage of as that represents the stemflow infiltration area is as replaces bs as 6 f p i s s p i s a s the size of the stand scale infiltration area is m2 may be estimated by taking the product of the mean stemflow rate per tree s r t l h 1 and the number of trees that occupy as nt dimensionless and dividing by the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surface ksat mm h 1 that is 7 i s s r t n t k s a t the numerator in eq 7 s r t n t may be estimated from the mean precipitation intensity while stemflow is being generated r mm h 1 the fraction of precipitation diverted to stemflow pd dimensionless and the stand area as 8 s r t n t p d r a s the parameter pd is termed the drainage partitioning coefficient and is derived following the methods of valente et al 1997 additionally pd may be substituted using either pt the trunk partitioning coefficient see gash 1979 or the slope of the linear regression relating stemflow depth as a function of precipitation depth see park and hatorri 2002 mckee and carlyle moses 2017 both f p b s and f p i s should be compared with the ratio between mean throughfall depth and precipitation depth t p so that a greater appreciation of the spatial variability of understory precipitation and the relative hot spot and hot moment importance of stemflow compared to throughfall may be achieved the metrics f p b s and f p i s represent a conceptual advance as they provide geoscientists the means to express stemflow quantitatively over the area in which it is delivered and received these metrics intuitively couple plant soil interactions over the actual area of input thereby connecting the canopy and subsurface for critical zone research lin 2010 3 methodology 3 1 case studies two case studies using previously unpublished data are presented in which the magnitudes of f p b s and f p i s are derived the first study was conducted in a shorea obtusa wall dipterocarpus tuberculatus roxb terminalia alata heyen ex roth dominated lowland deciduous forest in kratie

close proximity to the plot using a tipping bucket rain gauge resolution 0 5 mm tip 1 ow 34 bp ota keiki seisakusho co ltd tokyo japan while stemflow collected from each tree individually in the plot

campbell scientific inc recorded precipitation and stemflow from each tree at 10 minute intervals an individual precipitation event was defined as recorded precipitation bounded by at least 5 h of no

individual trees was estimated using linear regression between precipitation and the rate of stemflow the juvenile lodgepole pine stand was commercially harvested in 1999 and re planted within the following two years the 2600 m2 stand had a density of 6620 trees ha 1 and a basal area of 10 2 m2 ha 1 information concerning the climate of the research area and the throughfall and precipitation measurement methodology are given in carlyle moses and lishman 2015 while the stemflow measurement methodology used in this study is identical to that described by mckee and carlyle moses 2017 the stemflow infiltration area of the plot was estimated by extrapolating the measured extent of stemflow movement across the surface radiating from the base of three selected tree stems during three precipitation events a 1 cm band of bright dyes flt yellow green powder dye was placed evenly around and adjacent to the base of each selected tree stem prior to the event the extent of stemflow movement along the surface and after careful excavation of the soil belowground was photographed and measured vertically from the ground surface and horizontally from the stem center with a ruler within 12 h of the end of each event 3 2 review of recent literature in addition to the two case studies we derive the values of f p b s and f p i s for recently january 2017 june 2018 inclusive published studies listed as an article document type in the 2018 clarivate analytics web of science core collection that are found using the basic search field topic stemflow only forests and plantations are considered and only studies that provide the requisite stand data e g stand basal area or average basal area and number of trees were included derived values of f p b s by levia and germer 2015 from 11 studies representing 16 forests and plantations are also incorporated into the analysis of f p b s 4 results and discussion 4 1 case studies a total of 1500 9 mm of precipitation fell during 2010 distributed over 130 separate events mean event depth 11 5 mm within the tropical lowland deciduous forest stemflow data was available for 94 of the tree event combinations with the remainder estimated using linear regression relating stemflow depth to precipitation depth for individual trees r2 ranged from 0 81 to 0 94 the total volume of stemflow from all 12 trees over the one year period was 4468 l resulting in an annual s p value of 0 9 although this represents a very small fraction of the canopy water balance the annual f p b s was 4 6 suggesting that the input from stemflow at the base of these lowland tropical trees was approximately 460 of the precipitation that would have fallen over the equivalent area occupied by the tree stems at the tree scale cumulative f p b t ranged from 1 2 to 15 8 the mean rate of stemflow input s r t was found to be 0 853 l h 1 and given ksat 531 mm h 1 a mean it value of 1 6 10 3 m2 and an is value of 0 593 m2 on a per hectare basis is as 5 93 10 3 are derived using eq 6 a f p i s value of 151 8 is calculated that is the mean depth of stemflow infiltration was 15000 of the precipitation depth that would have infiltrated into the stemflow infiltration area in the absence of vegetation cover equivalent to a depth of 2 3 105 mm over the one year period within the juvenile pine stand precipitation stemflow and throughfall data were available for 36 events during the mid may to mid october growing season totaling 252 9 mm mean event depth 7 0 mm stemflow and throughfall accounted for 1 8 and 87 7 of the season long precipitation although s p was 2 of the cumulative precipitation a f p b s of 17 6 was derived given that t p during the same period was 0 877 stemflow represented an input that averaged 20 1 times that of mean throughfall the concentration of stemflow at the base of trees increased with increasing precipitation depth with f p b s ranging from an average of 1 0 for precipitation events 1 5 mm to an average of 20 6 for event depths 10 0 mm the mean f p b s for relatively small precipitation events i e 1 5 mm was 1 4 times greater than t p while for relatively large events i e

study being 223 0 mm stemflow represented a depth over is that was approximately 17 9 times greater than t p using traditional methods of expressing stand scale stemflow stemflow only represents 4 6

which f p b s reaches unity meaning only a very small fraction of stand scale precipitation needs to be diverted to the base of these mature trees as stemflow for equivalent depths over their basal areas to exceed precipitation depth in the supplemental material provided by van stan and gordon 2018 s p data are made available for 346 forests across the globe of the 346 values 18 of them 5 are listed as 1 assigning a value of 0 5 to those studies in which s p is listed as 1 80 of the studies had s p values 0 5 thus season long and annual f p b s values unity are likely the norm across the globe additionally the median s p value of the studies included in the supplemental material of van stan and gordon 2018 is 1 1 suggesting that the global median f p b s may lie between 4 and 5 which is in close agreement with the median value of 5 1 derived for mature forests and plantations reviewed in this present study the threshold s p value of 0 5 for f p b s to equal unity is a function of mean bs as from the studies used to derive eq 10 the threshold s p for any given stand may be readily equated with bs as as 11 s p b s a s where s p represents the threshold s p for f p b s to equal unity from an array of forest yield tables and forest inventory reports it may be concluded that bs for mature forests and plantations typically ranges from 10 to 60 m2 on a per hectare basis including many within the narrow range of 20 to 40 m2 per hectare e g forestry agency 1952 johnstone 1976 schober 1995 clark et al 2015 santiago garcía et al 2017 as such s p will fall in the range of 0 1 to 0 6 for most mature stands further supporting the conclusion that a very small fraction of precipitation needs to be diverted to stemflow for it to be a potential hot spot within wooded ecosystems across the globe as aforementioned no studies that have provided the requisite stand and soil hydraulic conductivity data for the derivation of f p i s have been published between january 2017 through june 2018 inclusive van stan and gordon 2018 arbitrarily argue that 1 m2 is a conservative estimate of it and is not likely to be smaller than that for mature trees while schroth et al 1999 subjectively set it to 2 m2 however derived it values in the range of 1 to 2 m2 are almost always associated with extreme precipitation conditions for example herwitz 1986 in a tropical rainforest in australia found that it for 8 trees ranged from 0 13 to 1 52 m2 mean 0 60 m2 for a precipitation event with a mean intensity of 73 7 mm h 1 schwärzel et al 2012 applied 180 l of stemflow water over a 180 minute period 60 l h 1 to an individual fagus sylvatica tree and observed that stemflow infiltrated directly into the stagnic luvisol soil in a circular area of 0 245 m2 infiltration and tree radius data provided by gómez et al 2002 suggest that it around three olive trees averaged 0 762 m2 for a large precipitation event 77 1 mm however over the entire study period of 12 events mean it was reduced to 0 108 m2 navar 2011 derived a mean it of 0 0314 m2 for tamaulipan thorn scrub in mexico while durocher 1990 found that all stemflow infiltrated into the soil in the immediate vicinity of tree stems with no surface flow observed thus it is typically 1 m2 for extreme events and for average stemflow producing events it is likely much smaller values of it 1 m2 should be expected under most forest conditions given the high surface ksat associated with forest soils compared to stemflow input rates typical of forest trees to maintain an it 1 m2 the ratio between the input rate of stemflow l h 1 and ksat mm h 1 must at least equal unity for most forest soils ksat 100 mm h 1 and may be 1000 mm h 1 hümann et al 2011 for example found that mean ksat values ranged from 193 to 846 mm h 1 across a variety of forests in southwest germany while chandler et al 2018 derived a ksat of 1239 mm h 1 in a scots pine pinus sylvestris stand in scotland similar ksat values have been reported for a range of mature forests and plantations e g murai and iwasaki 1975 herwitz 1986 durocher 1990 buczko et al 2006 di prima et al 2017 mean stemflow input rates s r t from a cross section of forest types were derived using eq 8 table 2 and found to range from approximately 0 1 to 7 7 l h 1 suggesting that it is normally between 1 10 4 to 1 10 1 m2 assuming ksat 100 mm h 1 given the tree densities commonly encountered in forests see table 2 is should normally be between 1 10 2 to 1 102 m2 per hectare with is as between 1 10 4 to 1 100 suggesting that f p i s like f p b s will normally be unity in most undisturbed forest settings thus stemflow represents on a stemflow infiltration area basis an understory input of water that is typically greater than t p and often greater than what the precipitation depth would have been in the absence of forest cover 5 conclusions we conclude and recommend based on the results of this study the following although stemflow represented 2 of incident precipitation within both a tropical lowland deciduous forest and a subpolar juvenile coniferous stand the season long or annual input of stemflow expressed over the stand basal areas and the stemflow infiltration areas greatly exceeded throughfall and the precipitation input that would have fallen on those areas in the absence of tree cover based on the results from recent studies and those presented in the review of levia and germer 2015 only a small percentage of precipitation approximately 0 5 on average needs to be diverted to stemflow for stand scale funneling ratios to equal or exceed unity the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soils of forests coupled with the modest stemflow input rates from forest trees means that most near stem soils receive water input depths that exceed those that would have infiltrated from precipitation or throughfall alone subsequent canopy partitioning studies should report stand scale funneling ratios and derive estimates of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the forest soil so that stand scale stemflow infiltration funneling ratios can be made available usage of the two stemflow metrics will areally link plant soil interactions for improved conceptualization of critical zone processes and the ecohydrological importance of stemflow future studies may for example use and expand on the stand scale stemflow funneling metrics to incorporate the stemflow enrichment ratio see levia and herwitz 2000 to better conceptualize biogeochemical processes in wooded ecosystems including

769,internal solitary waves isws propagating in a two layer stratified fluid system are studied by laboratory experiments through the standard lock release method we investigated the generation propagation and breaking phases of large amplitude internal solitary waves of depression propagating horizontally in a wave tank isws main features depend on the geometrical parameters that define the initial experimental setting relations between isws geometric and kinematic features and the initial setting parameters are analyzed and empirical relations are developed the approach of the isws towards a uniform slope is investigated depending on both wave properties and slopes values different physical processes characterize the shoaling phase causing different breaker type following a qualitatively analysis of the different breaking mechanisms collapsing plunging breakers show the larger contribution in terms of mixing the characteristics of the breaking events affecting internal wave packets propagating towards the north of the messina strait mediterranean sea are discussed additional laboratory experiments are performed to investigate how the pycnocline thickness is affected by the breaking of plunging isws the consequent increase of the pycnocline thickness results to be nonlinearly related with the iribarren number keywords internal solitary waves laboratory experiments breaking mechanisms mixing process 1 introduction solitary waves can be classified in two main categories surface solitary waves ssws and internal solitary waves isws ssws have been extensively studied in the past by a number of authors both numerically and experimentally focusing the attention on the shoaling and the breaking processes synolakis 1997 zelt 1991 grilli et al 1997 hsiao et al 2008 differently from surface oscillating waves the velocity field induced by solitary waves both ssws and isws is typical of translational waves this aspect is of fundamental importance since it determines the main feature of isws that is the ability to transport energy in terms of mass and heat during their propagation phase borluk and kalisch 2012 constantin and escher 2007 shroyer et al 2010 solitary waves form in the ocean as an evolution of the internal gravity waves igws they develop in the interior of stratified water bodies where the stratification presents a portion of the water column in which water density rapidly increases with depth because of changes in temperature and or salinity in the oceans at mid latitudes the well mixed surface waters are affected by seasonal changes in temperature garrett 2003 pedlowsky and miles 2004 sutherland et al 2013 the boundary between the mixed and deep layers is called pycnocline it represents an extremely stable zone acting as a barrier for surfaces processes below the pycnocline changes in salinity or temperature are very small in the mediterranean sea for instance the thickness of the surface mixed layer is typically around 100 m with some peaks and lows that reach 200 m and 30 m respectively depending on the season d ortenzio et al 2005 any disturbance that results in an alteration of the stable stratification of the ocean could cause large amplitude undulations of the pycnocline giving rise to internal waves that propagate due to the consequent action of the gravitational restoring forces on the vertically displaced fluid the gravitational instability can be caused for instance by the action of strong winds by river plumes and primarily by the interaction between tidal flow and the bottom topography for this reason igws could be mainly found within estuaries straits continental margins and the coastal oceans brandt et al 1999 marullo and santoleri 1986 stashchuk and vlasenko 2009 moreover in these regions two homogeneous layers of different density usually approximate vertical density profile in order to describe the density structure for such an approximation we make use of the boussinesq parameter i e the ratio of the density difference between the two layers and a reference density in the coastal oceans the typical value of the boussinesq parameter is 0 03 chen et al 2007 igws may develop in isolated waves of fixed form during the propagation of the internal tides igws could steepen due to nonlinearity giving rise to a train of internal solitary waves isws or solitons the main characteristic of the isws is the balance between nonlinear effects which tend to steepen the leading edge of the wave profile and dispersive effects which cause its flattening korteweg and de vries 1985 these forces act simultaneously and allow the single wave to preserve its shape during motion artale et al 1990 the recent reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc regarding the climate change that is occurring is directly acting on the factors that affect the development and the characteristics of isws ipcc 2013 2014a b the rise in global temperature kraucunas 2006 peterson and baringer 2009 the shrinking ice sheets the glacial retreat church and white 2006 and the warming oceans levitus et al 2009 are just some of the main consequences of this change in this context the action of isws can have a significant importance decarlo et al 2015 document what happens to isws in the breaking phase and stress their relevant action in global climate they analyzed how these waves help move a huge amount of energy from luzon strait across the south china sea warming in the upper layer of the ocean enhances wave activity for large density difference between the surface and the deep layers an increase of the wave energy is expected inducing more energetic effects in the breaking phase for these reasons wave action is expected to increase in those regions through the 21st century with consequent mitigation of the climate change impacts on coastal ecosystems in recent years scientific research has focused on the interaction between isws and the continental shelf slope studying the particular conditions that cause the breaking of the waves and their consequent effects breaking mechanisms beneath the shoaling waves induce both mixing and near bottom turbulence that could cause the suspension and redistribution of the bed material arthur and fringer 2014 droghei et al 2016 internal waves can compromising sub sea oil and gas drilling operations osborne et al 1978 shear stress induced by solitons may even destabilize drill pipes during offshore operations isws may also affect nutrients transport towards the surface in particular when mixing occurs lai et al 2010 and also may cause lateral transport of nutrients lamb 1997 consequently isws represent a crucial phenomenon on the continental shelf slope providing an important link between the large and the small scale at which their energy could be partially dissipated it is quite difficult to directly investigate the features of internal waves by field observations alpers and salusti 1983 artale et al 1990 internal solitary wave packets become visible when their propagation induces sea surface manifestations synthetic aperture radar sar images in alpers et al 1996 show the presence of a group of surface waves caused by internal wave train propagating out of the strait of gibraltar towards the atlantic ocean remote sensing images can only indirectly reveal the presence of the internal waves by defining an external forcing such as a tide it is possible to analyze the evolution of long internal waves in a two layer fluid system this topic has attracted much interest in the past osborne and burch 1980 and in artale et al 1990 used the well known korteweg and de vries kdv equation which describes the waveform for weakly nonlinear internal waves propagating in straits of uniform and shallow depth in two layer stratified fluid system according with the kdv equation the undulation of the pycnocline induced by an isw takes the form of a squared hyperbolic secant the experimental study conducted by grue et al 2000 shows that the kdv theory is valid for amplitudes up to 0 4 times the shallow water depth the observed oceanic isws show higher vertical displacement alpers et al 2008 show the density distribution of the water column of the strait of messina measured by ship borne sensors during the passage of a highly nonlinear internal wave packet the vertical displacement is approximately 3 times the shallow water depth for highly nonlinear waves the wave structure is significantly different from that predicted by kdv theory for this reason both experimental studies and fully nonlinear numerical simulations have been extensively carried out in the past the experiments conducted by kao et al 1985 concerned with the transition of isws from deep to shallow ambient fluid passing over a slope they evaluated the loss of energy due to breaking under these circumstances in their experiments the pycnocline never intersects the sloping boundary helfrich and melville 1986 studied experimentally the transition of isws from waves of depression in deep water to waves of elevation over the slope their experiments showed mixing during the wave transition helfrich 1992 investigated experimentally the approach of a solitary wave toward a uniform slope focusing on the study of boluses caused by the shoaling of isws the ratio between the isws amplitude and the shallow water depth assumed values not so larger than 0 4 michallet and ivey 1999 analyzed the energy loss due to mixing induced by shoaling large amplitude isws over a sloping boundary examining slopes between 0 069 and 0 214 boegman et al 2005 performed laboratory experiments in order to analyze the shoaling process of an internal wave train over a uniform slope 0 097 and 0 145 they introduced the wave slope as the parameter able to describe the isws geometric features it represents the ratio between the wave amplitude and the wavelength the wavelength is defined as the ratio between the wave surface and the wave amplitude in accordance with the kdv theory they classified different breaking types depending on the iribarren number ir defined as the ratio between the topographic slope and the square root of the wave slope however this way to estimate characteristic wavelength is quite misleading since they assume that the generated waves agrees with the theoretical kdv structure this brings to the following breaking domains plunging breakers ir 0 45 0 75 and collapsing breakers ir 0 75 aghsaee et al 2010 used 2d numerical simulations in order to explore the dynamics of large amplitude isws shoaling on a uniform slope they investigated the slope range 0 01 0 3 generating internal waves with an amplitude from 0 2 to 2 times the shallow layer depth they characterized the breaking regimes introducing time scales for each main process involved in the breaking event even if they evaluated ir for each case they did not use that parameter to classify the different breaking mechanisms they observed that for a defined wave the increase of the topographic slope changes the breaking type sutherland et al 2013 performed laboratory experiments on large amplitude isws shoaling on a constant slope their analyses focused on the prediction of the maximum breaking depth and the consequent propagation upslope of the dense layer as a bolus they defined the wavelength as the half width at the half maximum they used ir in order to identify the different breaking regimes plunging breakers occurred if ir 0 3 collapsing breakers for 0 3 ir 0 7 and surging breakers for 0 7 ir 1 5 the marked difference of the values that identify breaking domains between boegman et al 2005 and sutherland et al 2013 is due to the different definition of the wavelength in this work we investigate large amplitude internal waves by laboratory experiments broadening the parameters range explored in the past both numerically and experimentally one aim of this study is to distinguish the breaking mechanisms by evaluating the parameter λ extensively used in literature to define the isw wavelength defined as the ratio between the wave surface and the wave amplitude as in aghsaee et al 2010 this allows us to define an experimental set of ir that will be used to describe breaking mechanisms merging the numerical theoretical approaches with the classic experiments on isw breaking sutherland et al 2013 boegman et al 2005 the generated isws are characterized by wave amplitudes up to 4 times the shallow layers depth well beyond the kdv regime the investigated slope values ranged between 0 15 and 0 95 for this reason results may be efficiently applied to interpret the physical processes involved in real field observations we aim at the understanding how to configure the initial experimental conditions in order to obtain a wave of desired geometrical characteristics we then focus on breaking mechanisms in order to understand how to give rise to a particular type of breaking i e plunging collapsing and surging finally we discuss real breaking of the isws propagating towards the north of the strait of messina italy where the characteristics of both sea bottom and wave parameters suggest that the plunging breakers occur in this region for plunging breakers we investigated the effect of internal wave breaking in terms of increase of the pycnocline thickness we remark that our idealized experimental setting aims at the understanding of the physical processes involved in the real field rather than simulating real field geometries and conditions we are aware of the fact that some relevant parameters are not scaled e g reynolds numbers surface tension vapor pressure this might introduces additional scale effects during the breaking processes that cannot be accounted in laboratory experiments the paper is organized as follow in section 2 the laboratory facilities used to generate a single solitary wave of depression propagating in the wave flume are introduced in section 3 the laboratory model is described section 4 shows the wave field during the propagation phase and during the shoaling process section 5 presents the description of the different breaking mechanisms that could happen finally section 6 introduces the experiments performed in order to analyze the case of the wave packets propagating toward the north of the messina strait also discussing mixing process 2 experimental setting our laboratory experiments are performed in a perspex tank following the standard lock release method kao et al 1985 the 0 2 m wide flume has a length lt 3 0 m and a height ht 0 3 m fig 1 a a thin vertical removable perspex gate divides the flume into two regions the lock on the left hand side and the channel which represents the ambient fluid region in which the waves propagate fig 1a the flume is filled in order to obtain a stratified two layer fluid system of fresh water in the upper layer and brine water in the lower layer the tank is first filled with a solution of sodium chloride nacl creating the lower layer of uniform density ρ2 later fresh water is poured slowly into a funnel inlaid in a sponge float generating the upper layer of uniform density ρ1 this process has to be done very slowly to minimize the thickness of the pycnocline the fresh water was dyed by methylthioninium chloride c16h18cln3s in order to visually distinguish the two layers we used a pycnometer to measure the density of the saline mixture and the dyed fresh water with an error of 0 2 the vertical gate is placed up to a given distance from the bottom such that the hydraulic continuity between the lock and channel regions is always insured a displacement η0 between the pycnoclines of the two regions is produced by adding fresh water to the lock water surface during the tank filling phase part of the brine water flows below the gate spilling in the ambient fluid region as long as the two sides reach a stable hydrostatic condition the final setting present two different stratifications on the left and the right hand side of the gate fig 1a depending on the displacement η0 and on the ratio ρ2 ρ1 a displacement δ forms between the two free surfaces for all the performed experiments δ 2 4 mm by removing the gate a gravity collapse happens and an isw of depression forms and propagates towards the right hand side of the tank chen et al 2007 as schematized in fig 1b the geometrical parameters that define the initial setting of each experiment are fig 1a the lock length x0 the displacement between the pycnoclines η0 the fresh and brine water layer thicknesses h1 and h2 and the total water depth h h 1 h2 a ruler is used to measure the lower layer thickness h2 and the total water depths once h1 and h2 are evaluated the midpoint of the pycnocline in the ambient fluid region is known and it is used to identify the pycnocline position all the experiments are recorded with a ccd charged coupled device camera with a frequency of 25 hz and a spatial resolution of 1024 668 pixels located at a fixed distance from the lateral wall of the tank so that each pixel has a resolution of about 3 mm from image analysis we obtain the pycnocline thickness and the midpoint of the pycnocline in the lock region depending on the filling process accuracy the initial pycnocline thickness ranged between 1 and 9 of the total water depth h a slope defined by the angle θ is located at one end of the tank fig 1a in order to analyze the different breaking mechanisms of the isws the slope length is ls 0 845 m and the angle θ is obtained by measuring the legs a1 and a2 fig 1a table 1 all the experiments are carried out with two homogeneous fluids in order to obtain a density profile as similar as possible to the conditions occurring in ocean where solitary waves are observed the brine water in the lower layer presents a homogenous density ρ2 that ranges between 1029 1032 kg m3 the density of the upper layer for all the performed experiments is 1000 1001 kg m3 the density difference between the salt and the fresh water therefore ranged between 29 and 32 kg m3 obtaining a boussinesq parameter typical of the coastal oceans 0 029 0 032 in order to visualize the direction of the horizontal velocity during the shoaling process some particles of potassium permanganate are disposed as a tracer along particular locations over the slope some particles decant and collect over the slope and they are used to qualitatively understand the bed material redistribution process caused by the wave breaking an image analysis technique is used to measure the instantaneous pycnocline position as in robinson et al 2013 lombardi et al 2015 ottolenghi et al 2016a b ozeren and altinakar 2016 musumeci et al 2017 we then obtain both geometric and kinematic features of the isw such as the wave amplitude a the wave surface s the wavelength lw and the celerity c fig 1b we obtained the wave celerity as the first derivative of the trough s position deduced by image analysis the error committed for lengths measurements is about 1 pixel thus the celerity values are affected by an error of 0 1 cm s the characteristic wavelength λ is defined as in michallet and ivey 1999 1 λ a 1 n x d x s a where η x is the pycnocline position m s the wave surface m2 and a the wave amplitude m all the generated isws follow the shallow water approximation osborne and burch 1980 2 h λ 1 the large amplitude condition compared to the surface layer thickness bourgault et al 2014 can be defined as 3 a h 1 0 4 for all the performed experiments the ratio in eq 3 ranges between 0 6 and 4 we performed additional laboratory experiments in which the density fields are evaluated using dye as tracer for each pixel of the image a relation between the amount of the uniformly distributed dye in the tank and the grey scale values is obtained by acquiring at the end of each experiment several images characterized by a known concentration of dye as in nogueira et al 2013a b 2014 theiler and franca 2016 the error in the evaluation of the instantaneous density fields is estimated in 0 1 kg m3 by considering the ratio between the maximum range of density and the grey scale levels 2 1 waves generation and propagation over the horizontal bottom we identified several phases starting from the gate lifting in order to describe the different processes involved during each experiment fig 2 the first phase characterizes the wave generation the gate removal induces a gravity collapse and the light fluid trapped in the lock region begins to move forward into the ambient fluid fig 2a c after a certain time the initial disturbance fig 2d develops into an internal solitary wave of depression artale et al 1990 characterized by symmetric geometric features fig 2e the generation phase ends when the isw is completely formed and starts to maintain approximately constant its shape and its main features i e amplitude wavelength and celerity propagating over the horizontal bottom during the propagation phase the wave celerity is constant while the other wave properties could slightly change for the performed experiments starting from the time at which the wave assumes a constant homogeneous shape a mean decrease in amplitude of about 8 and a mean increase in wavelength of 7 occurred being isws characterized by a balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects this broadening process is likely due to the friction effects we evaluate the evolution of λ and a during the motion of an internal wave over the horizontal bottom supplementary fig s1 the wavelength increases of about 6 of the initial value while the amplitude decreases of about 9 5 of the initial value reaching approximatively constant values starting from 13 s after the gate removal during the propagation of the leading wave secondary isws can form fig 2f h however among all the performed experiments only few runs showed this occurrence in fig 2g the leading wave has an amplitude a 4 8 cm and a celerity c 11 cm s while the secondary wave features are as 1 8 cm and cs 5 4 cm s secondary waves are characterized by a very small amplitude up to one fifth of the amplitude of the leading waves the celerity of secondary waves eventually generated after the gate removal is very small compared to the celerity of the leading wave this is in accordance with the kdv theory the wave celerity depends on the wave amplitude sutherland et al 2013 thus isws with larger amplitude propagates faster since the amplitude of secondary waves is very small these quickly separate from the leading wave reaching the sloping boundary always after its breaking fig 2i because of the initial turbulence generated during the gate removal and the eventual presence of secondary waves the volume of the generated leading waves is lower than the initial volume x0η0 meanly 82 once the wave reaches the sloping boundary the breaking event occurs during this phase part of the wave is reflected fig 2i depending on the breaking mechanism the reflected wave assumes different geometric and kinematic features in presence of a vertical front wall the wave would be completely reflected and no breaking would occur once a sloping wall is introduced the interaction between the wave and the incline causes breaking most of the incident wave energy is lost due to turbulent mixing and only a part of the wave is reflected 3 the laboratory model to develop empirical relations with the initial setting parameters we considered the incident wave amplitude wavelength and celerity as characteristic values of each run from image analysis we evaluated the vertical projection of the toe of the slope on the pycnocline i e point p in fig 1c the instant at which the approaching wave starts to induce a pycnocline displacement in p defines the incident wave whose features are amplitude wavelength and celerity the main features of the incident wave are not affected yet by the presence of the sloping boundary as soon as the solitary wave approaches the slope the shoaling process starts and the main wave features quickly change the wave celerity decreases and the wave modifies its original shape we developed empirical relations in order to predict the isws main features depending on the geometrical parameters that define the initial experimental set up the initial experimental setting is uniquely determined once the values of the following four parameters are fixed the ambient fluid total depth h the layers depth ratio in the ambient fluid region r0 h2 h1 the lock length x0 and the displacement between the pycnoclines η0 we performed 24 laboratory experiments by using all the possible combinations of these four parameters table 1 in order to obtain isws characterized by different amplitude a characteristic wavelength λ and the wave celerity c we found that the dimensionless wave amplitude a h2 and the dimensionless term η0x0 hh2 relate each other as empirical exponential functions fig 3 a where the latter is the product between the dimensionless pycnocline displacement η0 h2 and the lock region aspect ratio x0 h the empirical exponential function reveals that the increase of the wave amplitude is correlated with the pycnocline displacement regardless from the lock aspect ratio i e x0 h the wave amplitude is always lower than the pycnocline displacement η0 moreover η0x0 can be considered the generating volume enclosed in the lock before the gate removal as the generating volume increases the wave amplitude tends to reach asymptotically a limit value for larger generating volumes the resulting waves present an increase of the wavelength rather than of the amplitude the wave amplitude also depends on the aspect ratio η0 x0 of the trapped light volume confined in the lock region fig 3b for a given pycnocline displacement η0 the wave amplitude decreases when the lock length increases the wavelength depends mainly on the generating volume fig 3c shows the empirical relation between the two dimensionless volumes i e the generating volume η0x0 and the generated volume λa which is equal to the volume of the generated wave it results that the linear fit passes through the origin of the axes then the generated volume of the wave is only a part of the initial volume confined in the lock and the lost volume depends only on the generating volume the gate removal causes an initial phase of rather violent fluid motion a collapse mechanism occurs characterized by an initial turbulent disturbance to obtain a further empirical relation associated with the wave motion we evaluate the dimensionless specific flow rate q defined as 4 q a λ h 2 c v s where 5 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 6 v s g h the term g is the reduced gravity defined as 7 g g ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 the specific flow rate is normalized by using the harmonic mean of the upper and lower layer depths of the two layer fluid 5 and the shallow water linear wave speed 6 in particular the harmonic mean represents the characteristic depth of the ambient and it is introduced in order to evaluate the shallow water linear wave speed cs in accordance with the kdv theory the more the wave amplitude increases the more the isws celerity is larger than cs sutherland et al 2013 for this reason we used cs to normalize the wave celerity and the harmonic mean of the upper and lower layer depths to normalize both the wave amplitude and the wavelength thus the two factors in 7 represent the dimensionless wave surface and celerity fig 3d shows the empirical relation between the parameters that define the initial experimental set up x0 η0 h1 made dimensionless by using the depths harmonic mean and the dimensionless specific flow rate q for a given stratified ambient fluid the specific flow rate increases as the volume of fresh water confined in the lock region increases larger volume waves propagate faster in accordance with the kdv theory the analyzed relations explain more in detail the wave generation process as obtained with the standard lock release method these equations will be used to set initial experimental parameters in order to generate desired waves in terms of amplitude and wavelength 4 the breaking mechanisms to identify the different breaking types it is useful to directly observe in which process each generated wave gets involved during the shoaling during this phase for all the generated waves two particular events we observed i the steepening of the trailing edge of the wave and ii the downward motion of the volume confined between the leading edge of the wave and the sloping boundary the leading edge of the wave tends to become parallel to the slope and the fluid confined in this region flows down channel with a strong acceleration potassium permanganate shows that the steepening of the trailing edge of the wave happens because the upper layer instantaneous horizontal velocities are lower along the verticals closer to the slope aghsaee et al 2010 this process is similar to the steepening of the leading edge of the wave profile for ssws shoaling li and raichlen 2002 fig 4 shows three consecutive snapshots of a single solitary wave during the shoaling process during the tank filling the fresh layer is partially dyed with methylene blue to better identify the pycnocline region and to observe directly the instabilities induced by the wave breaking in the top layer additional experiments were performed in order to qualitatively show the main processes induced by each breaker type and the consequent development of different instabilities table 2 figs 5 8 show consecutive snapshots captured from a prospective point of view 4 1 qualitative description of the observed breaking mechanisms in accordance with sutherland et al 2013 we recognized four breaking mechanisms plunging breakers collapsing breakers plunging collapsing breakers and surging breakers the development of a specific breaker type depends on the two processes described above during the shoaling of the wave along the slope the predominance of one of the two processes or their simultaneous development or their simultaneous absence affects the breaking mode for collapsing breakers the downward motion of the confined fluid is dominant compared to the trailing edge steepening during the shoaling the dense water trapped between the wave and the slope quickly leaves its original position fig 5a d at the same time the trailing edge steepening slowly occurs without inducing any observable instability the trapped dense fluid flows downward in the adverse pressure gradient region consequently the down slope flow quickly decreases its velocity after passing the wave trough inducing the boundary layer separation beneath the shoaling wave a separation bubble forms close to the bottom fig 5d the turbulent structure quickly gives rise to an anticlockwise motion that causes a large amount of mixing in the breaking location fig 5e f plunging breaking mechanism takes place when the overturning develops due to a dominant steepening of the trailing edge of the wave fig 6 during the shoaling a plunging breaker steepens the trailing edge that quickly overturns fig 6a c at the same time the dense fluid trapped between the wave and the sloping bottom leaves its position slowly and not completely when the rear edge overturning occurs a large amount of dense fluid separates the wave from the sloping boundary yet fig 6d during the plunging process mixing is confined within the body of the water column at the breaking location the clockwise vortex fig 9e is initially detached from the sloping boundary then it propagates onshore toward the sloping bottom gradually losing its energy fig 6f an intermediate breaking mechanism i e collapsing plunging breakers fig 7 a b is observed in the breaking location where the contemporary formation of a clockwise vortex within the body of the fluid and a separation bubble close to the bottom fig 7c d this causes a large amount of mixing because of the double motion at the breaking location fig 7e f finally another kind of breaking can be observed in this case neither the steepening of the trailing edge nor the downward motion of the water volume confined below the right tail causes the development of any kind of instability fig 8 a c as shown in fig 8d f when the trough of the wave reaches the sloping boundary a second kind of instabilities occur composed by a gravity current flowing up the slope lombardi et al 2015 ottolenghi et al 2014 2017 this kind of breaking refers to the surging breakers a quantitative analysis of the shoaling phase behind the breaking processes follows in the next section this allows defining the parameters that properly link breaker types with their shoaling conditions 4 2 characterization of the shoaling processes the occurrence of different breaking mechanisms depends directly on the wave evolution over the slope region we therefore parametrized the two main processes that characterize the shoaling phase the steepening of the trailing edge of the wave i e rear front of the isw and the downward i e upstream motion of the volume confined between the leading edge of the wave and the sloping boundary fig 1d we evaluated the instantaneous trailing edge steepening by the decrease of the angle α defined between the line perpendicular to the sloping boundary and the rear edge slope fig 1d the latter is calculated as the derivative of the isw profile at the midpoint m between the wave through and the final point of the trailing edge fig 1d to characterize the downward motion of the dense fluid confined between the wave and the sloping boundary we investigated the evolution of the volume vt identified by the trapped dense fluid between the wave and the slope this volume is instantaneously evaluated starting from the segment between the wave trough t and its vertical projection on the bottom t for four runs characterized by different breaking mechanisms we analyzed the evolution of the two dimensionless parameters α α0 and vt vt0 for those runs we estimated the total time of the shoaling process ti which starts when the wave begins to modify its isometric features because of the presence of the slope the values of α0 and vt0 refer to the initial shoaling time wave shoaling lasts until any discontinuity of the pycnocline i e the isw profile do not show up we obtained the trend of α α0 fig 9 a and vt vt0 fig 9b for the four breaker types fig 10 shows consecutive snapshots of the shoaling and breaking phases for the four cases after the shoaling phase i e for t ti 1 wave breaking occurs the plunging breaker presents a large initial decrease of α α0 compared to the other cases this is in accordance with the consequent breaker type characterized by the overturning of the rear edge of the wave this event begins before the leading edge is completely reclined on the sloping boundary during the overturning t ti 1 1 2 in fig 10a the upstream displacement of the vertical tracer shows that the downward motion of the denser bottom fluid below the leading edge is still occurring for the collapsing breaker the ratio α α0 remains initially unvaried because wave geometry does not change fig 9a the wavelength of the collapsing wave is indeed larger and the resulting horizontal velocity gradient assumes lower values when compared to the plunging case aghsaee et al 2010 during the shoaling of a collapsing case the decrease of the upper layer horizontal velocities and consequently the trailing edge steepening are smaller than those of the plunging case moreover about at the half of the shoaling phase the decrease of the trapped volume is larger for the plunging breaker than for the collapsing one during the final stages of the shoaling these occurrences undergo a change the trailing edge of the plunging breaker quickly steepens and at the same time the trapped volume continues to decrease more slowly the edge overturning takes place before the confined volume completely leaves its original position as shown in fig 10a for the collapsing breaker the rear edge steepening occurs during the final phase of the shoaling process fig 9a the downward motion beneath the shoaling wave is the dominant process which develops with a constant speed until all the trapped dense fluid is completely expelled fig 9b while the trapped volume is almost linearly decreasing the surface from which it flows decreases fig 10b for this reason during the final phase of the shoaling process large values of the downward velocities are expected this flow evolves in the direction of the adverse pressure gradient thus the boundary layer separation is expected to occur and to be the cause of the instability generated close to the bottom for t ti 1 collapsing plunging breaking behavior is in the middle between the two previous cases fig 9 the dimensionless ratio α α0 remains initially roughly unvaried as for the collapsing breaker at t ti 0 4 it begins to decrease very quickly reaching the same trend of the plunging breaker at the end of the shoaling at the same time the decrease of the trapped volume presents a slightly marked deviation point at t ti 0 4 after which it becomes slower as the plunging breaker finally for surging breaker the main mechanism seems to be the decrease of vt vt0 a boundary layer separation induced by the downward motion would be expected this event does not take place probably because the larger amount of the confined volume leaves its original position during the initial shoaling phase when the surface defined by tt fig 1d is not small enough to induce strong downward velocities at the bottom 4 3 the breaking domains the wave shoaling analysis shows how the occurrence of a particular kind of breaking mechanisms depends on the different geometric characteristics of the incident waves compared to the sloping boundary for this reason in agreement with the works of aghsaee et al 2010 and sutherland et al 2013 two parameters are introduced the topographic slope s and the wave slope sw defined as 8 s tan θ 9 s w a λ where θ is the angle between the slope and the horizontal for all experiments the relation between these two parameters is plotted fig 12 results show that the different breaker mechanisms are located in three different regions of the domain sw s which are distinguished by means of the internal iribarren number bridges 2008 10 i r s s w 0 5 the iribarren number is a dimensionless parameter universally applied to model surface gravity waves breaker types on beaches dean and dalrymple 1991 by using the same geometric parameters many authors defined isws breaking mechanisms boegman et al 2005 aghsaee et al 2010 sutherland et al 2013 nevertheless a part from some similarities the breaking evolution of surface waves and internal waves appear rather different fig 11 shows a schematic comparison between the surface waves breaker types and the isws breaking mechanisms observed in our experiments the steepening of the wave crest characterizes spilling and plunging surface waves which usually occur for waves interacting with relative gentle slopes by increasing the slope wave steepens and a turbulent whitewater spills down the face of the wave while for steeper slopes the crest curls over and drops onto the trough of the wave for the observed isw plunging breakers present the steepening of the trailing edge such that the breaking evolves with its consequent overturning for even steeper slopes both for internal and for surface waves the collapsing mechanism occur this results in an instability evolving close to the bottom finally for very steep sloping boundaries surging breakers are observed for surface waves a rapid movement of the base of the wave and the disappearance of the wave crest occur the wave almost does not break and a little whitewater forms for isws surging breakers the instabilities result in a gravity current flowing upward the incline after the wave trough touches the sloping boundary we can conclude that the main similarities between surface and internal breaking waves are the edge steepening for plunging breakers and the location of the breaking for collapsing and surging breakers in our experiments collapsing breakers are observed for values of sw 0 5 1 5 s and in particular for ir 1 1 5 for gentler slopes and or for larger wave slope plunging breakers develop fig 11 they are observed for sw 0 5 s i e ir 1 finally the collapsing plunging case occurs for sw 0 5 s since under these conditions the two main breaking processes simultaneously are observed runs 49 54 fig 12 are performed in order to investigate the breaking effect of plunging breakers for these runs the density field is obtained by image analysis we obtained the domain of the different breaking regimes by using a definition of characteristic wavelength based on a theoretical approach by using the empirical relation developed in section 3 it is possible to set the proper experimental setting that generates the desired wave and in particular to choose the appropriate values of the sloping boundary in order to induce for each designed wave a particular breaking mechanism 5 plunging breakers the case of the messina strait the messina strait separates the sicily island from the italian peninsula and represents the connection between the tyrrhenian sea in the north and the ionian sea in the south the center of the strait presents a shallow sill here the maximum water depth is about 80 m for this reason the center of the strait represents a barrier to the water exchange between the two seas the phase opposition of the semidiurnal tides in the thyrrenian and ionian seas generates large gradients of tidal displacements brandt et al 1999 the interaction between these gradients and the topography features of the strait gives rise to strong tidal currents alpers et al 1996 during northward southward tidal flow the ionian tyrrhenian waters overflowing the sill spills into the tyrrhenian ionian sea because of the different stratification that characterizes the two seas vercelli 1925 nonlinear internal solitary waves of depression form and propagate from the strait towards the north south in the tyrrhenian ionian sea nicolò and salusti 1991 sapia and salusti 1987 fig 13 shows the topography of the north part of the strait where the presence of a second sill forms a bottom with a slope sm 0 075 marullo and santoleri 1986 alpers et al 2008 show the density and velocity fields induced by a nonlinear internal wave packet composed by three solitary waves of depression propagating towards the north of the strait the main wave has an amplitude am 100 m and a characteristic wavelength λm 800 m approximately the evaluation of the wave surface allows defining the wave slope value sw 0 1 the corresponding iribarren number is 0 24 a typical value of the plunging breakers to focus on the characteristic of the plunging breakers and thus to investigate the potential effects of this kind of breaking in the north of messina strait we performed seven ad hoc experiments table 3 although our experiments aim at the sole understanding of the breaking mechanisms involved in the real field rather than scaling the real field conditions our set up is based on the internal solitary waves observed in the strait of messina and the topography that constraints their evolution northward fig 13 we therefore considers a real field reduced gravity g and the iribarren number ir as obtained from brandt et al 1999 in each run a constant value of 30 kg m3 is used as density difference between the two layers in the ambient fluid region then the reduced gravity is similar to the values measured in the real field marullo and santoleri 1986 the iribarren number is always less than one thus the breaker type falls within the plunging breakers domain the analysis of the density profiles allows evaluating the effect of the breaking as direct consequence of the breaking event the pycnocline increases its thickness to specifically evaluate this phenomenon and to have a bulk evaluation of the breaking effects the region overlying the slope has been chosen as the domain of interest the domain is bounded by the free surface and the sloping boundary while its left hand side is limited by the vertical passing through the slope s toe we considered the space averaged dimensionless density profiles along the domain in order to analyze their change during each time interval before and after the breaking process for each time step we firstly evaluated the density field by image analysis obtaining all the density profiles along the water depth then we performed their horizontal average in this way we estimated the instantaneous space averaged density profile 11 ρ d ρ x y ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 12 h d y h the dimensionless densities ranging between 0 and 1 are defined in eq 11 where ρ x y is the density at each point of the domain defined by the coordinates x and y and ρ1 2 are the densities values of the two layers in the ambient fluid region before the gate removal moreover eq 12 defines the dimensionless water depths hd to quantify the effect of the breaking in terms of increase of the pycnocline thickness we compared for each run the initial and final space averaged dimensionless density profile the initial condition refers to the initial time interval immediately before the gate removal the final density profile is defined when the fluid is at rest in stable equilibrium after the breaking event therefore for each run constant values of the pycnocline thickness characterize the final condition during these experiments no secondary waves formed and the fluid reaches a stable at rest condition before the reflected wave comes back in the domain of interest fig 14 shows the change in the pycnocline thickness at two different times before the gate removal fig 14a and after the breaking event fig 14c to evaluate the pycnocline thickness we estimate the local minimum of the derivative of each density profile the breaking event induces mixing that causes the increase of the pycnocline thickness by comparing the initial and final conditions for each run we obtained as difference the increase of the pycnocline thickness δp for all the performed experiments an increase of the pycnoclines thickness occurs table 4 shows the parameters used to analyze the mixing effects in particular the ratio between the increase of the dimensionless pycnocline thickness δpt δp h and the wave slope sw is evaluated the relation between the change in the pycnocline thickness and the iribarren number is investigated fig 15 a this relation shows that the overturning of the trailing edge for two different plunging breakers with equal ratio of amplitude and wavelength cannot generate the same breaking effects the change in topographic slope affects the breaking inducing different increases of the pycnocline thickness the ratio between the dimensionless increase of the pycnocline thickness and wave slope increases with the iribarren number however this increasing trend seems to collapse for ir 0 55 suggesting a non efficient overturning in terms of mixing for values of ir that tend to the collapsing phase i e ir 1 low values of ir well describe the messina strait case the linear behavior that occurs in this region allows us to estimate the breaking effects on the pycnocline thickness in the real field where δpt is expected to range in between 0 05 and 0 1 marullo and santoleri 1986 isws propagating towards the north of the messina strait are expected to break coherently with this nonlinear behavior then for plunging breakers once the total water depth and the topographic slope are defined a particular value of wave slope sw that maximizes the increase of the pycnocline thickness exists on the other hand for a given value of total water depth and for a well defined wave in terms of amplitude and wavelength a particular value of the topographic slope maximizes the breaking effects by increasing this value the breaking event induces a wave reflection process and the mixing effects in the pycnocline region tend to fade to investigate the horizontal distribution of the pycnocline thickness the domain of interest is divided in four regions of equal length above the sloping boundary fig 16 for each zone the space averaged dimensionless density profiles are evaluated for all the performed experiments and for each zone the increases of the pycnocline δp thickness are plotted fig 15b the zone 0 refers to the ambient fluid region preceding the sloping boundary in which the increase of the pycnocline is nil or negligible by approaching the end of the tank the effect of the breaking is noticeable all this suggests that the horizontal distribution of mixing also depends on the breaking location for the performed experiments indeed the breaking location is always one zone upstream the one where the maximum increase of pycnocline thickness occurs fig 16 since a small amount of the incident wave is reflected the horizontal trend of the increase of the pycnocline thickness can be also affected by the action of the reflected wave that moves the mixed region offshore run 48 indeed shows the largest reflected wave in terms of wave surface table 4 thus we conclude that both breaking location and reflected wave features may affect the horizontal distribution of the breaking effects 6 discussion and conclusions large amplitude isws of depression are analyzed by laboratory experiments we followed the theoretical numerical approach to define the characteristic wavelength λ empirical relations between the initial setting parameters and the generated isws kinematic and geometric main features are developed and used to obtain a well defined isw in terms of amplitude characteristic wavelength and celerity the empirical relations show that the amplitude of the generated wave depends on the aspect ratio of the generating volume confined in the lock region before the gate removal moreover the generating volume strongly influences both the value of the characteristic wavelength and the wave speed when a solitary wave of depression shoals over a sloping boundary different breaking mechanisms could develop depending directly on the main processes involved during the shoaling the steepening of the trailing edge of the wave and the downward motion of the dense fluid confined between the leading edge and the sloping boundary occur these events develop differently depending on the wave geometric characteristics and on the topographic features we investigate the dimensionless parameters that characterize these processes for plunging breakers observed for ir 1 the decrease of the trailing edge slope is the predominant event the rate of decrease undergoes a sharp increase at about half of the total shoaling time the decrease of the lower layer fluid confined between the wave and the sloping boundary characterizes the collapsing mechanism 1 ir 1 5 shortly before the end of the shoaling this process becomes prominent and cause instabilities at the bottom as collapsing plunging breakers ir 1 shoal over the sloping boundary the decrease of the trapped dense volume steadily occurs while a strong rear edge overturning takes place only in the second half of the process both the events cause instabilities giving rise to a large amount of mixing for surging breakers ir 1 5 we observed only a small amount of mixing during the propagation of the interface upslope as a gravity current in this case the largest amount of the confined dense water flows offshore trough a surface not large enough to induce the boundary layer separation we also discuss the isws propagating toward the north of the messina strait these waves and topographic features suggest that plunging breakers occur in this region ir 0 24 we carried out seven runs reproducing the real field case with idealized small scale experiments the effect of the breaking is evaluated in terms of increase of the pycnocline thickness induced by the consequent mixing we noticed that both the wave reflection and the breaking locations affect the horizontal distribution of the increase of the pycnocline thickness induced by the breaking the ratio between the dimensionless increase of the pycnocline thickness and the wave slope is evaluated this parameter shows a trend strongly related with the iribarren number it increases as ir increases then it collapses when ir tends to the collapsing domain for ir 0 35 the performed experiments show an approximately linear relation between ir and the dimensionless mixed depth we infer that breaking mechanisms that occur in the north of the messina strait should generate an increase of the pycnocline thickness of 0 5 1 we investigated the plunging regime only for collapsing breakers we expect a similar behavior concerning with the relation between the iribarren number and the pycnocline thickness when the shoaling develops simultaneous instabilities as for collapsing plunging breakers we expect a more irregular trend depending on the relative contribution of the two main shoaling processes we are aware of the limitation of our experiments in terms of scaling we point out however that an increase of the reynolds number as for real field conditions would reduce the effect of boundary layer separation on wave breaking aghsaee et al 2010 and bring the system towards the plunging for the same internal iribarren number the increase of pycnocline thickness as direct consequence of the breaking of solitary

769,internal solitary waves isws propagating in a two layer stratified fluid system are studied by laboratory experiments through the standard lock release method we investigated the generation propagation and breaking phases of large amplitude internal solitary waves of depression propagating horizontally in a wave tank isws main features depend on the geometrical parameters that define the initial experimental setting relations between isws geometric and kinematic features and the initial setting parameters are analyzed and empirical relations are developed the approach of the isws towards a uniform slope is investigated depending on both wave properties and slopes values different physical processes characterize the shoaling phase causing different breaker type following a qualitatively analysis of the different breaking mechanisms collapsing plunging breakers show the larger contribution in terms of mixing the characteristics of the breaking events affecting internal wave packets propagating towards the north of the messina strait mediterranean sea are discussed additional laboratory experiments are performed to investigate how the pycnocline thickness is affected by the breaking of plunging isws the consequent increase of the pycnocline thickness results to be nonlinearly related with the iribarren number keywords internal solitary waves laboratory experiments breaking mechanisms mixing process 1 introduction solitary waves can be classified in two main categories surface solitary waves ssws and internal solitary waves isws ssws have been extensively studied in the past by a number of authors both numerically and experimentally focusing the attention on the shoaling and the breaking processes synolakis 1997 zelt 1991 grilli et al 1997 hsiao et al 2008 differently from surface oscillating waves the velocity field induced by solitary waves both ssws and isws is typical of translational waves this aspect is of fundamental importance since it determines the main feature of isws that is the ability to transport energy in terms of mass and heat during their propagation phase borluk and kalisch 2012 constantin and escher 2007 shroyer et al 2010 solitary waves form in the ocean as an evolution of the internal gravity waves igws they develop in the interior of stratified water bodies where the stratification presents a portion of the water column in which water density rapidly increases with depth because of changes in temperature and or salinity in the oceans at mid latitudes the well mixed surface waters are affected by seasonal changes in temperature garrett 2003 pedlowsky and miles 2004 sutherland et al 2013 the boundary between the mixed and deep layers is called pycnocline it represents an extremely stable zone acting as a barrier for surfaces processes below the pycnocline changes in salinity or temperature are very small in the mediterranean sea for instance the thickness of the surface mixed layer is typically around 100 m with some peaks and lows that reach 200 m and 30 m respectively depending on the season d ortenzio et al 2005 any disturbance that results in an alteration of the stable stratification of the ocean could cause large amplitude undulations of the pycnocline giving rise to internal waves that propagate due to the consequent action of the gravitational restoring forces on the vertically displaced fluid the gravitational instability can be caused for instance by the action of strong winds by river plumes and primarily by the interaction between tidal flow and the bottom topography for this reason igws could be mainly found within estuaries straits continental margins and the coastal oceans brandt et al 1999 marullo and santoleri 1986 stashchuk and vlasenko 2009 moreover in these regions two homogeneous layers of different density usually approximate vertical density profile in order to describe the density structure for such an approximation we make use of the boussinesq parameter i e the ratio of the density difference between the two layers and a reference density in the coastal oceans the typical value of the boussinesq parameter is 0 03 chen et al 2007 igws may develop in isolated waves of fixed form during the propagation of the internal tides igws could steepen due to nonlinearity giving rise to a train of internal solitary waves isws or solitons the main characteristic of the isws is the balance between nonlinear effects which tend to steepen the leading edge of the wave profile and dispersive effects which cause its flattening korteweg and de vries 1985 these forces act simultaneously and allow the single wave to preserve its shape during motion artale et al 1990 the recent reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc regarding the climate change that is occurring is directly acting on the factors that affect the development and the characteristics of isws ipcc 2013 2014a b the rise in global temperature kraucunas 2006 peterson and baringer 2009 the shrinking ice sheets the glacial retreat church and white 2006 and the warming oceans levitus et al 2009 are just some of the main consequences of this change in this context the action of isws can have a significant importance decarlo et al 2015 document what happens to isws in the breaking phase and stress their relevant action in global climate they analyzed how these waves help move a huge amount of energy from luzon strait across the south china sea warming in the upper layer of the ocean enhances wave activity for large density difference between the surface and the deep layers an increase of the wave energy is expected inducing more energetic effects in the breaking phase for these reasons wave action is expected to increase in those regions through the 21st century with consequent mitigation of the climate change impacts on coastal ecosystems in recent years scientific research has focused on the interaction between isws and the continental shelf slope studying the particular conditions that cause the breaking of the waves and their consequent effects breaking mechanisms beneath the shoaling waves induce both mixing and near bottom turbulence that could cause the suspension and redistribution of the bed material arthur and fringer 2014 droghei et al 2016 internal waves can compromising sub sea oil and gas drilling operations osborne et al 1978 shear stress induced by solitons may even destabilize drill pipes during offshore operations isws may also affect nutrients transport towards the surface in particular when mixing occurs lai et al 2010 and also may cause lateral transport of nutrients lamb 1997 consequently isws represent a crucial phenomenon on the continental shelf slope providing an important link between the large and the small scale at which their energy could be partially dissipated it is quite difficult to directly investigate the features of internal waves by field observations alpers and salusti 1983 artale et al 1990 internal solitary wave packets become visible when their propagation induces sea surface manifestations synthetic aperture radar sar images in alpers et al 1996 show the presence of a group of surface waves caused by internal wave train propagating out of the strait of gibraltar towards the atlantic ocean remote sensing images can only indirectly reveal the presence of the internal waves by defining an external forcing such as a tide it is possible to analyze the evolution of long internal waves in a two layer fluid system this topic has attracted much interest in the past osborne and burch 1980 and in artale et al 1990 used the well known korteweg and de vries kdv equation which describes the waveform for weakly nonlinear internal waves propagating in straits of uniform and shallow depth in two layer stratified fluid system according with the kdv equation the undulation of the pycnocline induced by an isw takes the form of a squared hyperbolic secant the experimental study conducted by grue et al 2000 shows that the kdv theory is valid for amplitudes up to 0 4 times the shallow water depth the observed oceanic isws show higher vertical displacement alpers et al 2008 show the density distribution of the water column of the strait of messina measured by ship borne sensors during the passage of a highly nonlinear internal wave packet the vertical displacement is approximately 3 times the shallow water depth for highly nonlinear waves the wave structure is significantly different from that predicted by kdv theory for this reason both experimental studies and fully nonlinear numerical simulations have been extensively carried out in the past the experiments conducted by kao et al 1985 concerned with the transition of isws from deep to shallow ambient fluid passing over a slope they evaluated the loss of energy due to breaking under these circumstances in their experiments the pycnocline never intersects the sloping boundary helfrich and melville 1986 studied experimentally the transition of isws from waves of depression in deep water to waves of elevation over the slope their experiments showed mixing during the wave transition helfrich 1992 investigated experimentally the approach of a solitary wave toward a uniform slope focusing on the study of boluses caused by the shoaling of isws the ratio between the isws amplitude and the shallow water depth assumed values not so larger than 0 4 michallet and ivey 1999 analyzed the energy loss due to mixing induced by shoaling large amplitude isws over a sloping boundary examining slopes between 0 069 and 0 214 boegman et al 2005 performed laboratory experiments in order to analyze the shoaling process of an internal wave train over a uniform slope 0 097 and 0 145 they introduced the wave slope as the parameter able to describe the isws geometric features it represents the ratio between the wave amplitude and the wavelength the wavelength is defined as the ratio between the wave surface and the wave amplitude in accordance with the kdv theory they classified different breaking types depending on the iribarren number ir defined as the ratio between the topographic slope and the square root of the wave slope however this way to estimate characteristic wavelength is quite misleading since they assume that the generated waves agrees with the theoretical kdv structure this brings to the following breaking domains plunging breakers ir 0 45 0 75 and collapsing breakers ir 0 75 aghsaee et al 2010 used 2d numerical simulations in order to explore the dynamics of large amplitude isws shoaling on a uniform slope they investigated the slope range 0 01 0 3 generating internal waves with an amplitude from 0 2 to 2 times the shallow layer depth they characterized the breaking regimes introducing time scales for each main process involved in the breaking event even if they evaluated ir for each case they did not use that parameter to classify the different breaking mechanisms they observed that for a defined wave the increase of the topographic slope changes the breaking type sutherland et al 2013 performed laboratory experiments on large amplitude isws shoaling on a constant slope their analyses focused on the prediction of the maximum breaking depth and the consequent propagation upslope of the dense layer as a bolus they defined the wavelength as the half width at the half maximum they used ir in order to identify the different breaking regimes plunging breakers occurred if ir 0 3 collapsing breakers for 0 3 ir 0 7 and surging breakers for 0 7 ir 1 5 the marked difference of the values that identify breaking domains between boegman et al 2005 and sutherland et al 2013 is due to the different definition of the wavelength in this work we investigate large amplitude internal waves by laboratory experiments broadening the parameters range explored in the past both numerically and experimentally one aim of this study is to distinguish the breaking mechanisms by evaluating the parameter λ extensively used in literature to define the isw wavelength defined as the ratio between the wave surface and the wave amplitude as in aghsaee et al 2010 this allows us to define an experimental set of ir that will be used to describe breaking mechanisms merging the numerical theoretical approaches with the classic experiments on isw breaking sutherland et al 2013 boegman et al 2005 the generated isws are characterized by wave amplitudes up to 4 times the shallow layers depth well beyond the kdv regime the investigated slope values ranged between 0 15 and 0 95 for this reason results may be efficiently applied to interpret the physical processes involved in real field observations we aim at the understanding how to configure the initial experimental conditions in order to obtain a wave of desired geometrical characteristics we then focus on breaking mechanisms in order to understand how to give rise to a particular type of breaking i e plunging collapsing and surging finally we discuss real breaking of the isws propagating towards the north of the strait of messina italy where the characteristics of both sea bottom and wave parameters suggest that the plunging breakers occur in this region for plunging breakers we investigated the effect of internal wave breaking in terms of increase of the pycnocline thickness we remark that our idealized experimental setting aims at the understanding of the physical processes involved in the real field rather than simulating real field geometries and conditions we are aware of the fact that some relevant parameters are not scaled e g reynolds numbers surface tension vapor pressure this might introduces additional scale effects during the breaking processes that cannot be accounted in laboratory experiments the paper is organized as follow in section 2 the laboratory facilities used to generate a single solitary wave of depression propagating in the wave flume are introduced in section 3 the laboratory model is described section 4 shows the wave field during the propagation phase and during the shoaling process section 5 presents the description of the different breaking mechanisms that could happen finally section 6 introduces the experiments performed in order to analyze the case of the wave packets propagating toward the north of the messina strait also discussing mixing process 2 experimental setting our laboratory experiments are performed in a perspex tank following the standard lock release method kao et al 1985 the 0 2 m wide flume has a length lt 3 0 m and a height ht 0 3 m fig 1 a a thin vertical removable perspex gate divides the flume into two regions the lock on the left hand side and the channel which represents the ambient fluid region in which the waves propagate fig 1a the flume is filled in order to obtain a stratified two layer fluid system of fresh water in the upper layer and brine water in the lower layer the tank is first filled with a solution of sodium chloride nacl creating the lower layer of uniform density ρ2 later fresh water is poured slowly into a funnel inlaid in a sponge float generating the upper layer of uniform density ρ1 this process has to be done very slowly to minimize the thickness of the pycnocline the fresh water was dyed by methylthioninium chloride c16h18cln3s in order to visually distinguish the two layers we used a pycnometer to measure the density of the saline mixture and the dyed fresh water with an error of 0 2 the vertical gate is placed up to a given distance from the bottom such that the hydraulic continuity between the lock and channel regions is always insured a displacement η0 between the pycnoclines of the two regions is produced by adding fresh water to the lock water surface during the tank filling phase part of the brine water flows below the gate spilling in the ambient fluid region as long as the two sides reach a stable hydrostatic condition the final setting present two different stratifications on the left and the right hand side of the gate fig 1a depending on the displacement η0 and on the ratio ρ2 ρ1 a displacement δ forms between the two free surfaces for all the performed experiments δ 2 4 mm by removing the gate a gravity collapse happens and an isw of depression forms and propagates towards the right hand side of the tank chen et al 2007 as schematized in fig 1b the geometrical parameters that define the initial setting of each experiment are fig 1a the lock length x0 the displacement between the pycnoclines η0 the fresh and brine water layer thicknesses h1 and h2 and the total water depth h h 1 h2 a ruler is used to measure the lower layer thickness h2 and the total water depths once h1 and h2 are evaluated the midpoint of the pycnocline in the ambient fluid region is known and it is used to identify the pycnocline position all the experiments are recorded with a ccd charged coupled device camera with a frequency of 25 hz and a spatial resolution of 1024 668 pixels located at a fixed distance from the lateral wall of the tank so that each pixel has a resolution of about 3 mm from image analysis we obtain the pycnocline thickness and the midpoint of the pycnocline in the lock region depending on the filling process accuracy the initial pycnocline thickness ranged between 1 and 9 of the total water depth h a slope defined by the angle θ is located at one end of the tank fig 1a in order to analyze the different breaking mechanisms of the isws the slope length is ls 0 845 m and the angle θ is obtained by measuring the legs a1 and a2 fig 1a table 1 all the experiments are carried out with two homogeneous fluids in order to obtain a density profile as similar as possible to the conditions occurring in ocean where solitary waves are observed the brine water in the lower layer presents a homogenous density ρ2 that ranges between 1029 1032 kg m3 the density of the upper layer for all the performed experiments is 1000 1001 kg m3 the density difference between the salt and the fresh water therefore ranged between 29 and 32 kg m3 obtaining a boussinesq parameter typical of the coastal oceans 0 029 0 032 in order to visualize the direction of the horizontal velocity during the shoaling process some particles of potassium permanganate are disposed as a tracer along particular locations over the slope some particles decant and collect over the slope and they are used to qualitatively understand the bed material redistribution process caused by the wave breaking an image analysis technique is used to measure the instantaneous pycnocline position as in robinson et al 2013 lombardi et al 2015 ottolenghi et al 2016a b ozeren and altinakar 2016 musumeci et al 2017 we then obtain both geometric and kinematic features of the isw such as the wave amplitude a the wave surface s the wavelength lw and the celerity c fig 1b we obtained the wave celerity as the first derivative of the trough s position deduced by image analysis the error committed for lengths measurements is about 1 pixel thus the celerity values are affected by an error of 0 1 cm s the characteristic wavelength λ is defined as in michallet and ivey 1999 1 λ a 1 n x d x s a where η x is the pycnocline position m s the wave surface m2 and a the wave amplitude m all the generated isws follow the shallow water approximation osborne and burch 1980 2 h λ 1 the large amplitude condition compared to the surface layer thickness bourgault et al 2014 can be defined as 3 a h 1 0 4 for all the performed experiments the ratio in eq 3 ranges between 0 6 and 4 we performed additional laboratory experiments in which the density fields are evaluated using dye as tracer for each pixel of the image a relation between the amount of the uniformly distributed dye in the tank and the grey scale values is obtained by acquiring at the end of each experiment several images characterized by a known concentration of dye as in nogueira et al 2013a b 2014 theiler and franca 2016 the error in the evaluation of the instantaneous density fields is estimated in 0 1 kg m3 by considering the ratio between the maximum range of density and the grey scale levels 2 1 waves generation and propagation over the horizontal bottom we identified several phases starting from the gate lifting in order to describe the different processes involved during each experiment fig 2 the first phase characterizes the wave generation the gate removal induces a gravity collapse and the light fluid trapped in the lock region begins to move forward into the ambient fluid fig 2a c after a certain time the initial disturbance fig 2d develops into an internal solitary wave of depression artale et al 1990 characterized by symmetric geometric features fig 2e the generation phase ends when the isw is completely formed and starts to maintain approximately constant its shape and its main features i e amplitude wavelength and celerity propagating over the horizontal bottom during the propagation phase the wave celerity is constant while the other wave properties could slightly change for the performed experiments starting from the time at which the wave assumes a constant homogeneous shape a mean decrease in amplitude of about 8 and a mean increase in wavelength of 7 occurred being isws characterized by a balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects this broadening process is likely due to the friction effects we evaluate the evolution of λ and a during the motion of an internal wave over the horizontal bottom supplementary fig s1 the wavelength increases of about 6 of the initial value while the amplitude decreases of about 9 5 of the initial value reaching approximatively constant values starting from 13 s after the gate removal during the propagation of the leading wave secondary isws can form fig 2f h however among all the performed experiments only few runs showed this occurrence in fig 2g the leading wave has an amplitude a 4 8 cm and a celerity c 11 cm s while the secondary wave features are as 1 8 cm and cs 5 4 cm s secondary waves are characterized by a very small amplitude up to one fifth of the amplitude of the leading waves the celerity of secondary waves eventually generated after the gate removal is very small compared to the celerity of the leading wave this is in accordance with the kdv theory the wave celerity depends on the wave amplitude sutherland et al 2013 thus isws with larger amplitude propagates faster since the amplitude of secondary waves is very small these quickly separate from the leading wave reaching the sloping boundary always after its breaking fig 2i because of the initial turbulence generated during the gate removal and the eventual presence of secondary waves the volume of the generated leading waves is lower than the initial volume x0η0 meanly 82 once the wave reaches the sloping boundary the breaking event occurs during this phase part of the wave is reflected fig 2i depending on the breaking mechanism the reflected wave assumes different geometric and kinematic features in presence of a vertical front wall the wave would be completely reflected and no breaking would occur once a sloping wall is introduced the interaction between the wave and the incline causes breaking most of the incident wave energy is lost due to turbulent mixing and only a part of the wave is reflected 3 the laboratory model to develop empirical relations with the initial setting parameters we considered the incident wave amplitude wavelength and celerity as characteristic values of each run from image analysis we evaluated the vertical projection of the toe of the slope on the pycnocline i e point p in fig 1c the instant at which the approaching wave starts to induce a pycnocline displacement in p defines the incident wave whose features are amplitude wavelength and celerity the main features of the incident wave are not affected yet by the presence of the sloping boundary as soon as the solitary wave approaches the slope the shoaling process starts and the main wave features quickly change the wave celerity decreases and the wave modifies its original shape we developed empirical relations in order to predict the isws main features depending on the geometrical parameters that define the initial experimental set up the initial experimental setting is uniquely determined once the values of the following four parameters are fixed the ambient fluid total depth h the layers depth ratio in the ambient fluid region r0 h2 h1 the lock length x0 and the displacement between the pycnoclines η0 we performed 24 laboratory experiments by using all the possible combinations of these four parameters table 1 in order to obtain isws characterized by different amplitude a characteristic wavelength λ and the wave celerity c we found that the dimensionless wave amplitude a h2 and the dimensionless term η0x0 hh2 relate each other as empirical exponential functions fig 3 a where the latter is the product between the dimensionless pycnocline displacement η0 h2 and the lock region aspect ratio x0 h the empirical exponential function reveals that the increase of the wave amplitude is correlated with the pycnocline displacement regardless from the lock aspect ratio i e x0 h the wave amplitude is always lower than the pycnocline displacement η0 moreover η0x0 can be considered the generating volume enclosed in the lock before the gate removal as the generating volume increases the wave amplitude tends to reach asymptotically a limit value for larger generating volumes the resulting waves present an increase of the wavelength rather than of the amplitude the wave amplitude also depends on the aspect ratio η0 x0 of the trapped light volume confined in the lock region fig 3b for a given pycnocline displacement η0 the wave amplitude decreases when the lock length increases the wavelength depends mainly on the generating volume fig 3c shows the empirical relation between the two dimensionless volumes i e the generating volume η0x0 and the generated volume λa which is equal to the volume of the generated wave it results that the linear fit passes through the origin of the axes then the generated volume of the wave is only a part of the initial volume confined in the lock and the lost volume depends only on the generating volume the gate removal causes an initial phase of rather violent fluid motion a collapse mechanism occurs characterized by an initial turbulent disturbance to obtain a further empirical relation associated with the wave motion we evaluate the dimensionless specific flow rate q defined as 4 q a λ h 2 c v s where 5 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 6 v s g h the term g is the reduced gravity defined as 7 g g ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 1 the specific flow rate is normalized by using the harmonic mean of the upper and lower layer depths of the two layer fluid 5 and the shallow water linear wave speed 6 in particular the harmonic mean represents the characteristic depth of the ambient and it is introduced in order to evaluate the shallow water linear wave speed cs in accordance with the kdv theory the more the wave amplitude increases the more the isws celerity is larger than cs sutherland et al 2013 for this reason we used cs to normalize the wave celerity and the harmonic mean of the upper and lower layer depths to normalize both the wave amplitude and the wavelength thus the two factors in 7 represent the dimensionless wave surface and celerity fig 3d shows the empirical relation between the parameters that define the initial experimental set up x0 η0 h1 made dimensionless by using the depths harmonic mean and the dimensionless specific flow rate q for a given stratified ambient fluid the specific flow rate increases as the volume of fresh water confined in the lock region increases larger volume waves propagate faster in accordance with the kdv theory the analyzed relations explain more in detail the wave generation process as obtained with the standard lock release method these equations will be used to set initial experimental parameters in order to generate desired waves in terms of amplitude and wavelength 4 the breaking mechanisms to identify the different breaking types it is useful to directly observe in which process each generated wave gets involved during the shoaling during this phase for all the generated waves two particular events we observed i the steepening of the trailing edge of the wave and ii the downward motion of the volume confined between the leading edge of the wave and the sloping boundary the leading edge of the wave tends to become parallel to the slope and the fluid confined in this region flows down channel with a strong acceleration potassium permanganate shows that the steepening of the trailing edge of the wave happens because the upper layer instantaneous horizontal velocities are lower along the verticals closer to the slope aghsaee et al 2010 this process is similar to the steepening of the leading edge of the wave profile for ssws shoaling li and raichlen 2002 fig 4 shows three consecutive snapshots of a single solitary wave during the shoaling process during the tank filling the fresh layer is partially dyed with methylene blue to better identify the pycnocline region and to observe directly the instabilities induced by the wave breaking in the top layer additional experiments were performed in order to qualitatively show the main processes induced by each breaker type and the consequent development of different instabilities table 2 figs 5 8 show consecutive snapshots captured from a prospective point of view 4 1 qualitative description of the observed breaking mechanisms in accordance with sutherland et al 2013 we recognized four breaking mechanisms plunging breakers collapsing breakers plunging collapsing breakers and surging breakers the development of a specific breaker type depends on the two processes described above during the shoaling of the wave along the slope the predominance of one of the two processes or their simultaneous development or their simultaneous absence affects the breaking mode for collapsing breakers the downward motion of the confined fluid is dominant compared to the trailing edge steepening during the shoaling the dense water trapped between the wave and the slope quickly leaves its original position fig 5a d at the same time the trailing edge steepening slowly occurs without inducing any observable instability the trapped dense fluid flows downward in the adverse pressure gradient region consequently the down slope flow quickly decreases its velocity after passing the wave trough inducing the boundary layer separation beneath the shoaling wave a separation bubble forms close to the bottom fig 5d the turbulent structure quickly gives rise to an anticlockwise motion that causes a large amount of mixing in the breaking location fig 5e f plunging breaking mechanism takes place when the overturning develops due to a dominant steepening of the trailing edge of the wave fig 6 during the shoaling a plunging breaker steepens the trailing edge that quickly overturns fig 6a c at the same time the dense fluid trapped between the wave and the sloping bottom leaves its position slowly and not completely when the rear edge overturning occurs a large amount of dense fluid separates the wave from the sloping boundary yet fig 6d during the plunging process mixing is confined within the body of the water column at the breaking location the clockwise vortex fig 9e is initially detached from the sloping boundary then it propagates onshore toward the sloping bottom gradually losing its energy fig 6f an intermediate breaking mechanism i e collapsing plunging breakers fig 7 a b is observed in the breaking location where the contemporary formation of a clockwise vortex within the body of the fluid and a separation bubble close to the bottom fig 7c d this causes a large amount of mixing because of the double motion at the breaking location fig 7e f finally another kind of breaking can be observed in this case neither the steepening of the trailing edge nor the downward motion of the water volume confined below the right tail causes the development of any kind of instability fig 8 a c as shown in fig 8d f when the trough of the wave reaches the sloping boundary a second kind of instabilities occur composed by a gravity current flowing up the slope lombardi et al 2015 ottolenghi et al 2014 2017 this kind of breaking refers to the surging breakers a quantitative analysis of the shoaling phase behind the breaking processes follows in the next section this allows defining the parameters that properly link breaker types with their shoaling conditions 4 2 characterization of the shoaling processes the occurrence of different breaking mechanisms depends directly on the wave evolution over the slope region we therefore parametrized the two main processes that characterize the shoaling phase the steepening of the trailing edge of the wave i e rear front of the isw and the downward i e upstream motion of the volume confined between the leading edge of the wave and the sloping boundary fig 1d we evaluated the instantaneous trailing edge steepening by the decrease of the angle α defined between the line perpendicular to the sloping boundary and the rear edge slope fig 1d the latter is calculated as the derivative of the isw profile at the midpoint m between the wave through and the final point of the trailing edge fig 1d to characterize the downward motion of the dense fluid confined between the wave and the sloping boundary we investigated the evolution of the volume vt identified by the trapped dense fluid between the wave and the slope this volume is instantaneously evaluated starting from the segment between the wave trough t and its vertical projection on the bottom t for four runs characterized by different breaking mechanisms we analyzed the evolution of the two dimensionless parameters α α0 and vt vt0 for those runs we estimated the total time of the shoaling process ti which starts when the wave begins to modify its isometric features because of the presence of the slope the values of α0 and vt0 refer to the initial shoaling time wave shoaling lasts until any discontinuity of the pycnocline i e the isw profile do not show up we obtained the trend of α α0 fig 9 a and vt vt0 fig 9b for the four breaker types fig 10 shows consecutive snapshots of the shoaling and breaking phases for the four cases after the shoaling phase i e for t ti 1 wave breaking occurs the plunging breaker presents a large initial decrease of α α0 compared to the other cases this is in accordance with the consequent breaker type characterized by the overturning of the rear edge of the wave this event begins before the leading edge is completely reclined on the sloping boundary during the overturning t ti 1 1 2 in fig 10a the upstream displacement of the vertical tracer shows that the downward motion of the denser bottom fluid below the leading edge is still occurring for the collapsing breaker the ratio α α0 remains initially unvaried because wave geometry does not change fig 9a the wavelength of the collapsing wave is indeed larger and the resulting horizontal velocity gradient assumes lower values when compared to the plunging case aghsaee et al 2010 during the shoaling of a collapsing case the decrease of the upper layer horizontal velocities and consequently the trailing edge steepening are smaller than those of the plunging case moreover about at the half of the shoaling phase the decrease of the trapped volume is larger for the plunging breaker than for the collapsing one during the final stages of the shoaling these occurrences undergo a change the trailing edge of the plunging breaker quickly steepens and at the same time the trapped volume continues to decrease more slowly the edge overturning takes place before the confined volume completely leaves its original position as shown in fig 10a for the collapsing breaker the rear edge steepening occurs during the final phase of the shoaling process fig 9a the downward motion beneath the shoaling wave is the dominant process which develops with a constant speed until all the trapped dense fluid is completely expelled fig 9b while the trapped volume is almost linearly decreasing the surface from which it flows decreases fig 10b for this reason during the final phase of the shoaling process large values of the downward velocities are expected this flow evolves in the direction of the adverse pressure gradient thus the boundary layer separation is expected to occur and to be the cause of the instability generated close to the bottom for t ti 1 collapsing plunging breaking behavior is in the middle between the two previous cases fig 9 the dimensionless ratio α α0 remains initially roughly unvaried as for the collapsing breaker at t ti 0 4 it begins to decrease very quickly reaching the same trend of the plunging breaker at the end of the shoaling at the same time the decrease of the trapped volume presents a slightly marked deviation point at t ti 0 4 after which it becomes slower as the plunging breaker finally for surging breaker the main mechanism seems to be the decrease of vt vt0 a boundary layer separation induced by the downward motion would be expected this event does not take place probably because the larger amount of the confined volume leaves its original position during the initial shoaling phase when the surface defined by tt fig 1d is not small enough to induce strong downward velocities at the bottom 4 3 the breaking domains the wave shoaling analysis shows how the occurrence of a particular kind of breaking mechanisms depends on the different geometric characteristics of the incident waves compared to the sloping boundary for this reason in agreement with the works of aghsaee et al 2010 and sutherland et al 2013 two parameters are introduced the topographic slope s and the wave slope sw defined as 8 s tan θ 9 s w a λ where θ is the angle between the slope and the horizontal for all experiments the relation between these two parameters is plotted fig 12 results show that the different breaker mechanisms are located in three different regions of the domain sw s which are distinguished by means of the internal iribarren number bridges 2008 10 i r s s w 0 5 the iribarren number is a dimensionless parameter universally applied to model surface gravity waves breaker types on beaches dean and dalrymple 1991 by using the same geometric parameters many authors defined isws breaking mechanisms boegman et al 2005 aghsaee et al 2010 sutherland et al 2013 nevertheless a part from some similarities the breaking evolution of surface waves and internal waves appear rather different fig 11 shows a schematic comparison between the surface waves breaker types and the isws breaking mechanisms observed in our experiments the steepening of the wave crest characterizes spilling and plunging surface waves which usually occur for waves interacting with relative gentle slopes by increasing the slope wave steepens and a turbulent whitewater spills down the face of the wave while for steeper slopes the crest curls over and drops onto the trough of the wave for the observed isw plunging breakers present the steepening of the trailing edge such that the breaking evolves with its consequent overturning for even steeper slopes both for internal and for surface waves the collapsing mechanism occur this results in an instability evolving close to the bottom finally for very steep sloping boundaries surging breakers are observed for surface waves a rapid movement of the base of the wave and the disappearance of the wave crest occur the wave almost does not break and a little whitewater forms for isws surging breakers the instabilities result in a gravity current flowing upward the incline after the wave trough touches the sloping boundary we can conclude that the main similarities between surface and internal breaking waves are the edge steepening for plunging breakers and the location of the breaking for collapsing and surging breakers in our experiments collapsing breakers are observed for values of sw 0 5 1 5 s and in particular for ir 1 1 5 for gentler slopes and or for larger wave slope plunging breakers develop fig 11 they are observed for sw 0 5 s i e ir 1 finally the collapsing plunging case occurs for sw 0 5 s since under these conditions the two main breaking processes simultaneously are observed runs 49 54 fig 12 are performed in order to investigate the breaking effect of plunging breakers for these runs the density field is obtained by image analysis we obtained the domain of the different breaking regimes by using a definition of characteristic wavelength based on a theoretical approach by using the empirical relation developed in section 3 it is possible to set the proper experimental setting that generates the desired wave and in particular to choose the appropriate values of the sloping boundary in order to induce for each designed wave a particular breaking mechanism 5 plunging breakers the case of the messina strait the messina strait separates the sicily island from the italian peninsula and represents the connection between the tyrrhenian sea in the north and the ionian sea in the south the center of the strait presents a shallow sill here the maximum water depth is about 80 m for this reason the center of the strait represents a barrier to the water exchange between the two seas the phase opposition of the semidiurnal tides in the thyrrenian and ionian seas generates large gradients of tidal displacements brandt et al 1999 the interaction between these gradients and the topography features of the strait gives rise to strong tidal currents alpers et al 1996 during northward southward tidal flow the ionian tyrrhenian waters overflowing the sill spills into the tyrrhenian ionian sea because of the different stratification that characterizes the two seas vercelli 1925 nonlinear internal solitary waves of depression form and propagate from the strait towards the north south in the tyrrhenian ionian sea nicolò and salusti 1991 sapia and salusti 1987 fig 13 shows the topography of the north part of the strait where the presence of a second sill forms a bottom with a slope sm 0 075 marullo and santoleri 1986 alpers et al 2008 show the density and velocity fields induced by a nonlinear internal wave packet composed by three solitary waves of depression propagating towards the north of the strait the main wave has an amplitude am 100 m and a characteristic wavelength λm 800 m approximately the evaluation of the wave surface allows defining the wave slope value sw 0 1 the corresponding iribarren number is 0 24 a typical value of the plunging breakers to focus on the characteristic of the plunging breakers and thus to investigate the potential effects of this kind of breaking in the north of messina strait we performed seven ad hoc experiments table 3 although our experiments aim at the sole understanding of the breaking mechanisms involved in the real field rather than scaling the real field conditions our set up is based on the internal solitary waves observed in the strait of messina and the topography that constraints their evolution northward fig 13 we therefore considers a real field reduced gravity g and the iribarren number ir as obtained from brandt et al 1999 in each run a constant value of 30 kg m3 is used as density difference between the two layers in the ambient fluid region then the reduced gravity is similar to the values measured in the real field marullo and santoleri 1986 the iribarren number is always less than one thus the breaker type falls within the plunging breakers domain the analysis of the density profiles allows evaluating the effect of the breaking as direct consequence of the breaking event the pycnocline increases its thickness to specifically evaluate this phenomenon and to have a bulk evaluation of the breaking effects the region overlying the slope has been chosen as the domain of interest the domain is bounded by the free surface and the sloping boundary while its left hand side is limited by the vertical passing through the slope s toe we considered the space averaged dimensionless density profiles along the domain in order to analyze their change during each time interval before and after the breaking process for each time step we firstly evaluated the density field by image analysis obtaining all the density profiles along the water depth then we performed their horizontal average in this way we estimated the instantaneous space averaged density profile 11 ρ d ρ x y ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 12 h d y h the dimensionless densities ranging between 0 and 1 are defined in eq 11 where ρ x y is the density at each point of the domain defined by the coordinates x and y and ρ1 2 are the densities values of the two layers in the ambient fluid region before the gate removal moreover eq 12 defines the dimensionless water depths hd to quantify the effect of the breaking in terms of increase of the pycnocline thickness we compared for each run the initial and final space averaged dimensionless density profile the initial condition refers to the initial time interval immediately before the gate removal the final density profile is defined when the fluid is at rest in stable equilibrium after the breaking event therefore for each run constant values of the pycnocline thickness characterize the final condition during these experiments no secondary waves formed and the fluid reaches a stable at rest condition before the reflected wave comes back in the domain of interest fig 14 shows the change in the pycnocline thickness at two different times before the gate removal fig 14a and after the breaking event fig 14c to evaluate the pycnocline thickness we estimate the local minimum of the derivative of each density profile the breaking event induces mixing that causes the increase of the pycnocline thickness by comparing the initial and final conditions for each run we obtained as difference the increase of the pycnocline thickness δp for all the performed experiments an increase of the pycnoclines thickness occurs table 4 shows the parameters used to analyze the mixing effects in particular the ratio between the increase of the dimensionless pycnocline thickness δpt δp h and the wave slope sw is evaluated the relation between the change in the pycnocline thickness and the iribarren number is investigated fig 15 a this relation shows that the overturning of the trailing edge for two different plunging breakers with equal ratio of amplitude and wavelength cannot generate the same breaking effects the change in topographic slope affects the breaking inducing different increases of the pycnocline thickness the ratio between the dimensionless increase of the pycnocline thickness and wave slope increases with the iribarren number however this increasing trend seems to collapse for ir 0 55 suggesting a non efficient overturning in terms of mixing for values of ir that tend to the collapsing phase i e ir 1 low values of ir well describe the messina strait case the linear behavior that occurs in this region allows us to estimate the breaking effects on the pycnocline thickness in the real field where δpt is expected to range in between 0 05 and 0 1 marullo and santoleri 1986 isws propagating towards the north of the messina strait are expected to break coherently with this nonlinear behavior then for plunging breakers once the total water depth and the topographic slope are defined a particular value of wave slope sw that maximizes the increase of the pycnocline thickness exists on the other hand for a given value of total water depth and for a well defined wave in terms of amplitude and wavelength a particular value of the topographic slope maximizes the breaking effects by increasing this value the breaking event induces a wave reflection process and the mixing effects in the pycnocline region tend to fade to investigate the horizontal distribution of the pycnocline thickness the domain of interest is divided in four regions of equal length above the sloping boundary fig 16 for each zone the space averaged dimensionless density profiles are evaluated for all the performed experiments and for each zone the increases of the pycnocline δp thickness are plotted fig 15b the zone 0 refers to the ambient fluid region preceding the sloping boundary in which the increase of the pycnocline is nil or negligible by approaching the end of the tank the effect of the breaking is noticeable all this suggests that the horizontal distribution of mixing also depends on the breaking location for the performed experiments indeed the breaking location is always one zone upstream the one where the maximum increase of pycnocline thickness occurs fig 16 since a small amount of the incident wave is reflected the horizontal trend of the increase of the pycnocline thickness can be also affected by the action of the reflected wave that moves the mixed region offshore run 48 indeed shows the largest reflected wave in terms of wave surface table 4 thus we conclude that both breaking location and reflected wave features may affect the horizontal distribution of the breaking effects 6 discussion and conclusions large amplitude isws of depression are analyzed by laboratory experiments we followed the theoretical numerical approach to define the characteristic wavelength λ empirical relations between the initial setting parameters and the generated isws kinematic and geometric main features are developed and used to obtain a well defined isw in terms of amplitude characteristic wavelength and celerity the empirical relations show that the amplitude of the generated wave depends on the aspect ratio of the generating volume confined in the lock region before the gate removal moreover the generating volume strongly influences both the value of the characteristic wavelength and the wave speed when a solitary wave of depression shoals over a sloping boundary different breaking mechanisms could develop depending directly on the main processes involved during the shoaling the steepening of the trailing edge of the wave and the downward motion of the dense fluid confined between the leading edge and the sloping boundary occur these events develop differently depending on the wave geometric characteristics and on the topographic features we investigate the dimensionless parameters that characterize these processes for plunging breakers observed for ir 1 the decrease of the trailing edge slope is the predominant event the rate of decrease undergoes a sharp increase at about half of the total shoaling time the decrease of the lower layer fluid confined between the wave and the sloping boundary characterizes the collapsing mechanism 1 ir 1 5 shortly before the end of the shoaling this process becomes prominent and cause instabilities at the bottom as collapsing plunging breakers ir 1 shoal over the sloping boundary the decrease of the trapped dense volume steadily occurs while a strong rear edge overturning takes place only in the second half of the process both the events cause instabilities giving rise to a large amount of mixing for surging breakers ir 1 5 we observed only a small amount of mixing during the propagation of the interface upslope as a gravity current in this case the largest amount of the confined dense water flows offshore trough a surface not large enough to induce the boundary layer separation we also discuss the isws propagating toward the north of the messina strait these waves and topographic features suggest that plunging breakers occur in this region ir 0 24 we carried out seven runs reproducing the real field case with idealized small scale experiments the effect of the breaking is evaluated in terms of increase of the pycnocline thickness induced by the consequent mixing we noticed that both the wave reflection and the breaking locations affect the horizontal distribution of the increase of the pycnocline thickness induced by the breaking the ratio between the dimensionless increase of the pycnocline thickness and the wave slope is evaluated this parameter shows a trend strongly related with the iribarren number it increases as ir increases then it collapses when ir tends to the collapsing domain for ir 0 35 the performed experiments show an approximately linear relation between ir and the dimensionless mixed depth we infer that breaking mechanisms that occur in the north of the messina strait should generate an increase of the pycnocline thickness of 0 5 1 we investigated the plunging regime only for collapsing breakers we expect a similar behavior concerning with the relation between the iribarren number and the pycnocline thickness when the shoaling develops simultaneous instabilities as for collapsing plunging breakers we expect a more irregular trend depending on the relative contribution of the two main shoaling processes we are aware of the limitation of our experiments in terms of scaling we point out however that an increase of the reynolds number as for real field conditions would reduce the effect of boundary layer separation on wave breaking aghsaee et al 2010 and bring the system towards the plunging for the same internal iribarren number the increase of pycnocline thickness as direct consequence of the breaking of solitary internal waves plays a crucial role for the mitigation of the climate change impacts on coastal ecosystems the mixing induced by the dissipation of the wave energy affect the coastal ocean thermocline
