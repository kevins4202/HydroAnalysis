10725,in the arid region of central asia climate change leads not only to changes in water availability generated by glacier snow melt in the alpine regions but also to changes in water consumption this paper evaluates agricultural water demand and water supply represented by precipitation for the five central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan under global warming conditions of 1 5 c and 2 0 c as central asia is more sensitive to climate change compared to the global average the temperature is predicted to rise by 1 7 c and 2 6 c and precipitation to increase by 9 and 12 in global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c respectively the average crop water requirement cwr is expected to increase by 13 mm and 19 mm per year respectively under the global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c a widening gap between water supply and water demand is expected compared to the historical period 1976 2005 under global warming scenario of 2 0 c under global warming of 2 0 c the anticipated water gaps between precipitation and cwr are projected to increase by 2 8 108 m3 and 1 5 108 m3 for the rainfed north kazakhstan region and the irrigated fergana region while the increase of precipitation could able to meet the increase in cwr under global warming of 1 5 c investigating the water balance for major planting areas in water limited central asia could provide a scientific basis for sustainable development of the entire region keywords agricultural water demand 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming water balance central asia 1 introduction human induced warming reached approximately 1 0 0 2 c above pre industrial levels in 2017 increasing at 0 2 c 0 1 c per decade with high confidence ipcc 2019 climate change exacerbates the water cycle and is particularly obvious in arid inland regions as well it causes changes in snow glacier meltwater from mountain glaciers which results in changes in regional water availability and also affects water consumption and demand cai and rosegrant 2002 thomas 2008 the united nations paris agreement includes the aim of pursuing efforts to limit global warming to only 1 5 c above pre industrial levels seneviratne et al 2018 the hydrological ecological and social responses to a global warming scenario of 1 5 c and 2 c are becoming deeply concerning for scientists and society alike kraaijenbrink et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2018 central asia is a collective term denoting the five countries of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan it is located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent and spans an area of 402 8 104 km2 central asia is one of the most arid regions in the world with a unique landscape that features fragile mountain oasis desert ecosystems chen et al 2018 despite the prevailing aridity agriculture is the primary sector in central asia and about 90 of water abstractions are used by the agricultural sector with the land undergoing widespread irrigation unger shayesteh et al 2013 wwap united nations world water assessment programme 2018 unlike the humid regions irrigated agriculture is prevailing in central asia except the northern part of kazakhstan where features rainfed agriculture given the necessity for irrigation across most of central asia water is by far the most critical factor driving the economic and social development in the region agricultural productivity and profitability are relatively low across the five central asian countries this is mainly due to the prioritization of extensive production rather than of production efficiency a legacy from the policies of the former soviet union gupta et al 2009 these policies have boosted rapid expansion of irrigated areas and overuse of water resources kienzler et al 2012 unger shayesteh et al 2013 as a result the region has been experiencing severe ecological and hydrological problems since the beginning of the 20th century including critical issues such as the aral sea crisis perpetual water conflicts between neighboring countries the squeeze out of ecological water by agricultural water the drying out of the syr darya desertification and soil salinization li et al 2015 issanova et al 2017 previous studies have pointed out that the source of these problems is mainly unreasonable and excessive water use chen et al 2018 which is now intensified by unfavorable climate change due to the deleterious impacts of global warming the vulnerability of the region s water systems is steadily increasing in fact the dwindling of water resources caused by a warmer climate will likely lead to future reductions in crop yield and potential conflicts between central asian regions and countries if water demands outstrip supply chen et al 2018 the population increase across central asia is further exacerbating the lack of available water for the agricultural production energy projects and other forms of water consumption this situation is projected to become more severe with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns elliott et al 2014 several studies have investigated the responses of water resources such as glaciers snow water storage and runoff to climate change in central asia sorg et al 2012 chen et al 2016 some studies focused on drought and ecological problems e g npp and soil water content in central asia li et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 while others focused on issues around trans boundary rivers and basins normatov and petrov 2009 siegfried et al 2012 yapiyev et al 2017 however despite the dominant role of agricultural water demand in total water consumption there are relatively few studies on this topic concerning central asia karthe et al 2015 thevs et al 2015 how crop water consumption will change under predicted global warming conditions of 1 5 c and 2 0 c is a key issue in evaluating water balance and water security across the entire region considering the current water balance conditions and rising temperatures in central asia what are the expectations for changes in cwr and what are the potential situations for water resources requirement and supply to answer these questions we propose a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes and water demand changes under a range of global warming targets based on an ensemble of ten general circulation models for central asia we also analyze water demand and water availability for typical rainfed and irrigated areas 2 study area 2 1 study area central asia is located in the inland of the eurasian continent the land use data were derived from the global land cover characterization data from the international geosphere biosphere program igbp http nsidc org data ease ancillary html igbp classes along with modis from 2010 http modis gsfc nasa gov data dataprod mod12 php from these data a routine integrated classification of land use cover change lucc characteristics was obtained based on feature fusion processes a large part of the land area is grassland 67 6 of the total area followed by barren land 13 9 crop land covers about 32 00 104 km2 accounting for 8 0 of the total terrestrial area fig 1 based on the fao statistics kazakhstan has predominantly rainfed agriculture with around 20 106 ha in cultivated rainfed crops primarily in northern kazakhstan conversely the other central asian countries kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan have very little rainfed agriculture as most of the crops are grown on irrigated land http www fao org nr water aquastat irrigationmap index10 stm the main water resources in central asia come from glacier and snow meltwater in the alpine area which flows through the oasis and finally disappears in the desert or terminal lakes thus water resources are incredibly scarce for the countries located in the lower reaches of the rivers the annual internal renewable water resources of turkmenistan and uzbekistan are respectively 275 and 589 m3 inhabitant which is much lower than the global average of 1 700 m3 inhabitant according to the united nations food and agriculture organization aquastat database http www fao org nr water aquastat spatial mismatches between water generation and water consumption are the main trigger for water conflicts in the trans boundary rivers and neighboring countries based on the climate and water conditions the crop lands in central asia can be divided into rainfed farmland and irrigated lands gupta et al 2009 most of the rainfed areas are in northern kazakhstan and the mountain regions of kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan while the irrigated areas are mainly in the low lying regions of turkmenistan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan and southern kazakhstan the irrigated crop land in the lowlands relies on water diverted from the syr darya and amu darya rivers the main crops grown in the five central asian countries are wheat cotton and grains for fodder data from the kazakhstan ministry of agriculture show that the major crop in kazakhstan is spring wheat 52 3 of the crops which is mostly grown in northern kazakhstan other grains grown in the north of the country are spring barley and oats comprising 10 7 of total crops in southern kazakhstan the primary crops are winter wheat rice and cotton in kyrgyzstan wheat and barley are the main grain crops accounting for 30 and 14 respectively of the nation s crops while maize and potatoes make up less than 10 and fodder grasses cover about 25 of the sown area in tajikistan cotton 30 and wheat 36 are the primary crops along with other cereals 9 in turkmenistan cotton and grain make up about 90 of the sown area with the cotton crop decreasing in favor of cereals since 1980 the same phenomenon is also occurring in uzbekistan which saw cotton reduced from 1 9 million hectares in 1990 to 1 4 million hectares in 2006 while cereals increased from 1 0 million to 1 6 million hectares 2 2 arable land and irrigation water use in central asia in the five central asian countries rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems have supported livelihoods for millennia this region is home to some of the largest irrigation schemes in the world with around 22 million people depending directly or indirectly on irrigated agriculture bucknall et al 2003 other than for northern kazakhstan over 75 of the farmland needs to be irrigated due to the dry climate there are about 31 7 106 ha cultivated area in central asia of which 36 is irrigated table 1 about 5 3 22 1 of gdp are derived from agriculture in addition to the region s massive irrigation projects central asia features a vast network of reservoirs and dams according to the aquastat database there are more than 200 water reservoirs in central asia giving a total capacity of 176 8 km3 http www fao org nr water aquastat data 3 methodology in this study the water gaps between the cwr and effective precipitation were estimated for the current period and the 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming scenarios fig 2 as is shown in fig 2 the ncep ncar reanalysis 1 http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis html kalnay et al 1996 data were firstly bias corrected based on the measured meteorological data i e global historical climatology network daily version 3 22 then the corrected ncep data was used to bias correct the gcm outputs for both current period and global warming scenarios based on the meteorological data effective precipitation reference evapotranspiration and cwr were calculated finally the water gap between the cwr and effective precipitation were calculated for the current period and the 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming scenarios 3 1 gcm simulation ensemble for 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming climate simulations from 1976 to 2099 are based on ten state of the art general circulation models gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 for the lower emission scenario rcp4 5 and higher emission scenario rcp8 5 kawase et al 2011 fang et al 2018b the ten gcms which include both climate system models and earth system models table 2 have spatial resolutions ranging from 0 75 to 3 75 in this study we only considered maximum minimum air temperature and precipitation as stated in the ar15 reports 1 5 c or 2 0 c warming is defined as an increase in multi decadal global mean surface temperature combined land surface air and sea surface temperatures above pre industrial levels reference period 1850 1900 in this study ten gcm simulations for a 30 year period under two rcp scenarios were used to derive 1 5 c or 2 0 c global warming scenarios based on climate projections in cmip5 it is reasonable to assume that the periods 2016 2045 under rcp4 5 and 2006 2035 under rcp8 5 can be deemed as periods of 1 5 c warming while the periods 2036 2065 under rcp4 5 and 2021 2050 under rcp8 5 be considered periods of 2 0 c warming ipcc 2013 2019 3 2 bias correction of the ncep data and gcm outputs the ncep data though well performed in many regions of the world were biased in central asia region the ncep data were bias corrected before calculating et0 using linear scaling method fang et al 2015 as the gcm outputs are normally biased bias correction methods were applied to precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures using the corrected ncep as reference data all of these bias correction procedures were conducted on a daily basis from 1976 to 2005 the bias correction of gcm outputs was done on a raster basis i e grid by grid additional details on bias correction methods can be found in fang et al 2015 after applying the bias correction methods the relative changes in precipitation and absolute changes in temperature of the gcm simulations were calculated 3 3 calculation of cwr first daily data during 1976 2005 of air mean maximum minimum temperatures tmean tmax and tmin pressure relative humidity u wind v wind net shortwave radiation and net longwave radiation from the ncep ncar reanalysis 1 were collected and bias corrected the penman monteith approach recommended by the un food and agriculture organization fao was used to estimate et0 as it is widely recognized as an effective and efficient approach for calculating et0 allen et al 1998 shen et al 2013 li et al 2017 fang et al 2018a the et0 was defined and calculated based on the evapotranspiration of well watered short grass measuring 0 12 m in height with a resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 2005 the calculation was performed for each gcm on its own grid and then the calculated et0 and etc were averaged for the cropland areas the calculation of et0 was expressed as 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn mj m 2day 1 is the net daily radiation at the vegetated surface and it is the sum of shortwave radiation and long wave radiation g mj m 2day 1 is the soil heat flux which is generally assumed to be negligible for daily time steps u 2 m s 1 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height which is calculated based on u wind and v wind es kpa is saturation vapor pressure expressed as a function of tmax and tmin ea kpa is mean daily actual vapour pressure calculated using tmax tmin rhmax and rhmin δ kpa c 1 is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve and γ kpa c 1 is the psychrometric constant for detailed computation methods of these variables see mcmahon et al 2013 the etc of crop i was calculated based on the crop coefficient approach eq 2 2 etci kci et0 where etci mm and kci are crop water requirement and crop coefficient for the ith crop respectively in the current study three major crops with the largest planting area i e cotton wheat and fodder were considered other crops including barley soybeans beets potatoes and other vegetables were not separately considered crop coefficients of cotton and wheat are derived from previous studies conducted in the arid regions conrad et al 2013 liu and shen 2018 and crop coefficient of fodder was derived from fao recommendations and then adapted to the semi arid to arid conditions table 12 and box 14 allen et al 1998 cwr is the sum of etc for the entire crop growth period pereira and alves 2013 for future calculation bias corrected gcm outputs were used to calculate et0 the expected cwr was calculated based on the following assumptions a the irrigated area remains constant b the crop mix remains unchanged and c other climatic variables remain stable with the current period i e increases in evapotranspirative requirements et0 are mainly determined by increases in temperature the regional water balance of changed precipitation and changed cwr was then evaluated for the rainfed and irrigated areas 3 4 water balance calculation to address the changes in water stress of central asia we focus on changes in effective precipitation and cwr the calculation was performed on a monthly basis and then averaged to a 30 year period 3 δ w c u r r e n t c w r c u r r e n t p e c u r r e n t 4 δ w 1 5 c w r 1 5 p e 1 5 5 δ w 2 0 c w r 2 0 p e 2 0 where δ w c u r r e n t δ w 1 5 and δ w 2 0 are water balance indicators meaning the water gap between cwr and effective precipitation during the current period 1976 2005 global warming of 1 5 c or 2 0 c respectively c w r c u r r e n t and p e c u r r e n t are cwr and effective precipitation during the current period 1976 2005 c w r 1 5 p e 1 5 c w r 2 0 and p e 2 0 are the cwr and effective precipitation under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c or 2 0 c respectively effective precipitation which indicate the rainfall transferred to soil moisture could be estimated using an empirically effective utilization coefficient of rainfall which is adopted as 0 52 in our study region shen et al 2013 as this study only focuses on the agricultural area and all results presented were meant the agricultural area unless specified 4 results 4 1 future climatic changes future changes in temperature and precipitation were derived from the gcm ensemble under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for precipitation the ensemble models mean annual increases were 20 mm and 25 mm per year in 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming conditions in central asia region the relative changes in precipitation δ p ranged from 12 to 55 with an average increase of 9 under a global warming scenario of 1 5 c fig 3 with similar seasonal patterns precipitation increment is slightly more obvious under a warming scenario of 2 0 c than of 1 5 c the δ p ranged from 20 to 60 with an average increment being 12 under a global warming scenario of 2 0 c seasonally the largest precipitation increase was expected to occur in winter months as high as 20 while large uncertainty was predicted in summer months with mean precipitation changes being 12 14 18 22 and 14 17 respectively in june to august under 1 5 c 2 0 c global warming for temperature a dominating rising trend was projected by the gcm ensemble temperature was expected to increase by about 1 7 c and 2 6 c under a global warming scenario of 1 5 c and 2 0 c respectively the rise in temperature is most prominent in spring with increments being 1 8 c and 2 7 c respectively under 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming the results also indicated a more sensitive response of inland basins to global warming compared to the global average 4 2 etc for the historical period and under warming scenarios et0 demonstrates the climatic evaporative capacity with fig 4 showing the spatial variations of et0 in central asia during the historical period 1976 2005 the average annual et0 was estimated to be 800 mm for the entire central asia calculated based on the corrected ncep dataset ranging from 422 mm in the mountainous region to 1947 mm near the caspian sea low et0 values are expected to prevail in the high mountainous regions e g kyrgyzstan and tajikistan which is characterized by alpine continent climate for etc the highest value was observed in the water limited ashgabat region along the kara kum canal in southern turkmenistan and also around the aral sea region the climatic water budget p et0 was also calculated and it is high at the mountainous region and the northern kazakhstan while low in the whole uzbekistan the high etc values in uzbekistan and turkmenistan were expected due to high proportion of cotton planting area and high et0 the etc in the rainfed northern part of kazakhstan were estimated to be less than 300 mm per year while that of the irrigated fergana region could reach as high as 330 mm per year fig 4d et0 increased greatly under warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c as illustrated in fig 5 et0 showed an overall increasing trend from an average annual value of 772 mm during the control period 1976 2005 to 805 mm and 825 mm respectively under 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming scenarios the increasing et0 was more prominent under global warming of 2 0 c compared to 1 5 c seasonally et0 for spring summer and fall was projected to increase respectively by 10 mm 17 mm 13 mm 21 mm 6 mm 10 mm under global warming of 1 5 c 2 0 c scenario future changes in etc in the farmland areas of central asia were further investigated considering varying planting structure and carbon fertilization effect fig 6 during the control period the annual mean etc was estimated to be 340 mm during the growing season with the largest monthly values in may 116 mm and june 101 mm followed by july 56 mm if the planting structure keeps identical to that of the control period the etc would increase by 13 mm and 19 mm under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c respectively if not taking into account the co2 fertilization effect when considering crop pattern adjustment we assume two extreme scenarios a water saving policy replacing acreage of high water demanding crop cotton with spring wheat which led to less water consumption because wheat have smaller et 319 mm per year than cotton 500 mm per year in the region b economic priority policy replacing spring wheat by cotton to get high economic profits in addition elevated co2 concentration would inevitably influence cwr as has been observed in field experiments e g free air co2 enrichment experiment however the effects have not been quantified or even qualified considering the complex stomatal responses different water stress levels changing growth season varying cultivation density transpiration cooling effect changes in leaf area cultivars etc morison 1993 chun et al 2011 o leary et al 2015 kang et al 2017 chen et al 2019 studies concerning to future changes in crop water demand generally ignore the effects of co2 enrichment on evapotranspiration due to its high uncertainty arshad et al 2019 song et al 2019 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 the photosynthetic mechanism at elevated atmospheric co2 still remains unquantified based on current experiment results leakey et al 2006 and the responses of crop coefficient to co2 concentration rise are complex and still uncertain through experimental investigations therefore there are both possibilities that cwr in central asia might be expected to decrease or increase as the co2 level rise as explained in kimball et al 1994 thus this study assumes certain percent changes change by 20 10 based on extensive literature review of crop coefficient in response to elevated co2 concentration under future 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming table 3 this suggests that cwrs of cotton and wheat would change by 20 to 10 under warming climate it could be expected that cwr would decrease by 10 and 3 if crop coefficient decreases by 20 and 10 respectively assuming the same planting pattern under global warming scenario of 1 5 c under water saving policy the regional cwr will decrease by 2 19 regarding different response processes of crop to warming and elevated co2 concentration however under economic priority policy the regional cwr will increase dramatically by 23 59 under warming scenarios spatially the largest etc increase was detected in turkmenistan and northeastern kazakhstan with the increment larger than 25 mm note that etc increase is much larger under global warming of 2 0 c compared to 1 5 c 4 3 water balance for typical rainfed and irrigated farmland let us take the rainfed wheat production area in north central kazakhstan and the densely cultivated fergana valley irrigation zone as representative examples for analyzing the water balance of large scale agricultural systems based on the projected changes in precipitation and cwr under 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming scenarios for the rainfed wheat production area in north central kazakhstan the area is 154 241 km2 based on modis landuse data mcd12q1 and global map of irrigation areas gmia of fao precipitation amounts will increase by 21 mm and 24 mm respectively during the growing season i e april to september with effective precipitation increases 16 8 108 m3 and 19 2 108 m3 for etc it increased by 9 4 mm and 14 3 mm respectively under a global warming scenario of 1 5 c and 2 0 c which amount to 14 5 108 m3 and 22 0 108 m3 for the rainfed agricultural area the disproportionate increase in water supply and water demand will widen the gap in water availability and cwr of the rainfed north central kazakhstan to 2 8 108 m3 under global warming scenario of 2 0 c table 4 seasonally for the current period precipitation in may is estimated to be 35 mm which will increase to 37 mm and 39 mm under warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c along with the increase in temperature water demand for spring wheat in may is also projected to increase from 114 mm to 118 mm and 121 mm respectively under 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming hence the increase in water demand is larger than the incremental increase in precipitation fig 7 note that the large water demand cannot be meet by the precipitation in may posed an even greater risk to the rainfed northern kazakhstan agriculture pavlova et al 2014 for the fergana valley irrigation zone it is equipped with relatively complete irrigation facilities including dams reservoirs etc and the agricultural area is estimated to be 13 337 km2 and the production activities in this region are mainly fed by the syr darya conrad et al 2016 the increase in annual precipitation are estimated at 11 mm and 11 mm amounts to effective precipitation of 0 8 108 m3 and 0 8 108 m3 respectively in this study changes in soil water content was neglected when doing the long term water balance calculation for cwr it increased by 10 4 mm and 16 8 mm respectively under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c the gap in water availability excluding the runoff changes of the syr darya and cwr will widen by 0 5 108 m3 and 1 5 108 m3 under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 0 c table 3 in july the highest water demand month the water demand increases from 112 mm to 115 mm and 116 mm and precipitation increment is almost zero under 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming which is not obvious considering the high water demand in this area however as the runoff in the syr darya is projected to decrease to some extent in the coming decades nohara et al 2006 the water conflicts in the fergana region will likely further deteriorate 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of future climate change on cwr impact of climate change on cwr has been investigated in many regions of the world mostly focusing on the humid area cwr was expected to largely increase in the future globally fischer et al 2007 regionally the changes in cwr would show significant regional differences due to the spatial variations of future climate changes for example the cwr was projected to increase in many regions of the world e g the northeast farming region of china xu et al 2019 the lower mississippi alluvial valley yang et al 2019 the mediterranean region tanasijevic et al 2014 also the cwr decreased or kept unchanged in many regions e g the northern and central european regions lavalle et al 2009 and the rice paddy in northwest bangladesh shahid 2011 modeling of today s cwr as a function of irrigated area climate and crops provides the basis for estimating the future impact of climate change döll and siebert 2002 currently mostly studies used the crop coefficient approach based on penman monteith calculated reference evapotranspiration to calculate the cwr fischer et al 2007 yang et al 2019 levis et al 2018 however the estimated change is somewhat less sensitive to temperature compared to the hargreaves equation it is shown that the net irrigation requirement differed by 36 between the penman and hargreaves et0 methods in europe webber et al 2016 and penman monteith estimated cwr is lower than the matt shuttleworth approach in the arid and semi arid australia shuttleworth and wallace 2009 recently researchers have developed a soil water balance simulation model to estimate cwr qureshi et al 2013 5 2 impact of global warming on agricultural risk while it is widely acknowledged that global warming of 1 5 c is projected to have a broad range of climate induced negative impacts on agriculture in many regions e g sub saharan africa south east asia and central and south america ipcc 2019 this study suggests a more severe water deficit under 2 0 c global warming than 1 5 c warming for the five central asia countries featured in this work temperature in central asia is projected to increase by 1 7 c and 2 6 c compared to the control period 1976 2005 under 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming scenarios which were much higher than the global average this study estimated a widening gap between precipitation and cwr of 2 8 108 m3 and 1 5 108 m3 under a global warming scenario of 2 0 c for the rainfed north kazakhstan region and the fergana region water shortage will certainly has a large effect on crop production liu et al 2016 and in addition more drought events are expected under global warming of 2 0 c with standardized precipitation index spi decreased from 0 38 in the control period to 0 34 under global warming scenario of 2 0 c which may pose great impact for rainfed crop production in northern kazakhstan where grain production typically suffers from serious drought in two out of every five years broka et al 2016 further high temperatures in june and july also have a negative effect on agriculture in central asia with days of high temperature in july defined as daily maximum temperature exceeding 5 of historical temperature have increased from 1 5 days per year in the control period to 3 8 days and 4 8 days under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 0 c respectively the water condition is anticipated to be worse under the 2 0 c scenario than the 1 5 c scenario similar to many risk assessment studies ipcc 2019 su et al 2018 5 3 major adaption potential and uncertainties changing agricultural practices can be an effective climate adaptation strategy a diversity of adaptation options exist including mixed crop livestock production systems which can be a cost effective strategy recently central asian countries have started to realize the importance of switching from water consuming crops to water conserving crops for instance cotton and rice have comparatively high crop water consumption even though they are grown under water stressed conditions thevs et al 2015 given the region s long standing issue of physical water scarcity water conservation agriculture is expected to expand however when applying water conservation irrigation attention should be paid to the degradation of inland areas kienzler et al 2012 improving irrigation efficiency could effectively deal with changing global water endowments especially if the improvements were achieved via farmers adopting new behavior and water efficiency practices rather than through large scale infrastructure since the collapse of the soviet union water management has weakened and infrastructure maintenance has in many places come to a standstill irrigation and drainage infrastructure is beginning to fall apart and canals are silted up or damaged using the present irrigation scheduling about 20 of the water is percolated out of the root zone pereira et al 2009 and the average efficiency of canal water delivery systems is only 15 20 compared to 70 90 in most developed countries in this study the uncertainty lies largely in the projected changes in precipitation and temperature as the gcm uncertainty is the highest in climate change impact studies fang et al 2018b though bias corrected uncertainties still existed in the ncep data considering the low spatial resolution the uncertainty in calculation of the water requirement should be noted furthermore the effectiveness of co2 fertilization is a source of major uncertainty with respect to water consumption konzmann et al 2013 o leary et al 2015 investigations showed that warming by 2 c outweighs co2 enrichment to 500 ppm on water use efficiency of wheat wang et al 2018 this may be the only positive effect of global warming on the agricultural system elliott et al 2014 this study suggested that a decrease of 10 in crop coefficient in penman monteith would basically offset the warming by 2 c table 3 under current conditions with slightly increased precipitation and increased available water it may technically be possible to increase the planting area in rainfed zones which is revealed by the re intensification of agricultural land during the last decade malsy et al 2015 however it may not be economical to do so due to the cost of planting relative to the potential increase in production additional socio economic issues such as transboundary disputes on appropriate river discharge rates will continue to be a problem in many arid regions the willingness of farmers to change their current planting strategy is also a concern regarding the water supply it is still not clear if river runoff will increase in the near future however it is predicted that under a warmer climate the runoff peak will shift forward by 30 60 days changing from the current spring early summer into a late winter early spring runoff regime siegfried et al 2012 this will increase water stress in unregulated catchments because less water will be available for irrigation during the summer months this issue implies that the construction of mountainous reservoirs would add management flexibility to the summer irrigation season and make better use of the abundant snow melt water compared to reservoirs located in the oasis area the evaporative water consumption of mountain reservoirs is much lower and water storage and regulations are more effective numerical modelling of runoff under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c in the headwater catchment of syr darya is needed to shed light on past and future changes in glacial runoff and on dating the tipping point sorg et al 2012 nevertheless considerable uncertainties regarding the future evolution of water availability and water demand will likely remain sorg et al 2014 6 conclusions we investigated water balance estimations in the water limited central asian region under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c based on projected precipitation and temperature changes increments in precipitation and water demand were evaluated precipitation is expected to increase by 9 1 and 11 6 and temperature will rise by 1 7 c and 2 6 c under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 0 c these projections indicate a more sensitive response of the eurasian inland to climate change compared to the global average furthermore a widening gap between water supply represented by precipitation and water demand is anticipated compared to the historical period 1976 2005 the water deficit under global warming of 2 0 c is much larger than that under 1 5 c for both the rainfed north kazakhstan area and irrigated fergana region global warming will further intensify the current regional water conflicts in central asia and may lead to a food shortage if the present trends of increasing population and dietary changes consumption of more protein and meat continue in addition to the projected climate change agriculture is also expected to suffer from extreme rainfall variability and increased drought events which will have a detrimental effect on crop yield especially in rainfed areas adaptations to predicted global warming include water conservation measures more

10725,in the arid region of central asia climate change leads not only to changes in water availability generated by glacier snow melt in the alpine regions but also to changes in water consumption this paper evaluates agricultural water demand and water supply represented by precipitation for the five central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan under global warming conditions of 1 5 c and 2 0 c as central asia is more sensitive to climate change compared to the global average the temperature is predicted to rise by 1 7 c and 2 6 c and precipitation to increase by 9 and 12 in global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c respectively the average crop water requirement cwr is expected to increase by 13 mm and 19 mm per year respectively under the global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c a widening gap between water supply and water demand is expected compared to the historical period 1976 2005 under global warming scenario of 2 0 c under global warming of 2 0 c the anticipated water gaps between precipitation and cwr are projected to increase by 2 8 108 m3 and 1 5 108 m3 for the rainfed north kazakhstan region and the irrigated fergana region while the increase of precipitation could able to meet the increase in cwr under global warming of 1 5 c investigating the water balance for major planting areas in water limited central asia could provide a scientific basis for sustainable development of the entire region keywords agricultural water demand 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming water balance central asia 1 introduction human induced warming reached approximately 1 0 0 2 c above pre industrial levels in 2017 increasing at 0 2 c 0 1 c per decade with high confidence ipcc 2019 climate change exacerbates the water cycle and is particularly obvious in arid inland regions as well it causes changes in snow glacier meltwater from mountain glaciers which results in changes in regional water availability and also affects water consumption and demand cai and rosegrant 2002 thomas 2008 the united nations paris agreement includes the aim of pursuing efforts to limit global warming to only 1 5 c above pre industrial levels seneviratne et al 2018 the hydrological ecological and social responses to a global warming scenario of 1 5 c and 2 c are becoming deeply concerning for scientists and society alike kraaijenbrink et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2018 central asia is a collective term denoting the five countries of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan it is located in the hinterland of the eurasian continent and spans an area of 402 8 104 km2 central asia is one of the most arid regions in the world with a unique landscape that features fragile mountain oasis desert ecosystems chen et al 2018 despite the prevailing aridity agriculture is the primary sector in central asia and about 90 of water abstractions are used by the agricultural sector with the land undergoing widespread irrigation unger shayesteh et al 2013 wwap united nations world water assessment programme 2018 unlike the humid regions irrigated agriculture is prevailing in central asia except the northern part of kazakhstan where features rainfed agriculture given the necessity for irrigation across most of central asia water is by far the most critical factor driving the economic and social development in the region agricultural productivity and profitability are relatively low across the five central asian countries this is mainly due to the prioritization of extensive production rather than of production efficiency a legacy from the policies of the former soviet union gupta et al 2009 these policies have boosted rapid expansion of irrigated areas and overuse of water resources kienzler et al 2012 unger shayesteh et al 2013 as a result the region has been experiencing severe ecological and hydrological problems since the beginning of the 20th century including critical issues such as the aral sea crisis perpetual water conflicts between neighboring countries the squeeze out of ecological water by agricultural water the drying out of the syr darya desertification and soil salinization li et al 2015 issanova et al 2017 previous studies have pointed out that the source of these problems is mainly unreasonable and excessive water use chen et al 2018 which is now intensified by unfavorable climate change due to the deleterious impacts of global warming the vulnerability of the region s water systems is steadily increasing in fact the dwindling of water resources caused by a warmer climate will likely lead to future reductions in crop yield and potential conflicts between central asian regions and countries if water demands outstrip supply chen et al 2018 the population increase across central asia is further exacerbating the lack of available water for the agricultural production energy projects and other forms of water consumption this situation is projected to become more severe with rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns elliott et al 2014 several studies have investigated the responses of water resources such as glaciers snow water storage and runoff to climate change in central asia sorg et al 2012 chen et al 2016 some studies focused on drought and ecological problems e g npp and soil water content in central asia li et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 while others focused on issues around trans boundary rivers and basins normatov and petrov 2009 siegfried et al 2012 yapiyev et al 2017 however despite the dominant role of agricultural water demand in total water consumption there are relatively few studies on this topic concerning central asia karthe et al 2015 thevs et al 2015 how crop water consumption will change under predicted global warming conditions of 1 5 c and 2 0 c is a key issue in evaluating water balance and water security across the entire region considering the current water balance conditions and rising temperatures in central asia what are the expectations for changes in cwr and what are the potential situations for water resources requirement and supply to answer these questions we propose a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes and water demand changes under a range of global warming targets based on an ensemble of ten general circulation models for central asia we also analyze water demand and water availability for typical rainfed and irrigated areas 2 study area 2 1 study area central asia is located in the inland of the eurasian continent the land use data were derived from the global land cover characterization data from the international geosphere biosphere program igbp http nsidc org data ease ancillary html igbp classes along with modis from 2010 http modis gsfc nasa gov data dataprod mod12 php from these data a routine integrated classification of land use cover change lucc characteristics was obtained based on feature fusion processes a large part of the land area is grassland 67 6 of the total area followed by barren land 13 9 crop land covers about 32 00 104 km2 accounting for 8 0 of the total terrestrial area fig 1 based on the fao statistics kazakhstan has predominantly rainfed agriculture with around 20 106 ha in cultivated rainfed crops primarily in northern kazakhstan conversely the other central asian countries kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan have very little rainfed agriculture as most of the crops are grown on irrigated land http www fao org nr water aquastat irrigationmap index10 stm the main water resources in central asia come from glacier and snow meltwater in the alpine area which flows through the oasis and finally disappears in the desert or terminal lakes thus water resources are incredibly scarce for the countries located in the lower reaches of the rivers the annual internal renewable water resources of turkmenistan and uzbekistan are respectively 275 and 589 m3 inhabitant which is much lower than the global average of 1 700 m3 inhabitant according to the united nations food and agriculture organization aquastat database http www fao org nr water aquastat spatial mismatches between water generation and water consumption are the main trigger for water conflicts in the trans boundary rivers and neighboring countries based on the climate and water conditions the crop lands in central asia can be divided into rainfed farmland and irrigated lands gupta et al 2009 most of the rainfed areas are in northern kazakhstan and the mountain regions of kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan while the irrigated areas are mainly in the low lying regions of turkmenistan uzbekistan kyrgyzstan tajikistan and southern kazakhstan the irrigated crop land in the lowlands relies on water diverted from the syr darya and amu darya rivers the main crops grown in the five central asian countries are wheat cotton and grains for fodder data from the kazakhstan ministry of agriculture show that the major crop in kazakhstan is spring wheat 52 3 of the crops which is mostly grown in northern kazakhstan other grains grown in the north of the country are spring barley and oats comprising 10 7 of total crops in southern kazakhstan the primary crops are winter wheat rice and cotton in kyrgyzstan wheat and barley are the main grain crops accounting for 30 and 14 respectively of the nation s crops while maize and potatoes make up less than 10 and fodder grasses cover about 25 of the sown area in tajikistan cotton 30 and wheat 36 are the primary crops along with other cereals 9 in turkmenistan cotton and grain make up about 90 of the sown area with the cotton crop decreasing in favor of cereals since 1980 the same phenomenon is also occurring in uzbekistan which saw cotton reduced from 1 9 million hectares in 1990 to 1 4 million hectares in 2006 while cereals increased from 1 0 million to 1 6 million hectares 2 2 arable land and irrigation water use in central asia in the five central asian countries rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems have supported livelihoods for millennia this region is home to some of the largest irrigation schemes in the world with around 22 million people depending directly or indirectly on irrigated agriculture bucknall et al 2003 other than for northern kazakhstan over 75 of the farmland needs to be irrigated due to the dry climate there are about 31 7 106 ha cultivated area in central asia of which 36 is irrigated table 1 about 5 3 22 1 of gdp are derived from agriculture in addition to the region s massive irrigation projects central asia features a vast network of reservoirs and dams according to the aquastat database there are more than 200 water reservoirs in central asia giving a total capacity of 176 8 km3 http www fao org nr water aquastat data 3 methodology in this study the water gaps between the cwr and effective precipitation were estimated for the current period and the 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming scenarios fig 2 as is shown in fig 2 the ncep ncar reanalysis 1 http www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis html kalnay et al 1996 data were firstly bias corrected based on the measured meteorological data i e global historical climatology network daily version 3 22 then the corrected ncep data was used to bias correct the gcm outputs for both current period and global warming scenarios based on the meteorological data effective precipitation reference evapotranspiration and cwr were calculated finally the water gap between the cwr and effective precipitation were calculated for the current period and the 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming scenarios 3 1 gcm simulation ensemble for 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming climate simulations from 1976 to 2099 are based on ten state of the art general circulation models gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 for the lower emission scenario rcp4 5 and higher emission scenario rcp8 5 kawase et al 2011 fang et al 2018b the ten gcms which include both climate system models and earth system models table 2 have spatial resolutions ranging from 0 75 to 3 75 in this study we only considered maximum minimum air temperature and precipitation as stated in the ar15 reports 1 5 c or 2 0 c warming is defined as an increase in multi decadal global mean surface temperature combined land surface air and sea surface temperatures above pre industrial levels reference period 1850 1900 in this study ten gcm simulations for a 30 year period under two rcp scenarios were used to derive 1 5 c or 2 0 c global warming scenarios based on climate projections in cmip5 it is reasonable to assume that the periods 2016 2045 under rcp4 5 and 2006 2035 under rcp8 5 can be deemed as periods of 1 5 c warming while the periods 2036 2065 under rcp4 5 and 2021 2050 under rcp8 5 be considered periods of 2 0 c warming ipcc 2013 2019 3 2 bias correction of the ncep data and gcm outputs the ncep data though well performed in many regions of the world were biased in central asia region the ncep data were bias corrected before calculating et0 using linear scaling method fang et al 2015 as the gcm outputs are normally biased bias correction methods were applied to precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures using the corrected ncep as reference data all of these bias correction procedures were conducted on a daily basis from 1976 to 2005 the bias correction of gcm outputs was done on a raster basis i e grid by grid additional details on bias correction methods can be found in fang et al 2015 after applying the bias correction methods the relative changes in precipitation and absolute changes in temperature of the gcm simulations were calculated 3 3 calculation of cwr first daily data during 1976 2005 of air mean maximum minimum temperatures tmean tmax and tmin pressure relative humidity u wind v wind net shortwave radiation and net longwave radiation from the ncep ncar reanalysis 1 were collected and bias corrected the penman monteith approach recommended by the un food and agriculture organization fao was used to estimate et0 as it is widely recognized as an effective and efficient approach for calculating et0 allen et al 1998 shen et al 2013 li et al 2017 fang et al 2018a the et0 was defined and calculated based on the evapotranspiration of well watered short grass measuring 0 12 m in height with a resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 2005 the calculation was performed for each gcm on its own grid and then the calculated et0 and etc were averaged for the cropland areas the calculation of et0 was expressed as 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn mj m 2day 1 is the net daily radiation at the vegetated surface and it is the sum of shortwave radiation and long wave radiation g mj m 2day 1 is the soil heat flux which is generally assumed to be negligible for daily time steps u 2 m s 1 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height which is calculated based on u wind and v wind es kpa is saturation vapor pressure expressed as a function of tmax and tmin ea kpa is mean daily actual vapour pressure calculated using tmax tmin rhmax and rhmin δ kpa c 1 is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve and γ kpa c 1 is the psychrometric constant for detailed computation methods of these variables see mcmahon et al 2013 the etc of crop i was calculated based on the crop coefficient approach eq 2 2 etci kci et0 where etci mm and kci are crop water requirement and crop coefficient for the ith crop respectively in the current study three major crops with the largest planting area i e cotton wheat and fodder were considered other crops including barley soybeans beets potatoes and other vegetables were not separately considered crop coefficients of cotton and wheat are derived from previous studies conducted in the arid regions conrad et al 2013 liu and shen 2018 and crop coefficient of fodder was derived from fao recommendations and then adapted to the semi arid to arid conditions table 12 and box 14 allen et al 1998 cwr is the sum of etc for the entire crop growth period pereira and alves 2013 for future calculation bias corrected gcm outputs were used to calculate et0 the expected cwr was calculated based on the following assumptions a the irrigated area remains constant b the crop mix remains unchanged and c other climatic variables remain stable with the current period i e increases in evapotranspirative requirements et0 are mainly determined by increases in temperature the regional water balance of changed precipitation and changed cwr was then evaluated for the rainfed and irrigated areas 3 4 water balance calculation to address the changes in water stress of central asia we focus on changes in effective precipitation and cwr the calculation was performed on a monthly basis and then averaged to a 30 year period 3 δ w c u r r e n t c w r c u r r e n t p e c u r r e n t 4 δ w 1 5 c w r 1 5 p e 1 5 5 δ w 2 0 c w r 2 0 p e 2 0 where δ w c u r r e n t δ w 1 5 and δ w 2 0 are water balance indicators meaning the water gap between cwr and effective precipitation during the current period 1976 2005 global warming of 1 5 c or 2 0 c respectively c w r c u r r e n t and p e c u r r e n t are cwr and effective precipitation during the current period 1976 2005 c w r 1 5 p e 1 5 c w r 2 0 and p e 2 0 are the cwr and effective precipitation under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c or 2 0 c respectively effective precipitation which indicate the rainfall transferred to soil moisture could be estimated using an empirically effective utilization coefficient of rainfall which is adopted as 0 52 in our study region shen et al 2013 as this study only focuses on the agricultural area and all results presented were meant the agricultural area unless specified 4 results 4 1 future climatic changes future changes in temperature and precipitation were derived from the gcm ensemble under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for precipitation the ensemble models mean annual increases were 20 mm and 25 mm per year in 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming conditions in central asia region the relative changes in precipitation δ p ranged from 12 to 55 with an average increase of 9 under a global warming scenario of 1 5 c fig 3 with similar seasonal patterns precipitation increment is slightly more obvious under a warming scenario of 2 0 c than of 1 5 c the δ p ranged from 20 to 60 with an average increment being 12 under a global warming scenario of 2 0 c seasonally the largest precipitation increase was expected to occur in winter months as high as 20 while large uncertainty was predicted in summer months with mean precipitation changes being 12 14 18 22 and 14 17 respectively in june to august under 1 5 c 2 0 c global warming for temperature a dominating rising trend was projected by the gcm ensemble temperature was expected to increase by about 1 7 c and 2 6 c under a global warming scenario of 1 5 c and 2 0 c respectively the rise in temperature is most prominent in spring with increments being 1 8 c and 2 7 c respectively under 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming the results also indicated a more sensitive response of inland basins to global warming compared to the global average 4 2 etc for the historical period and under warming scenarios et0 demonstrates the climatic evaporative capacity with fig 4 showing the spatial variations of et0 in central asia during the historical period 1976 2005 the average annual et0 was estimated to be 800 mm for the entire central asia calculated based on the corrected ncep dataset ranging from 422 mm in the mountainous region to 1947 mm near the caspian sea low et0 values are expected to prevail in the high mountainous regions e g kyrgyzstan and tajikistan which is characterized by alpine continent climate for etc the highest value was observed in the water limited ashgabat region along the kara kum canal in southern turkmenistan and also around the aral sea region the climatic water budget p et0 was also calculated and it is high at the mountainous region and the northern kazakhstan while low in the whole uzbekistan the high etc values in uzbekistan and turkmenistan were expected due to high proportion of cotton planting area and high et0 the etc in the rainfed northern part of kazakhstan were estimated to be less than 300 mm per year while that of the irrigated fergana region could reach as high as 330 mm per year fig 4d et0 increased greatly under warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c as illustrated in fig 5 et0 showed an overall increasing trend from an average annual value of 772 mm during the control period 1976 2005 to 805 mm and 825 mm respectively under 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming scenarios the increasing et0 was more prominent under global warming of 2 0 c compared to 1 5 c seasonally et0 for spring summer and fall was projected to increase respectively by 10 mm 17 mm 13 mm 21 mm 6 mm 10 mm under global warming of 1 5 c 2 0 c scenario future changes in etc in the farmland areas of central asia were further investigated considering varying planting structure and carbon fertilization effect fig 6 during the control period the annual mean etc was estimated to be 340 mm during the growing season with the largest monthly values in may 116 mm and june 101 mm followed by july 56 mm if the planting structure keeps identical to that of the control period the etc would increase by 13 mm and 19 mm under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c respectively if not taking into account the co2 fertilization effect when considering crop pattern adjustment we assume two extreme scenarios a water saving policy replacing acreage of high water demanding crop cotton with spring wheat which led to less water consumption because wheat have smaller et 319 mm per year than cotton 500 mm per year in the region b economic priority policy replacing spring wheat by cotton to get high economic profits in addition elevated co2 concentration would inevitably influence cwr as has been observed in field experiments e g free air co2 enrichment experiment however the effects have not been quantified or even qualified considering the complex stomatal responses different water stress levels changing growth season varying cultivation density transpiration cooling effect changes in leaf area cultivars etc morison 1993 chun et al 2011 o leary et al 2015 kang et al 2017 chen et al 2019 studies concerning to future changes in crop water demand generally ignore the effects of co2 enrichment on evapotranspiration due to its high uncertainty arshad et al 2019 song et al 2019 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 the photosynthetic mechanism at elevated atmospheric co2 still remains unquantified based on current experiment results leakey et al 2006 and the responses of crop coefficient to co2 concentration rise are complex and still uncertain through experimental investigations therefore there are both possibilities that cwr in central asia might be expected to decrease or increase as the co2 level rise as explained in kimball et al 1994 thus this study assumes certain percent changes change by 20 10 based on extensive literature review of crop coefficient in response to elevated co2 concentration under future 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming table 3 this suggests that cwrs of cotton and wheat would change by 20 to 10 under warming climate it could be expected that cwr would decrease by 10 and 3 if crop coefficient decreases by 20 and 10 respectively assuming the same planting pattern under global warming scenario of 1 5 c under water saving policy the regional cwr will decrease by 2 19 regarding different response processes of crop to warming and elevated co2 concentration however under economic priority policy the regional cwr will increase dramatically by 23 59 under warming scenarios spatially the largest etc increase was detected in turkmenistan and northeastern kazakhstan with the increment larger than 25 mm note that etc increase is much larger under global warming of 2 0 c compared to 1 5 c 4 3 water balance for typical rainfed and irrigated farmland let us take the rainfed wheat production area in north central kazakhstan and the densely cultivated fergana valley irrigation zone as representative examples for analyzing the water balance of large scale agricultural systems based on the projected changes in precipitation and cwr under 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming scenarios for the rainfed wheat production area in north central kazakhstan the area is 154 241 km2 based on modis landuse data mcd12q1 and global map of irrigation areas gmia of fao precipitation amounts will increase by 21 mm and 24 mm respectively during the growing season i e april to september with effective precipitation increases 16 8 108 m3 and 19 2 108 m3 for etc it increased by 9 4 mm and 14 3 mm respectively under a global warming scenario of 1 5 c and 2 0 c which amount to 14 5 108 m3 and 22 0 108 m3 for the rainfed agricultural area the disproportionate increase in water supply and water demand will widen the gap in water availability and cwr of the rainfed north central kazakhstan to 2 8 108 m3 under global warming scenario of 2 0 c table 4 seasonally for the current period precipitation in may is estimated to be 35 mm which will increase to 37 mm and 39 mm under warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c along with the increase in temperature water demand for spring wheat in may is also projected to increase from 114 mm to 118 mm and 121 mm respectively under 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming hence the increase in water demand is larger than the incremental increase in precipitation fig 7 note that the large water demand cannot be meet by the precipitation in may posed an even greater risk to the rainfed northern kazakhstan agriculture pavlova et al 2014 for the fergana valley irrigation zone it is equipped with relatively complete irrigation facilities including dams reservoirs etc and the agricultural area is estimated to be 13 337 km2 and the production activities in this region are mainly fed by the syr darya conrad et al 2016 the increase in annual precipitation are estimated at 11 mm and 11 mm amounts to effective precipitation of 0 8 108 m3 and 0 8 108 m3 respectively in this study changes in soil water content was neglected when doing the long term water balance calculation for cwr it increased by 10 4 mm and 16 8 mm respectively under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c the gap in water availability excluding the runoff changes of the syr darya and cwr will widen by 0 5 108 m3 and 1 5 108 m3 under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 0 c table 3 in july the highest water demand month the water demand increases from 112 mm to 115 mm and 116 mm and precipitation increment is almost zero under 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming which is not obvious considering the high water demand in this area however as the runoff in the syr darya is projected to decrease to some extent in the coming decades nohara et al 2006 the water conflicts in the fergana region will likely further deteriorate 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of future climate change on cwr impact of climate change on cwr has been investigated in many regions of the world mostly focusing on the humid area cwr was expected to largely increase in the future globally fischer et al 2007 regionally the changes in cwr would show significant regional differences due to the spatial variations of future climate changes for example the cwr was projected to increase in many regions of the world e g the northeast farming region of china xu et al 2019 the lower mississippi alluvial valley yang et al 2019 the mediterranean region tanasijevic et al 2014 also the cwr decreased or kept unchanged in many regions e g the northern and central european regions lavalle et al 2009 and the rice paddy in northwest bangladesh shahid 2011 modeling of today s cwr as a function of irrigated area climate and crops provides the basis for estimating the future impact of climate change döll and siebert 2002 currently mostly studies used the crop coefficient approach based on penman monteith calculated reference evapotranspiration to calculate the cwr fischer et al 2007 yang et al 2019 levis et al 2018 however the estimated change is somewhat less sensitive to temperature compared to the hargreaves equation it is shown that the net irrigation requirement differed by 36 between the penman and hargreaves et0 methods in europe webber et al 2016 and penman monteith estimated cwr is lower than the matt shuttleworth approach in the arid and semi arid australia shuttleworth and wallace 2009 recently researchers have developed a soil water balance simulation model to estimate cwr qureshi et al 2013 5 2 impact of global warming on agricultural risk while it is widely acknowledged that global warming of 1 5 c is projected to have a broad range of climate induced negative impacts on agriculture in many regions e g sub saharan africa south east asia and central and south america ipcc 2019 this study suggests a more severe water deficit under 2 0 c global warming than 1 5 c warming for the five central asia countries featured in this work temperature in central asia is projected to increase by 1 7 c and 2 6 c compared to the control period 1976 2005 under 1 5 c and 2 0 c global warming scenarios which were much higher than the global average this study estimated a widening gap between precipitation and cwr of 2 8 108 m3 and 1 5 108 m3 under a global warming scenario of 2 0 c for the rainfed north kazakhstan region and the fergana region water shortage will certainly has a large effect on crop production liu et al 2016 and in addition more drought events are expected under global warming of 2 0 c with standardized precipitation index spi decreased from 0 38 in the control period to 0 34 under global warming scenario of 2 0 c which may pose great impact for rainfed crop production in northern kazakhstan where grain production typically suffers from serious drought in two out of every five years broka et al 2016 further high temperatures in june and july also have a negative effect on agriculture in central asia with days of high temperature in july defined as daily maximum temperature exceeding 5 of historical temperature have increased from 1 5 days per year in the control period to 3 8 days and 4 8 days under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 0 c respectively the water condition is anticipated to be worse under the 2 0 c scenario than the 1 5 c scenario similar to many risk assessment studies ipcc 2019 su et al 2018 5 3 major adaption potential and uncertainties changing agricultural practices can be an effective climate adaptation strategy a diversity of adaptation options exist including mixed crop livestock production systems which can be a cost effective strategy recently central asian countries have started to realize the importance of switching from water consuming crops to water conserving crops for instance cotton and rice have comparatively high crop water consumption even though they are grown under water stressed conditions thevs et al 2015 given the region s long standing issue of physical water scarcity water conservation agriculture is expected to expand however when applying water conservation irrigation attention should be paid to the degradation of inland areas kienzler et al 2012 improving irrigation efficiency could effectively deal with changing global water endowments especially if the improvements were achieved via farmers adopting new behavior and water efficiency practices rather than through large scale infrastructure since the collapse of the soviet union water management has weakened and infrastructure maintenance has in many places come to a standstill irrigation and drainage infrastructure is beginning to fall apart and canals are silted up or damaged using the present irrigation scheduling about 20 of the water is percolated out of the root zone pereira et al 2009 and the average efficiency of canal water delivery systems is only 15 20 compared to 70 90 in most developed countries in this study the uncertainty lies largely in the projected changes in precipitation and temperature as the gcm uncertainty is the highest in climate change impact studies fang et al 2018b though bias corrected uncertainties still existed in the ncep data considering the low spatial resolution the uncertainty in calculation of the water requirement should be noted furthermore the effectiveness of co2 fertilization is a source of major uncertainty with respect to water consumption konzmann et al 2013 o leary et al 2015 investigations showed that warming by 2 c outweighs co2 enrichment to 500 ppm on water use efficiency of wheat wang et al 2018 this may be the only positive effect of global warming on the agricultural system elliott et al 2014 this study suggested that a decrease of 10 in crop coefficient in penman monteith would basically offset the warming by 2 c table 3 under current conditions with slightly increased precipitation and increased available water it may technically be possible to increase the planting area in rainfed zones which is revealed by the re intensification of agricultural land during the last decade malsy et al 2015 however it may not be economical to do so due to the cost of planting relative to the potential increase in production additional socio economic issues such as transboundary disputes on appropriate river discharge rates will continue to be a problem in many arid regions the willingness of farmers to change their current planting strategy is also a concern regarding the water supply it is still not clear if river runoff will increase in the near future however it is predicted that under a warmer climate the runoff peak will shift forward by 30 60 days changing from the current spring early summer into a late winter early spring runoff regime siegfried et al 2012 this will increase water stress in unregulated catchments because less water will be available for irrigation during the summer months this issue implies that the construction of mountainous reservoirs would add management flexibility to the summer irrigation season and make better use of the abundant snow melt water compared to reservoirs located in the oasis area the evaporative water consumption of mountain reservoirs is much lower and water storage and regulations are more effective numerical modelling of runoff under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c in the headwater catchment of syr darya is needed to shed light on past and future changes in glacial runoff and on dating the tipping point sorg et al 2012 nevertheless considerable uncertainties regarding the future evolution of water availability and water demand will likely remain sorg et al 2014 6 conclusions we investigated water balance estimations in the water limited central asian region under global warming scenarios of 1 5 c and 2 0 c based on projected precipitation and temperature changes increments in precipitation and water demand were evaluated precipitation is expected to increase by 9 1 and 11 6 and temperature will rise by 1 7 c and 2 6 c under global warming of 1 5 c and 2 0 c these projections indicate a more sensitive response of the eurasian inland to climate change compared to the global average furthermore a widening gap between water supply represented by precipitation and water demand is anticipated compared to the historical period 1976 2005 the water deficit under global warming of 2 0 c is much larger than that under 1 5 c for both the rainfed north kazakhstan area and irrigated fergana region global warming will further intensify the current regional water conflicts in central asia and may lead to a food shortage if the present trends of increasing population and dietary changes consumption of more protein and meat continue in addition to the projected climate change agriculture is also expected to suffer from extreme rainfall variability and increased drought events which will have a detrimental effect on crop yield especially in rainfed areas adaptations to predicted global warming include water conservation measures more

10726,assessment of agricultural drought risk is significant for risk division and management nevertheless the drought risk dynamic evolution characteristics have not been revealed to this end the agricultural drought conditions are characterized by the standardized precipitation index spi and the time scale of spi is determined based on agricultural damage data the joint return periods of various drought severities and durations under different agricultural drought scenarios are calculated by using copula functions moreover drought risk factors resilience vulnerability and exposure are also used to characterize drought risk subsequently based on the moving window the joint return period and risk factors in each window are calculated and agricultural drought dynamics are explored the pearl river basin prb is selected as a case study results indicated that 1 the 4 month most appropriate timescale for the spi in characterizing agricultural drought based on agricultural damage data in the prb 2 risk factors method is more suitable than joint return period in assessing agricultural drought risk 3 most of the prb exhibit a significant increasing agricultural drought risk while the drought risk of the pearl river delta has a decreased trend within the past 50 years generally this study show new insights into agricultural drought risk assessment thus promoting local agricultural drought preparedness and mitigation keywords agricultural dynamic risk dynamics agricultural damage data copula functions the pearl river basin 1 introduction as global climate has been growing warmer the rate of water circulation is accelerated and extreme weather events such as droughts and floods become more frequent and intense christensen and christensen 2004 aghakouchak et al 2014 huang et al 2014 huang et al 2017 guo et al 2019a b han et al 2019a ren et al 2019a xu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 the drought is triggered by a prolonged lack of water which can have devastating influences on agriculture and social economy xiao et al 2016 huang et al 2019 in the usa droughts annually have caused an average of 6 8 billion losses in agriculture keyantash and dracup 2002 zhang et al 2015a b moreover droughts resulted in the losses of economy more than us 12 billion during 1949 1995 in china qin et al 2015 xu et al 2015 chang et al 2016 ayantobo et al 2018 compared to other forms of nature disasters drought is regarded as one of the least understood and most expensive natural disasters kao and govindaraju 2010 zhang et al 2015a b therefore drought has drawn increasing attentions from hydrologists agricultural scientists ecologists and so on mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2015 drought indices have been considered as the most commonly used and significant tools in recent decades a large number of drought indices have been proposed such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 china z index czi effective drought index edi morid et al 2010 and so on it was reported that spi has widespread applicability in identifying the drought event angelidis et al 2012 yusof et al 2013 since it can compare and describe drought event during different regions and timescales cancelliere et al 2007 in addition spi is recommended to use by the world meteorological organization wmo hayes et al 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 its calculation is simple and data is easy to be obtained it is based on long term precipitation data and is calculated by fitting the time series to a probability distribution mckee et al 1993 ajaz et al 2019 only precipitation data are needed for the study therefore the spi is adopted to characterize drought in this study droughts are classified into many types for instance meteorological droughts on deficits in precipitation agricultural droughts are based on deficits in soil moisture and hydrologic droughts on deficits in streamflow and socio economic drought occur when the demand of multifarious commodities for water exceeds the supply dracup et al 1980 kao and govindaraju 2010 liu et al 2016 han et al 2019a guo et al 2020 li et al 2018 however the spi with different timescales can exert various influences of a precipitation deficit on water resources soil moisture streamflow and groundwater morid et al 2010 in general the spi at a 1 month scale is usually considered meteorological drought index 3 6 months are used to present the agricultural drought and 12 months is considered as the hydrological drought index harsch 1992 meigh et al 1999 rouault and richard 2003 lloyd hughes and saunders 2010 many previous studies have used the spi with multiple timescales to characterize different types of drought for example sepulcre canto et al 2012 detected the agricultural drought based on 3 month spi vicente serrano 2006 studied the evolution of hydrologic drought in the iberian peninsula by using 12 month timescales spi it can be seen that the time scale of spi is significant to investigate different types of drought in addition because agriculture plays an important role in the national economy the study of agricultural drought risk is of important significance nevertheless little attention was paid to the reliability of spi with appropriate time scale in characterizing agricultural drought condition hence with the aim to address the knowledge gap the agricultural damage data are applied to determine the appropriate time scale of spi thus accurately characterizing agricultural drought condition drought have multiple attributes such as duration intensity and severity and they are mutual related ganguli and reddy 2012 yusof et al 2013 the major advantage of copulas is that it can use different types of marginal distributions to describe multivariate random events and model the probabilistic dependence structure independently of marginal distributions fu and butler 2014 zhang et al 2015a b fang et al 2019a b thus copulas based joint return period have been widely applied in assessing drought risk for example liu et al 2011 employed a bivariate copula to investigate the probabilistic behaviors and analyze the risk of drought in guangdong province ganguli and reddy 2012 selected the gumbel hougaard copula to assess the risk of droughts in saurashtra and kutch region of gujarat state of india it can be seen from the above studies that drought risk assessment is a drought probability behavior currently resilience vulnerability and exposure are considered as important elements of risk for risk assessment another method based on risk factors is used for instance oliver et al 2019 studied the application of the resilience index to flash flooding events and obtained the disaster risk resilience in colima villa de alvarez mexico sun et al 2019 assessed the climate risk and vulnerability of the urban cluster in the yangtze river delta region of china based an index doyle et al 2018 analyzed the exposure and sensitivity to potential ecosystem change in the gulf of alaska it could be seen that the resilience vulnerability exposure were analyzed in the risk assessment and they were all single analysis without comprehensive assessment valiya et al 2018 analyzed the sensitivity of drought resilience vulnerability exposure to hydrologic ratios in contiguous united states guo et al 2019a guo et al 2019b assessed socioeconomic drought based on an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index it can be found that risk assessment based on risk factors has become the development trend of risk assessment but few studies have compared these two risk assessment methods thus it is necessary to study which method is more reliable to assess drought risk which is another objective of this study moreover these studies mentioned above show only a static drought risk that is calculated based on the whole series however with the global warming the hydrological stationarity may be invalid huang et al 2017 li et al 2019 it is particularly important to study the dynamic evolution characteristics of extreme hydrological events under a changing environment which can clearly show how the risks vary with sequence changes if we can understand the ability or vulnerability of a region to return to normal after a drought it will be of high importance for further revealing the risk of drought therefore in order to assess drought risk more comprehensively and objectively in this study we use risk factors resilience vulnerability and exposure to evaluate the dynamics of drought risk in the pearl river basin prb and compare it with the drought risk in the probabilistic behavior to determine which is more suitable for assessing agricultural drought risk it is of important significance to water resources management and regional sustainable development of social economy to sum up this study will comprehensively concentrate on evaluating the agricultural drought risk and its dynamics in the prb with this in mind the primary objectives of this paper are 1 to identify the appropriate time scale of the spi in characterizing agricultural drought risk 2 to select a more suitable assessment method for agricultural drought risk via comparing the results of risk assessment based on probability analysis of joint return period and characteristic analysis based on risk factors 3 to fully reveal the dynamic evolution characteristics of the agricultural drought risk in the prb in addition the paper is organized as follows introduction of the study area and data is described in section 2 the study methods are described in section 3 results and discussion are presented in section 4 and section 5 respectively the conclusions are presented in final section 2 study area and data the pearl river 102 14 115 53 e 21 31 26 49 n is located in south china and is the second largest river in china by annual discharge fig 1 the drainage area of the prb is about 4 5 10 5 km2 niu et al 2017 it is dominated by tropical and subtropical climate and includes three major tributary basins east river north river and west river the multi annual average precipitation of prb is 1525 1 mm and the annual mean temperature varies from 14 to 22 zhang et al 2012 li et al 2017 the distribution of annual precipitation is uneven and precipitation from april to september accounts for 80 of the annual total in the prb xiao et al 2016 chen et al 2017 although the prb is a humid area that has abundant precipitation severe droughts have been witnessed in the prb in recent years such as the serious droughts in south china in 2011 which has devastating impacts on the local socio economy development zhang et al 2012 what s more the prb is an economically developed region the pearl river delta prd is not only one of the most economically developed regions in china but also the cultivation of various types of agricultural cash crops occupying an important position in the whole country once droughts occur they will have a strongly adverse impact on local economy as shown in fig 1 in this study the prb is divided into seven sub regions which are the upper reach of the west river basin uwrb the middle lower reach of the west river basin mlwrb the yu river basin yrb the liu river basin lrb the north river basin nrb the east river basin erb and the pearl river delta prd respectively the daily precipitation data of 46 meteorological stations in the prb and the damage area data caused by drought from 1960 to 2015 are used in this paper among them the daily precipitation data of each station can be collected from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn data on the area damaged by drought e g the disaster and affected areas are obtained from the natural disaster database of the china planting information network http sjcx fldj agri cn moazzys zaiqing aspx in addition the sunspot numbers can be

be obtained from the noaa earth system research laboratory https www esrl noaa gov zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b han et al 2019b 3 study methods 3 1 copula function the copula function was proposed by sklar in 1959 to construct the joint distribution function of multivariate random variables sklar 1959 nelsen 2006 let f denote the joint distribution function of x 1 x 2 x n then there exists a n c o p u l a function c that satisfies zhang et al 2015a b 1 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n f n x n where if f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n are continuous then c can be uniquely determined at present the archimedean copula family including clayton frank and gumbel hougaard copulas has been widely used in hydrology particularly in the research of drought kao and govindaraju 2010 li et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the archimedean copula not only has the advantage of simple structure and calculation but also can construct joint distribution functions of various forms in addition the normal or gaussian copula and t copula are common elliptic copula functions which can fit the multiple extremum distribution and non normal structure well ganguli and reddy 2012 zhao et al 2019a ayantobo et al 2018 therefore considering the extreme nature of drought variables the archimedean copulas normal or gaussian copula and t copula are selected to calculate the probability of drought events in this study moreover the usual functions as the marginal distributions that is gamma gam exponential exp generalized pareto gp and generalized extreme gev are adopted to select the optimal marginal distribution kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse are used to select suitable marginal distribution of drought duration and severity which requires the p value higher than 0 05 and a smaller rmse as much as possible 3 2 joint drought return period in this study the dependent structure of drought duration and intensity is characterized by copula function therefore let x denote the drought duration and y the drought severity f x x and f y y are the marginal distribution functions for the random variables x and y respectively and they are represented by u and v the return period can be defined as shiau 2006 zhang et al 2015a b 1 univariate return period 2 t x e l 1 f x x f x x pr x x 3 t y e l 1 f y y f y y pr y y where e l is the average interval time of drought events 2 two dimensional joint probability and return period the formula of two dimensional joint distribution function based on copula function is expressed as follows cheng et al 2016 4 f x y p x x y y c f x x f y y c u v the probability of two dimensional joint transcendence is as follows 5 p x x y y 1 f x x f y y c f x x f y y 1 u v c u v the two dimensional joint return period including and return period and the or return period can be defined as 6 t x y a n d e l p x x y y e l 1 u v c u v 7 t x y o r e l p x x y y e l 1 c u v where t x y a n d is the return period for x x and y y and t x y o r is the return period for x x or y y 3 3 drought risk factors 1 resilience drought resilience refers to the ability of a watershed to recover from scarcity to availability state of water hoque et al 2016 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 ren et al 2019b valiya et al 2018 the resilience is defined as 8 re m i 1 m d d i where m is the number of drought d d i is the duration of each drought re is the resilience of the basin and the higher the value is the stronger the adaptability of the basin to drought 2 vulnerability drought vulnerability refers to the average loss of available water resources in a basin caused by drought valiya et al 2018 in this paper its vulnerability is calculated according to the spi and the vulnerability can be defined as sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 9 v u s p i 1 s p i m 3 exposure drought exposure refers to the diachronic proportion of drought in a certain period of time liu et al 2013 valiya et al 2018 the exposure is defined as 10 e x i 1 m d d i t d where t d is the total length of the research series in months d d i is the duration of each drought e x is drought exposure and the higher the value is the higher the drought exposure is 3 4 cross wavelet transform crossover wavelet transform is a new time frequency analysis technique based on traditional wavelet transform suppose that the two time series are x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n respectively and their crossover wavelet transform is defined as follows yu and lin 2015 11 w n x y s w n x s w n y s where w n x s and w n y s are continuous wavelet transforms of two time series x and y respectively w n y s is the complex conjugate of w n y s 4 results 4 1 identification of appropriate time scale of spi in characterizing agricultural drought the prb contains the whole guangdong province and the 95 8 of guangxi province accounting for about 95 6 of the total prb area and the two provinces have certain representativeness in addition considering the spi index has multi scale characteristic and the available drought disaster damage data are on the scale of province the correlation degree between spi series of different time scales and agricultural damage area are examined by using pearson s correlation coefficient based on the data of the disaster area and the affected area of drought in guangdong and guangxi provinces table 1 it is obviously found that the correlation coefficients between the spi series at different time scales and agricultural damage area are negative which are reasonable since the anomaly of the spi series poses adverse impacts on agriculture thus increasing agricultural damage area it is known that more severe the drought the higher the damage it can be seen clearly from table 1 that correlation coefficients between the 4 month spi and the disaster area as well as the affected area are 0 579 and 0 582 respectively which is larger than other month scales as a result the 4 month spi is determined to reliably identify the agricultural drought condition in the prb 4 2 drought risk characterized by the return period 4 2 1 static drought risk during 1961 2015 according to the classification criteria of spi drought grade formulated by the china meteorological administration spi of 1 indicates that the occurrence probability of precipitation in a certain period of time is 0 15 by using the theory of runs yevjevich et al 1967 zhang et al 2015a b and spi of 1 is selected as the threshold to capture drought events yusof et al 2013 bae et al 2019 the duration and severity of drought in seven sub regions are identified in the prb the duration and severity of drought have a high correlation which satisfies the premise of copula to construct the joint distribution function of two variables in this study drought duration and severity are arranged in a decreasing order drought duration and severity corresponding to 50 and 25 frequencies are used to represent moderate drought and severe drought scenarios in seven zones table 2 table 3 exhibits that the marginal distributions of duration are gev gam gev gam gam gp and gev and the marginal distributions of severity are gam gam gev gam gam gam and gam respectively in seven sub regions among the archimedean copula family and elliptic copula the gaussian copula is found to be the best performing copula in modeling the joint dependence structure of drought duration and severity by the ordinary least squares ols and akaike information criterion aic goodness of fit tests in seven sub regions table 4 furthermore the return periods of single variable and two variables including duration and severity in the moderate and severe drought scenarios are calculated in the seven sub regions of the prb table 5 in order to show the drought risk of the prb more clearly and intuitively we get histograms figs 2 and 3 and risk maps fig 4 based on the results of this return period as known that the smaller the return period the higher the drought risk it can be clearly seen from figs 2 and 3 that under the moderate and severe drought scenario the univariate and multivariate return periods of the drought of the mlwrb and nrb are all smaller than other regions indicating that the drought risk of the mlwrb and nrb are higher than others fig 4 exhibits the same results compared with figs 2 and 3 but it is more obvious in addition it is distinct that the univariate return period are almost the same in the two scenarios however the joint return periods have obvious difference especially in the yrb therefore it can be seen that the two variables can reflect the risk of drought more fully and the dynamic drought risk simultaneously considering drought duration and severity from 1961 to 2015 is further studied 4 2 2 dynamic drought risk simultaneously considering drought duration and severity in order to investigate the characteristics of drought risk under a changing environment the dynamic drought return period of seven sub regions in the prb under moderate and severe drought conditions are calculated based on the moving window of 31 years in this case the return period acts as a proxy for risk and the smaller its value is the higher the drought risk is it can be seen from fig 5 that the drought return period of the whole basin show overall downward trend indicating that the drought risk of the basin is increasing according to the mann kendall m k nonparametric rank correlation test ichiyanagi et al 2010 the risk change trend of seven sub regions in recent 50 years are obtained in table 6 the 5 significance level and the 1 significance level are used in this study it can clearly be found that except for prd the return period of other regions all present a downward trend especially in the uwrb and the yrb they have significant decreasing trends at different severity levels which suggests that the risk of drought in these regions have obvious increased over the last 50 years however the joint return periods of prd have increasing trends and the joint return periods of severe drought present significant upward trends which reveal that the drought condition in the prd has alleviated to some extent the above is based on the calculation of drought return period to study the variation rules of drought risk in each region of the prb and the drought risk factors can more directly reflect the risk changes therefore drought risk will be further studied through drought resilience vulnerability and exposure in section 4 3 4 3 drought risk characterized by risk factors method 4 3 1 static drought risk during 1961 2015 the drought resilience vulnerability and exposure of the seven sub regions in the prb are calculated as shown in fig 6 from eqs 8 9 and 10 it can be obtained that the risk of drought is higher in the three cases of lower resilience higher vulnerability and higher exposure and vice versa fig 6a shows that the resilience of the lrb is smallest and the uwrb is similar which indicates that the drought risks of them are high meanwhile fig 6b and c exhibit that the drought risk of the uwrb and the lrb are higher than others respectively in addition it can be seen that the prd has a higher vulnerability and exposure and its resilience is smaller which means that it also have a higher risk but for the uwrb it is different from other sub regions although it has smaller resilience and exposure the vulnerability is large according to formula 8 we know that drought resilience is negatively correlated with average duration formula 9 shows that vulnerability is positively correlated with average severity and formula 10 represents a positive correlation between exposure and drought duration as a result this suggests that the drought is a drought of small duration large severity and a few numbers that is the drought intensity is large in the uwrb it is also be found that the drought risk factors are similar in the lrb and prd so it could be concluded that the number of drought event is small in this two regions but the duration and severity are large that is the average duration and severity of drought are both larger furthermore the risk graph based on risk factors is presented as shown in fig 7 4 3 2 dynamic drought risk considering risk factors similarly the moving window of 31 years is used to study the dynamic change rules of drought risk factors in the prb as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the drought resilience shows a downward trend the vulnerability and exposure indicate upward trends as a whole which means that the risk of drought across the basin has increased over the last 50 years the trend of risk factors series is conducted by the m k nonparametric rank correlation test in seven sub regions the results are presented in table 7 it can be clearly observed that a downward trend in resilience and an upward trend in vulnerability and exposure as a whole but the exception is the prd which is consistent with the results of the dynamic return period in general compared with the dynamic research results of drought return period both of them can support each other the dynamic results indicate that the drought risk generally have increased tendency in the prb while the drought risk has decreased tendency in the prd 5 discussion 5 1 the determination of a suitable way in characterizing agricultural drought risk the drought risk is studied by return period and risk factor in the prb in order to further determine a reasonable evaluation method assessing the agricultural drought guangdong and guangxi province fig 1b are taken as the research object and the above mentioned methods are used to calculate the risk pearson s correlation coefficient is adopted to study the correlation degree between the result of risk and the damage data respectively the results are shown in the table 8 since the higher the return period is the smaller the drought risk is this paper adopted the inverse of the return period for research it can be seen from table 8 that the correlation between drought risk factors and damage data is higher than that of the inverse of the return period in two provinces among them resilience and vulnerability have a higher correlation with the agricultural damage area to some extent this indicates that risk factors are more suitable for assessing agricultural drought risk than joint return period it can be seen that the dynamic risk in the prb is increasing on the whole in this study zhao et al 2014 found consecutive dry days have significantly increased trend in this basin from 1960 to 2012 which proves the reliability of this conclusion to some extent in addition what is noteworthy in this study is that the possible reason why risk factors are more suitable for assessing agricultural drought risk than the joint return period it is well known that the calculation of the return period is essentially a probability analysis it should be noted that there is inevitable error propagation when the return period is calculated in this study if different marginal distribution function is selected for drought duration and severity the determination of joint distribution function will be affected and the return period will be different thus this is one of the important reasons for the inaccurate calculation results however risk factors resilience vulnerability and exposure are calculated based on drought duration and severity and there is no process of data fitting and optimization which will reduce the impact of uncertainty on the calculated results furthermore they have been widely used in risk assessment serre and barroca 2009 menoni et al 2012 guo et al 2019a b therefore it can be illustrated that using drought risk factors for risk assessment can improve the accuracy of results moreover the use of multiple types of marginal and joint distribution functions will also reduce the impact of uncertainty to some extent thus how different distribution functions affect the results of drought risk will be considered in future studies 5 2 the possible causes of agricultural drought risk niu 2013 found that ei oscillation enso or the indian ocean dipole iod has a relationship with the occurrence of extreme hydrological events in the prb zhao et al 2014 pointed out that the southern oscillation index soi and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are significant factors for precipitation fang et al 2019a fang et al 2019b indicated that sunspot activity has a strong relevance in the prb thus the sunspot numbers enso and pdo are selected to analysis the reason in this study and the cross wavelet transform larocca 2016 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 is used to study the links between these climate variability and the agricultural drought that is 4 month spi series of the prb according to the drought risk of the river basin the prb is divided into two parts for research one is the whole basin excluding the prd and the other is the prd region the results are exhibited in figs 9 and 10 the redder the color is the higher the correlation is the right and left arrows represent positive and negative phase relations respectively take sunspots as an example it can be observed from fig 9 that a negative relationship between sunspots and 1974 2001 series of 4 month spi over an 8 14 years band in the prb except for the prd fig 10 exhibits a negative relationship between sunspots and 1973 2000 series of 4 month spi over a 7 13 years band in the prd the same analysis is carried out for enso and pdo respectively it can be found that sunspots have the strongest links with the 4 month spi series among the three climate factors which suggests sunspots have a strong influence on agriculture drought in the prb furthermore it can be found that the results of the two regions are similar which implies the large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies caused by global warming is not dominant driver for the inconsistent risk dynamic of drought in the two regions however apart from the large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies induced by the ocean the land atmosphere feedbacks caused by the soil moisture anomaly can strongly regulate near surface heat and aridity and also stimulate the large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies remotely miralles et al 2014 berg et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2019 it is worth noting that the prd has experienced rapid urbanization resulting in significant urban heat island effect which has an important impact on regional climate chen et al 2006 wang et al 2014 found that although urbanization reduced the annual total precipitation days the total precipitation was increasing which means that urbanization has triggered more rainstorms in the prd therefore the remarkable urbanization may be one of the important reasons for the slowdown of drought risk in the prd 6 conclusion based on the daily precipitation data of 46 meteorological stations in the prb from 1960 to 2015 in this study the agricultural drought conditions are characterized by the spi and the appropriate timescale of spi is determined according to agricultural damage data the copula functions are used to obtained the joint return period under different drought scenarios moderate drought and severe drought and drought risk factors resilience vulnerability and exposure are applied to reveal the drought risk under different scenarios in addition the joint return period and risk factors in each window are calculated based on the moving window of 31 years and the agricultural drought dynamic risks are explored the main results are as follows 1 based on the agricultural damage data in guangdong and guangxi it can be found that the spi of 4 month time scale is used to monitor the agricultural drought is appropriate by pearson s correlation coefficient in the prb which provides a new idea for determining the time scale of drought index 2 from the perspective of static risk it can be found that the drought risk in the east of prb is higher than that in the west and the drought risk in the mlwrb and the nrb are higher by return period however the higher risk of the uwrb and the lrb is obtained by the risk factors it has certain reference value for the rational allocation of local water resources and the implementation of the great protection strategy of the prb 3 the dynamic risk of drought is detected in the prb by the moving window of 31 years it can be seen that the drought risk of the prb has been increasing as a whole while the drought risk of the prd has a decreased trend within the past 50 years which plays an important role in regional water resources management and planning drought prevention and mitigation 4 it can be observed that the return period of two variables are more suitable for the assessment of drought risk than the signal variable because it can describe the drought situation of the basin more comprehensively 5 the return period and risk factors are used to assess the drought risk in guangdong and guangxi provinces respectively it can be found that the correlation of risk factors is larger than the inverse of joint return period based on the basin damage area which suggests that risk factors method is more suitable than the frequency analysis based on return period in assessing agricultural drought risk

10726,assessment of agricultural drought risk is significant for risk division and management nevertheless the drought risk dynamic evolution characteristics have not been revealed to this end the agricultural drought conditions are characterized by the standardized precipitation index spi and the time scale of spi is determined based on agricultural damage data the joint return periods of various drought severities and durations under different agricultural drought scenarios are calculated by using copula functions moreover drought risk factors resilience vulnerability and exposure are also used to characterize drought risk subsequently based on the moving window the joint return period and risk factors in each window are calculated and agricultural drought dynamics are explored the pearl river basin prb is selected as a case study results indicated that 1 the 4 month most appropriate timescale for the spi in characterizing agricultural drought based on agricultural damage data in the prb 2 risk factors method is more suitable than joint return period in assessing agricultural drought risk 3 most of the prb exhibit a significant increasing agricultural drought risk while the drought risk of the pearl river delta has a decreased trend within the past 50 years generally this study show new insights into agricultural drought risk assessment thus promoting local agricultural drought preparedness and mitigation keywords agricultural dynamic risk dynamics agricultural damage data copula functions the pearl river basin 1 introduction as global climate has been growing warmer the rate of water circulation is accelerated and extreme weather events such as droughts and floods become more frequent and intense christensen and christensen 2004 aghakouchak et al 2014 huang et al 2014 huang et al 2017 guo et al 2019a b han et al 2019a ren et al 2019a xu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 the drought is triggered by a prolonged lack of water which can have devastating influences on agriculture and social economy xiao et al 2016 huang et al 2019 in the usa droughts annually have caused an average of 6 8 billion losses in agriculture keyantash and dracup 2002 zhang et al 2015a b moreover droughts resulted in the losses of economy more than us 12 billion during 1949 1995 in china qin et al 2015 xu et al 2015 chang et al 2016 ayantobo et al 2018 compared to other forms of nature disasters drought is regarded as one of the least understood and most expensive natural disasters kao and govindaraju 2010 zhang et al 2015a b therefore drought has drawn increasing attentions from hydrologists agricultural scientists ecologists and so on mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2015 drought indices have been considered as the most commonly used and significant tools in recent decades a large number of drought indices have been proposed such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 china z index czi effective drought index edi morid et al 2010 and so on it was reported that spi has widespread applicability in identifying the drought event angelidis et al 2012 yusof et al 2013 since it can compare and describe drought event during different regions and timescales cancelliere et al 2007 in addition spi is recommended to use by the world meteorological organization wmo hayes et al 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 its calculation is simple and data is easy to be obtained it is based on long term precipitation data and is calculated by fitting the time series to a probability distribution mckee et al 1993 ajaz et al 2019 only precipitation data are needed for the study therefore the spi is adopted to characterize drought in this study droughts are classified into many types for instance meteorological droughts on deficits in precipitation agricultural droughts are based on deficits in soil moisture and hydrologic droughts on deficits in streamflow and socio economic drought occur when the demand of multifarious commodities for water exceeds the supply dracup et al 1980 kao and govindaraju 2010 liu et al 2016 han et al 2019a guo et al 2020 li et al 2018 however the spi with different timescales can exert various influences of a precipitation deficit on water resources soil moisture streamflow and groundwater morid et al 2010 in general the spi at a 1 month scale is usually considered meteorological drought index 3 6 months are used to present the agricultural drought and 12 months is considered as the hydrological drought index harsch 1992 meigh et al 1999 rouault and richard 2003 lloyd hughes and saunders 2010 many previous studies have used the spi with multiple timescales to characterize different types of drought for example sepulcre canto et al 2012 detected the agricultural drought based on 3 month spi vicente serrano 2006 studied the evolution of hydrologic drought in the iberian peninsula by using 12 month timescales spi it can be seen that the time scale of spi is significant to investigate different types of drought in addition because agriculture plays an important role in the national economy the study of agricultural drought risk is of important significance nevertheless little attention was paid to the reliability of spi with appropriate time scale in characterizing agricultural drought condition hence with the aim to address the knowledge gap the agricultural damage data are applied to determine the appropriate time scale of spi thus accurately characterizing agricultural drought condition drought have multiple attributes such as duration intensity and severity and they are mutual related ganguli and reddy 2012 yusof et al 2013 the major advantage of copulas is that it can use different types of marginal distributions to describe multivariate random events and model the probabilistic dependence structure independently of marginal distributions fu and butler 2014 zhang et al 2015a b fang et al 2019a b thus copulas based joint return period have been widely applied in assessing drought risk for example liu et al 2011 employed a bivariate copula to investigate the probabilistic behaviors and analyze the risk of drought in guangdong province ganguli and reddy 2012 selected the gumbel hougaard copula to assess the risk of droughts in saurashtra and kutch region of gujarat state of india it can be seen from the above studies that drought risk assessment is a drought probability behavior currently resilience vulnerability and exposure are considered as important elements of risk for risk assessment another method based on risk factors is used for instance oliver et al 2019 studied the application of the resilience index to flash flooding events and obtained the disaster risk resilience in colima villa de alvarez mexico sun et al 2019 assessed the climate risk and vulnerability of the urban cluster in the yangtze river delta region of china based an index doyle et al 2018 analyzed the exposure and sensitivity to potential ecosystem change in the gulf of alaska it could be seen that the resilience vulnerability exposure were analyzed in the risk assessment and they were all single analysis without comprehensive assessment valiya et al 2018 analyzed the sensitivity of drought resilience vulnerability exposure to hydrologic ratios in contiguous united states guo et al 2019a guo et al 2019b assessed socioeconomic drought based on an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index it can be found that risk assessment based on risk factors has become the development trend of risk assessment but few studies have compared these two risk assessment methods thus it is necessary to study which method is more reliable to assess drought risk which is another objective of this study moreover these studies mentioned above show only a static drought risk that is calculated based on the whole series however with the global warming the hydrological stationarity may be invalid huang et al 2017 li et al 2019 it is particularly important to study the dynamic evolution characteristics of extreme hydrological events under a changing environment which can clearly show how the risks vary with sequence changes if we can understand the ability or vulnerability of a region to return to normal after a drought it will be of high importance for further revealing the risk of drought therefore in order to assess drought risk more comprehensively and objectively in this study we use risk factors resilience vulnerability and exposure to evaluate the dynamics of drought risk in the pearl river basin prb and compare it with the drought risk in the probabilistic behavior to determine which is more suitable for assessing agricultural drought risk it is of important significance to water resources management and regional sustainable development of social economy to sum up this study will comprehensively concentrate on evaluating the agricultural drought risk and its dynamics in the prb with this in mind the primary objectives of this paper are 1 to identify the appropriate time scale of the spi in characterizing agricultural drought risk 2 to select a more suitable assessment method for agricultural drought risk via comparing the results of risk assessment based on probability analysis of joint return period and characteristic analysis based on risk factors 3 to fully reveal the dynamic evolution characteristics of the agricultural drought risk in the prb in addition the paper is organized as follows introduction of the study area and data is described in section 2 the study methods are described in section 3 results and discussion are presented in section 4 and section 5 respectively the conclusions are presented in final section 2 study area and data the pearl river 102 14 115 53 e 21 31 26 49 n is located in south china and is the second largest river in china by annual discharge fig 1 the drainage area of the prb is about 4 5 10 5 km2 niu et al 2017 it is dominated by tropical and subtropical climate and includes three major tributary basins east river north river and west river the multi annual average precipitation of prb is 1525 1 mm and the annual mean temperature varies from 14 to 22 zhang et al 2012 li et al 2017 the distribution of annual precipitation is uneven and precipitation from april to september accounts for 80 of the annual total in the prb xiao et al 2016 chen et al 2017 although the prb is a humid area that has abundant precipitation severe droughts have been witnessed in the prb in recent years such as the serious droughts in south china in 2011 which has devastating impacts on the local socio economy development zhang et al 2012 what s more the prb is an economically developed region the pearl river delta prd is not only one of the most economically developed regions in china but also the cultivation of various types of agricultural cash crops occupying an important position in the whole country once droughts occur they will have a strongly adverse impact on local economy as shown in fig 1 in this study the prb is divided into seven sub regions which are the upper reach of the west river basin uwrb the middle lower reach of the west river basin mlwrb the yu river basin yrb the liu river basin lrb the north river basin nrb the east river basin erb and the pearl river delta prd respectively the daily precipitation data of 46 meteorological stations in the prb and the damage area data caused by drought from 1960 to 2015 are used in this paper among them the daily precipitation data of each station can be collected from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn data on the area damaged by drought e g the disaster and affected areas are obtained from the natural disaster database of the china planting information network http sjcx fldj agri cn moazzys zaiqing aspx in addition the sunspot numbers can be

be obtained from the noaa earth system research laboratory https www esrl noaa gov zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b han et al 2019b 3 study methods 3 1 copula function the copula function was proposed by sklar in 1959 to construct the joint distribution function of multivariate random variables sklar 1959 nelsen 2006 let f denote the joint distribution function of x 1 x 2 x n then there exists a n c o p u l a function c that satisfies zhang et al 2015a b 1 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n f n x n where if f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n are continuous then c can be uniquely determined at present the archimedean copula family including clayton frank and gumbel hougaard copulas has been widely used in hydrology particularly in the research of drought kao and govindaraju 2010 li et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the archimedean copula not only has the advantage of simple structure and calculation but also can construct joint distribution functions of various forms in addition the normal or gaussian copula and t copula are common elliptic copula functions which can fit the multiple extremum distribution and non normal structure well ganguli and reddy 2012 zhao et al 2019a ayantobo et al 2018 therefore considering the extreme nature of drought variables the archimedean copulas normal or gaussian copula and t copula are selected to calculate the probability of drought events in this study moreover the usual functions as the marginal distributions that is gamma gam exponential exp generalized pareto gp and generalized extreme gev are adopted to select the optimal marginal distribution kolmogorov smirnov k s test and root mean square error rmse are used to select suitable marginal distribution of drought duration and severity which requires the p value higher than 0 05 and a smaller rmse as much as possible 3 2 joint drought return period in this study the dependent structure of drought duration and intensity is characterized by copula function therefore let x denote the drought duration and y the drought severity f x x and f y y are the marginal distribution functions for the random variables x and y respectively and they are represented by u and v the return period can be defined as shiau 2006 zhang et al 2015a b 1 univariate return period 2 t x e l 1 f x x f x x pr x x 3 t y e l 1 f y y f y y pr y y where e l is the average interval time of drought events 2 two dimensional joint probability and return period the formula of two dimensional joint distribution function based on copula function is expressed as follows cheng et al 2016 4 f x y p x x y y c f x x f y y c u v the probability of two dimensional joint transcendence is as follows 5 p x x y y 1 f x x f y y c f x x f y y 1 u v c u v the two dimensional joint return period including and return period and the or return period can be defined as 6 t x y a n d e l p x x y y e l 1 u v c u v 7 t x y o r e l p x x y y e l 1 c u v where t x y a n d is the return period for x x and y y and t x y o r is the return period for x x or y y 3 3 drought risk factors 1 resilience drought resilience refers to the ability of a watershed to recover from scarcity to availability state of water hoque et al 2016 sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 ren et al 2019b valiya et al 2018 the resilience is defined as 8 re m i 1 m d d i where m is the number of drought d d i is the duration of each drought re is the resilience of the basin and the higher the value is the stronger the adaptability of the basin to drought 2 vulnerability drought vulnerability refers to the average loss of available water resources in a basin caused by drought valiya et al 2018 in this paper its vulnerability is calculated according to the spi and the vulnerability can be defined as sadeghi and hazbavi 2017 9 v u s p i 1 s p i m 3 exposure drought exposure refers to the diachronic proportion of drought in a certain period of time liu et al 2013 valiya et al 2018 the exposure is defined as 10 e x i 1 m d d i t d where t d is the total length of the research series in months d d i is the duration of each drought e x is drought exposure and the higher the value is the higher the drought exposure is 3 4 cross wavelet transform crossover wavelet transform is a new time frequency analysis technique based on traditional wavelet transform suppose that the two time series are x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n respectively and their crossover wavelet transform is defined as follows yu and lin 2015 11 w n x y s w n x s w n y s where w n x s and w n y s are continuous wavelet transforms of two time series x and y respectively w n y s is the complex conjugate of w n y s 4 results 4 1 identification of appropriate time scale of spi in characterizing agricultural drought the prb contains the whole guangdong province and the 95 8 of guangxi province accounting for about 95 6 of the total prb area and the two provinces have certain representativeness in addition considering the spi index has multi scale characteristic and the available drought disaster damage data are on the scale of province the correlation degree between spi series of different time scales and agricultural damage area are examined by using pearson s correlation coefficient based on the data of the disaster area and the affected area of drought in guangdong and guangxi provinces table 1 it is obviously found that the correlation coefficients between the spi series at different time scales and agricultural damage area are negative which are reasonable since the anomaly of the spi series poses adverse impacts on agriculture thus increasing agricultural damage area it is known that more severe the drought the higher the damage it can be seen clearly from table 1 that correlation coefficients between the 4 month spi and the disaster area as well as the affected area are 0 579 and 0 582 respectively which is larger than other month scales as a result the 4 month spi is determined to reliably identify the agricultural drought condition in the prb 4 2 drought risk characterized by the return period 4 2 1 static drought risk during 1961 2015 according to the classification criteria of spi drought grade formulated by the china meteorological administration spi of 1 indicates that the occurrence probability of precipitation in a certain period of time is 0 15 by using the theory of runs yevjevich et al 1967 zhang et al 2015a b and spi of 1 is selected as the threshold to capture drought events yusof et al 2013 bae et al 2019 the duration and severity of drought in seven sub regions are identified in the prb the duration and severity of drought have a high correlation which satisfies the premise of copula to construct the joint distribution function of two variables in this study drought duration and severity are arranged in a decreasing order drought duration and severity corresponding to 50 and 25 frequencies are used to represent moderate drought and severe drought scenarios in seven zones table 2 table 3 exhibits that the marginal distributions of duration are gev gam gev gam gam gp and gev and the marginal distributions of severity are gam gam gev gam gam gam and gam respectively in seven sub regions among the archimedean copula family and elliptic copula the gaussian copula is found to be the best performing copula in modeling the joint dependence structure of drought duration and severity by the ordinary least squares ols and akaike information criterion aic goodness of fit tests in seven sub regions table 4 furthermore the return periods of single variable and two variables including duration and severity in the moderate and severe drought scenarios are calculated in the seven sub regions of the prb table 5 in order to show the drought risk of the prb more clearly and intuitively we get histograms figs 2 and 3 and risk maps fig 4 based on the results of this return period as known that the smaller the return period the higher the drought risk it can be clearly seen from figs 2 and 3 that under the moderate and severe drought scenario the univariate and multivariate return periods of the drought of the mlwrb and nrb are all smaller than other regions indicating that the drought risk of the mlwrb and nrb are higher than others fig 4 exhibits the same results compared with figs 2 and 3 but it is more obvious in addition it is distinct that the univariate return period are almost the same in the two scenarios however the joint return periods have obvious difference especially in the yrb therefore it can be seen that the two variables can reflect the risk of drought more fully and the dynamic drought risk simultaneously considering drought duration and severity from 1961 to 2015 is further studied 4 2 2 dynamic drought risk simultaneously considering drought duration and severity in order to investigate the characteristics of drought risk under a changing environment the dynamic drought return period of seven sub regions in the prb under moderate and severe drought conditions are calculated based on the moving window of 31 years in this case the return period acts as a proxy for risk and the smaller its value is the higher the drought risk is it can be seen from fig 5 that the drought return period of the whole basin show overall downward trend indicating that the drought risk of the basin is increasing according to the mann kendall m k nonparametric rank correlation test ichiyanagi et al 2010 the risk change trend of seven sub regions in recent 50 years are obtained in table 6 the 5 significance level and the 1 significance level are used in this study it can clearly be found that except for prd the return period of other regions all present a downward trend especially in the uwrb and the yrb they have significant decreasing trends at different severity levels which suggests that the risk of drought in these regions have obvious increased over the last 50 years however the joint return periods of prd have increasing trends and the joint return periods of severe drought present significant upward trends which reveal that the drought condition in the prd has alleviated to some extent the above is based on the calculation of drought return period to study the variation rules of drought risk in each region of the prb and the drought risk factors can more directly reflect the risk changes therefore drought risk will be further studied through drought resilience vulnerability and exposure in section 4 3 4 3 drought risk characterized by risk factors method 4 3 1 static drought risk during 1961 2015 the drought resilience vulnerability and exposure of the seven sub regions in the prb are calculated as shown in fig 6 from eqs 8 9 and 10 it can be obtained that the risk of drought is higher in the three cases of lower resilience higher vulnerability and higher exposure and vice versa fig 6a shows that the resilience of the lrb is smallest and the uwrb is similar which indicates that the drought risks of them are high meanwhile fig 6b and c exhibit that the drought risk of the uwrb and the lrb are higher than others respectively in addition it can be seen that the prd has a higher vulnerability and exposure and its resilience is smaller which means that it also have a higher risk but for the uwrb it is different from other sub regions although it has smaller resilience and exposure the vulnerability is large according to formula 8 we know that drought resilience is negatively correlated with average duration formula 9 shows that vulnerability is positively correlated with average severity and formula 10 represents a positive correlation between exposure and drought duration as a result this suggests that the drought is a drought of small duration large severity and a few numbers that is the drought intensity is large in the uwrb it is also be found that the drought risk factors are similar in the lrb and prd so it could be concluded that the number of drought event is small in this two regions but the duration and severity are large that is the average duration and severity of drought are both larger furthermore the risk graph based on risk factors is presented as shown in fig 7 4 3 2 dynamic drought risk considering risk factors similarly the moving window of 31 years is used to study the dynamic change rules of drought risk factors in the prb as shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the drought resilience shows a downward trend the vulnerability and exposure indicate upward trends as a whole which means that the risk of drought across the basin has increased over the last 50 years the trend of risk factors series is conducted by the m k nonparametric rank correlation test in seven sub regions the results are presented in table 7 it can be clearly observed that a downward trend in resilience and an upward trend in vulnerability and exposure as a whole but the exception is the prd which is consistent with the results of the dynamic return period in general compared with the dynamic research results of drought return period both of them can support each other the dynamic results indicate that the drought risk generally have increased tendency in the prb while the drought risk has decreased tendency in the prd 5 discussion 5 1 the determination of a suitable way in characterizing agricultural drought risk the drought risk is studied by return period and risk factor in the prb in order to further determine a reasonable evaluation method assessing the agricultural drought guangdong and guangxi province fig 1b are taken as the research object and the above mentioned methods are used to calculate the risk pearson s correlation coefficient is adopted to study the correlation degree between the result of risk and the damage data respectively the results are shown in the table 8 since the higher the return period is the smaller the drought risk is this paper adopted the inverse of the return period for research it can be seen from table 8 that the correlation between drought risk factors and damage data is higher than that of the inverse of the return period in two provinces among them resilience and vulnerability have a higher correlation with the agricultural damage area to some extent this indicates that risk factors are more suitable for assessing agricultural drought risk than joint return period it can be seen that the dynamic risk in the prb is increasing on the whole in this study zhao et al 2014 found consecutive dry days have significantly increased trend in this basin from 1960 to 2012 which proves the reliability of this conclusion to some extent in addition what is noteworthy in this study is that the possible reason why risk factors are more suitable for assessing agricultural drought risk than the joint return period it is well known that the calculation of the return period is essentially a probability analysis it should be noted that there is inevitable error propagation when the return period is calculated in this study if different marginal distribution function is selected for drought duration and severity the determination of joint distribution function will be affected and the return period will be different thus this is one of the important reasons for the inaccurate calculation results however risk factors resilience vulnerability and exposure are calculated based on drought duration and severity and there is no process of data fitting and optimization which will reduce the impact of uncertainty on the calculated results furthermore they have been widely used in risk assessment serre and barroca 2009 menoni et al 2012 guo et al 2019a b therefore it can be illustrated that using drought risk factors for risk assessment can improve the accuracy of results moreover the use of multiple types of marginal and joint distribution functions will also reduce the impact of uncertainty to some extent thus how different distribution functions affect the results of drought risk will be considered in future studies 5 2 the possible causes of agricultural drought risk niu 2013 found that ei oscillation enso or the indian ocean dipole iod has a relationship with the occurrence of extreme hydrological events in the prb zhao et al 2014 pointed out that the southern oscillation index soi and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are significant factors for precipitation fang et al 2019a fang et al 2019b indicated that sunspot activity has a strong relevance in the prb thus the sunspot numbers enso and pdo are selected to analysis the reason in this study and the cross wavelet transform larocca 2016 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 is used to study the links between these climate variability and the agricultural drought that is 4 month spi series of the prb according to the drought risk of the river basin the prb is divided into two parts for research one is the whole basin excluding the prd and the other is the prd region the results are exhibited in figs 9 and 10 the redder the color is the higher the correlation is the right and left arrows represent positive and negative phase relations respectively take sunspots as an example it can be observed from fig 9 that a negative relationship between sunspots and 1974 2001 series of 4 month spi over an 8 14 years band in the prb except for the prd fig 10 exhibits a negative relationship between sunspots and 1973 2000 series of 4 month spi over a 7 13 years band in the prd the same analysis is carried out for enso and pdo respectively it can be found that sunspots have the strongest links with the 4 month spi series among the three climate factors which suggests sunspots have a strong influence on agriculture drought in the prb furthermore it can be found that the results of the two regions are similar which implies the large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies caused by global warming is not dominant driver for the inconsistent risk dynamic of drought in the two regions however apart from the large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies induced by the ocean the land atmosphere feedbacks caused by the soil moisture anomaly can strongly regulate near surface heat and aridity and also stimulate the large scale atmospheric circulation anomalies remotely miralles et al 2014 berg et al 2016 2017 zhou et al 2019 it is worth noting that the prd has experienced rapid urbanization resulting in significant urban heat island effect which has an important impact on regional climate chen et al 2006 wang et al 2014 found that although urbanization reduced the annual total precipitation days the total precipitation was increasing which means that urbanization has triggered more rainstorms in the prd therefore the remarkable urbanization may be one of the important reasons for the slowdown of drought risk in the prd 6 conclusion based on the daily precipitation data of 46 meteorological stations in the prb from 1960 to 2015 in this study the agricultural drought conditions are characterized by the spi and the appropriate timescale of spi is determined according to agricultural damage data the copula functions are used to obtained the joint return period under different drought scenarios moderate drought and severe drought and drought risk factors resilience vulnerability and exposure are applied to reveal the drought risk under different scenarios in addition the joint return period and risk factors in each window are calculated based on the moving window of 31 years and the agricultural drought dynamic risks are explored the main results are as follows 1 based on the agricultural damage data in guangdong and guangxi it can be found that the spi of 4 month time scale is used to monitor the agricultural drought is appropriate by pearson s correlation coefficient in the prb which provides a new idea for determining the time scale of drought index 2 from the perspective of static risk it can be found that the drought risk in the east of prb is higher than that in the west and the drought risk in the mlwrb and the nrb are higher by return period however the higher risk of the uwrb and the lrb is obtained by the risk factors it has certain reference value for the rational allocation of local water resources and the implementation of the great protection strategy of the prb 3 the dynamic risk of drought is detected in the prb by the moving window of 31 years it can be seen that the drought risk of the prb has been increasing as a whole while the drought risk of the prd has a decreased trend within the past 50 years which plays an important role in regional water resources management and planning drought prevention and mitigation 4 it can be observed that the return period of two variables are more suitable for the assessment of drought risk than the signal variable because it can describe the drought situation of the basin more comprehensively 5 the return period and risk factors are used to assess the drought risk in guangdong and guangxi provinces respectively it can be found that the correlation of risk factors is larger than the inverse of joint return period based on the basin damage area which suggests that risk factors method is more suitable than the frequency analysis based on return period in assessing agricultural drought risk

must adopt water management strategies and methods for crop sustainability improvement provenzano et al 2014 besides that the last two citrus census in state of sao paulo showed an increase of more than 20 000 ha of irrigated orange orchards especially under localized systems fundecitrus 2018 2017 despite its production amounts brazilian orange orchards are mostly rainfed but the numbers point out the importance of drip irrigated systems and the growth potential of irrigated citriculture this potential shows the need of efficient irrigation systems associated to water saving strategies to deal with different environmental growing conditions pires et al 2005 provenzano et al 2013 and increasing water demand annual citrus water requirement depends on the region and weather yearly variation it is important to highlight that rainfall distribution is not uniform throughout the year blain 2009 causing water deficit periods with different duration and intensity even during rainy season climate has an important influence over citrus fruit development and quality davies and albrigo 1994 temperatures below 12 13 c and lower soil water availability slow down plants metabolism and lead them to an dormancy period during winter also flowering induction could be triggered by water deficit and or lower temperatures and this fact could be related to occurrence of more than one flowering per season doorenbos and kassam 1979 pires et al 2005 as observed for pera sweet orange the main variety cultivated in sao paulo state irrigated orchards although water deficit is one of the flowering induction factors it can be critical if occurs from flowering until fruit diameter reaches 2 5 cm deficit irrigation di has been studied as a strategy for increasing water productivity consoli et al 2016 2014 important processes such as flowering fruit setting and fruit yield and quality respond differently to water stress carr 2012 therefore di effect studies in specific fruit stages pérez pérez et al 2009 2008a 2008b or in the whole season garcía tejero et al 2011 are important for better understanding of citrus response to water stress these evaluations could show strategies for water saving and fruit yield and quality improvement moreover those authors also observed changes in fruit quality under di but there was no effect pattern among their studies this fact highlights that local and crop characteristics influences citrus responses and may be considered before water management decision making several di studies for citrus occurred in semiarid regions differently of brazilian orchards which are mostly tropical considering this scenario the hypotheses are that use deficit irrigation does not reduce yield compared to full irrigation and improves fruit quality and water use efficiency in a tropical orange production region 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design weather data and crop evapotranspiration the experiment was carried out in a 6 year old commercial grove of pêra sweet orange citrus sinensis l osbeck grafted onto sunki mandarin citrus sunki hort ex tanaka in southeastern region of sao paulo state brazil 22 48 29 s 49 03 37 w the orchard was planted in 2007 and plant spacing was 6 5 2 3 m 669 plants ha 1 trial started in 2013 and it was carried out for five consecutive growing seasons until 2018 the plots consisted of three rows with 12 plants each where we evaluated the ten central trees aiming to avoid border effect the orchard was irrigated by a surface drip system and there were five treatments based on crop evapotranspiration etc estimation t100 100 etc t75 75 etc t50 50 etc t25 25 etc and t0 rainfed six replications per treatment were randomized in blocks for statistical analysis fig 1 each plot was 538 2 m² adding up to 1 6 ha of total area data of minimum and maximum air temperature relative air humidity global solar radiation and wind speed were collected by a weather station for estimating daily reference evapotranspiration eto crop evapotranspiration etc was obtained according to penman monteith method using single crop coefficient values reported from allen et al 1998 the selected value considered the percentage of ground cover of orchard soil which was evaluated twice per cycle throughout the experimental period in addition it was considered the reduction coefficient related to the use of drip irrigation according allen et al 1998 kc values during the irrigated period averaged 0 6 during 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 seasons in 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 kc was about 0 7

respectively resulting in 13 9 m3 m 3 and 6 9 m3 m 3 of water content soil water storage capacity for 0 0 6 m soil depth was 42 mm according to swrc carr 2012 reported that citrus root depth and distribution was affected by environmental conditions cultural practices and rootstocks some of the studies reported that most of citrus root concentration were up to 0 6 m deep souza et al 2008 whitney et al 1991 considering these studies and the trenches we opened at field to collect soil samples it was adopted 0 6 m as the depth where most of roots were concentrated to estimate soil water retention and for water balance water balance thornthwaite and mather 1955 was applied from january 2014 until december 2018 2 3 fertilizers and fertigation leaf and soil chemical analysis were made yearly to support fertilizer lime and gypsum applications quaggio et al 2005 van raij et al 1997 soil samples were collected at 0 0 to 0 2 m and 0 2 to 0 4 m layers about 1 0 m from plant trunk and 0 15 m from drip line in the irrigated treatments on rainfed treatment soil collection was made at the same position in relation to plant trunk we took three samples per plot totaling 30 composite soil samples leaves sampling was made between february and march at the middle third of plant canopy by taken the 3rd or 4th leaf in branches that had fruits from the main blossoming period four leaves were collected from ten middle plants of each plot two facing sunrise side and two facing sunset side 40 leaves per plot besides that season expected yield was also considered for nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k recommendations which were 200 kg n ha 1 100 kg p ha 1 and 180 kg k ha 1 in 2013 14 220 kg n ha 1 70 kg p ha 1 and 170 kg k ha 1 in 2014 15 200 kg n ha 1 70 kg p ha 1 and

around 70 gypsum was applied only if aluminum saturation was above 40 of cation exchange capacity the aim of this recommendation was to maintain conditions for high yields according chemical soil analyses quaggio et al 2005 we applied 1 5 0 5 2 5 and 1 0 ton ha 1 in the seasons 2014 15 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively no lime application was necessary in 2013 14 gypsum was applied only

harvest for ripening monitoring fruit weight total soluble solids tss titratable acidity ta and maturation index mi which is tss ta were analyzed when mi reached around 12 14 the experiment was harvested and yield was measured by weighing all fruits per plot alternate bearing index abi was calculated as abi 1 n 1 a2 a1 a2 a1 a3 a2 a3 a2 an an 1 an an 1 where n is the number of years and a1 a2 an 1 an are the yields of corresponding years pearce and doberšek urbanc 1967 water use efficiency wue was estimated by the ratio between weight of fruit produced kg and total water input irrigation plus rainfall mm by season from one harvest to the next 2 5 data analysis the occurrence of outliers homogeneity of variance normality and sample size were assessed before statistical analyses results were tested by analysis of variance and tukey s means test yield scott knott grouping test fruit quality and multivariate analysis of variance plant height and canopy volume considering α 0 05 3 results 3 1 weather data and seasonal irrigation volumes monthly maximum minimum and average temperature recorded during the five studied seasons are summarized in fig 3 air temperature starts to decrease around april forwarding to may june and july total rainfall r observed totalized 1293 1577 1438 1668 and 1067 mm respectively for the years 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 while reference evapotranspiration eto reached 1410 1181 1171 1232 and 1199 mm fig 4 in 2014 from april until october monthly r did not meet the needs crop evapotranspiration etc except for may and september fig 4 etc surpassed r in april june august and october 2015 and april july and september 2016 rain was not sufficient in 2017 only in july and september lower r volumes were observed in 2018 when compared to the years before irrigation suspension dates for flowering induction were 27 05 14 10 04 15 17 05 16 28 04 17 and restart dates were 18 07 14 20 07 15 18 07 16 19 07 17 chilling hour accumulation rainfall distribution fig 4 and variation in both reference and crop evapotranspiration led to different irrigation volumes application in each season table 1 irrigation volumes increased from 2013 14 until 2016 17 even though total rainfall also increased considering soil water storage capacity of 42 mm water balance fig 5 shows that soil deficit periods were longer when compared to just rainfall and etc monthly amounts when rainfall was higher than etc sometimes but it was not sufficient to recover soil water in soil profile 3 2 plant height and canopy volume multivariate analysis of variance manova for treatment general effect showed that plant height did not differ from each other for α 0 05 f 1 58 wilk s lambda p value 0 0710 fig 6 however multivariate contrasts between treatments indicated significant differences f 4 45 p 0 0108 comparing t100 and t0 showing that plant height did not differ among irrigated treatments but rainfed ones had smaller plants over time manova also showed that canopy volumes did not differ among treatments f 1 45 wilk s lambda p value 0 0612 fig 7 however multivariate contrast between t0 and irrigated treatments f 2 97 p 0 0442 and also contrasting t0 t25 with t50 t75 t100 f 3 05 p 0 0442 resulted in significant differences showing that t25 was more similar to t0 over time than the other irrigated treatments it is noticeable that rainfed treatment had lower plant height fig 6 and canopy volume fig 7 on the last sampling dates especially november 2017 and october 2018 and t25 showed less recovery in both height and canopy volume compared to irrigated ones considering that citrus flowering occurs only in new branches this result brings up the hypothesis that deficit irrigation as intense as 25 etc t25 could be harmful for flowering after years under this condition 3 3 yield water use efficiency and fruit quality the experiment started in 2012 13 so there was not treatments effect in this season and average yield reached 26 1 t ha 1 average yield of irrigated treatments t100 t75 t50 and t25 was about 43 4 t ha 1 in 2013 14 while rainfed t0 produced 35 2 t ha 1 despite that there were not statistical difference among them table 2 in 2014 15 the average yield was 64 1 t ha 1 for irrigated treatments significantly different from t0 with 41 4 t ha 1 in 2015 16 yield decreased for irrigated ones when compared to previous seasons however t0 increased yield until 2016 17 in this season irrigated treatments reached 73 7 t ha 1 and t0 61 9 t ha 1 with no statistical differences in the following season 2017 18 t100 t75 and t50 yielded 39 5 t ha 1 higher than t25 and t0 which averaged 26 0 t ha 1 alternate bearing index abi shows that pêra iac did not have intense variation in crop amounts year by year in this region yield obtained in 2017 18 reached values as low as those observed in the first harvest 2012 13 which had no treatment effect and t25 and t0 yield was lower than 2013 14 harvest low yield was observed in 2017 18 in this season citrus fruit borer gymnandrosoma aurantianum occurred in state of são paulo a pest which burrows fruits rind and causes its dropping water use efficiency was statistically different among treatments three out of five seasons table 2 in 2013 14 there were no statistical differences in wue as well as observed for yield despite there were not differences among irrigated treatments yield in 2014 15 t100 resulted in lower wue values compared to deficit irrigated ones and it was statistically equal to t0 in 2015 16 and 2016 17 there were not significantly differences for wue the lower wue value was observed for t0 in 2017 18 wue for t25 was significantly higher than t0 but lower than t100 t75 and t50 considering yield and wue table 2 deficit irrigation applying 50 etc showed to be an interesting strategy for increasing yield and saving water maturation curves monitoring showed the occurrence of a second flowering period for t0 fig 8 resulting in the abrupt decrease in soluble solids tss and increase in acidity ta between measuring dates of may 28th and june 30th mean fruit weight was significantly different among treatments only in the first season were it could be observed that t0 produced smaller fruits table 3 maturation index mi was significantly smaller for t0 only in 2014 15 seasons due to its second flowering it is important to highlight that the treatments were harvested at same time the higher the water deficit was among irrigated treatments t100 t75 t50 and t25 the higher tss and lower ta were in four out of five seasons table 3 when compared to rainfed t0 irrigation statistically reduced ta and tss except for 2015 16 season tss value for t25 was statistically equal to t0 in 2014 15 despite this ta was higher in t0 resulting in lower mi 4 discussion although lower rainfall volumes indicate that irrigation is necessary water management was made according to rainfall distribution and plant growth over time by adjusting crop coefficient kc lower plant height and canopy volume were observed at the beginning of the trial figs 6 and 7 explaining why irrigation volumes were lower in a dry season as 2013 14 table 1 thornthwaite and mather 1955 water balance represents rainfed condition because it considers only air temperature and rainfall but it allowed us to understand the differences in soil water availability among seasons higher reference eto and crop evapotranspiration etc occurred during citrus critical period fig 4 even in rainy seasons as 2016 17 leading to increase water volumes applied no statistical differences were observed in four out of five seasons comparing deficit irrigation treatments t75 t50 t25 to full irrigated one t100 table 2 these results corroborate with those found by garcía tejero et al 2011 who did not observe yield differences among deficit and full irrigation treatments over three seasons the authors found differences only in the fourth evaluated season when full irrigation lead to higher yield however another study found that the higher the water deficit applied the lower yield were after evaluating two seasons nagaz et al 2017 the authors verified that irrigation at 100 etc yielded more than 75 and 50 etc cumulative effect of deficit irrigation di was one of the causes of differences among treatments in fourth season garcía tejero et al 2011 another point to highlight is that this season was the driest one according to water balance thus cumulative effect of di and the drier season might have caused yield difference similar situation may have occurred in our study as season 2017 18 had lower rainfall volumes and soil water deficit for more than six months figs 4 and 5 we observed that t25 yielded as much as t0 in this situation different studies about di effect on orange trees yield emphasizes the importance of long term trials to understand its cumulative effect previous studies considered cravo lemon tree as rootstock duenhas et al 2005 tubelis et al 1992 which is drought tolerant and could influence experiments conclusions depending on rainfall distribution and or irrigation management therefore different results about deficit irrigation effect found in literature denotes the importance of studies made in different edaphoclimatic conditions rootstock scion combinations and cropping activities associated considering total yield of five years it was not observed significant difference among irrigated treatments t100 t75 t50 t25 yield achieved by t0 was 222 3 t ha 1 while under irrigation it was 271 9 t ha 1 49 6 t ha 1 or 18 3 more dividing t0 production by five seasons its mean yield was 44 5 t ha 1 season 1 yield increment due to irrigation after five harvesting years was slightly more than one rainfed like harvest 49 6 t ha 1 44 5 t ha 1 season 1 1 1 season therefore considering yield reached throughout the experiment as well as fruit quality improvements it was verified that deficit irrigation can be a suitable strategy for water saving showing interesting long term results considering etc percentages adopted in our study yield amounts variated from season to season but alternate bearing index abi found did not define alternate bearing this result agreed with tubelis et al 1992 findings who evaluated yield of pera bianchi sweet orange grafted onto clove lemon during 12 years in rainfed condition the authors did not observe alternate bearing from one year to another but that plants generally recover yield levels in two harvests after an off year garcía petillo and castel 2014 also obtained similar results after five seasons evaluating valencia orange grafted onto poncirus trifoliata abi found by the authors ranged from 0 160 to 0 289 regardless irrigation treatment applied this trend was also observed in our study which abi values ranged from 0 173 to 0 205 we found water use efficiency wue significant differences in seasons 2014 15 and 2017 18 table 2 when comparing deficit irrigation treatments di t75 t50 t25 and t100 the last season evaluated had intense soil water deficit in post flowering induction months fig 5 treatment t100 presented lower wue in season 2014 15 despite it yielded as much as di ones in 2017 18 season it was observed that t25 had lower wue as well as lower yield when compared to t100 t75 and t50 there were not significant differences in the other seasons but considering treatments yield di showed to be a suitable strategy for improving orange production with water saving consoli et al 2014 also observed wue increase when applying deficit irrigation at 75 and 50 etc combined with in partial rootzone drying in 3 yr old orange orchard with no significant differences in first harvest amounts it was also found that for 6 yr old orange orchard partial rootzone drying at 50 etc increased wue with no changes in yield consoli et al 2016 also it was found in mature orchards that di strategies did not affect wue neither yield pérez pérez et al 2009 zapata sierra and manzano agugliaro 2017 as we found in our study it is important to highlight that most of these studies evaluated only one or two crop seasons our results showed the importance of long term evaluations because of the possible relation between water availability after flowering induction and yield and wue responses even in seasons with better rainfall volumes such as 2014 15 expected average fruit weight for pera sweet orange is about 0 146 and 0 156 kg pozzan and triboni 2005 therefore irrigation management applied in the experiment allowed to reach expected values for this cultivar table 3 likewise those verified in literature bertonha et al 2004 duenhas et al 2005 tazima et al 2010 juice qualitative characteristics differences are more observed garcía tejero et al 2011 2010a pérez pérez et al 2009 than yield differences when plants are subjected to deficit irrigation however there are also reports of yield decrease when this strategy was adopted garcía tejero et al 2010b nagaz et al 2017 as well as observed in our study table 3 fig 8 more severe water deficit applied in the end of fruit ripening 55 etc may improve fruit quality by increasing ss and acidity without maturation index decreasing garcía tejero et al 2010b however the authors did not apply deficit irrigation in the whole season as in our study comparing t100 and t50 we did not found differences in fruit quality in the evaluated seasons which does not indicate the need for postponing t50 harvest this result differs from those obtained by part time deficit pérez pérez et al 2009 and whole season deficit garcía tejero et al 2011 as both studies reported that irrigation at 50 etc increased ss and ta but without modifying mi hence there was need for postponing harvest in our study deficit irrigation allowed to anticipate harvest differing from pérez pérez et al 2009 because there were no difference in mi and its values were adequate in this case fruits with lower acidity are preferable table 3 then showing t50 advantages the second flowering observed in t0 occurred probably due to rainfall distribution and air temperature variations after its main flowering occurred in 2014 irrigation restarted according to chilling hours for t100 t75 t50 and t25 in july 18th but t0 was exposed to intense drought period from august to october figs 4 and 5 resulting in fruit drop rainy days occurred in october but the volumes were not enough to keep first flowers and higher rain volumes in the end of october lead to the second flowering in t0 fruit quality characteristics evaluated one by one do not have the same responses to different irrigation volumes demonstrating the complexity of the relationships between tss ta and their responses to water applying however deficit irrigation showed to be a good alternative once it increased yield and water savings in sao paulo state southeastern region 5 conclusions deficit irrigation di at 75 50 or 25 of crop evapotranspiration etc maintained fruit yield and fruit quality when compared to full irrigation in three out of five crops when compared to rainfed di increased yield and most of the fruit quality characteristics from the weather point of view and considering water use efficiency irrigation management at 50 etc showed to be a better water saving strategy for the studied region

and bulk density of 1420 kg m 3 soil water retention curve swrc was determined according to richards pressure chamber method richards 1965 by applying different pressures ranging from 0 006 up to 1 5 mpa in soil samples at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depths three repetitions each fig 2 from swrc volumetric water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point were set to 0 01 mpa and 1 5 mpa respectively resulting in 13 9 m3 m 3 and 6 9 m3 m 3 of water content soil water storage capacity for 0 0 6 m soil depth was 42 mm according to swrc carr 2012 reported that citrus root depth and distribution was affected by environmental conditions cultural practices and rootstocks some of the studies reported that most of citrus root concentration were up to 0 6 m deep souza et al 2008 whitney et al 1991 considering these studies and the trenches we opened at field to collect soil samples it was adopted 0 6 m as the depth where most of roots were concentrated to estimate soil water retention and for water balance water balance thornthwaite and mather 1955 was applied from january 2014 until december 2018 2 3 fertilizers and fertigation leaf and soil chemical analysis were made yearly to support fertilizer lime and gypsum applications quaggio et al 2005 van raij et al 1997 soil samples were collected at 0 0 to 0 2 m and 0 2 to 0 4 m layers about 1 0 m from plant trunk and 0 15 m from drip line in the irrigated treatments on rainfed treatment soil collection was made at the same position in relation to plant trunk we took three samples per plot totaling 30 composite soil samples leaves sampling was made between february and march at the middle third of plant canopy by taken the 3rd or 4th leaf in branches that had fruits from the main blossoming period four leaves were collected from ten middle plants of each plot two facing sunrise side and two facing sunset side 40 leaves per plot besides that season expected yield was also considered for nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k recommendations which were 200 kg n ha 1 100 kg p ha 1 and 180 kg k ha 1 in 2013 14 220 kg n ha 1 70 kg p ha 1 and 170 kg k ha 1 in 2014 15 200 kg n ha 1 70 kg p ha 1 and 170 kg k ha 1 in 2015 16 220 kg n ha 1 60 kg p ha 1 and 180 kg k ha 1 in 2016 17 220 kg n ha 1 70 kg p ha 1 and 200 kg k ha 1 in 2017 18 we made lime applications to maintain soil base saturation around 70 gypsum was applied only if aluminum saturation was above 40 of cation exchange capacity the aim of this recommendation was to maintain conditions for high yields according chemical soil analyses quaggio et al 2005 we applied 1 5 0 5 2 5 and 1 0 ton ha 1 in the seasons 2014 15 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively no lime application was necessary in 2013 14 gypsum was applied only in 2014 15 0 5 ton ha 1 recommendations were the same for all the treatments calcium nitrate ca2no3 potassium chloride kcl and ammonium nitrate nh4no3 were applied by fertigation and npk 23 00 18 solid fertilizer was also used for irrigated treatments 40 n and 30 k were applied by fertigation from august to november followed by npk solid fertilizer supplying 30 n and 30 k from november to january and finally 30 n and 40 k from february to april by fertigation for rainfed treatment 40 npk was applied in october 30 in december and 30 in february all recommended phosphorus was applied in september using monoammonium phosphate 2 4 plant development yield fruit quality and water use efficiency plant height and canopy volume were measured twice a year canopy volume cvol was estimated

harvest for ripening monitoring fruit weight total soluble solids tss titratable acidity ta and maturation index mi which is tss ta were analyzed when mi reached around 12 14 the experiment was harvested and yield was measured by weighing all fruits per plot alternate bearing index abi was calculated as abi 1 n 1 a2 a1 a2 a1 a3 a2 a3 a2 an an 1 an an 1 where n is the number of years and a1

considering α 0 05 3 results 3 1 weather data and seasonal irrigation volumes monthly maximum minimum and average temperature recorded during the five studied seasons are summarized in fig 3 air temperature starts to decrease around april forwarding to may june and july total rainfall r observed totalized 1293 1577 1438 1668 and 1067 mm respectively for the years 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 while reference evapotranspiration eto reached 1410 1181 1171 1232 and 1199 mm fig 4 in 2014 from april until october monthly r did not meet the needs crop evapotranspiration etc except for may and september fig 4 etc surpassed r in april june august and october 2015 and april july and september 2016 rain was not sufficient in 2017 only in july and september lower r volumes were observed in 2018 when compared to the years before irrigation suspension dates for flowering induction were 27 05 14 10 04 15 17 05 16 28 04 17 and restart dates were 18 07 14 20 07 15 18 07 16 19 07 17 chilling hour accumulation rainfall distribution fig 4 and variation in both reference and crop evapotranspiration led to different irrigation volumes application in each season table 1 irrigation volumes increased from 2013 14 until 2016 17 even though total rainfall also increased considering soil water storage capacity of 42 mm water balance fig 5 shows that soil deficit periods were longer when compared to just rainfall and etc monthly amounts when rainfall was higher than etc sometimes but it was not sufficient to recover soil water in soil profile 3 2 plant height and canopy volume multivariate analysis of variance manova for treatment general effect showed that plant height did not differ from each other for α 0 05 f 1 58 wilk s lambda p value 0 0710 fig 6 however multivariate contrasts between treatments indicated significant differences f 4 45 p 0 0108 comparing t100 and t0 showing that plant height did not differ among irrigated treatments but rainfed ones had smaller plants over time manova also showed that canopy volumes did not differ among treatments f 1 45 wilk s lambda p value 0 0612 fig 7 however multivariate contrast between t0 and irrigated treatments f 2 97 p 0 0442 and also contrasting t0 t25 with t50 t75 t100 f 3 05 p 0 0442 resulted in significant differences showing that t25 was more similar to t0 over time than the other irrigated treatments it is noticeable that rainfed treatment had lower plant height fig 6 and canopy volume fig 7 on the last sampling dates especially november 2017 and october 2018 and t25 showed less recovery in both height and canopy volume compared to irrigated ones considering that citrus flowering occurs only in new branches this result brings up the hypothesis that deficit irrigation as intense as 25 etc t25 could be harmful for flowering after years under this condition 3 3 yield water use efficiency and fruit quality the experiment started in 2012 13 so there was not treatments effect in this season and average yield reached 26 1 t ha 1 average yield of irrigated treatments t100 t75 t50 and t25 was about 43 4 t ha 1 in 2013 14 while rainfed t0 produced 35 2 t ha 1 despite that there were not statistical difference among them table 2 in 2014 15 the average yield was 64 1 t ha 1 for irrigated treatments significantly different from t0 with 41 4 t ha 1 in 2015 16 yield decreased for irrigated ones when compared to previous seasons however t0 increased yield until 2016 17 in this season irrigated treatments reached 73 7 t ha 1 and t0 61 9 t ha 1 with no statistical differences in the following season 2017 18 t100 t75 and t50 yielded 39 5 t ha 1 higher than t25 and t0 which averaged 26 0 t ha 1 alternate bearing index abi shows that pêra iac did not have intense variation in crop amounts year by year in this region yield obtained in 2017 18 reached values as low as those observed in the first harvest 2012 13 which had no treatment effect and t25 and t0 yield was lower than 2013 14 harvest low yield was observed in 2017 18 in this season citrus fruit borer gymnandrosoma aurantianum occurred in state of são paulo a pest which burrows fruits rind and causes its dropping water use efficiency was statistically different among treatments three out of five seasons table 2 in 2013 14 there were no statistical differences in wue as well as observed for yield despite there were not differences among irrigated treatments yield in 2014 15 t100 resulted in lower wue values compared to deficit irrigated ones and it was statistically equal to t0 in 2015 16 and 2016 17 there were not significantly differences for wue the lower wue value was observed for t0 in 2017 18 wue for t25 was significantly higher than t0 but lower than t100 t75 and t50 considering yield and wue table 2 deficit irrigation applying 50 etc showed to be an interesting strategy for increasing yield and saving water maturation curves monitoring showed the occurrence of a second flowering period for t0 fig 8 resulting in the abrupt decrease in soluble solids tss and increase in acidity ta between measuring dates of may 28th and june 30th mean fruit weight was significantly different among treatments only in the first season were it could be observed that t0 produced smaller fruits table 3 maturation index mi was significantly smaller for t0 only in 2014 15 seasons due to its second flowering it is important to highlight that the treatments were harvested at same time the higher the water deficit was among irrigated treatments t100 t75 t50 and t25 the higher tss and lower ta were in four out of five seasons table 3 when compared to rainfed t0 irrigation statistically reduced ta and tss except for 2015 16 season tss value for t25 was statistically equal to t0 in 2014 15 despite this ta was higher in t0 resulting in lower mi 4 discussion although lower rainfall volumes indicate that irrigation is necessary water management was made according to rainfall distribution and plant growth over time by adjusting crop coefficient kc lower plant height and canopy volume were observed at the beginning of the trial figs 6 and 7 explaining why irrigation volumes were lower in a dry season as 2013 14 table 1 thornthwaite and mather 1955 water balance represents rainfed condition because it considers only air temperature and rainfall but it allowed us to understand the differences in soil water availability among seasons higher reference eto and crop evapotranspiration etc occurred during citrus critical period fig 4 even in rainy seasons as 2016 17 leading to increase water volumes applied no statistical differences were observed in four out of five seasons comparing deficit irrigation treatments t75 t50 t25 to full irrigated one t100 table 2 these results corroborate with those found by garcía tejero et al 2011 who did not observe yield differences among deficit and full irrigation treatments over three seasons the authors found differences only in the fourth evaluated season when full irrigation lead to higher yield however another study found that the higher the water deficit applied the lower yield were after evaluating two seasons nagaz et al 2017 the authors verified that irrigation at 100 etc yielded more than 75 and 50 etc cumulative effect of deficit irrigation di was one of the causes of differences among treatments in fourth season garcía tejero et al 2011 another point to highlight is that this season was the driest one according to water balance thus cumulative effect of di and the drier season might have caused yield difference similar situation may have occurred in our study as season 2017 18 had lower rainfall volumes and soil water deficit for more than six months figs 4 and 5 we observed that t25 yielded as much as t0 in this situation different studies about di effect on orange trees yield emphasizes the importance of long term trials to understand its cumulative effect previous studies considered cravo lemon tree as rootstock duenhas et al 2005 tubelis et al 1992 which is drought tolerant and could influence experiments conclusions depending on rainfall distribution and or irrigation management therefore different results about deficit irrigation effect found in literature denotes the importance of studies made in different edaphoclimatic conditions rootstock scion combinations and cropping activities associated considering total yield of five years it was not observed significant difference among irrigated treatments t100 t75 t50 t25 yield achieved by t0 was 222 3 t ha 1 while under irrigation it was 271 9 t ha 1 49 6 t ha 1 or 18 3 more dividing t0 production by five seasons its mean yield was 44 5 t ha 1 season 1 yield increment due to irrigation after five harvesting years was slightly more than one rainfed like harvest 49 6 t ha 1 44 5 t ha 1 season 1 1 1 season therefore considering yield reached throughout the experiment as well as fruit quality improvements it was verified that deficit irrigation can be a suitable strategy for water saving showing interesting long term results considering etc percentages adopted in our study yield amounts variated from season to season but alternate bearing index abi found did not define alternate bearing this result agreed with tubelis et al 1992 findings who evaluated yield of pera bianchi sweet orange grafted onto clove lemon during 12 years in rainfed condition the authors did not observe alternate bearing from one year to another but that plants generally recover yield levels in two harvests after an off year garcía petillo and castel 2014 also obtained similar results after five seasons evaluating valencia orange grafted onto poncirus trifoliata abi found by the authors ranged from 0 160 to 0 289 regardless irrigation treatment applied this trend was also observed in our study which abi values ranged from 0 173 to 0 205 we found water use efficiency wue significant differences in seasons 2014 15 and 2017 18 table 2 when comparing deficit irrigation treatments di t75 t50 t25 and t100 the last season evaluated had intense soil water deficit in post flowering induction months fig 5 treatment t100 presented lower wue in season 2014 15 despite it yielded as much as di ones in 2017 18 season it was observed that t25 had lower wue as well as lower yield when compared to t100 t75 and t50 there were not significant differences in the other seasons but considering treatments yield di showed to be a suitable strategy for improving orange production with water saving consoli et al 2014 also observed wue increase when applying deficit irrigation at 75 and 50 etc combined with in partial rootzone drying in 3 yr old orange orchard with no significant differences in first harvest amounts it was also found that for 6 yr old orange orchard partial rootzone drying at 50 etc increased wue with no changes in yield consoli et al 2016 also it was found in mature orchards that di strategies did not affect wue neither yield pérez pérez et al 2009 zapata sierra and manzano agugliaro 2017 as we found in our study it is important to highlight that most of these studies evaluated only one or two crop seasons our results showed the importance of long term evaluations because of the possible relation between water availability after flowering induction and yield and wue responses even in seasons with better rainfall volumes such as 2014 15 expected average fruit weight for pera sweet orange is about 0 146 and 0 156 kg pozzan and triboni 2005 therefore irrigation management applied in the experiment allowed to reach expected values for this cultivar table 3 likewise those verified in literature bertonha et al 2004 duenhas et al 2005 tazima et al 2010 juice qualitative characteristics differences are more observed garcía tejero et al 2011 2010a pérez pérez et al 2009 than yield differences when plants are subjected to deficit irrigation however there are also reports of yield decrease when this strategy was adopted garcía tejero et al 2010b nagaz et al 2017 as well as observed in our study table 3 fig 8 more severe water deficit applied in the end of fruit ripening 55 etc may improve fruit quality by increasing ss and acidity without maturation index decreasing garcía tejero et al 2010b however the authors did not apply deficit irrigation in the whole season as in our study comparing t100 and t50 we did not found differences in fruit quality in the evaluated seasons which does not indicate the need for postponing t50 harvest this result differs from those obtained by part time deficit pérez pérez et al 2009 and whole season deficit garcía tejero et al 2011 as both studies reported that irrigation at 50 etc increased ss and ta but without modifying mi hence there was need for postponing harvest in our study deficit irrigation allowed to anticipate harvest differing from pérez pérez et al 2009 because there were no difference in mi and its values were adequate in this case fruits with lower acidity are preferable table 3 then showing t50 advantages the second flowering observed in t0 occurred probably due to rainfall distribution and air temperature variations after its main flowering occurred in 2014 irrigation restarted according to chilling hours for t100 t75 t50 and t25 in july 18th but t0 was exposed to intense drought period from august to october figs 4 and 5 resulting in fruit drop rainy days occurred in october but the volumes were not enough to keep first flowers and higher rain volumes in the end of october lead to the second flowering in t0 fruit quality characteristics evaluated one by one do not have the same responses to different irrigation volumes demonstrating the complexity of the relationships between tss ta and their responses to water applying however deficit irrigation showed to be a good alternative once it increased yield and water savings in sao paulo state southeastern region 5 conclusions deficit irrigation di at 75 50 or 25 of crop evapotranspiration etc maintained fruit yield and fruit quality when compared to full irrigation in three out of five crops when compared to rainfed di increased yield and most of the fruit quality characteristics from the weather point of view and considering water use efficiency irrigation management at 50 etc showed to be a better water saving strategy for the studied region

10728,determining methods for increasing irrigation water productivity is important for sustaining high wheat grain yields in the irrigated region of the loess plateau in china plastic covered ridge and furrow planting has been widely applied in dryland farming as it markedly increases precipitation productivity and crop yields however whether this planting system can significantly increase irrigation water productivity and whether it can reduce the irrigation volume for high yielding wheat production in irrigated regions of the loess plateau are unclear in the present study plastic covered ridge and furrow planting and traditional flatbed planting were performed at four irrigation levels the objective was to investigate whether applying plastic covered ridge and furrow planting to an irrigated farmland system could reduce the irrigation water requirements and increase water productivity for high yielding wheat production the results suggested that plastic covered ridge and furrow planting significantly increased soil moisture content and increased both grain yield and water productivity of wheat at the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels compared with that resulting from traditional flatbed planting the grain yield resulting from plastic covered ridge and furrow planting was 51 7 64 8 25 5 and 5 84 greater respectively at the high grain yield level 6 7 t ha 1 the plastic covered ridge and furrow planting system at 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation conserved 40 of irrigation water during wheat production and it coordinated the relationships among grain yield quality water protuctivity and for wheat production these findings show that the plastic covered ridge and furrow planting system with 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation is suitable for sustainable high yielding wheat production in the irrigated regions of the loess plateau of china keywords plastic covered ridge and furrow planting irrigation wheat grain yield water productivity 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l feeds approximately 40 of the population of china the identification of methods to increase the yield per unit of cereals such as wheat is increasingly crucial for the grain productivity and food security in china he et al 2017 the loess plateau is the largest dryland agricultural region of china and it is one of the important crop production regions of china water availability is the main limiting factor for wheat production in this region in northern china the water consumption of high yielding winter wheat grain yield 6 0 t ha 1 is approximately 450 650 mm huang et al 2016 however the low amount of regional annual precipitation cannot satisfy the water requirements of wheat production in addition more than 70 of this annual precipitation falls from june to september which does not coincide with the growth stages of winter wheat this aggravates the water shortage during the wheat growing season therefore if this region is to achieve high wheat grain yields irrigation is the most important agronomic measure however most regions of the loess plateau are not irrigated the guanzhong plain mainly located in the subhumid area is a unique irrigated region on the loess plateau as such the guanzhong plain is the main crop production area and is a high yielding and elite area of grain production on the loess plateau increasing grain yields in this region can effectively alleviate the grain crisis in other rainfed areas on the loess plateau however a deficiency in agricultural water use also exists because of the dense urbanization of the region and the consequent priority for the residential use of water flood irrigation is the traditional and primary irrigation method used in the region but this method leads to severe water waste and low water productivity wp man et al 2015 this situation has aggravated the regional water deficiency and has rendered high yielding wheat production unsustainable guo et al 2014 thus the development of conservation methods to reduce the use of irrigation water to sustain high yielding wheat grain production and increase wp is important for wheat production in this region previous studies have suggested that certain water saving agricultural measures such as drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation conserve considerable amounts of irrigation water and can increase the water use efficiency of wheat cohen et al 2000 bern et al 2013 however the high expense of drip and sprinkler irrigation systems has hindered their application for wheat production in china on the loess plateau which is the largest dryland agricultural region in china precipitation is the only water source for wheat production therefore the effective use of rainwater is necessary for wheat production in this region ali et al 2017 plastic covered ridge and furrow planting rf systems which are a type of rainwater harvesting system have been widely used in recent years on the loess plateau chen et al 2013 a previous study suggested that rf systems can concentrate the limited amounts of rainfall within the planting furrow and root zone of plants li et al 2005 moreover rf systems can reduce unwanted water evaporation from farmlands because of the plastic mulching gan et al 2013 this approach has led to significant increases in soil moisture crop yields and crop water use efficiency on the loess plateau of china ren et al 2008 however studies involving rf systems have focused mainly on dryland farming systems but the effects of rf systems on crop yields and wp in irrigated farming systems are not clear rf systems can concentrate water from light rainfall events prevent surface runoff from heavy rainfall events and retain rainfall in crop planting regions ren et al 2010 on the basis of the effectiveness of rf systems in dryland farming it is unknown whether rf systems should be applied to irrigated farmland systems to enhance the rainfall use efficiency of crops and therefore reduce the amount of irrigation water used for crop production in the present study rf and traditional flatbed planting tf methods were used in an irrigated farming region with different irrigation treatments the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of irrigation on the grain yield and wp of winter wheat under the rf system in the subhumid region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the present study was conducted at the doukou wheat and maize experimental farm of northwest a f university shaanxi province china 34 36 n 108 52 e during 2015 2017 the experimental site is at 510 m above sea level the annual mean temperature was 13 2 c and the annual mean precipitation was 548 7 mm 70 of which fell from june to september the soil in the top 1 2 m was a eum orthrosol chinese soil taxonomy the soil bulk density organic matter content available nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k at a depth of 0 20 cm were 1 05 g cm 3 14 6 g kg 1 99 4 mg kg 1 20 2 mg kg 1 and 243 2 mg kg 1 respectively before fertilization the soil analyses were performed according to the methods of bao 2007 the available n was measured by alkaline hydrolysis diffusion method the available p was measured by sodium bicarbonate mo sb colorimetry method and available k was measured by ammonium acetate flame photometry method precipitation during the wheat growing period was 123 9 and 130 7 mm in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively fig 1 two planting systems rf and tf were used in the experiment for each planting system four irrigation levels were applied 0 400 40 mm 1200 120 mm and 2000 200 mm m3 ha 1 eight treatments were included in the experiment with three replicates per treatment the experiment was laid out as a completely randomized design the plot area was 18 m2 4 5 m 4 m and the interval between plots was 1 m irrigation was applied at the wintering zadoks 17 and jointing zadoks 31 stages with the irrigation amount per treatment split equally between the stages and measured using a water meter lxs 25y nanchang water industry group co china micro sprinkler irrigation was used for this experiment a schematic diagram for the rf system is presented in fig 2 with both the ridge and furrow measuring 30 cm and the plastic film with a thickness of 0 012 mm mulched on the ridge the rf system consisted of alternating ridges and furrows and was constructed manually the height of the ridges or the depth of the furrows was 15 cm the wheat was planted within the furrows with two rows of wheat plants per furrow the row spacing for both the rf and tf systems was 0 30 m and the sowing rate was 150 kg ha 1 a single wheat cultivar xinong 979 was used the plants were directly sown on october 15 2015 and on october 18 2016 before the experimental arrangement rotary tillage was used and 225 kg ha 1 n as urea and 120 kg ha 1 p2o5 as ordinary superphosphate were applied as a basal fertilizer in conjunction with rotary tillage 2 2 measurements and data analysis 2 2 1 plant growth grain yield and quality at the seedling zadoks 13 wintering zadoks 17 jointing zadoks 31 anthesis zadoks 65 and mature zadoks 94 stages the number of tillers and stems of two rows with 1 m long were measured in each plot and the tillers and spike at maturity density were calculated at the same stage the aboveground total biomass was determined after the samples were oven dried at 80 c to a constant weight for each plot three 1 m2 sections of plants were harvested the grain yield the grain moisture content was measured and was converted to 13 5 and grain yield components namely the spike number per unit area the spikelet number per spike and the grain weight were measured the grain samples were dried naturally for quality analysis the grain protein concentration and wet gluten concentration were determined via a near infrared analyzer da7250 perten sweden 2 2 2 soil moisture and temperature from sowing to maturity the soil moisture of the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers was measured at 10 and 20 d intervals in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at sowing and maturity the soil moisture was measured at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 200 cm in addition the soil moisture was measured at the jointing and anthesis stages within a soil depth of 0 100 cm the soil moisture reported for the rf system was the average of that in the ridge and furrow the soil was sampled in 20 cm increments via a soil ferric auger and the gravimetric g g 1 soil water content was measured by drying the soil at 105 c to a constant weight the soil temperature of the 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm soil layers was measured by mercury in glass thermometers with bent stems and was recorded daily at 8 00 h 14 00 h and 20 00 h the average soil temperature was then calculated 2 2 3 water productivity wp the wp was calculated as the wheat grain yield divided by the seasonal evapotranspiration the specific method used was that described by li et al 2016 the seasonal evapotranspiration for each plot was determined by the formula et p swc i where p is the total seasonal precipitation mm swc is the soil moisture change and i is the total amount of irrigation the experimental field had good water holding capacity and therefore little drainage occurred below 200 cm during the growing season the wp was calculated as the winter wheat yield kg ha 1 divided by the evapotranspiration during the growing season m3 ha 1 the irrigation water productivity iwp and precipitation water productivity pwp were calculated as the winter wheat yield divided by the total amount of irrigation during the wheat growing period and the winter wheat yield divided by the total seasonal precipitation during the wheat growing period respectively 2 2 4 nitrogen use efficiency nue at maturity the total n concentration of the aboveground tissue was determined by h2so4 h2o2 digestion and analysis of the digestate by the automatic kjeldahl method foss8400 switzerland the nitrogen uptake efficiency nupe was calculated as the ratio of n uptake into the aboveground parts of the plants at maturity to the amount of n fertilizer applied the partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer nfp was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield to the amount of n fertilizer applied expressed as kg grain kg 1 applied n nue was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield to the total n uptake expressed as kg grain kg 1 of n uptake guo et al 2014 2 3 statistical analyses the spss 16 0 statistical software package was used to conduct the analyses analysis of variance anova was used to determine the significance of the main effects and their interactions means of the data for each treatment were calculated by averaging the values for each plot the general linear model was used and the differences between the means were evaluated by the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 phenology with increasing irrigation level the growth period of wheat increased table 1 in addition a significant interaction effect of irrigation and planting system was observed on the wheat phenology under the 0 and 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation treatments the anthesis stage and mature stage of wheat in the rf system occurred later than did those in the tf system however under the 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation treatments no differences in the growth period of wheat were detected between the rf and tf systems the trends of both sets of years were similar 3 2 soil moisture and temperature in the present study both the rf system and irrigation level significantly affected the soil moisture with increasing irrigation the soil moisture within the 0 40 cm soil layer tended to markedly increase fig 3 compared with the tf system the rf system significantly increased the amount of soil moisture within the 0 40 cm layer in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the mean soil moisture within the 0 20 cm soil layer in the rf system was 4 00 and 5 83 greater than that in the tf system respectively in addition the mean soil moisture within the 20 40 cm soil layer in the rf system was 3 12 and 4 01 greater than that in the tf system respectively at the joint and anthesis stages the soil moisture within the 0 100 cm soil layer was measured the soil moisture within the 0 100 cm soil layer in the rf system was 3 46 and 5 80 greater than that in the tf system at the joint and anthesis wheat stages respectively averaged over the four irrigation levels and two years fig 4 additionally the difference in soil moisture between the rf and tf systems decreased with increased irrigation at anthesis the soil moisture in the rf system was 16 48 and 9 19 greater than that in the tf system in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at the 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation level however the soil moisture in the rf system was only 1 25 and 2 26 greater than that in the tf system in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level this difference might be related to the high evaporation rate at the experimental site overall these results suggested that at low irrigation compared with the tf system the rf system is better at conserving water with increasing irrigation level the total water consumption of the 0 200 cm soil layer tended to markedly increase but the soil water consumption tended to decrease fig 5 in addition the total water consumption and soil water consumption in the rf system was greater than that in the tf system at the same irrigation level in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the total water consumption in the rf system was 1 37 and 5 18 5 61 and 1 60 3 03 and 1 20 and 1 01 and 0 37 greater than that in the tf system at the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels respectively the soil water consumption in the rf system was 3 20 and 9 45 3 69 and 1 60 18 16 and 4 68 and 7 77 and 18 51 greater than that in the tf system at the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels respectively this means that the rf system led to an increase in soil water consumption which may be conducive to efficient soil water storage the soil temperature in the 5 and 10 cm soil layers decreased with increasing irrigation level fig 6 in addition the rf system led to an increase in soil temperature in the 5 and 10 cm soil layers during the early wheat growth period this phenomenon may be related to the heat conservation effect of the plastic mulch however the rf system had a reducing effect on the soil temperature in the 5 and 10 cm soil layers during the late wheat growth period in contrast to the soil temperature in the 5 and 10 cm soil layers neither the rf system nor irrigation level had significant effects on the soil temperature in the 15 cm soil layer 3 3 plant growth grain yield and quality both the rf system and irrigation significantly affected the tiller and spike density and aboveground biomass of wheat fig 7 with increasing irrigation level the tiller and spike density and aboveground biomass markedly increased these findings mean that soil water is an important limiting factor for plant growth in this region in addition the rf system also affected the tiller and spike density and aboveground biomass but the effect of the rf system on these parameters was significantly related to the irrigation level at the 0 400 and 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels the rf system resulted in significant increases in tiller and spike density and aboveground biomass of wheat however no significant differences in tiller and spike density number or aboveground biomass of wheat were detected between the rf and tf systems at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level these results mean that at high irrigation levels rf systems do not lead to increases in wheat plant growth under the same planting system n accumulation increased with increasing irrigation level fig 8 the rf system also markedly affected the n accumulation and the n accumulation in the rf system was significantly greater than that in the tf system at the 0 and 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels however there were no significant differences in n accumulation between the rf system and tf system at the 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels under the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation treatments the respective grain yields from the rf system were 41 5 61 8 70 0 96 5 27 5 23 4 and 14 4 2 7 2015 2016 2016 2017 greater than those from the tf system respectively table 2 with increasing irrigation level the number of spikes per area and grain number per spike of wheat markedly increased however irrigation had no significant effect on the grain weight of wheat in addition the rf system also led to an increase in both the number of spikes per area and the grain number per spike overall the number of spikes per area and grain number per spike in the rf system were 15 4 and 17 5 2015 2016 and 11 6 and 15 0 2016 2017 greater than those in the tf system respectively however the effect of the rf system on the number of spikes per area and grain number per spike was related to the irrigation level under the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation treatments the spikes density in the rf system was 22 47 28 04 10 34 and 6 21 greater than that in the tf system respectively in 2015 2016 and the number of grains per spike was 15 49 20 31 8 51 and 3 03 greater respectively table 1 shows that irrigation significantly decreased the protein and wet gluten concentrations in the grain however the rf system had no significant effect on the protein or wet gluten concentrations of the grain table 2 3 4 water productivity wp and n use efficiency nue the wp of wheat initially tended to increase but then decreased with increasing irrigation level table 3 in addition the rf system also significantly affected the wp of wheat and the effect of the rf system on the wp was related to the irrigation level at the 0 400 and 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels compared with the tf system the rf system significantly increased the wp of wheat however the rf system had no significant effect on the wp of wheat at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level with increasing irrigation level the pwp tended to increase and the iwp tended to decrease the rf system significantly affected both the pwp and iwp the pwp in the rf system was significantly greater than that in the tf system at all four irrigation levels the rf system also significantly increased the iwp at the 400 and 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels but at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level there was no significant difference in the iwp between the rf system and the tf system these findings mean that the rf system markedly increased the water productivity at the 0 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels in addition the rf system notably affected the nue of wheat table 4 overall the rf system significantly increased the nupe nfp and nue the nupe nfp and nue in the rf system the means of all four irrigation levels were 18 64 and 11 94 32 60 and 27 20 and 12 37 and 16 97 greater than those in the tf system in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at the 0 400 and 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels the nfp and nue in the rf system were significantly greater than those in the tf system and the nupe in the rf system was significantly greater than that in the tf system at both the 0 and 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels 4 discussion in the present study the soil moisture within the 0 100 cm depth in the rf system was 3 46 and 5 80 greater than that in the tf system at the joint and anthesis stages respectively averaged over the four irrigation levels and two sets of years additionally the difference in soil moisture between rf and tf systems decreased with increasing irrigation level at anthesis the soil moisture in the rf system was 9 19 16 48 greater than that in the tf system at the 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation level however the soil moisture in the rf system was only 1 25 2 26 greater than that in the tf system at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level this difference might be related to the high evaporation rate at the experimental site the annual mean pan evaporation was 993 2 mm under low irrigation conditions irrigation water accumulates mainly within the shallow soil layer mueller et al 2012 therefore there was considerable soil water loss in the tf system previous studies have suggested that plastic film can significantly inhibit soil water evaporation ren et al 2010 gan et al 2013 li et al 2016 additionally the greater canopy cover in rf systems has been shown to reduce both soil temperature and soil water loss ren et al 2008 therefore rf systems can increase soil moisture under low irrigation conditions because of this irrigation water infiltrates into the deep soil layer because of the saturation of the shallow soil layer under high irrigation conditions mueller et al 2012 this phenomenon enabled water evaporation and loss thus reducing the water concentrating effect of the rf system this might explain why the difference in soil moisture between the rf system and tf system decreased with increasing irrigation in the present study the rf system increased soil temperature during the early growth period of wheat fig 3 in wheat maize double cropping systems sowing dates of wheat are delayed to increase maize yields hartmann et al 2014 this delay causes low temperature stress during the seed germination and seedling growth stages of wheat li et al 2013 a previous study suggested that rf systems can enhance crop growth during the early stages because of higher soil temperatures ren et al 2008 therefore the use of rf systems may be advantageous during the late wheat sowing stage to enhance growth which would consequently increase both the growth period of maize and annual yields of wheat maize double cropping systems both the rf system and irrigation significantly affected wheat grain yields with a notable interactive effect table 2 the rf system increased the wheat grain yield but the stimulatory effect of the rf system on the grain yield decreased with increased irrigation at low irrigation the small amount of irrigation water accumulated mainly within the shallow soil layer fig 4 which may lead to evaporative loss mueller et al 2012 however the rf system strongly inhibited water evaporation because of the plastic film mulch gan et al 2013 this system can notably improve the use of irrigation water and the growth of wheat as such the rf system significantly increased plant growth under the low irrigation treatment fig 7 and the grain yield in the rf system at the 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation level was 50 1 62 9 greater than that at the no irrigation level the yields in the rf system were notably greater than those in the tf system at the 400 m3 ha 1 and no irrigation levels with the former being 35 6 and 23 6 greater than the latter in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively high grain yields constitute the most important objective for wheat production in china he et al 2017 with global climate change the precipitation in northern china has tended to decrease lv et al 2013 this phenomenon has led to an increase in groundwater consumption to retain the high yielding wheat grain production in this region chen et al 2010 however the severe ground water saving policy in northern china makes it difficult to depend entirely on groundwater irrigation to maintain high yielding wheat grain production yao et al 2017 therefore determining how to coordinate high grain yields and water savings is important for the sustainability of wheat production in northern china in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the highest grain yield in the tf system occurred at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level however the rf system attained the same grain yield 6 t ha 1 in 2015 2016 and 7 t ha 1 in 2016 2017 with only 1200 m3 ha 1 of irrigation water a savings of 40 thus the rf system conserved significant amounts of water for high yielding wheat grain production in the subhumid region of china therefore the rf system is widely applicable for high yielding wheat grain production in the subhumid region of northern china with economic development and increased standards of living the demand to meet the need for high quality wheat grain and flour has increased rapidly lin et al 2015 protein and wet gluten concentrations are the most important traits that determine the quality of wheat grain gao et al 2016 table 2 shows that irrigation significantly reduced the protein and wet gluten concentrations of the grain these results are similar to those of previous studies guttieri et al 2000 sissons et al 2014 however the rf system had no significant effect on the protein or wet gluten concentrations of the grain table 2 a previous study suggested that grain quality is notably affected by temperature and soil moisture troccoli et al 2000 soil moisture was shown to be negatively correlated with protein and wet gluten concentrations in wheat grains guttieri et al 2000 sissons et al 2014 however high temperatures during the grain filling period have been shown to increase protein concentrations in wheat grains markedly nuttall et al 2017 in the present study the rf system significantly increased the soil moisture and temperature figs 2 and 3 therefore we conclude that the comprehensive effects of soil moisture temperature and other factors associated with the rf system had no significant effects on the grain quality of wheat in china obtaining high yields is a major objective in wheat production however the quality of crop products often declines with increased grain yields lin et al 2015 by contrast in the present study the rf system significantly increased the grain yield of wheat without significantly affecting grain quality in other words the rf system retained the grain quality of the wheat while increasing the wheat yield in the sub humid region of china there has been some dispute over applications of plastic film for crop production some studies have suggested that the application of plastic film might lead to white pollution and destroy the soil structure steinmetz et al 2016 feng et al 2017 additionally plastic film increases the cost of wheat production which might limit the use of plastic film in wheat production in china however given the increasing demand for cereals and water deficiency water conservation is an inevitable way to obtain high yield crop production in china compared with that of water saving irrigation systems such as drip irrigation which require a series of expensive equipment the cost of plastic film is low moreover rf systems can be mechanized and the plastic film can be recovered after crop harvest braunack et al 2015 these measures can decrease the cost of the rf system in the present study we found that although the rf system at 1200 m3 ha 1 had a greater cost because of the plastic film than did the tf system at 2000 m3 ha 1 the water cost was lower and the former had a high grain yield and high output supplemental table 1 therefore the net income of the rf system at 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation was 11 3 28 6 greater than that of the tf system at 2000 m3 ha 1 this means that applications of the rf system do not reduce the economic benefit of wheat production additionally the application of alternative film materials such as degradable film can reduce the white pollution of plastic film kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 yang et al 2015 these factors can also increase the application of the rf system for crop production promoting wp is one of the main objectives for sustainable agriculture guo et al 2014 man et al 2015 in the present study wp first increased but then decreased as the irrigation level increased table 2 in addition compared with the tf system the rf system significantly increased the wp of wheat at the same irrigation level this pattern resembles that reported in previous studies on dryland farming ren et al 2010 li et al 2016 however the degree of wp increase by the rf system was significantly related to the irrigation level with the largest rf induced wp increases always occurring at the low irrigation level during the two experimental periods the wp in the rf system was 60 9 and 69 5 greater than that in the tf system in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively in contrast the wp in the rf system was only 0 8 12 1 greater than that in the tf system for the high irrigation level this pattern is similar to that of the grain yield results and this means that there was a notably interaction effect between planting and irrigation on wp table 3 a previous study suggested that rf systems increase wp mainly in two ways by reducing evapotranspiration and by increasing grain yields albrizio et al 2010 in the present study the mean evapotranspiration in the rf and tf systems averaged over the four irrigation levels did not significantly differ thus the wp increase in the rf system was related mainly to the grain yield increase in the present study during 2015 2016 the evapotranspiration was greater in the rf system than in the tf system this tendency might have occurred because the rf system markedly promoted the growth of wheat roots into deep soil and increased the lateral root mass thus promoting the absorption of water within the deep soil layer by the crops li et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 suggested that rf systems might lead to a severe water deficit within the deep soil layer 100 200 cm in the semiarid region of china moreover liu et al 2014 suggested that an annual rainfall greater than 273 mm is adequate for the rf system to ensure the water balance and sustainability of dryland maize production in the semiarid region of china however whether long term use of an rf system can maintain the water balance and sustainability in the sub humid region of china which has an annual precipitation between approximately 500 and 600 mm is unclear thus a long term field study is needed to further investigate this issue water and n notably interacted to affect the regulation of crop growth in a previous study albrizio et al 2010 water could increase n availability and absorption for the crop and n could enhance crop drought resistance li et al 2009 another previous study suggested that an rf system significantly increased the nue of wheat and its n accumulation li et al 2016 the data in table 4 suggest that overall compared with the tf system the rf system had greater nupe nfp and nue of wheat this pattern suggests that rf systems might improve soil moisture and by this promoting the absorption and accumulation of n by wheat and this means that the planting and irrigation may combine to affected the nue of wheat this outcome might be beneficial for the efficient use of resources in wheat production the results of the present study show for the first time that an rf system had a significant water saving effect for high yielding wheat grain production in the sub humid region of china and coordinated the relationships among grain yield quality wp and nue for wheat production therefore rf systems are suitable for sustainable high yielding wheat production in the sub humid region of china 5 conclusion the rf system significantly increased soil moisture and therefor increased the grain yield wp and nue of wheat at the high grain yield level 6 7 t ha 1 compared with the tf system the rf system at 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation conserved 40 of the irrigation water in wheat production in addition the rf system at 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation coordinated the relationships among grain yield quality wp and nue for wheat production therefore the rf system in conjunction with 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation is suitable for sustainable high yielding wheat production in irrigated fields

10728,determining methods for increasing irrigation water productivity is important for sustaining high wheat grain yields in the irrigated region of the loess plateau in china plastic covered ridge and furrow planting has been widely applied in dryland farming as it markedly increases precipitation productivity and crop yields however whether this planting system can significantly increase irrigation water productivity and whether it can reduce the irrigation volume for high yielding wheat production in irrigated regions of the loess plateau are unclear in the present study plastic covered ridge and furrow planting and traditional flatbed planting were performed at four irrigation levels the objective was to investigate whether applying plastic covered ridge and furrow planting to an irrigated farmland system could reduce the irrigation water requirements and increase water productivity for high yielding wheat production the results suggested that plastic covered ridge and furrow planting significantly increased soil moisture content and increased both grain yield and water productivity of wheat at the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels compared with that resulting from traditional flatbed planting the grain yield resulting from plastic covered ridge and furrow planting was 51 7 64 8 25 5 and 5 84 greater respectively at the high grain yield level 6 7 t ha 1 the plastic covered ridge and furrow planting system at 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation conserved 40 of irrigation water during wheat production and it coordinated the relationships among grain yield quality water protuctivity and for wheat production these findings show that the plastic covered ridge and furrow planting system with 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation is suitable for sustainable high yielding wheat production in the irrigated regions of the loess plateau of china keywords plastic covered ridge and furrow planting irrigation wheat grain yield water productivity 1 introduction winter wheat triticum aestivum l feeds approximately 40 of the population of china the identification of methods to increase the yield per unit of cereals such as wheat is increasingly crucial for the grain productivity and food security in china he et al 2017 the loess plateau is the largest dryland agricultural region of china and it is one of the important crop production regions of china water availability is the main limiting factor for wheat production in this region in northern china the water consumption of high yielding winter wheat grain yield 6 0 t ha 1 is approximately 450 650 mm huang et al 2016 however the low amount of regional annual precipitation cannot satisfy the water requirements of wheat production in addition more than 70 of this annual precipitation falls from june to september which does not coincide with the growth stages of winter wheat this aggravates the water shortage during the wheat growing season therefore if this region is to achieve high wheat grain yields irrigation is the most important agronomic measure however most regions of the loess plateau are not irrigated the guanzhong plain mainly located in the subhumid area is a unique irrigated region on the loess plateau as such the guanzhong plain is the main crop production area and is a high yielding and elite area of grain production on the loess plateau increasing grain yields in this region can effectively alleviate the grain crisis in other rainfed areas on the loess plateau however a deficiency in agricultural water use also exists because of the dense urbanization of the region and the consequent priority for the residential use of water flood irrigation is the traditional and primary irrigation method used in the region but this method leads to severe water waste and low water productivity wp man et al 2015 this situation has aggravated the regional water deficiency and has rendered high yielding wheat production unsustainable guo et al 2014 thus the development of conservation methods to reduce the use of irrigation water to sustain high yielding wheat grain production and increase wp is important for wheat production in this region previous studies have suggested that certain water saving agricultural measures such as drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation conserve considerable amounts of irrigation water and can increase the water use efficiency of wheat cohen et al 2000 bern et al 2013 however the high expense of drip and sprinkler irrigation systems has hindered their application for wheat production in china on the loess plateau which is the largest dryland agricultural region in china precipitation is the only water source for wheat production therefore the effective use of rainwater is necessary for wheat production in this region ali et al 2017 plastic covered ridge and furrow planting rf systems which are a type of rainwater harvesting system have been widely used in recent years on the loess plateau chen et al 2013 a previous study suggested that rf systems can concentrate the limited amounts of rainfall within the planting furrow and root zone of plants li et al 2005 moreover rf systems can reduce unwanted water evaporation from farmlands because of the plastic mulching gan et al 2013 this approach has led to significant increases in soil moisture crop yields and crop water use efficiency on the loess plateau of china ren et al 2008 however studies involving rf systems have focused mainly on dryland farming systems but the effects of rf systems on crop yields and wp in irrigated farming systems are not clear rf systems can concentrate water from light rainfall events prevent surface runoff from heavy rainfall events and retain rainfall in crop planting regions ren et al 2010 on the basis of the effectiveness of rf systems in dryland farming it is unknown whether rf systems should be applied to irrigated farmland systems to enhance the rainfall use efficiency of crops and therefore reduce the amount of irrigation water used for crop production in the present study rf and traditional flatbed planting tf methods were used in an irrigated farming region with different irrigation treatments the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of irrigation on the grain yield and wp of winter wheat under the rf system in the subhumid region of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the present study was conducted at the doukou wheat and maize experimental farm of northwest a f university shaanxi province china 34 36 n 108 52 e during 2015 2017 the

method the available p was measured by sodium bicarbonate mo sb colorimetry method and available k was measured by ammonium acetate flame photometry method precipitation during the wheat growing period was 123 9 and 130 7 mm in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively fig 1 two planting systems rf and tf were used in the experiment for each planting system four irrigation levels were applied 0 400 40 mm 1200 120 mm and 2000 200 mm m3 ha 1 eight treatments were included in the experiment with three replicates per treatment the experiment was laid out as a completely randomized design the plot area was 18 m2 4 5 m 4 m and the interval between plots was 1 m irrigation was applied at the wintering zadoks 17 and jointing zadoks 31 stages with the irrigation amount per treatment split equally between the stages and measured using a water meter lxs 25y nanchang water industry group co china micro sprinkler irrigation was used for this experiment a schematic diagram for the rf system is presented in fig 2 with both the ridge and furrow measuring 30 cm and the plastic film with a thickness of 0 012 mm mulched on the ridge the rf system consisted of alternating ridges and furrows and was constructed manually the height of the ridges or the depth of the furrows was 15 cm the wheat was planted within the furrows with two rows of wheat plants per furrow the row spacing for both the rf and tf systems was 0 30 m and the sowing rate was 150 kg ha 1 a single wheat cultivar xinong 979 was used the plants were directly sown on october 15 2015 and on october 18 2016 before the experimental arrangement rotary tillage was used and 225 kg ha 1 n as urea and 120 kg ha 1 p2o5 as ordinary superphosphate were applied as a basal fertilizer in conjunction with rotary tillage 2 2 measurements and data analysis 2 2 1 plant growth grain yield and quality at the seedling zadoks 13 wintering zadoks 17 jointing zadoks 31 anthesis zadoks 65 and mature zadoks 94 stages the number of tillers and stems of two rows with 1 m long were measured in each plot and the tillers and spike at maturity density were calculated at the same stage the aboveground total biomass was determined after the samples were oven dried at 80 c to a constant weight for each plot three 1 m2 sections of plants were harvested the grain yield the grain moisture content was measured and was converted to 13 5 and grain yield components namely the spike number per unit area the spikelet number per spike and the grain weight were measured the grain samples were dried naturally for quality analysis the grain protein concentration and wet gluten concentration were determined via a near infrared analyzer da7250 perten sweden 2 2 2 soil moisture and temperature from sowing to maturity the soil moisture of the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers was measured at 10 and 20 d intervals in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at sowing and maturity the soil moisture was measured at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 200 cm in addition the soil moisture was measured at the jointing and anthesis stages within a soil depth of 0 100 cm the soil moisture reported for the rf system was the average of that in the ridge and furrow the soil was sampled in 20 cm increments via a soil ferric auger and the gravimetric g g 1 soil water content was measured by drying the soil at 105 c to a constant weight the soil temperature of the 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm soil layers was measured by mercury in glass thermometers with bent stems and was recorded daily at 8 00 h 14 00 h and 20 00 h the average soil temperature was then calculated 2 2 3 water productivity wp the wp was calculated as the wheat grain yield divided by the seasonal evapotranspiration the specific method used was that described by li et al 2016 the seasonal evapotranspiration for each plot was determined by the formula et p swc i where p is the total seasonal precipitation mm swc is the soil moisture change and i is the total amount of irrigation the experimental field had good water holding capacity and therefore little drainage occurred below 200 cm during the growing season the wp was calculated as the winter wheat yield kg ha 1 divided by the evapotranspiration during the growing season m3 ha 1 the irrigation water productivity iwp and precipitation water productivity pwp were calculated as the winter wheat yield divided by the total amount of irrigation during the wheat growing period and the winter wheat yield divided by the total seasonal precipitation during the wheat growing period respectively 2 2 4 nitrogen use

productivity of nitrogen fertilizer nfp was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield to the amount of n fertilizer applied expressed as kg grain kg 1 applied n nue was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield to the total n uptake expressed as kg grain kg 1 of n uptake guo et al 2014 2 3 statistical analyses the spss 16 0 statistical software package was used to conduct the analyses analysis of variance anova was used to determine the significance of the main effects and their interactions means of the data for each treatment were calculated by averaging the values for each plot the general linear model was used and the differences between the means were evaluated by the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 phenology with increasing irrigation level the growth period of wheat increased table 1 in addition a significant interaction effect of irrigation and planting system was observed on the wheat phenology under the 0 and 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation treatments the anthesis stage and mature stage of wheat in the rf system occurred later than did those in the tf system however under the 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation treatments no differences in the growth period of wheat were detected between the rf and tf systems the trends of both sets of years were similar 3 2 soil moisture and temperature in the present study both the rf system and irrigation level significantly affected the soil moisture with increasing irrigation the soil moisture within the 0 40 cm soil layer tended to markedly increase fig 3 compared with the tf system the rf system significantly increased the amount of soil moisture within the 0 40 cm layer in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the mean soil moisture within the 0 20 cm soil layer in the rf system was 4 00 and 5 83 greater than that in the tf system respectively in addition the mean soil moisture within the 20 40 cm soil layer in the rf system was 3 12 and 4 01 greater than that in the tf system respectively at the joint and anthesis stages the soil moisture within the 0 100 cm soil layer was measured the soil moisture within the 0 100 cm soil layer in the rf system was 3 46 and 5 80 greater than that in the tf system at the joint and anthesis wheat stages respectively averaged over the four irrigation levels and two years fig 4 additionally the difference in soil moisture between the rf and tf systems decreased with increased irrigation at anthesis the soil moisture in the rf system was 16 48 and 9 19 greater than that in the tf system in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at the 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation level however the soil moisture in the rf system was only 1 25 and 2 26 greater than that in the tf system in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level this difference might be related to the high evaporation rate at the experimental site overall these results suggested that at low irrigation compared with the tf system the rf system is better at conserving water with increasing irrigation level the total water consumption of the 0 200 cm soil layer tended to markedly increase but the soil water consumption tended to decrease fig 5 in addition the total water consumption and soil water consumption in the rf system was greater than that in the tf system at the same irrigation level in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the total water consumption in the rf system was 1 37 and 5 18 5 61 and 1 60 3 03 and 1 20 and 1 01 and 0 37 greater than that in the tf system at the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels respectively the soil water consumption in the rf system was 3 20 and 9 45 3 69 and 1 60 18 16 and 4 68 and 7 77 and 18 51 greater than that in the tf system at the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels respectively this means that the rf system led to an increase in soil water consumption which may be conducive to efficient soil water storage the soil temperature in the 5 and 10 cm soil layers decreased with increasing irrigation level fig 6 in addition the rf system led to an increase in soil temperature in the 5 and 10 cm soil layers during the early wheat growth period this phenomenon may be related to the heat conservation effect of the plastic mulch however the rf system had a reducing effect on the soil temperature in the 5 and 10 cm soil layers during the late wheat growth period in contrast to the soil temperature in the 5 and 10 cm soil layers neither the rf system nor irrigation level had significant effects on the soil temperature in the 15 cm soil layer 3 3 plant growth grain yield and quality both the rf system and irrigation significantly affected the tiller and spike density and aboveground biomass of wheat fig 7 with increasing irrigation level the tiller and spike density and aboveground biomass markedly increased these findings mean that soil water is an important limiting factor for plant growth in this region in addition the rf system also affected the tiller and spike density and aboveground biomass but the effect of the rf system on these parameters was significantly related to the irrigation level at the 0 400 and 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels the rf system resulted in significant increases in tiller and spike density and aboveground biomass of wheat however no significant differences in tiller and spike density number or aboveground biomass of wheat were detected between the rf and tf systems at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level these results mean that at high irrigation levels rf systems do not lead to increases in wheat plant growth under the same planting system n accumulation increased with increasing irrigation level fig 8 the rf system also markedly affected the n accumulation and the n accumulation in the rf system was significantly greater than that in the tf system at the 0 and 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels however there were no significant differences in n accumulation between the rf system and tf system at the 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels under the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation treatments the respective grain yields from the rf system were 41 5 61 8 70 0 96 5 27 5 23 4 and 14 4 2 7 2015 2016 2016 2017 greater than those from the tf system respectively table 2 with increasing irrigation level the number of spikes per area and grain number per spike of wheat markedly increased however irrigation had no significant effect on the grain weight of wheat in addition the rf system also led to an increase in both the number of spikes per area and the grain number per spike overall the number of spikes per area and grain number per spike in the rf system were 15 4 and 17 5 2015 2016 and 11 6 and 15 0 2016 2017 greater than those in the tf system respectively however the effect of the rf system on the number of spikes per area and grain number per spike was related to the irrigation level under the 0 400 1200 and 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation treatments the spikes density in the rf system was 22 47 28 04 10 34 and 6 21 greater than that in the tf system respectively in 2015 2016 and the number of grains per spike was 15 49 20 31 8 51 and 3 03 greater respectively table 1 shows that irrigation significantly decreased the protein and wet gluten concentrations in the grain however the rf system had no significant effect on the protein or wet gluten concentrations of the grain table 2 3 4 water productivity wp and n use efficiency nue the wp of wheat initially tended to increase but then decreased with increasing irrigation level table 3 in addition the rf system also significantly affected the wp of wheat and the effect of the rf system on the wp was related to the irrigation level at the 0 400 and 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels compared with the tf system the rf system significantly increased the wp of wheat however the rf system had no significant effect on the wp of wheat at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level with increasing irrigation level the pwp tended to increase and the iwp tended to decrease the rf system significantly affected both the pwp and iwp the pwp in the rf system was significantly greater than that in the tf system at all four irrigation levels the rf system also significantly increased the iwp at the 400 and 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels but at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level there was no significant difference in the iwp between the rf system and the tf system these findings mean that the rf system markedly increased the water productivity at the 0 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels in addition the rf system notably affected the nue of wheat table 4 overall the rf system significantly increased the nupe nfp and nue the nupe nfp and nue in the rf system the means of all four irrigation levels were 18 64 and 11 94 32 60 and 27 20 and 12 37 and 16 97 greater than those in the tf system in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively at the 0 400 and 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels the nfp and nue in the rf system were significantly greater than those in the tf system and the nupe in the rf system was significantly greater than that in the tf system at both the 0 and 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation levels 4 discussion in the present study the soil moisture within the 0 100 cm depth in the rf system was 3 46 and 5 80 greater than that in the tf system at the joint and anthesis stages respectively averaged over the four irrigation levels and two sets of years additionally the difference in soil moisture between rf and tf systems decreased with increasing irrigation level at anthesis the soil moisture in the rf system was 9 19 16 48 greater than that in the tf system at the 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation level however the soil moisture in the rf system was only 1 25 2 26 greater than that in the tf system at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level this difference might be related to the high evaporation rate at the experimental site the annual mean pan evaporation was 993 2 mm under low irrigation conditions irrigation water accumulates mainly within the shallow soil layer mueller et al 2012 therefore there was considerable soil water loss in the tf system previous studies have suggested that plastic film can significantly inhibit soil water evaporation ren et al 2010 gan et al 2013 li et al 2016 additionally the greater canopy cover in rf systems has been shown to reduce both soil temperature and soil water loss ren et al 2008 therefore rf systems can increase soil moisture under low irrigation conditions because of this irrigation water infiltrates into the deep soil layer because of the saturation of the shallow soil layer under high irrigation conditions mueller et al 2012 this phenomenon enabled water evaporation and loss thus reducing the water concentrating effect of the rf system this might explain why the difference in soil moisture between the rf system and tf system decreased with increasing irrigation in the present study the rf system increased soil temperature during the early growth period of wheat fig 3 in wheat maize double cropping systems sowing dates of wheat are delayed to increase maize yields hartmann et al 2014 this delay causes low temperature stress during the seed germination and seedling growth stages of wheat li et al 2013 a previous study suggested that rf systems can enhance crop growth during the early stages because of higher soil temperatures ren et al 2008 therefore the use of rf systems may be advantageous during the late wheat sowing stage to enhance growth which would consequently increase both the growth period of maize and annual yields of wheat maize double cropping systems both the rf system and irrigation significantly affected wheat grain yields with a notable interactive effect table 2 the rf system increased the wheat grain yield but the stimulatory effect of the rf system on the grain yield decreased with increased irrigation at low irrigation the small amount of irrigation water accumulated mainly within the shallow soil layer fig 4 which may lead to evaporative loss mueller et al 2012 however the rf system strongly inhibited water evaporation because of the plastic film mulch gan et al 2013 this system can notably improve the use of irrigation water and the growth of wheat as such the rf system significantly increased plant growth under the low irrigation treatment fig 7 and the grain yield in the rf system at the 400 m3 ha 1 irrigation level was 50 1 62 9 greater than that at the no irrigation level the yields in the rf system were notably greater than those in the tf system at the 400 m3 ha 1 and no irrigation levels with the former being 35 6 and 23 6 greater than the latter in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively high grain yields constitute the most important objective for wheat production in china he et al 2017 with global climate change the precipitation in northern china has tended to decrease lv et al 2013 this phenomenon has led to an increase in groundwater consumption to retain the high yielding wheat grain production in this region chen et al 2010 however the severe ground water saving policy in northern china makes it difficult to depend entirely on groundwater irrigation to maintain high yielding wheat grain production yao et al 2017 therefore determining how to coordinate high grain yields and water savings is important for the sustainability of wheat production in northern china in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the highest grain yield in the tf system occurred at the 2000 m3 ha 1 irrigation level however the rf system attained the same grain yield 6 t ha 1 in 2015 2016 and 7 t ha 1 in 2016 2017 with only 1200 m3 ha 1 of irrigation water a savings of 40 thus the rf system conserved significant amounts of water for high yielding wheat grain production in the subhumid region of china therefore the rf system is widely applicable for high yielding wheat grain production in the subhumid region of northern china with economic development and increased standards of living the demand to meet the need for high quality wheat grain and flour has increased rapidly lin et al 2015 protein and wet gluten concentrations are the most important traits that determine the quality of wheat grain gao et al 2016 table 2 shows that irrigation significantly reduced the protein and wet gluten concentrations of the grain these results are similar to those of previous studies guttieri et al 2000 sissons et al 2014 however the rf system had no significant effect on the protein or wet gluten concentrations of the grain table 2 a previous study suggested that grain quality is notably affected by temperature and soil moisture troccoli et al 2000 soil moisture was shown to be negatively correlated with protein and wet gluten concentrations in wheat grains guttieri et al 2000 sissons et al 2014 however high temperatures during the grain filling period have been shown to increase protein concentrations in wheat grains markedly nuttall et al 2017 in the present study the rf system significantly increased the soil moisture and temperature figs 2 and 3 therefore we conclude that the comprehensive effects of soil moisture temperature and other factors associated with the rf system had no significant effects on the grain quality of wheat in china obtaining high yields is a major objective in wheat production however the quality of crop products often declines with increased grain yields lin et al 2015 by contrast in the present study the rf system significantly increased the grain yield of wheat without significantly affecting grain quality in other words the rf system retained the grain quality of the wheat while increasing the wheat yield in the sub humid region of china there has been some dispute over applications of plastic film for crop production some studies have suggested that the application of plastic film might lead to white pollution and destroy the soil structure steinmetz et al 2016 feng et al 2017 additionally plastic film increases the cost of wheat production which might limit the use of plastic film in wheat production in china however given the increasing demand for cereals and water deficiency water conservation is an inevitable way to obtain high yield crop production in china compared with that of water saving irrigation systems such as drip irrigation which require a series of expensive equipment the cost of plastic film is low moreover rf systems can be mechanized and the plastic film can be recovered after crop harvest braunack et al 2015 these measures can decrease the cost of the rf system in the present study we found that although the rf system at 1200 m3 ha 1 had a greater cost because of the plastic film than did the tf system at 2000 m3 ha 1 the water cost was lower and the former had a high grain yield and high output supplemental table 1 therefore the net income of the rf system at 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation was 11 3 28 6 greater than that of the tf system at 2000 m3 ha 1 this means that applications of the rf system do not reduce the economic benefit of wheat production additionally the application of alternative film materials such as degradable film can reduce the white pollution of plastic film kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 yang et al 2015 these factors can also increase the application of the rf system for crop production promoting wp is one of the main objectives for sustainable agriculture guo et al 2014 man et al 2015 in the present study wp first increased but then decreased as the irrigation level increased table 2 in addition compared with the tf system the rf system significantly increased the wp of wheat at the same irrigation level this pattern resembles that reported in previous studies on dryland farming ren et al 2010 li et al 2016 however the degree of wp increase by the rf system was significantly related to the irrigation level with the largest rf induced wp increases always occurring at the low irrigation level during the two experimental periods the wp in the rf system was 60 9 and 69 5 greater than that in the tf system in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively in contrast the wp in the rf system was only 0 8 12 1 greater than that in the tf system for the high irrigation level this pattern is similar to that of the grain yield results and this means that there was a notably interaction effect between planting and irrigation on wp table 3 a previous study suggested that rf systems increase wp mainly in two ways by reducing evapotranspiration and by increasing grain yields albrizio et al 2010 in the present study the mean evapotranspiration in the rf and tf systems averaged over the four irrigation levels did not significantly differ thus the wp increase in the rf system was related mainly to the grain yield increase in the present study during 2015 2016 the evapotranspiration was greater in the rf system than in the tf system this tendency might have occurred because the rf system markedly promoted the growth of wheat roots into deep soil and increased the lateral root mass thus promoting the absorption of water within the deep soil layer by the crops li et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 suggested that rf systems might lead to a severe water deficit within the deep soil layer 100 200 cm in the semiarid region of china moreover liu et al 2014 suggested that an annual rainfall greater than 273 mm is adequate for the rf system to ensure the water balance and sustainability of dryland maize production in the semiarid region of china however whether long term use of an rf system can maintain the water balance and sustainability in the sub humid region of china which has an annual precipitation between approximately 500 and 600 mm is unclear thus a long term field study is needed to further investigate this issue water and n notably interacted to affect the regulation of crop growth in a previous study albrizio et al 2010 water could increase n availability and absorption for the crop and n could enhance crop drought resistance li et al 2009 another previous study suggested that an rf system significantly increased the nue of wheat and its n accumulation li et al 2016 the data in table 4 suggest that overall compared with the tf system the rf system had greater nupe nfp and nue of wheat this pattern suggests that rf systems might improve soil moisture and by this promoting the absorption and accumulation of n by wheat and this means that the planting and irrigation may combine to affected the nue of wheat this outcome might be beneficial for the efficient use of resources in wheat production the results of the present study show for the first time that an rf system had a significant water saving effect for high yielding wheat grain production in the sub humid region of china and coordinated the relationships among grain yield quality wp and nue for wheat production therefore rf systems are suitable for sustainable high yielding wheat production in the sub humid region of china 5 conclusion the rf system significantly increased soil moisture and therefor increased the grain yield wp and nue of wheat at the high grain yield level 6 7 t ha 1 compared with the tf system the rf system at 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation conserved 40 of the irrigation water in wheat production in addition the rf system at 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation coordinated the relationships among grain yield quality wp and nue for wheat production therefore the rf system in conjunction with 1200 m3 ha 1 irrigation is suitable for sustainable high yielding wheat production in irrigated fields

10729,interreplicate variability the spread in output values among units of the same sensor subjected to essentially the same condition can be a major source of uncertainty in sensor data to investigate the interreplicate variability among eight electromagnetic soil moisture sensors through a field study eight units of tdr315 cs616 cs655 hydraprobe2 ec5 5te and teros12 were installed at a depth of 0 30 m within 3 m of each other whereas three units of aquaspy vector probe were installed within 3 m of each other the magnitude of interreplicate variability in volumetric water content θv was generally similar between a static period near field capacity and a dynamic period of 85 consecutive days in the growing season however a wider range of variability was observed during the dynamic period primarily because interreplicate variability in θv increased sharply whenever infiltrated rainfall reached the sensor depth interreplicate variability for most sensors was thus smaller if comparing θv changes over several days that excluded this phenomenon than if comparing θv directly among the sensors that also reported temperature and or apparent electrical conductivity the sensors exhibiting the largest interreplicate variability in these outputs were characterized by units with consistently above or below average readings although manufacturers may continue to improve the technology in and the quality control of soil moisture sensors users would still benefit from paying greater attention to interreplicate variability and adopting strategies to mitigate the consequences of interreplicate variability keywords apparent electrical conductivity precision soil water content standard deviation temperature uncertainty 1 introduction soil moisture is an important property affecting the physics chemistry and biology of soils in turn moisture driven changes in soil characteristics and processes affect the urban agricultural and natural ecosystems aboveground as well as local to global hydrological and meteorological cycles therefore measuring soil moisture is of high interest for understanding and managing our world topp and ferré 2002 the past century witnessed the development of electromagnetic em sensors that can serve as relatively convenient and inexpensive tools for continuously measuring soil moisture at fixed depths in fixed locations concurrently accompanying research revealed gradually that the permittivity driven raw output of em sensors does not exhibit the same relationship with volumetric soil water content θv in all environments topp et al 2000 because site specific θv calibration can be difficult and cost prohibitive in many applications studies have attempted to account for the influence of measurable soil properties e g specific surface area temperature t salinity bulk density organic matter content on θv calibrations using physically based dielectric mixing models dirksen and dasberg 1993 or and wraith 1999 schwartz et al 2009 or empirical corrections jacobsen and schjønning 1993 western and seyfried 2005 kelleners et al 2009b singh et al 2019 however the influence of measurable soil properties is not the only source of error in θv determination using em sensors another source of error is interreplicate variability arising from inconsistencies in sensor hardware and or from sensitivity to microscale differences on one hand the dimensions and em behavior of sensor components may vary among different units of the same em sensor the same permittivity consequently results in different output values on the other hand even under uniform management θv and or other em related soil properties may vary within the representative elementary volume rev if an em sensor responds preferentially to the wetter zones logsdon 2009 and or measures a volume smaller than the rev output values will vary among identical units of that sensor depending on the microscale spatial distribution of θv and or of other em related soil properties although significant interreplicate variability can severely restrict the accuracy of em sensors with and without site specific calibration this type of error has received relatively little attention evett et al 2006 2009 rosenbaum et al 2010 therefore the objective of this study was to quantify the interreplicate variability of eight em sensors under field conditions 2 methods 2 1 sensors the eight em sensors in this study were tdr315 acclima meridian id cs616 campbell scientific logan ut cs655 campbell scientific logan

measures a property that is related to soil permittivity which in turn is positively associated with θv tdr315 is a time domain reflectometer that generates its own em pulses and analyzes its own waveforms to obtain travel times schwartz et al 2016 cs616 and cs655 are both water content reflectometers that count the average times per second the reflection of the previous generated em pulse

2 2 experiments this study was composed of two experiments that were conducted in a medium textured soil under no till corn soybean rotation at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research and extension center in north platte ne in the 2018 experiment two side by side rectangular pits i e the west pit and the east pit were excavated 1 06 m apart each pit was 1 83 m long in the north south direction by 0 46 m wide in the east west direction by 0 41 m deep in each horizontal i e northwest southwest northeast southeast quadrant of each pit one unit each of tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 ec5 5te and teros12 was inserted horizontally into the lengthwise i e west east face of the pit at a depth of 0 30 m until the base of the sensor head was flush with the pit wall the sensor spacing along the length of each pit was 0 13 m and all sensors except hp2 whose prongs are not coplanar were oriented such that all prongs were on the same horizontal plane the excavated soil was carefully backfilled so that the sensor cables were bending downward from the sensor heads before bending upward to exit the pits and so that the top of each pit was neither a mound nor a depression the four units of tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 ec5 and 5te in each pit were connected to the same cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan ut for recording sensor readings every 15 min the four units of teros12 in each pit were connected to the same em60 g datalogger meter group pullman wa for recording sensor readings every 15 min and for uploading data every six hours to the manufacturer s website https zentracloud com via telemetry while sensor installation occurred on march 14 15 planting occurred on may 10 specifically soybean seed product p25a12x dupont pioneer johnston ia was planted by hand in 0 19 m rows parallel with the length of the pits i e along the north south direction at a seed spacing of 0 03 m and at a depth of 0 03 m and the previously removed corn residue was once again spread evenly over the site the dense crop stand was intended to create a laterally homogeneous soil moisture distribution so that sensors with varying measurement volumes would be subjected to similar environments in the 2017 experiment which was located 23 m away from the 2018 experiment soybean seed product 2511nrr hoegemeyer hybrids hooper ne was mechanically planted on may 25 in 0 76 m rows along the north south direction at a seed spacing of 0 03 m and at a depth of 0 05 m on june 14 a total of three vps were installed by the manufacturer in two adjacent crop rows such that the vps formed the northwest northeast and southeast corners of a 3 0 m long and 0 76 m wide rectangle the vps were set up to record their sensor readings every 15 min and to upload those readings periodically to the manufacturer s website https agspy aquaspy com via telemetry for comparison a 503dr neutron moisture meter nmm cpn international concord ca was used in this study from each corner of each pit in the 2018 experiment an aluminum access tube was installed 0 30 m outward in the lengthwise direction and 0 06 m outward in the widthwise direction in the 2017 experiment a total of three aluminum access tubes were installed in the same two rows as the vps such that the tubes formed the northwest northeast and southeast corners of a 2 1 m long and 0 76 m wide rectangle enclosed within the rectangle defined by the three vps in both experiments nmm readings were always centered at the depths of the em sensors and were always taken for a count duration of 16 s after the two experiments two intact cylindrical soil cores of 0 04 m diameter and 0 10 m length centering at the sensor depth were collected for each sensor depth within the study areas using a hydraulic direct push soil probe giddings machine company windsor co textural composition and organic matter content were analyzed using the hydrometer and loss on ignition methods respectively by ward laboratories kearney ne the oven dried weight of each core was divided by the original volume of that core to calculate bulk density these soil properties were summarized in table 1 2 3 analyses in this study interreplicate variability was quantified in terms of the sample standard deviation sd eq 1 this definition lumps together the impacts of sensor hardware irregularities and of microscale soil heterogeneities because users tend to leave the em sensors under investigation in place for at least one growing season but tend to carry the same nmm unit between measurement locations users decrease their uncertainty in sample means typically by increasing the number of em sensor units or by increasing the number of nmm access tubes thus the different units of the same em sensor were treated as replicates of that em sensor whereas the different nmm access tubes in the same experiment were treated as replicates of nmm 1 s d i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 where n the number of replicates i the index for replicates xi the variable of interest i e t eca θv cumulative δθv or interval δθv as measured by replicate i of the given sensor at the given time and x the interreplicate mean of the variable of interest for the given sensor at the given time the sole factory θv calibration was applied to tdr315 cs655 5te and nmm respectively in contrast the standard quadratic calibration for cs616 the default loam calibration for hp2 the mineral soil calibration for ec5 and the mineral soil calibration for teros12 were selected from multiple factory θv calibrations the manufacturer of the vp does not recommend any θv calibration but each deviation from the interreplicate mean in scaled frequency 0 100 was multiplied by 0 005 to convert to a deviation from the interreplicate mean in θv 0 0 5 m3 m 3 according to a graph of scaled frequency versus θv from a manufacturer representative sloane 2017 a static assessment of interreplicate variability in θv focused on four instances coinciding with measurement dates of nmm when the sensor depths were near field capacity and were not experiencing root water uptake for tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 ec5 5te teros12 and nmm these four instances were on april 19 april 30 may 4 and may 10 all before germination in the 2018 experiment here the static assessment sd in θv for each of these sensors at each of the four dates included all eight replicates for vp and nmm in the 2017 experiment these four instances were on july 7 july 10 july 12 and july 14 root water uptake was occurring at shallow depths only here the static assessment sd in θv for each of these sensors at each of the four dates included the equivalent of nine replicates pooling together the deviations from depth specific interreplicate means at the 1 00 1 10 and 1 20 m depths among all three replicates of vp or nmm a dynamic assessment of interreplicate variability in θv incorporated all sensor readings from a continuous period of 85 days during the growing season the period from may 11 to august 3 in the 2018 experiment included 18 nmm measurement times for unknown reasons all four replicates of ec5 in the east pit of the 2018 experiment began to report nonsensical θv values from june 9 onward so ec5 was excluded from the dynamic assessment the dynamic assessment sd in θv for tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 5te teros12 or nmm at any given time in 2018 included all eight replicates on the other hand the period from july 6 to september 28 in the 2017 experiment included 33 nmm measurement times the dynamic assessment sd in θv for vp or nmm at any given time in 2017 included all three replicates but was calculated separately at each of the 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 0 60 0 70 0 80 and 0 90 m depths in all cases missing or zero values were omitted from sd calculations to some users the magnitudes of changes in θv δθv are more important data than the actual values of θv therefore the interreplicate variability in two types of δθv was investigated for all sensors as a part of the dynamic assessment the first type cumulative δθv was δθv from the first nmm measurement time to each of the latter measurement times the second type interval δθv was δθv from each nmm measurement time except for the last one to the very next nmm measurement time the 2018 and 2017 experiments included 17 and 32 intervals respectively some readers may be interested in how the factory calibrated results would change if adjusted using the local field thermogravimetric θv calibration for the particular nmm unit which achieved an r2 of 0 98 and a resubstitution root mean square error of 0 010 m3 m 3 with 54 soil cores from multiple depths specifically sd values in θv and in δθv for each sensor were multiplied by the linear regression slope that was obtained after averaging among all replicates and then plotting locally calibrated nmm θv against factory calibrated θv from the sensor of interest table 2 although this adjustment was admittedly imperfect schwartz et al 2018 rudnick et al 2018 developing accurate site specific θv calibrations of each em sensor under investigation could not be accomplished given the authors constraints the adjusted results were arguably closer to reality than the factory calibrated results but readers may choose to focus on the factory calibrated results and or the adjusted results the observed ranges in θv by the nmm during this study are listed in table 3 finally some users depend on em sensors to determine not only θv but also t and eca among the eight em sensors in this study tdr315 cs655 hp2 5te teros12 and vp reported t whereas tdr315 cs655 hp2 and 5te reported eca thus the interreplicate variability in t and in eca for these sensors was assessed according to the above methodology for the interreplicate variability in θv however in both the static and the dynamic assessments of interreplicate variability in eca sd from the 2018 experiment included just seven replicates specifically the northwest quadrant of the east pit was excluded because the 5te unit reported nonsensical eca values throughout the experiment for unknown reasons for clarity a summary of this subsection and an outline of the following results and discussion section are provided in table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 static assessment in the static assessment when the soil surrounding the sensors was near field capacity and was not experiencing root water uptake all eight em sensors under investigation exhibited larger interreplicate variability in factory and adjusted θv as compared with nmm table 5 however tdr315 cs655 vp and nmm kept sd below 0 020 m3 m 3 on all four dates with and without adjustment in contrast hp2 exhibited relatively large interreplicate variability in factory and adjusted θv keeping sd above 0 025 m3 m 3 on all four dates adjustment changed the results noticeably for some sensors under evaluation for example among the em sensors 5te showed the smallest interreplicate variability in factory θv but showed the third largest interreplicate variability in adjusted θv the static assessment also examined interreplicate variability in t and eca table 5 cs655 hp2 and 5te exhibited relatively small interreplicate variability in t maintaining sd below 0 4 c on all four dates on the other hand cs655 showed the smallest interreplicate variability in eca maintaining sd below 0 05 ds m 1 on all four dates the exceptionally large interreplicate variability in both t and eca for tdr315 was found to be characterized by substantial and persistent deviation of several replicates from the interreplicate mean specifically the southwest and northeast replicates in the west pit and the southwest replicate in the east pit reported much higher t values than the mean whereas the southeast replicate in the east pit reported much lower t values than the mean on the other hand the northwest replicate in the west pit and the northeast and southeast replicates in the east pit reported much higher eca values than the mean 3 2 dynamic assessment 3 2 1 temperature and apparent electrical conductivity in agreement with the static assessment the dynamic assessment found that interreplicate variability in t remained relatively small for cs655 hp2 5te and teros12 fig 1 the 3rd quartile sd values of these four sensors were still lower than the minimum sd value for tdr315 even though the sd values for tdr315 were already smaller in the dynamic assessment than in the static assessment although the 1st quartile and median sd values were lowest for cs655 the range of sd values was narrowest for 5te and almost all sd values for 5te were below 0 3 c interreplicate variability in t was relatively large for vp fig 1 and as identified earlier for tdr315 was also characterized by substantial and persistent deviation of particular replicates from the interreplicate mean at the seven depths from 0 30 m to 0 90 m t was always highest for the southeast replicate and lowest for the northwest replicate also in agreement with the static assessment the dynamic assessment of interreplicate variability in eca was the lowest for cs655 and highest for tdr315 fig 1 among the three core variables under investigation i e t eca and θv the disparity between the most variable and least variable sensor was largest in eca the median interquartile range and total range of sd in eca for tdr315 were all about 11 times those for cs655 with tdr315 being affected by substantial and persistent deviation of some replicates from the interreplicate mean as noted in the static assessment 3 2 2 volumetric water content at the nmm measurement times during the 2018 dynamic assessment tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 5te and teros12 all exhibited larger interreplicate variability in θv as compared with nmm fig 2 the 1st quartile sd values of these six em sensors were higher than the 3rd quartile sd value of nmm with and without adjustment among these six em sensors the 1st quartile median and 3rd quartile sd values of tdr315 were among the lowest with and without adjustment however the distribution of sd for tdr315 featured a relatively long upper tail where maximum sd was 0 039 and 0 035 m3 m 3 with and without adjustment respectively sd values for hp2 and teros12 also spanned relatively wide ranges in contrast all sd values for cs655 at the nmm measurement times stayed below 0 030 m3 m 3 with and without adjustment dynamic sd values were slightly higher than static sd values for cs655 and teros12 while the reverse was true for hp2 nonetheless static and dynamic sd values in θv were similar in magnitude overall based on the nmm measurement times in the 2018 experiment on the other hand vp did not exhibit consistently larger interreplicate variability in θv than nmm did at the nmm measurement times during the 2017 dynamic assessment fig 2 at shallower depths with and without adjustment sd values for vp were generally higher than those for nmm the opposite however tended to be true at deeper depths as sd values for nmm clearly increased with increasing depth for both vp and nmm adjusted sd values spanned a range wider than 0 03 m3 m 3 at most depths a smaller number of replicates i e three as opposed to eight but a larger number of nmm measurement times i e 33 as opposed to 18 likely contributed to the greater diversity in sd values during the 2018 dynamic assessment as compared with during the 2017 dynamic assessment the effects of wetting and drying on interreplicate variability in θv were examined from the entire 85 day time series fig 3 both for the em sensors under investigation and for nmm rain events that increased θv triggered jumps in its sd this behavior was likely caused by microscale nonuniformity in effective precipitation and subsequent percolation i e preferential flow as opposed to piston flow on the other hand drying sequences generally preserved or steadily decreased sd but sometimes replicates drifted apart as drying continued perhaps the rate and vertical distribution of root water uptake around the replicates were gradually diverging such drifting was found in the 1st quarter of the 2017 dynamic assessment at all vp and nmm depths except for 0 20 m in the 2nd quarter of the 2018 dynamic assessment various extents of such drifting were found for tdr315 cs616 cs655 5te and teros12 but not for hp2 and nmm rises in sd due to replicates drifting apart were not as abrupt as those due to percolating rainfall but the former was still observed to roughly double sd values for vp and nmm in 2017 and for cs655 in 2018 the time series graphs revealed additionally that tdr315 and hp2 experienced obvious fluctuations in θv readings from one reading to another 15 min apart tdr315 showed sudden and erratic spikes in θv whereas hp2 oscillated constantly filtering and smoothing procedures could be employed to enhance data precision amidst the noise 3 2 3 change in volumetric water content examining the interreplicate variability in δθv would not only generate practical information to some users but also shed light into the nature of the interreplicate variability in θv if interreplicate variability in the starting value of θv was the overwhelming reason for interreplicate variability in θv sd values in cumulative δθv would be much smaller than sd values in θv median sd values in adjusted cumulative δθv were 0 010 and 0 006 m3 m 3 smaller than median sd values in adjusted θv for cs616 and cs655 respectively figs 2 and 4 however minimal reductions were observed for other sensors in the 2018 experiment sd values in cumulative δθv were smaller than sd values in θv at some depths for vp and nmm in the 2017 experiment whereas the opposite was true at some other depths for nmm in the 2017 experiment sd values in cumulative δθv did not increase with increasing depth as sd values in θv did the lack of consistently smaller sd values in cumulative δθv than in θv revealed that differences in the starting value of θv were not the dominant source of interreplicate variability during the 2018 and 2017 dynamic assessments the close proximity of all replicates in this study was expected to reduce the observed magnitude of spatial variability in initial θv as compared with arrangements that scattered the replicates across a field at the same time divergences among replicates in effective precipitation root water uptake and or sensor responses prevented the interreplicate differences in θv from remaining constant throughout the dynamic assessment in contrast interreplicate variability in δθv over short intervals of approximately 2 7 days was substantially smaller than interreplicate variability in θv for all sensors except tdr315 figs 2 and 4 the majority of sd values in adjusted interval δθv were below 0 01 m3 m 3 and the sd values for cs616 and vp were mostly comparable to those for nmm nevertheless a strong right skew in the distribution of sd values was especially prevalent among em sensors those relatively large sd values corresponded to the intervals that included or immediately followed infiltration to the sensor depths which was associated earlier with increases in interreplicate variability 4 implications soil moisture sensors are undoubtedly useful but interreplicate variability poses a genuine challenge to the quantitative use of soil moisture sensor data even if the calibration is perfect large interreplicate variability still prevents users from obtaining a confident value of t eca or θv without deploying many replicates in turn data errors resulting from interreplicate variability of soil moisture sensors may propagate to the models to which users supply this data and to the decisions that users make based on this data to reduce interreplicate variability inconsistency in sensor hardware should first be minimized through improved construction manufacturers can choose better parts and procedures that cause greater uniformity and durability in the mechanical and electrical characteristics affecting em signal generation transmission reception and interpretation the inevitably remaining variability in sensor hardware can then be compensated through laboratory standardization of each individual unit rosenbaum et al 2010 during factory calibration finally internal and external damage to sensor hardware may occur after the product leaves the manufacturer i e during shipping installation usage removal and storage so users must be on the alert for obvious physical deformities and for nonsensical data to decide when sensor repair or replacement is necessary under field conditions microscale differences in actual θv and in soil properties that alter the relationship between θv and sensor output cannot be completely eliminated therefore users desiring precision in exact θv are recommended to select soil moisture sensors that have been shown to exhibit small interreplicate variability and to be cautious of sensors that are by design e g operating physical principles em frequency em field uniformity predisposed to high sensitivity to microscale differences evett et al 2006 2009 furthermore such users are advised to maximize the number of replicates under their particular labor and financial constraints and to avoid instantaneous unfiltered data differentiating the contribution of hardware inconsistency versus microscale heterogeneity on interreplicate variability among the em sensors was impossible using only the 2017 and 2018 field experiments data therefore eight replicates of tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 ec5 5te and teros12 were immersed one at a time in 10 c acetone sunnyside corporation wheeling il indoors on october 30 2019 acetone served as a suitable reference liquid because it is easily accessible is not overly hazardous and maintains a similar permittivity within the range of frequencies that are employed by the em sensors under evaluation vp was excluded from this laboratory test because no replicates were available for the other seven em sensors the factory calibrated θv from a particular replicate was recorded once the entire measurement volume of that replicate was inside acetone fig 5 regrettably the eight replicates in this laboratory test could not be guaranteed to be exactly the same eight replicates in the 2018 field experiment therefore the results could not be applied to analyze further any systematic deviations from the interreplicate mean i e whether a replicate that was routinely above below average in the field was above below average in acetone or to isolate definitively the sensor hardware effect from the microscale heterogeneity effect furthermore readers must not overgeneralize results from eight replicates nevertheless interreplicate sd in factory θv for acetone was loosely compared to interreplicate sd in factory θv for the 2018 static assessment because the θv corresponding to the permittivity of acetone is similar to θv during the 2018 static assessment according to the interreplicate variability of the em sensors in acetone hardware variability was low for cs616 cs655 and hp2 moderate for tdr315 ec5 and teros12 and high for 5te table 6 on one hand the high acetone static ratio for tdr315 suggests that the potential for reducing its interreplicate variability lies predominantly in improving hardware consistency on the other hand the low acetone static ratio for hp2 suggests that the potential for reducing its interreplicate variability lies predominantly in lowering sensitivity to microscale heterogeneity such sensitivity of hp2 may be related to its small and concentrated measurement volume implying that spatial precision and interreplicate variability might sometimes be tradeoffs that need to be weighed depending on application after all interreplicate variability is only one of many important considerations the user is ultimately responsible for selecting 1 the most scientifically and practically appropriate soil moisture sensors for a particular application 2 the most optimal placement of those sensors given 3 d soil heterogeneity and 3 the most reasonable approach to interpreting and using soil moisture data while accounting for the reality of interreplicate variability users who do not absolutely require the knowledge of θv itself however may wish to reduce their exclusive reliance on the exact θv reading from soil moisture sensors for example many irrigated agronomic crop producers who use soil moisture sensors monitor multiple depths at just one location per field without replication scheduling irrigation strictly based on a fixed θv threshold would be difficult even in the absence of calibration error because sd values in θv of 0 02 m3 m 3 which were commonly observed in this study are approximately between an eighth and a quarter of available water capacity in most soils additionally based on the overall similarity between sd values in θv and sd values in cumulative δθv for the sensors in this study it might not be easier to schedule irrigation strictly based on a fixed cumulative δθv threshold relative to an observational field capacity lo et al 2017 value that is defined early in the season this study suggests that the interreplicate variability for soil moisture sensors should not be blindly assumed to consist mostly of constant offsets persisting throughout the growing season from their experiences in this study and from their interactions with producers and industry the authors have discerned the need to further research unconventional irrigation scheduling approaches that focus on the drying sequences in em sensor data and integrate multiple data sources for instance at the beginning of each drying sequence field capacity at each thoroughly wetted depth might be redefined as the output value corresponding to the end of nonlinear or nighttime decline starr and paltineanu 1998 subsequently the roughly linear and stair step like daytime decline across depths might be related either to a known calibration or to expected rates of crop water use thompson et al 2007 finally a comparison of active extraction depth against expected effective rooting depth t g smith personal communication 2014 and a comparison of current profile depletion against profile allowable depletion merriam 1966 might be jointly considered to make irrigation decisions by depending on the ability of em sensors mainly to describe θv trends and to quantify δθv within each drying sequence starr and paltineanu 1998 singh et al 2018 such an approach might be more accommodating of shortcomings in calibration and or interreplicate variability future field studies that implement and evaluate this type of approach as well as complex ensemble approaches combining soil moisture sensing soil water balance modeling and thermal sensing energy balance modeling barker et al 2018 would be greatly

10729,interreplicate variability the spread in output values among units of the same sensor subjected to essentially the same condition can be a major source of uncertainty in sensor data to investigate the interreplicate variability among eight electromagnetic soil moisture sensors through a field study eight units of tdr315 cs616 cs655 hydraprobe2 ec5 5te and teros12 were installed at a depth of 0 30 m within 3 m of each other whereas three units of aquaspy vector probe were installed within 3 m of each other the magnitude of interreplicate variability in volumetric water content θv was generally similar between a static period near field capacity and a dynamic period of 85 consecutive days in the growing season however a wider range of variability was observed during the dynamic period primarily because interreplicate variability in θv increased sharply whenever infiltrated rainfall reached the sensor depth interreplicate variability for most sensors was thus smaller if comparing θv changes over several days that excluded this phenomenon than if comparing θv directly among the sensors that also reported temperature and or apparent electrical conductivity the sensors exhibiting the largest interreplicate variability in these outputs were characterized by units with consistently above or below average readings although manufacturers may continue to improve the technology in and the quality control of soil moisture sensors users would still benefit from paying greater attention to interreplicate variability and adopting strategies to mitigate the consequences of interreplicate variability keywords apparent electrical conductivity precision soil water content standard deviation temperature uncertainty 1 introduction soil moisture is an important property affecting the physics chemistry and biology of soils in turn moisture driven changes in soil characteristics and processes affect the urban agricultural and natural ecosystems aboveground as well as local to global hydrological and meteorological cycles therefore measuring soil moisture is of high interest for understanding and managing our world topp and ferré 2002 the past century witnessed the development of electromagnetic em sensors that can serve as relatively convenient and inexpensive tools for continuously measuring soil moisture at fixed depths in fixed locations concurrently accompanying research revealed gradually that the permittivity driven raw output of em sensors does not exhibit the same relationship with volumetric soil water content θv in all environments topp et al 2000 because site specific θv calibration can be difficult and cost prohibitive in many applications studies have attempted to account for the influence of measurable soil properties e g specific surface area temperature t salinity bulk density organic matter content on θv calibrations using physically based dielectric mixing models dirksen and dasberg 1993 or and wraith 1999 schwartz et al 2009 or empirical corrections jacobsen and schjønning 1993 western and seyfried 2005 kelleners et al 2009b singh et al 2019 however the influence of measurable soil properties is not the only source of error in θv determination using em sensors another source of error is interreplicate variability arising from inconsistencies in sensor hardware and or from sensitivity to microscale differences on one hand the dimensions and em behavior of sensor components may vary among different units of the same em sensor the same permittivity consequently results in different output values on the other hand even under uniform management θv and or other em related soil properties may vary within the representative elementary volume rev if an em sensor responds preferentially to the wetter zones logsdon 2009 and or measures a volume smaller than the rev output values will vary among identical units of that sensor depending on the microscale spatial distribution of θv and or of other em related soil properties although significant interreplicate variability can severely restrict the accuracy of em sensors with and without site specific calibration this type of error has received relatively little attention evett et al 2006 2009 rosenbaum et al 2010 therefore the objective of this study was to quantify the interreplicate variability of eight em sensors under field conditions 2 methods 2 1 sensors the eight em sensors in this study were tdr315 acclima meridian id cs616 campbell scientific logan ut cs655 campbell scientific logan ut hydraprobe2 hp2 stevens water portland or ec5 meter group pullman wa 5te meter group pullman wa teros12 meter group pullman wa and vector probe vp aquaspy san diego ca each of these sensors measures a property that is related to soil permittivity which in turn is positively associated with θv tdr315 is a time domain reflectometer that generates its own em pulses and analyzes its own

2 2 experiments this study was composed of two experiments that were conducted in a medium textured soil under no till corn soybean rotation at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research and extension center in north platte ne in the 2018 experiment two side by side rectangular pits i e the west pit and the east pit were excavated 1 06 m apart each pit was 1 83 m long in the north south direction by 0 46 m wide in the east west direction by 0 41 m deep in each horizontal i e northwest southwest northeast southeast quadrant of each pit one unit each of tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 ec5 5te and teros12 was inserted horizontally into the lengthwise i e west east face of the pit at a depth of 0 30 m until the base of the sensor head was flush with the pit wall the sensor spacing along the length of each pit was 0 13 m and all sensors except hp2 whose prongs are not coplanar were oriented such that all prongs were on the same horizontal plane the excavated soil was carefully backfilled so that the sensor cables were bending downward from the sensor heads before bending upward to exit the pits and so that the top of each pit was neither a mound nor a depression the four units of tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 ec5 and 5te in each pit were connected to the same cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific logan ut for recording sensor readings every 15 min the four units of teros12 in each pit were connected to the same em60 g datalogger meter group pullman wa for recording sensor readings every 15 min and for uploading data every six hours to the manufacturer s website https zentracloud com via telemetry while sensor installation occurred on march 14 15 planting occurred on may 10 specifically soybean seed product p25a12x dupont pioneer johnston ia was planted by hand in 0 19 m rows parallel with the length of the pits i e along the north south direction at a seed spacing of 0 03 m and at a depth of 0 03 m and the previously removed corn residue was once again spread evenly over the site the dense crop stand was intended to create a laterally homogeneous soil moisture distribution so that sensors with varying measurement volumes would be subjected to similar environments in the 2017 experiment which was located 23 m away from the 2018 experiment soybean seed product 2511nrr hoegemeyer hybrids hooper ne was mechanically planted on may 25 in 0 76 m rows along the north south direction at a seed spacing of 0 03 m and at a depth of 0 05 m on june 14 a total of three vps were installed by the manufacturer in two adjacent crop rows such that the vps formed the northwest northeast and southeast corners of a 3 0 m long and 0 76 m wide rectangle the vps were set up to record their sensor readings every 15 min and to upload those readings periodically to the manufacturer s website https agspy aquaspy com via telemetry for comparison a 503dr neutron moisture meter nmm cpn international concord ca was used in this study from each corner of each pit in the 2018 experiment an aluminum access tube was installed 0 30 m outward in the lengthwise direction and 0 06 m outward in the widthwise direction in the 2017 experiment a total of three aluminum access tubes were installed in the same two rows as the vps such that the tubes formed the northwest northeast and southeast corners of a 2 1 m long and 0 76 m wide rectangle enclosed within the rectangle defined by the three vps in both experiments nmm readings were always centered at the depths of the em sensors and were always taken for a count duration of 16 s after the two experiments two intact cylindrical soil cores of 0 04 m diameter and 0 10 m length centering at the sensor depth were collected for each sensor depth within the study areas using a hydraulic direct push soil probe giddings machine company windsor co textural composition and organic matter content were analyzed using the hydrometer and loss on ignition methods respectively by ward laboratories kearney ne the oven dried weight of each core was divided by the original volume of that core to calculate bulk density these soil properties were summarized in table 1 2 3 analyses in this study interreplicate variability was quantified in terms of the sample standard deviation sd eq 1 this definition lumps together the impacts of sensor hardware irregularities and of microscale soil heterogeneities because users tend to leave the em sensors under investigation in place for at least one growing season but tend to carry the same nmm unit between measurement locations users decrease their uncertainty in sample means typically by increasing the number of em sensor units or by increasing the number of nmm access tubes thus the different units of the same em sensor were treated as replicates of that em sensor whereas the different nmm access tubes in the same experiment were treated as replicates of nmm 1 s d i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 where n the number of replicates i the index for replicates xi the variable of interest i e t eca θv cumulative δθv or interval δθv as measured by replicate i of the given sensor at the given time and x the interreplicate mean of the variable of interest for the given sensor at the given time the sole factory θv calibration was applied to tdr315 cs655 5te and nmm respectively in contrast the standard quadratic calibration for cs616 the default loam calibration for hp2 the mineral soil calibration for ec5 and the mineral soil calibration for teros12 were selected from multiple factory θv calibrations the manufacturer of the vp does not recommend any θv calibration but each deviation from the interreplicate mean in scaled frequency 0 100 was multiplied by 0 005 to convert to a deviation from the interreplicate mean in θv 0 0 5 m3 m 3 according to a graph of scaled frequency versus θv from a manufacturer representative sloane 2017 a static assessment of interreplicate variability in θv focused on four instances coinciding with measurement dates of nmm when the sensor depths were near field capacity and were not experiencing root water uptake for tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 ec5 5te teros12 and nmm these four instances were on april 19 april 30 may 4 and may 10 all before germination in the 2018 experiment here the static assessment sd in θv for each of these sensors at each of the four dates included all eight replicates for vp and nmm in the 2017 experiment these four instances were on july 7 july 10 july 12 and july 14 root water uptake was occurring at shallow depths only here the static assessment sd in θv for each of these sensors at each of the four dates included the equivalent of nine replicates pooling together the deviations from depth specific interreplicate means at the 1 00 1 10 and 1 20 m depths among all three replicates of vp or nmm a dynamic assessment of interreplicate variability in θv incorporated all sensor readings from a continuous period of 85 days during the growing season the period from may 11 to august 3 in the 2018 experiment included 18 nmm measurement times for unknown reasons all four replicates of ec5 in the east pit of the 2018 experiment began to report nonsensical θv values from june 9 onward so ec5 was excluded from the dynamic assessment the dynamic assessment sd in θv for tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 5te teros12 or nmm at any given time in 2018 included all eight replicates on the other hand the period from july 6 to september 28 in the 2017 experiment included 33 nmm measurement times the dynamic assessment sd in θv for vp or nmm at any given time in 2017 included all three replicates but was calculated separately at each of the 0 20 0 30 0 40 0 50 0 60 0 70 0 80 and 0 90 m depths in all cases missing or zero values were omitted from sd calculations to some users the magnitudes of changes in θv δθv are more important data than the actual values of θv therefore the interreplicate variability in two types of δθv was investigated for all sensors as a part of the dynamic assessment the first type cumulative δθv was δθv from the first nmm measurement time to each of the latter measurement times the second type interval δθv was δθv from each nmm measurement time except for the last one to the very next nmm measurement time the 2018 and 2017 experiments included 17 and 32 intervals respectively some readers may be interested in how the factory calibrated results would change if adjusted using the local field thermogravimetric θv calibration for the particular nmm unit which achieved an r2 of 0 98 and a resubstitution root mean square error of 0 010 m3 m 3 with 54 soil cores from multiple depths specifically sd values in θv and in δθv for each sensor were multiplied by the linear regression slope that was obtained after averaging among all replicates and then plotting locally calibrated nmm θv against factory calibrated θv from the sensor of interest table 2 although this adjustment was admittedly imperfect schwartz et al 2018 rudnick et al 2018 developing accurate site specific θv calibrations of each em sensor under investigation could not be accomplished given the authors constraints the adjusted results were arguably closer to reality than the factory calibrated results but readers may choose to focus on the factory calibrated results and or the adjusted results the observed ranges in θv by the nmm during this study are listed in table 3 finally some users depend on em sensors to determine not only θv but also t and eca among the eight em sensors in this study tdr315 cs655 hp2 5te teros12 and vp reported t whereas tdr315 cs655 hp2 and 5te reported eca thus the interreplicate variability in t and in eca for these sensors was assessed according to the above methodology for the interreplicate variability in θv however in both the static and the dynamic assessments of interreplicate variability in eca sd from the 2018 experiment included just seven replicates specifically the northwest quadrant of the east pit was excluded because the 5te unit reported nonsensical eca values throughout the experiment for unknown reasons for clarity a summary of this subsection and an outline of the following results and discussion section are provided in table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 static assessment in the static assessment when the soil surrounding the sensors was near field capacity and was not experiencing root water uptake all eight em sensors under investigation exhibited larger interreplicate variability in factory and adjusted θv as compared with nmm table 5 however tdr315 cs655 vp and nmm kept sd below 0 020 m3 m 3 on all four dates with and without adjustment in contrast hp2 exhibited relatively large interreplicate variability in factory and adjusted θv keeping sd above 0 025 m3 m 3 on all four dates adjustment changed the results noticeably for some sensors under evaluation for example among the em sensors 5te showed the smallest interreplicate variability in factory θv but showed the third largest interreplicate variability in adjusted θv the static assessment also examined interreplicate variability in t and eca table 5 cs655 hp2 and 5te exhibited relatively small interreplicate variability in t maintaining sd below 0 4 c on all four dates on the other hand cs655 showed the smallest interreplicate variability in eca maintaining sd below 0 05 ds m 1 on all four dates the exceptionally large interreplicate variability in both t and eca for tdr315 was found to be characterized by substantial and persistent deviation of several replicates from the interreplicate mean specifically the southwest and northeast replicates in the west pit and the southwest replicate in the east pit reported much higher t values than the mean whereas the southeast replicate in the east pit reported much lower t values than the mean on the other hand the northwest replicate in the west pit and the northeast and southeast replicates in the east pit reported much higher eca values than the mean 3 2 dynamic assessment 3 2 1 temperature and apparent electrical conductivity in agreement with the static assessment the dynamic assessment found that interreplicate variability in t remained relatively small for cs655 hp2 5te and teros12 fig 1 the 3rd quartile sd values of these four sensors were still lower than the minimum sd value for tdr315 even though the sd values for tdr315 were already smaller in the dynamic assessment than in the static assessment although the 1st quartile and median sd values were lowest for cs655 the range of sd values was narrowest for 5te and almost all sd values for 5te were below 0 3 c interreplicate variability in t was relatively large for vp fig 1 and as identified earlier for tdr315 was also characterized by substantial and persistent deviation of particular replicates from the interreplicate mean at the seven depths from 0 30 m to 0 90 m t was always highest for the southeast replicate and lowest for the northwest replicate also in agreement with the static assessment the dynamic assessment of interreplicate variability in eca was the lowest for cs655 and highest for tdr315 fig 1 among the three core variables under investigation i e t eca and θv the disparity between the most variable and least variable sensor was largest in eca the median interquartile range and total range of sd in eca for tdr315 were all about 11 times those for cs655 with tdr315 being affected by substantial and persistent deviation of some replicates from the interreplicate mean as noted in the static assessment 3 2 2 volumetric water content at the nmm measurement times during the 2018 dynamic assessment tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 5te and teros12 all exhibited larger interreplicate variability in θv as compared with nmm fig 2 the 1st quartile sd values of these six em sensors were higher than the 3rd quartile sd value of nmm with and without adjustment among these six em sensors the 1st quartile median and 3rd quartile sd values of tdr315 were among the lowest with and without adjustment however the distribution of sd for tdr315 featured a relatively long upper tail where maximum sd was 0 039 and 0 035 m3 m 3 with and without adjustment respectively sd values for hp2 and teros12 also spanned relatively wide ranges in contrast all sd values for cs655 at the nmm measurement times stayed below 0 030 m3 m 3 with and without adjustment dynamic sd values were slightly higher than static sd values for cs655 and teros12 while the reverse was true for hp2 nonetheless static and dynamic sd values in θv were similar in magnitude overall based on the nmm measurement times in the 2018 experiment on the other hand vp did not exhibit consistently larger interreplicate variability in θv than nmm did at the nmm measurement times during the 2017 dynamic assessment fig 2 at shallower depths with and without adjustment sd values for vp were generally higher than those for nmm the opposite however tended to be true at deeper depths as sd values for nmm clearly increased with increasing depth for both vp and nmm adjusted sd values spanned a range wider than 0 03 m3 m 3 at most depths a smaller number of replicates i e three as opposed to eight but a larger number of nmm measurement times i e 33 as opposed to 18 likely contributed to the greater diversity in sd values during the 2018 dynamic assessment as compared with during the 2017 dynamic assessment the effects of wetting and drying on interreplicate variability in θv were examined from the entire 85 day time series fig 3 both for the em sensors under investigation and for nmm rain events that increased θv triggered jumps in its sd this behavior was likely caused by microscale nonuniformity in effective precipitation and subsequent percolation i e preferential flow as opposed to piston flow on the other hand drying sequences generally preserved or steadily decreased sd but sometimes replicates drifted apart as drying continued perhaps the rate and vertical distribution of root water uptake around the replicates were gradually diverging such drifting was found in the 1st quarter of the 2017 dynamic assessment at all vp and nmm depths except for 0 20 m in the 2nd quarter of the 2018 dynamic assessment various extents of such drifting were found for tdr315 cs616 cs655 5te and teros12 but not for hp2 and nmm rises in sd due to replicates drifting apart were not as abrupt as those due to percolating rainfall but the former was still observed to roughly double sd values for vp and nmm in 2017 and for cs655 in 2018 the time series graphs revealed additionally that tdr315 and hp2 experienced obvious fluctuations in θv readings from one reading to another 15 min apart tdr315 showed sudden and erratic spikes in θv whereas hp2 oscillated constantly filtering and smoothing procedures could be employed to enhance data precision amidst the noise 3 2 3 change in volumetric water content examining the interreplicate variability in δθv would not only generate practical information to some users but also shed light into the nature of the interreplicate variability in θv if interreplicate variability in the starting value of θv was the overwhelming reason for interreplicate variability in θv sd values in cumulative δθv would be much smaller than sd values in θv median sd values in adjusted cumulative δθv were 0 010 and 0 006 m3 m 3 smaller than median sd values in adjusted θv for cs616 and cs655 respectively figs 2 and 4 however minimal reductions were observed for other sensors in the 2018 experiment sd values in cumulative δθv were smaller than sd values in θv at some depths for vp and nmm in the 2017 experiment whereas the opposite was true at some other depths for nmm in the 2017 experiment sd values in cumulative δθv did not increase with increasing depth as sd values in θv did the lack of consistently smaller sd values in cumulative δθv than in θv revealed that differences in the starting value of θv were not the dominant source of interreplicate variability during the 2018 and 2017 dynamic assessments the close proximity of all replicates in this study was expected to reduce the observed magnitude of spatial variability in initial θv as compared with arrangements that scattered the replicates across a field at the same time divergences among replicates in effective precipitation root water uptake and or sensor responses prevented the interreplicate differences in θv from remaining constant throughout the dynamic assessment in contrast interreplicate variability in δθv over short intervals of approximately 2 7 days was substantially smaller than interreplicate variability in θv for all sensors except tdr315 figs 2 and 4 the majority of sd values in adjusted interval δθv were below 0 01 m3 m 3 and the sd values for cs616 and vp were mostly comparable to those for nmm nevertheless a strong right skew in the distribution of sd values was especially prevalent among em sensors those relatively large sd values corresponded to the intervals that included or immediately followed infiltration to the sensor depths which was associated earlier with increases in interreplicate variability 4 implications soil moisture sensors are undoubtedly useful but interreplicate variability poses a genuine challenge to the quantitative use of soil moisture sensor data even if the calibration is perfect large interreplicate variability still prevents users from obtaining a confident value of t eca or θv without deploying many replicates in turn data errors resulting from interreplicate variability of soil moisture sensors may propagate to the models to which users supply this data and to the decisions that users make based on this data to reduce interreplicate variability inconsistency in sensor hardware should first be minimized through improved construction manufacturers can choose better parts and procedures that cause greater uniformity and durability in the mechanical and electrical characteristics affecting em signal generation transmission reception and interpretation the inevitably remaining variability in sensor hardware can then be compensated through laboratory standardization of each individual unit rosenbaum et al 2010 during factory calibration finally internal and external damage to sensor hardware may occur after the product leaves the manufacturer i e during shipping installation usage removal and storage so users must be on the alert for obvious physical deformities and for nonsensical data to decide when sensor repair or replacement is necessary under field conditions microscale differences in actual θv and in soil properties that alter the relationship between θv and sensor output cannot be completely eliminated therefore users desiring precision in exact θv are recommended to select soil moisture sensors that have been shown to exhibit small interreplicate variability and to be cautious of sensors that are by design e g operating physical principles em frequency em field uniformity predisposed to high sensitivity to microscale differences evett et al 2006 2009 furthermore such users are advised to maximize the number of replicates under their particular labor and financial constraints and to avoid instantaneous unfiltered data differentiating the contribution of hardware inconsistency versus microscale heterogeneity on interreplicate variability among the em sensors was impossible using only the 2017 and 2018 field experiments data therefore eight replicates of tdr315 cs616 cs655 hp2 ec5 5te and teros12 were immersed one at a time in 10 c acetone sunnyside corporation wheeling il indoors on october 30 2019 acetone served as a suitable reference liquid because it is easily accessible is not overly hazardous and maintains a similar permittivity within the range of frequencies that are employed by the em sensors under evaluation vp was excluded from this laboratory test because no replicates were available for the other seven em sensors the factory calibrated θv from a particular replicate was recorded once the entire measurement volume of that replicate was inside acetone fig 5 regrettably the eight replicates in this laboratory test could not be guaranteed to be exactly the same eight replicates in the 2018 field experiment therefore the results could not be applied to analyze further any systematic deviations from the interreplicate mean i e whether a replicate that was routinely above below average in the field was above below average in acetone or to isolate definitively the sensor hardware effect from the microscale heterogeneity effect furthermore readers must not overgeneralize results from eight replicates nevertheless interreplicate sd in factory θv for acetone was loosely compared to interreplicate sd in factory θv for the 2018 static assessment because the θv corresponding to the permittivity of acetone is similar to θv during the 2018 static assessment according to the interreplicate variability of the em sensors in acetone hardware variability was low for cs616 cs655 and hp2 moderate for tdr315 ec5 and teros12 and high for 5te table 6 on one hand the high acetone static ratio for tdr315 suggests that the potential for reducing its interreplicate variability lies predominantly in improving hardware consistency on the other hand the low acetone static ratio for hp2 suggests that the potential for reducing its interreplicate variability lies predominantly in lowering sensitivity to microscale heterogeneity such sensitivity of hp2 may be related to its small and concentrated measurement volume implying that spatial precision and interreplicate variability might sometimes be tradeoffs that need to be weighed depending on application after all interreplicate variability is only one of many important considerations the user is ultimately responsible for selecting 1 the most scientifically and practically appropriate soil moisture sensors for a particular application 2 the most optimal placement of those sensors given 3 d soil heterogeneity and 3 the most reasonable approach to interpreting and using soil moisture data while accounting for the reality of interreplicate variability users who do not absolutely require the knowledge of θv itself however may wish to reduce their exclusive reliance on the exact θv reading from soil moisture sensors for example many irrigated agronomic crop producers who use soil moisture sensors monitor multiple depths at just one location per field without replication scheduling irrigation strictly based on a fixed θv threshold would be difficult even in the absence of calibration error because sd values in θv of 0 02 m3 m 3 which were commonly observed in this study are approximately between an eighth and a quarter of available water capacity in most soils additionally based on the overall similarity between sd values in θv and sd values in cumulative δθv for the sensors in this study it might not be easier to schedule irrigation strictly based on a fixed cumulative δθv threshold relative to an observational field capacity lo et al 2017 value that is defined early in the season this study suggests that the interreplicate variability for soil moisture sensors should not be blindly assumed to consist mostly of constant offsets persisting throughout the growing season from their experiences in this study and from their interactions with producers and industry the authors have discerned the need to further research unconventional irrigation scheduling approaches that focus on the drying sequences in em sensor data and integrate multiple data sources for instance at the beginning of each drying sequence field capacity at each thoroughly wetted depth might be redefined as the output value corresponding to the end of nonlinear or nighttime decline starr and paltineanu 1998 subsequently the roughly linear and stair step like daytime decline across depths might be related either to a known calibration or to expected rates of crop water use thompson et al 2007 finally a comparison of active extraction depth against expected effective rooting depth t g smith personal communication 2014 and a comparison of current profile depletion against profile allowable depletion merriam 1966 might be jointly considered to make irrigation decisions by depending on the ability of em sensors mainly to describe θv trends and to quantify δθv within each drying sequence starr and paltineanu 1998 singh et al 2018 such an approach might be more accommodating of shortcomings in calibration and or interreplicate variability future field studies that implement and evaluate this type of approach as well as complex ensemble approaches combining soil moisture sensing soil water balance modeling and thermal sensing energy balance modeling barker et al 2018 would be greatly
