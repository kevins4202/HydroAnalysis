11375,a greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of three biochar types on available water contents awc of sandy loam and loamy soils two soil types three different biochar types bt five biochar rates br and five fertilizer levels fr were included in the study the biochar types were produced from rice husk rb bean harvest residue bb and corn cobs cb all of the biochar types were either saturated with nutrient rich dairy effluent de or kept unsaturated while the soils with no addition of biochar types were regarded as control treatment winter wheat triticum aestivum l was grown for two seasons and soil sampling was done following each harvest the mineral fertilizers were applied at the beginning of each season while biochar types were applied only at the beginning of the experiment soil samples were analyzed for total porosity water contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point and thereby awc was calculated soil type bt br and fr had significant effect on water retention and total porosity in both soil types total porosity was significantly lower at higher brs than control the addition of different biochar types continually increased the awc both in sandy loam and loamy soils though the effect was more obvious in the loamy soils however comparing the water retention with 2 0 and 3 0 br relative to the control in the first season the increase rate of awc was much higher in sandy loam soil compared to loamy soil the aging of all three biochar types in second season caused to increase in awc at a rate of 19 9 in rb 6 0 in cb and 6 1 in bb the results revealed that all biochar types used in this experiment can be utilized to improve awc in both sandy loam and loamy soils keywords biochar field capacity wilting point available water total porosity soil texture 1 introduction improving water retention of arable soils in arid and semi arid regions of the world is essential to maintain sustainability of food and fiber demands of increasing population mostly in undeveloped and developing countries a number of attempts such as conservational tillage lampurlanés et al 2016 shao et al 2016 acar et al 2017 mulching alliaume et al 2017 application of organic materials alaoui et al 2011 and the addition of fine particles shanmugam et al 2004 have been made to improve the water holding capacity of soils significant positive influence on water holding capacity of coarse textured soils was reported by the addition of biochar as an organic amendment primarily because of the increased soil porosity kammann et al 2011 liu et al 2016 igalavithana et al 2017 which is a dynamic property and affected by several natural plant roots soil microorganisms or anthropogenic factors soil tillage badorreck et al 2012 liu et al 2017 biochar a pyrolyzed organic material can alter soil hydrology and retain large amounts of water and nutrients due to their high specific surface area van zwieten et al 2009 and porous structure basso et al 2013 the water is retained in the pores inside biochar particles as well as pores created among soil and biochar particles liu et al 2017 thus the effectiveness increases with the increasing rate of biochar application blanco canqui 2017 despite 4 130 increase in available water content of soils by biochar amendment blanco canqui 2017 the results are not consistent due to the differences in feedstock of biochar produced production technology application rate size of particles applied soil type and residence time in soil etc major et al 2012 hardie et al 2014 obia et al 2016 liu et al 2017 mia et al 2017 some studies also reported a decline abel et al 2013 mukherjee and lal 2013 or no effect mollinedo et al 2015 hardie et al 2014 kinney et al 2012 of biochar application on water retention of soils when evaluating the published data on different biochar types care should be given to type of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions and the soil where biochar being applied andrenelli et al 2016 aller et al 2017 water and nutrient holding capacity of soils with high sand contents are low which creates a severe risk of drought in arid and semi arid regions while leads to leaching in humid regions hardie et al 2014 higher water retention ability of biochar amended coarse textured soils helps to retain more amount of plant available water and decrease the leaching of nutrients hardie et al 2014 dokoohaki et al 2017 akhtar et al 2015 stated the positive impact of biochar addition to saline soils by reducing the plant available uptake of na and decreasing osmotic stress by improving soil moisture contents the response of sandy soils to biochar treatment is faster and more prominent than clayey soils application of biochar in coarse textured soils is reported to reduce macropores in favor of meso and micropores which improves the water retention dokoohaki et al 2017 blanco canqui 2017 the biochar as an organic amendment acts as a cementing agent to form stable microaggregates nelissen et al 2015 which facilitate the formation of micropores in soil and enhance water holding capacity of coarse textured soils bruun et al 2014 hansen et al 2016 biochar amendments both fresh and aged significantly increased the water retention of maize grown clay loam soil compared to no biochar application whereas had no influence on silt loam and variable impacts on sandy loam soils aller et al 2017 in contrast to the obvious impact on coarse textured soil addition of straw and wastewater sludge biochar to clay soil improved the formation of macroaggregates 5 0 2 0 mm and 0 25 0 5 mm while microaggregate 0 25 mm decreased with biochar amendment sun and lu 2014 andrenelli et al 2016 also stated the importance of biochar amendment for improving water and air movement in fine textured soils the characteristics of biochar types particle size shape porous structure and size of pores largely depend on the type of feedstock and conditions of pyrolysis i e temperature heating rate duration of retaining etc which play a crucial role in water retention andrenelli et al 2016 liu et al 2017 water retention of different biochar types produced at high temperatures 500 c is higher due to being more hydrophilic than those produced at low temperatures the removal of aliphatic functional groups at higher temperatures increases the affinity of biochar surfaces to water and plant nutrients gray et al 2014 most previous studies conducted to investigate the effects of biochar on soil water retention consisted of a specific type of biochar or a soil however the experiments conducted to compare the effects of different biochar types enriched with liquid manure on water retention of soils with different textures in the same experiment are limited therefore a greenhouse experiment was conducted to compare the influence of different biochar types with various origins on water retention capacity of two different soil types data obtained in this study helps to compare the effects of same biochar on water retention in two different soils and also aid to infer the effect of three biochar types of varying origin on water retention under the same soil conditions 2 materials and methods a greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of different biochar types on the soil water contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point during 2015 2016 wheat growing seasons the greenhouse experiment was conducted at gaziosmanpaşa university tokat turkey 40 33 n 36 47 e 640 m above sea level the greenhouse was maintained at 33 22 5 ºc day night temperature free draining plastic pots 2 25 l with an upper diameter of 17 cm lower diameter of 12 cm and a height of 16 cm were used in the experiments the pots were filled with 1700 g of sandy loam and loamy soils the experimental soils were collected from 0 to 30 cm of an apple orchard and a vegetable production field in kazova basin of tokat province turkey the long term mean annual precipitation and air temperature were 440 mm and 12 4 c respectively gunal et al 2007 the soils used in the experiment were sandy loam and loamy soils the soils were formed over sediments deposited by yesilirmak river and located on river bank and young terraces of the river both soils were classified as fluvisols in world reference base iuss working group 2015 and typic fluvents in soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 following collection soils were air dried and sieved to obtain a fraction of 2 mm to eliminate the skeleton materials 2 1 production and characterization of biochar types the biochar materials used in this study were rice husk oryza sativa l common bean phaseolus vulgaris l harvest residues and corn cobs zea mays l biochars were produced by slow pyrolysis of feedstocks maximum size 2 mm at 500 c in an ingeniously developed lab scale reactor slow pyrolysis process was characterized by slow heating rates a rate of approximately 10 c min 1 and long residence times of biomass the pyrolysis temperature was kept constant at 500 c and biochar was held in the unit until pyrolysis gas disappeared after heating for almost 4 6 hours the biochars were allowed to cool to room temperature the selection of these materials was purely based on their easy availability in tokat province turkey the physicochemical characteristics of all biochar types are presented in table 1 the ph and ec of the biochars were measured in deionized water at the ratio of 1 10 wtwt 1 ratio the biochar samples were thoroughly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h the ph and ec were then measured using an orion 720 ph ec meter with a combination electrode the total c and n contents of were determined using a leco cn 2000 analyzer leco corp st joseph mi usa at 1200 c ethylene glycol mono ethyl ether egme method was to measure specific surface area typically used for soils cerato and lutenegger 2002 cation exchange capacity was determined by ammonium acetate method chapman 1965 all biochar types were alkaline with ph values of 8 90 7 70 and 9 80 for rice husk rb corn cobs cb and bean harvest residue bb biochar types respectively depending on biomass and temperature in pyrolysis the c n ratio of biochar show high variability the c n ratio of biochars produced from 60 different biomasses ranged from 7 to 192 sun et al 2017 the c n ratios of biochars used in the experiment were 124 110 and 416 for rb cb and bb respectively 2 2 treatments and experimental design the experiments were laid out according to the factorial design soil textures were taken as main factor biochar types as sub factor biochar application rates as sub sub factor while fertilizer application rates were treated as sub sub sub factor thus the experiment consisted of 2 soil type 3 biochar types 5 biochar application rates 5 fertilizer application rates all of the treatments had three replications and experiments were repeated over time the treatments of the experiment were 1 soil textures loamy and sandy loam 2 biochar types rice husk corn cob and bean harvest residue 3 biochar application rates 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 g g biochar application rates are equivalent to 11 25 t ha 0 5 22 5 t ha 1 0 45 ton ha 2 0 and 67 5 ton ha 3 0 and 4 fertilizer application rate biochar saturated with dairy effluent without mineral fertilizers fr1 biochar saturated with dairy effluent bde 1 4th of mineral fertilizer needed for wheat growth fr2 bde 1 2 fertilizer fr3 bde complete fertilizer fr4 and biochar without dairy effluent but with complete fertilizer fr5 since biochar is c rich stable materials and decompose very slowly lehmann and joseph 2015 they were applied once at the beginning of the experiment plant nutrients required for winter wheat were added in the form of liquid solution to the soil at the beginning of each growing season the soils were thoroughly mixed with biochar types and nutrients in a separate washbowl and transferred to the pots the seeds were planted on october 28 2015 and march 16 2016 in the first and second seasons respectively plants were irrigated with deionized water on a daily basis to keep soil moisture content close to field capacity although studies showed that biochar properties still change over time downie et al 2009 very scarce information is available regarding how biochar aging influences soil water retention and total porosity therefore effect of biochar types on water retention was investigated by collecting soil samples at 59 and 220 days after biochar incorporation biochars were added to the soils on 28th of october the plants were harvested at the stem elongation stage at each growing season first soil sampling was done after the first wheat harvest on december 25 2015 while second soil samples were taken following the second harvest on june 8 2016 the term aging effect was used to indicate the soil samples collected following the second growing season the aging of biochar is defined as short term or long term aging depending on the time required for hydration and oxidation of biochar particles which is called short term aging and physical and chemical breakdown of biochar particles chemical changes in organic compounds and neutralization of alkaline nature mia et al 2017 in our study biochar types are considered as short aged 2 3 laboratory analyses particle size distribution of soils were determined by hydrometer method in a sedimentation cylinder using sodium hexamethaphosphate as dispersing agent gee and bauder 1986a b organic matter was determined by dichromate oxidation using the modified walkley black method nelson and sommers 1996 organic carbon was converted to soil organic matter content multiplying by the conversion factor of 1 72 the soil reaction ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in a saturated paste rhoades 1982 the caco3 content was determined by using calcimeter method as mentioned by allison and moodie 1965 the pressure plate method was used for determining the water contents held at 0 33 bar and 15 bar matric potential klute 1986 the field capacity fc is defined as the water held in soil at 0 33 bar of suction pressure and can easily be extracted by plants while water contents at 15 bar suction pressure are known as permanent wilting point pwp and water beyond pwp is not available for the plants hillel 1980 the metal rings were used to determine water retained at 0 33 bar while rubber rings 1 cm height and 3 cm diameter were used to determine water retained 15 bars soil samples were placed in a pressure membrane apparatus and 0 33 and 15 bar suction pressures were applied after the equilibrium reached the oven dried weight of soil samples was determined after heating at 105 c for 24 h the plant available water content awc was calculated as the difference between gravimetric water content at field capacity 0 33 bar and permanent wilting point 15 bar all water content values calculated from the laboratory water retention curves reported on a gravimetric basis g g soil bulk density was determined on undisturbed soil cores blake and hartge 1986 although data on bulk density have not been presented here it was used for the calculation of total porosity the total porosity was only determined at the end of the second growing season because each undisturbed soil core removed around 150 160 g soil from the pots the soil sampled for each season was almost 100 g for the physical chemical and biological analyses so we could not afford to lose soil samples for bulk density at each growing season total porosity of soils was calculated using the dry bulk density and particle density 2 65 g cm 3 values in the relationship developed by danielson and sutherland 1986 this method assumes that soil porosity is the fraction of total volume not occupied by soil assuming a particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 danielson and sutherland 1986 total porosity 1 bulk density g cm 3 2 65 g cm 3 2 4 data analysis the normality of the data was tested prior to statistical evaluation the data had normal distribution the levene s test was performed to confirm equality of variances of fc pwp awc and total porosity between replicated measurements four way analysis of variance anova technique was used to test the differences between treatments least significant difference test lsd at 0 05 level of probability was used test to assess the differences among the means bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the significance level of multiple comparisons the difference in soil water contents between two growing seasons was tested by a paired t test all the statistical analyses were conducted using spss spss inc chicago il usa statistical software version 21 the results presented here included both individual effects soil type biochar type biochar application rate and fertilizer application rate on soil water and total porosity and two way interactions among individual factors data for individual factors and two way interactions except biochar types fertilizer application rate have been given in tables 3 6 three and four way interactions have not been presented due to the large tables and avoiding the repetition anova results of three and four way interaction are given in a separate table and the interactions were evaluated by a general discussion 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of individual factors on soil water retention the difference in soil water contents between two growing seasons of wheat under controlled conditions was significant p 0 01 thus the data was analyzed separately for both seasons table 2 3 1 1 soil type the soil type had significant effect p 0 01 on fc pwp and awc that were higher in loamy soils than sandy loam soil fig 1 the total porosity was also significantly higher in loamy soil 49 6 than sandy soil 46 3 the aging of biochar increased the fc of loamy soil by 7 6 while water content at pwp were not affected in contrast to loamy soil pwp decreased with aging by 10 5 and fc did not significantly vary in sandy loam soil the awc in the second season increased by 11 9 in loamy soil due to the higher water content in fc and 8 1 in sandy loam soil due to the lower water content in pwp the higher awc in loamy soil is apparently resulting from the higher total porosity of loamy soil compared to sandy soil 3 1 2 biochar type all of the biochar types had significant effects p 0 01 on soil water contents at fc pwp and awc during both growing seasons with pwp an exception in the first season andrenelli et al 2016 also reported no difference in terms of pwp by two types of biochar obtained by the same feedstock but differing for pyrolysis process the biochar types had also significant impact on the total porosity of soils soils containing rb had significantly higher total porosity compared to soils with cb and bb soils with rb in the first season had the lowest fc 17 0 pwp 7 5 and awc 9 46 while bb application resulted the highest water contents for fc 18 2 pwp 7 6 and awc 10 6 in contrast to the first season the highest fc 18 7 pwp 7 3 and awc 11 3 values in the second season were obtained in soils with rb treatments fig 2 the highest water content of soils with rb treatment is consistent with the highest total porosity of soils treated with rb in the second season the moisture contents of soils at pwp in all biochar applications showed a decrease compared to the first season this decrease was 2 4 in rb 4 2 in cb and 8 7 in bb treatment after incorporation to the soil exposure to water by time causes conversion of hydrophobic surfaces of biochar types into hydrophilic das and sarmah 2015 which may have improved the water retention at lower tensions and have negative effect on water retention at higher tension the awc was increased by the aging of all three biochar types at a rate of 19 9 in rb 6 0 in cb and 6 1 in bb the differences in water contents between two growing seasons necessitate the importance of long term studies to make a reliable suggestion for biochar types aller et al 2017 have concluded that aged biochars may have different influence on soil water retention relative to freshly produced biochar thus the results obtained in a short term experiment with fresh biochar amendment may not be useful to predict the long term effects of biochar the reports on the effects of biochar types on water retention are contradictory due to the differences in biochar types application rate age dahooki et al 2017 pyrolysis conditions and soils treated jeffery et al 2015 reported that the hydrophobicity of the biochar significantly reduced the infiltration of water into the biochar particles which prevented the water from being held in the soil in contrast biochar application to mesic typic hapludolls increased the moisture contents at 0 33 bar 1 0 bar and 5 0 bar pressure suction by 15 13 and 10 respectively laird et al 2010 the specific surface areas of cb rb and bb were 398 212 and 118 m2 g 1 respectively table 1 the increase in soil water retention with biochar amendment has been attributed to the porous structure and higher surface area verheijen et al 2010 sandhu and kumar 2017 however the higher surface area of cb compared to rb and bb did not improve the moisture retention of soils with cb application the highest awc in the first season was recorded with bb 10 6 which had the lowest surface area during the second season the highest awc value 11 3 was observed in rb treatment the increase or decrease in water contents and total porosity of soils treated with different biochar types may not only be related to the specific surface area of biochar materials but may also be influenced by the differences in other biochar features i e particle size shape and internal structure which cause a significant change in pore characteristics of soils liu et al 2017 sandhu and kumar 2017 the hydrophobic nature of varying biochar materials may also cause differences in water retention biochars produced from forest wastes are naturally hydrophobic page dumroese et al 2015 though kinney et al 2012 reported that the extent of water repellence of biochars may vary depending on both the nature of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions 3 1 3 biochar application rate biochar application rate had significant effects p 0 01 on water contents at fc pwp and awc and total porosity of soils the increased rate of biochar significantly improved the water retention at fc and pwp and total porosity fig 3 the addition of highly porous biochar materials to the soils linearly increased the total porosity and moisture contents increase in total porosity can be related to improvement in soil aggregation interaction of biochars with mineral particles and reduced soil compaction blanco canqui 2017 during the first season moisture content at fc was increased by 0 2 2 5 5 7 and 9 3 by br2 br3 br4 br5 respectively compared to control treatment of the study similar trend was observed in the second growing season fig 3 the total porosity of soils with 3 0 biochar amendment was 7 2 higher compared to the control treatment the changes in water contents and total porosity were the results of interactions between the soil and the applied biochar particles the increase in soil water contents and total porosity with the increased biochar addition are in accordance with dokoohaki et al 2017 who applied red oak wood biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c to sandy loam soil biochar amendment at 3 and 6 rates significantly increased the porosity compared to the control treatment and caused a significant increase in water content retained both in fc and pwp the increase in water content at lower tensions such as field capacity has also been associated to the increase in total porosity by several other studies hardie et al 2014 sun et al 2015 igalavithana et al 2017 the pores in biochar particles might be considered as the main contributors of higher total porosity of soils furthermore increased aggregate stability and higher soil biota in biochar amended soils may also cause to higher soil porosity hardie et al 2014 the biochar addition at 0 5 rate did not cause any significant change in pwp though further increase in biochar rate increased the water content at pwp relative to control by 2 1 5 1 and 6 3 with br3 br4 and br5 treatments respectively similar increases in pwp water content with respect to biochar rate treatments were obtained in the second season the results obtained are consistent with the findings from hardie et al 2014 who did not find any significant increase in pwp with lower rate of biochar addition however significant increase in pwp was reported with the addition of 20 biochar and attributed this to the increase in microporosity the increase of water retention at higher tensions with higher doses of biochar types relative to control and lower doses has also been related to the increase in specific surface area abel et al 2013 ulyett et al 2014 liu et al 2017 ulyett et al 2014 indicated that the higher specific surface area of biochar increased the ability of soil to hold more water at high matric tensions compared to the first season the fc at the end of the second season was higher in all treatments in contrast to fc water content at pwp was lower than the first season the awc had a similar trend as fc significantly increased higher br application rate fig 3 the highest awc in both seasons was obtained with br5 and the lowest was observed in control treatment in the first season the awc in br5 treatment was 11 5 higher than control treatment similarly the awc increased by 7 8 with br4 and 8 8 by br5 treatments during the second season fig 3 application of each mg ha 1 biochar produced by pyrolysis of eucalyptus wood increased the awc of sandy loam soil by a rate of 0 8 the increase in awc was attributed to the positive effect of biochar on total porosity of sandy loam soil water content at saturation and macro porosity of soil increased by 0 5 and 1 6 with each of mg ha 1 biochar application compared to no biochar amendment respectively carvalho de melo et al 2014 water retention of soils is expected to increase with aging of biochar relative to the fresh biochar due to lower hydrophobicity of biochar with aging ojeda et al 2015 mia et al 2017 observed improvement in water holding capacity of soils due to the changes in physicochemical properties of biochars by time biochar application improved awc though the rate of increase in the first season was higher relative to increase in the second season the findings of kerré et al 2017 supports the higher water retention of soils with aged biochar soils under historical charcoal kilns more than 150 years reported to retain 11 0 higher awc than the adjacent regular arable soils in belgium kerré et al 2017 the pwp content of soils in the second season decreased compared to the first season the decrease in pwp water content with the aging of biochars will contribute positively to the high pwp moisture content problem 3 1 4 fertilizer application rate fertilizer application rates had significant effects p 0 01 on fc pwp awc and total porosity of soils fig 4 the highest fc in the first season was obtained with fr5 17 9 whereas fr2 18 8 caused the highest fc in the second season fig 4 there was no significant relationship between the decrease or increase in fr and awc in both seasons while the first four treatments in the first season were statistically similar to each other in terms of awc the fr5 treatment caused a 3 3 increase in awc compared to fr1 in the second season the awc in fr2 and fr3 doses were higher compared to awc in fr1 treatment whereas awc in fr4 and fr5 treatments where full fertilization performed was decreased by 4 3 and 2 9 respectively compared to control the lowest fc in both seasons was observed in fr4 treatment 17 2 and 17 8 the fc values in fr treatments were mostly lower compared to the control fr1 treatment 3 2 interactions of factors on soil water retention 3 2 1 interaction of soil type and biochar type soil water contents at fc and pwp awc and total porosity were significantly p 0 01 affected by the interactions of soil type and biochar type table 3 the improvement of water holding capacity in biochar amended soils is reported due to the combined effects of soil and biochar type biochar amendment rate and biochar properties barnes et al 2014 andrenelli et al 2016 similarly gray et al 2014 also indicated the influence of feedstock and production technology on water uptake potential of biochars in contrast to these findings aller et al 2017 could not distinguish the effects of twelve different biochar types on biochar s ability to retain water the lowest water content at fc in both growing season was obtained with sandy loam soil rb interaction 14 9 and 14 8 while the highest fc in the first season was obtained with loamy soil bb interactions 21 2 and in the second season was with loamy soil rb 20 9 interactions the fc water content of sandy loam soil was significantly lower compared to that of loamy soil in all biochar types the highest pwp was observed in loamy soil bb 8 0 loamy cb 7 8 interactions during first and second growth seasons respectively the lowest pwp values in both seasons were noted in sandy loam soil bb interactions 7 1 and 6 2 the pwp values of second season increased by 4 0 and 1 6 with rb and cb respectively in the loamy soils compared with the first season while pwp was decreased with bb by 5 0 in contrast to loamy soil water content at pwp was significantly decreased with the aging of all biochar types in sandy loam soil table 3 in the first season the highest awc 13 3 was recorded in loamy soil with bb while the highest awc in the second season was observed under rb treatment 15 0 compared with other two biochar types the highest awc in loamy soils with rb during the second season is consistent with the highest mean total porosity value of soils containing rb in sandy loam soil the highest awc 8 5 in the first season was noted with cb whereas the bb treatment had the highest awc 9 2 during the second season the main reason of the differences obtained in awc for the same soil type is probably related to the differences in inherent properties of three biochar types shown by specific surface area cation exchange capacity and other characteristics table 1 the awc in the second season for both soil types was higher compared to the first season the increase in fc and awc shows that the aging of biochar probably improved the stability of aggregates and reduced water retention at the pwp the highest difference in awc between the two seasons was observed with rb in loamy soil 27 2 and by bb in sandy loam soil 15 6 these findings are consistent with the studies reporting the hydrophobicity of biochars das and sarmah 2015 aller et al 2017 mia et al 2017 aged biochars relative to their fresh ones were found to be less hydrophobic which helped to retain more water by time mia et al 2017 irrigation of plants throughout two growing seasons helped biochar particles to be less hydrophilic aller et al 2017 which lead to higher awc of soils treated with all three types of biochars 3 2 2 interaction of soil type and biochar application rate the soil type biochar rate interactions revealed that water content at fc was similar to all biochar application rates however the interaction appeared statistically significant p 0 01 at the end of the second season table 4 water contents of soils under aged biochar doses were significantly higher compared to the control treatments while the effect of soil type and biochar dose factors on fc moisture content in the first season was non significant p 0 1650 while quite significant during the second season the highest fc moisture contents during the first season in the soil br interactions during both seasons were obtained by interactions of loam soil br5 20 9 and 22 0 and lowest fc values were recorded in sandy loam soil br1 14 6 and 14 0 interactions the highest fc moisture contents in both soils were observed with br5 3 0 biochar which is the highest biochar dose and the lowest fc moisture contents were recorded by the control br1 treatment table 4 increasing amount of biochar caused an increase in total porosity of both soils thus led to higher moisture contents at fc the increment in moisture contents at fc was higher in sandy loam soil than loamy soil for each biochar dose the highest fc moisture content increase compared to the control treatment was observed in the interactions of sandy loam br5 by 10 9 and 11 1 in first and second growth season respectively the significant increase in water content and total porosity with higher biochar application rate observed in this study is consistent with findings of other researchers jeffery et al 2011 reported that biochar pores improve the porosity of coarse textured soil and enhance the soil water retention improvement in the ability of soils to retain and maintain high water content during drought periods makes biochar as an important additive material especially for arid and semi arid regions nelissen et al 2015 the effects of biochar aging even at lower biochar doses were more obvious in sandy loam soils compared to the first season considering the residual effect water retention at fc with lower biochar doses 0 5 and 1 0 in sandy loam soil were higher at the rates of 8 3 and 9 9 compared to control in both soil types the highest pwp values were obtained with br5 and the lowest values were found in br1 doses except for the first season of loam soil the highest biochar rate resulted in an increase of pwp of loamy soil by 7 7 and 5 7 rates in the first and second seasons respectively compared to control treatment for the sandy loam soil the increase in pwp with br5 relative to control was 4 9 and 6 5 for the first and second seasons table 4 the findings on increased pwp with biochar amendment are partially consistent with the data reported by aller et al 2017 who found increased soil water retention at pwp with fresh biochar and decreased pwp moisture content with aged biochar similar findings for higher water retention at pwp with biochar amendment have also been reported by hansen et al 2016 who attributed the results to higher water retention at fc as in our case however our results that biochar addition has positive influence on pwp partially differ from the findings of hardie et al 2014 who found non significant effect of biochar addition of 5 to pwp while significant increase in pwp with 20 biochar in a clay loam soil in both growing seasons the awc of sandy soil for all br treatments remained significantly lower than the loamy soil the addition of biochars continually increased the awc of both soils though the effect was higher in the loamy soil higher biochar amendment considerably increased the awc in the loamy soil while the differences between the control and br5 treatments were more pronounced in sandy loam soil table 4 comparing the water retention of br1 with br4 and br5 for the first season the increase of awc was much higher in sandy loam soil compared to loamy soil the improvements in soil water holding capacity by biochar application especially in coarse textured soils have also been reported by glaser et al 2002 and nelissen et al 2015 moragues saitua et al 2017 reported that the ability of the biochar to retain water can vary considerably depending on soil type the effect of soils on awc was generally associated with improved porosity surface area and sorption capacity of biochars compared to other organic wastes downie et al 2009 sandhu and kumar 2017 3 2 3 interaction of soil type and fertilizer application rate significant interaction p 0 01 of soil type and fertilizer application rate was found for fc pwp awc and total porosity table 5 the highest mean fc and awc moisture content was obtained in loamy soil fr5 interactions 20 4 and 12 8 and loamy soil fr3 22 3 and 14 6 interaction during first and second growth season respectively the lowest mean fc and pwp were obtained by interactions of sandy loam soil fr4 14 6 and 6 9 in the first season and sandy loam soil fr3 14 5 and 6 3 in the second season the lowest fc moisture contents in loamy soil were obtained by fr1 treatment during both seasons the increase in the fr resulted in an increase in fc moisture content of loamy sols during both periods whereas fc moisture content at fr1 was higher relative to other fr treatments in sandy loam soil the highest pwp values was recorded in sandy loam soil fr1 8 0 and loamy soil fr4 8 0 interactions during first and second growth season the lowest pwp were noted in sandy loam soil fr4 6 9 and sandy loam soil fr3 6 3 interactions in the first and second seasons respectively 3 2 4 interaction of biochar and fertilizer application rates biochar and fertilizer application rate interactions had significant p 0 01 effects on fc pwp awc in both seasons and total porosity in the second season table 6 the highest mean fc values in the first period were obtained by br5 fr5 19 1 and in the second season with br5 fr2 19 7 interactions on the other hand the lowest fc moisture content was observed with br1 fr3 16 5 and br2 fr5 17 2 interactions during first and second growth season the highest fc moisture contents in both seasons were obtained under br4 and br5 in all fr doses in both seasons the highest pwp was recorded under br5 fr5 8 0 and 7 7 interactions while the lowest was noted in br1 fr3 6 9 and br1 fr2 6 7 interactions table 6 no significant decrease or increase was observed between the fr and the change in awc under the different brs in both seasons the awc increased in some treatments while some of the treatments caused a decrease in awc table 6 however water retention significantly increased with the increase in br at a given fr treatment even in the case of fr1 fr2 and fr3 which did not contain adequate plant nutrients the increase in awc by the addition of biochar enabled plants to utilize the existing sources more effectively the highest awc in the first season was obtained in br5 fr1 11 0 and br5 fr5 11 0 treatments whereas br5 fr2 12 5 interactions resulted in the highest awc during the second growth season table 6 however the lowest awc was noted in br1 fr1 9 4 and br5 fr4 10 0 during first and second growth season respectively 3 2 5 interaction of biochar type and biochar application rate biochar type and application rate interactions had significant effects p 0 01 on water contents at fc pwp awc and total porosity table 7 the highest fc in the first season with all biochar types were obtained with br5 as 17 5 for rb 18 5 for cb and 19 6 for bb the lowest fc values were obtained in rb br2 16 5 cb br1 and cb br2 16 9 and 16 9 and bb br1 17 1 interactions the lowest fc moisture contents of the second season were observed in br1 treatments of all three biochar types in contrast the highest fc values were observed in br2 19 1 with rb br4 18 4 with cb and in br5 19 2 with bb the increase in fc with the increase of br was prominent in bb treatments for both growing seasons the br4 and br5 treatments of bean biochar compared to br1 increased fc moisture content by 9 4 and 14 2 and 11 0 and 13 8 in the first and second seasons respectively the highest pwp were recorded with bb br5 7 9 and rb br5 7 5 treatments in the first and second season respectively table 7 the lowest pwp moisture contents were found with cb br2 7 2 and bb br1 6 5 interactions during first and second season the increase in biochar rate and water retained at pwp was in good agreement for all three types in both seasons the highest awc was obtained in bb br5 11 7 and 12 0 interactions table 7 the awc of the soils was significantly increased with the addition of all three types of biochar the increase in awc is directly proportional to the br increase in cb and bb applied soils the amount of water retained in the soil was increased with the increase in biochar addition for example in bean biochar application during the first season the increase in awc compared to br1 was higher at a rate of 4 3 with br2 4 8 with br3 11 8 with br4 and 18 6 with br5 the tendency to increase in awc with increased br was similar in the second season the increase rate of awc compared to br1 in the second season was 5 6 br2 8 5 br3 12 7 br4 and 16 0 br5 the rest of interactions of factors presented in table 8 had significant impacts on soil water retention and total porosity of soils 3 3 relationship between biochar application water retention and dry matter yield the relationship between shoot dry matter sdm yield and fc pwp and awc were varied depending on soil type the sdm yield of wheat had significant positive p 0 01 correlations with fc pwp and awc of loamy soil in the first growing season whereas sdm yield had significant negative correlations with fc p 0 05 and awc p 0 01 and no correlation with pwp of sandy loam soil similarly plant phosphorus p concentration had significant p 0 01 positive correlations p 0 01 with fc pwp and awc of loamy soil and negative correlations with fc pwp and awc of sandy loam soil the increase in awc content had significant positive effect on sdm yield plant k p and n concentrations of wheat at the first growing season in loamy soil while sdm yield plant fe k and p concentrations negatively affected by increase in awc in sandy soil similar findings for effects of biochar application on awc and crop performance were also reported by others kammann et al 2011 hansen et al 2016 hansen et al 2016 showed that straw gasified and wood gasified biochar applications caused an increase in awc by 18 and 17 in sandy loam and 42 and 31 in coarse sandy soil respectively they have also stated that straw gasified biochar application to coarse sandy soil increased the shoot growth by 165 while wood gasified biochar had a negative effect on shoot growth despite the positive effect on awc the interactions of factors such as biochar application rate biochar characteristics and soil texture cause varying effects of biochar application on water retention and plant growth table 9 4 conclusions impacts of three different biochar types on water retention of two soils differing in texture have been examined in a greenhouse experiment by growing winter wheat all biochar types used in the study improved the hydrological properties of loamy and sandy loam soils though differences in inherent properties of three biochar materials resulted in varied water retention for the same soil type the results revealed that biochar application had positive influence on water retention of loamy and sandy loam soils due to significant improvement in total porosity though the impact on sandy soil was more prominent compared to loamy soil the positive impact of increased biochar rates was higher especially at lower matric potentials as in field capacity however we only determined water retained at 0 33 bar and 15 bar suction pressures the higher water contents obtained at the end of second growing season relative to the first season show the importance of long lasting influence of biochars on improving water holding capacity of coarse textures soils improving water holding capacity of coarse textured soils means maintaining higher amount of water during drought periods this makes biochar as an important additive material especially for arid and semi arid regions in conclusion all of the tested biochar types can be used for improving water retention of coarse textured soils under arid and semi arid conditions acknowledgements the authors feel indebted to dr hikmet günal and dr shahid farooq for their valuable comments and careful

11375,a greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of three biochar types on available water contents awc of sandy loam and loamy soils two soil types three different biochar types bt five biochar rates br and five fertilizer levels fr were included in the study the biochar types were produced from rice husk rb bean harvest residue bb and corn cobs cb all of the biochar types were either saturated with nutrient rich dairy effluent de or kept unsaturated while the soils with no addition of biochar types were regarded as control treatment winter wheat triticum aestivum l was grown for two seasons and soil sampling was done following each harvest the mineral fertilizers were applied at the beginning of each season while biochar types were applied only at the beginning of the experiment soil samples were analyzed for total porosity water contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point and thereby awc was calculated soil type bt br and fr had significant effect on water retention and total porosity in both soil types total porosity was significantly lower at higher brs than control the addition of different biochar types continually increased the awc both in sandy loam and loamy soils though the effect was more obvious in the loamy soils however comparing the water retention with 2 0 and 3 0 br relative to the control in the first season the increase rate of awc was much higher in sandy loam soil compared to loamy soil the aging of all three biochar types in second season caused to increase in awc at a rate of 19 9 in rb 6 0 in cb and 6 1 in bb the results revealed that all biochar types used in this experiment can be utilized to improve awc in both sandy loam and loamy soils keywords biochar field capacity wilting point available water total porosity soil texture 1 introduction improving water retention of arable soils in arid and semi arid regions of the world is essential to maintain sustainability of food and fiber demands of increasing population mostly in undeveloped and developing countries a number of attempts such as conservational tillage lampurlanés et al 2016 shao et al 2016 acar et al 2017 mulching alliaume et al 2017 application of organic materials alaoui et al 2011 and the addition of fine particles shanmugam et al 2004 have been made to improve the water holding capacity of soils significant positive influence on water holding capacity of coarse textured soils was reported by the addition of biochar as an organic amendment primarily because of the increased soil porosity kammann et al 2011 liu et al 2016 igalavithana et al 2017 which is a dynamic property and affected by several natural plant roots soil microorganisms or anthropogenic factors soil tillage badorreck et al 2012 liu et al 2017 biochar a pyrolyzed organic material can alter soil hydrology and retain large amounts of water and nutrients due to their high specific surface area van zwieten et al 2009 and porous structure basso et al 2013 the water is retained in the pores inside biochar particles as well as pores created among soil and biochar particles liu et al 2017 thus the effectiveness increases with the increasing rate of biochar application blanco canqui 2017 despite 4 130 increase in available water content of soils by biochar amendment blanco canqui 2017 the results are not consistent due to the differences in feedstock of biochar produced production technology application rate size of particles applied soil type and residence time in soil etc major et al 2012 hardie et al 2014 obia et al 2016 liu et al 2017 mia et al 2017 some studies also reported a decline abel et al 2013 mukherjee and lal 2013 or no effect mollinedo et al 2015 hardie et al 2014 kinney et al 2012 of biochar application on water retention of soils when evaluating the published data on different biochar types care should be given to type of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions and the soil where biochar being applied andrenelli et al 2016 aller et al 2017 water and nutrient holding capacity of soils with high sand contents are low which creates a severe risk of drought in arid and semi arid regions while leads to leaching in humid regions hardie et al 2014 higher water retention ability of biochar amended coarse textured soils helps to retain more amount of plant available water and decrease the leaching of nutrients hardie et al 2014 dokoohaki et al 2017 akhtar et al 2015 stated the positive impact of biochar addition to saline soils by reducing the plant available uptake of na and decreasing osmotic stress by improving soil moisture contents the response of sandy soils to biochar treatment is faster and more prominent than clayey soils application of biochar in coarse textured soils is reported to reduce macropores in favor of meso and micropores which improves the water retention dokoohaki et al 2017 blanco canqui 2017 the biochar as an organic amendment acts as a cementing agent to form stable microaggregates nelissen et al 2015 which facilitate the formation of micropores in soil and enhance water holding capacity of coarse textured soils bruun et al 2014 hansen et al 2016 biochar amendments both fresh and aged significantly increased the water retention of maize grown clay loam soil compared to no biochar application whereas had no influence on silt loam and variable impacts on sandy loam soils aller et al 2017 in contrast to the obvious impact on coarse textured soil addition of straw and wastewater sludge biochar to clay soil improved the formation of macroaggregates 5 0 2 0 mm and 0 25 0 5 mm while microaggregate 0 25 mm decreased with biochar amendment sun and lu 2014 andrenelli et al 2016 also stated the importance of biochar amendment for improving water and air movement in fine textured soils the characteristics of biochar types particle size shape porous structure and size of pores largely depend on the type of feedstock and conditions of pyrolysis i e temperature heating rate duration of retaining etc which play a crucial role in water retention andrenelli et al 2016 liu et al 2017 water retention of different biochar types produced at high temperatures 500 c is higher due to being more hydrophilic than those produced at low temperatures the removal of aliphatic functional groups at higher temperatures increases the affinity of biochar surfaces to water and plant nutrients gray et al 2014 most previous studies conducted to investigate the effects of biochar on soil water retention consisted of a specific type of biochar or a soil however the experiments conducted to compare the effects of different biochar types enriched with liquid manure on water retention of soils with different textures in the same experiment are limited therefore a greenhouse experiment was conducted to compare the influence of different biochar types with various origins on water retention capacity of two different soil types data obtained in this study helps to compare the effects of same biochar on water retention in two different soils and also aid to infer the effect of three biochar types of varying origin on water retention under the same soil conditions 2 materials and methods a greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of different biochar types on the soil water contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point during 2015 2016 wheat growing seasons the greenhouse experiment was conducted at gaziosmanpaşa university tokat turkey 40 33 n 36 47 e 640 m above sea level the greenhouse was maintained at 33 22 5 ºc day night temperature free draining plastic pots 2 25 l with an upper diameter of 17 cm lower diameter of 12 cm and a height of 16 cm were used in the experiments the pots were filled with 1700 g of sandy loam and loamy soils the experimental soils were collected from 0 to 30 cm of an apple orchard and a vegetable production field in kazova basin of tokat province turkey the long term mean annual precipitation and air temperature were 440 mm and 12 4 c respectively gunal et al 2007 the soils used in the experiment were sandy loam and loamy soils the soils were formed over sediments deposited by yesilirmak river and located on river bank and young terraces of the river both soils were classified as fluvisols in world reference base iuss working group 2015 and typic fluvents in soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 following collection soils were air dried and sieved to obtain a fraction of 2 mm to eliminate the skeleton materials 2 1 production and characterization of biochar types the biochar materials used in this study were rice husk oryza sativa l common bean phaseolus vulgaris l harvest residues and corn cobs zea mays l biochars were produced by slow pyrolysis of feedstocks maximum size 2 mm at 500 c in an ingeniously developed lab scale reactor slow pyrolysis process was characterized by slow heating rates a rate of approximately 10 c min 1 and long residence times of biomass the pyrolysis temperature was kept constant at 500 c and biochar was held in the unit until pyrolysis gas disappeared after heating for almost 4 6 hours the biochars were allowed to cool to room temperature the selection of these materials was purely based on their easy availability in tokat province turkey the physicochemical characteristics of all biochar types are presented in table 1 the ph and ec of the biochars were measured in deionized water at the ratio of 1 10 wtwt 1 ratio the biochar samples were thoroughly mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h the ph and ec were then measured using an orion 720 ph ec meter with a combination electrode the total c and n contents of were determined using a leco cn 2000 analyzer leco corp st joseph mi usa at 1200 c ethylene glycol mono ethyl ether egme method was to measure specific surface area typically used for soils cerato and lutenegger 2002 cation exchange capacity was determined by ammonium acetate method chapman 1965 all biochar types were alkaline with ph values of 8 90 7 70 and 9 80 for rice husk rb corn cobs cb and bean harvest residue bb biochar types respectively depending on biomass and temperature in pyrolysis the c n ratio of biochar show high variability the c n ratio of biochars produced from 60 different biomasses ranged from 7 to 192 sun et al 2017 the c n ratios of biochars used in the experiment were 124 110 and 416 for rb cb and bb respectively 2 2 treatments and experimental design the experiments were laid out according to the factorial design soil textures were taken as main factor biochar types as sub factor biochar application rates as sub sub factor while fertilizer application rates were treated as sub sub sub factor thus the experiment consisted of 2 soil type 3 biochar types 5 biochar application rates 5 fertilizer application rates all of the treatments had three replications and experiments were repeated over time the treatments of the experiment were 1 soil textures loamy and sandy loam 2 biochar types rice husk corn cob and bean harvest residue 3 biochar application rates 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 g g biochar application rates are equivalent to 11 25 t ha 0 5 22 5 t ha 1 0 45 ton ha 2 0 and 67 5 ton ha 3 0 and 4 fertilizer application rate biochar saturated with dairy effluent without mineral fertilizers fr1 biochar saturated with dairy effluent bde 1 4th of mineral fertilizer needed for wheat growth fr2 bde 1 2 fertilizer fr3 bde complete fertilizer fr4 and biochar without dairy effluent but with complete fertilizer fr5 since biochar is c rich stable materials and decompose very slowly lehmann and joseph 2015 they were applied once at the beginning of the experiment plant nutrients required for winter wheat were added in the form of liquid solution to the soil at the beginning of each growing season the soils were thoroughly mixed with biochar types and nutrients in a separate washbowl and transferred to the pots the seeds were planted on october 28 2015 and march 16 2016 in the first and second seasons respectively plants were irrigated with deionized water on a daily basis to keep soil moisture content close to field capacity although studies showed that biochar properties still change over time downie et al 2009 very scarce information is available regarding how biochar aging influences soil water retention and total porosity therefore effect of biochar types on water retention was investigated by collecting soil samples at 59 and 220 days after biochar incorporation biochars were added to the soils on 28th of october the plants were harvested at the stem elongation stage at each growing season first soil sampling was done after the first wheat harvest on december 25 2015 while second soil samples were taken following the second harvest on june 8 2016 the term aging effect was used to indicate the soil samples collected following the second growing season the aging of biochar is defined as short term or long term aging depending on the time required for hydration and oxidation of biochar particles which is called short term aging and physical and chemical breakdown of biochar particles chemical changes in organic compounds and neutralization of alkaline nature mia et al 2017 in our study biochar types are considered as short aged 2 3 laboratory analyses particle size distribution of soils were determined by hydrometer method in a sedimentation cylinder using sodium hexamethaphosphate as dispersing agent gee and bauder 1986a b organic matter was determined by dichromate oxidation using the modified walkley black method nelson and sommers 1996 organic carbon was converted to soil organic matter content multiplying by the conversion factor of 1 72 the soil reaction ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in a saturated paste rhoades 1982 the caco3 content was determined by using calcimeter method as mentioned by allison and moodie 1965 the pressure plate method was used for determining the water contents held at 0 33 bar and 15 bar matric potential klute 1986 the field capacity fc is defined as the water held in soil at 0 33 bar of suction pressure and can easily be extracted by plants while water contents at 15 bar suction pressure are known as permanent wilting point pwp and water beyond pwp is not available for the plants hillel 1980 the metal rings were used to determine water retained at 0 33 bar while rubber rings 1 cm height and 3 cm diameter were used to determine water retained 15 bars soil samples were placed in a pressure membrane apparatus and 0 33 and 15 bar suction pressures were applied after the equilibrium reached the oven dried weight of soil samples was determined after heating at 105 c for 24 h the plant available water content awc was calculated as the difference between gravimetric water content at field capacity 0 33 bar and permanent wilting point 15 bar all water content values calculated from the laboratory water retention curves reported on a gravimetric basis g g soil bulk density was determined on undisturbed soil cores blake and hartge 1986 although data on bulk density have not been presented here it was used for the calculation of total porosity the total porosity was only determined at the end of the second growing season because each undisturbed soil core removed around 150 160 g soil from the pots the soil sampled for each season was almost 100 g for the physical chemical and biological analyses so we could not afford to lose soil samples for bulk density at each growing season total porosity of soils was calculated using the dry bulk density and particle density 2 65 g cm 3 values in the relationship developed by danielson and sutherland 1986 this method assumes that soil porosity is the fraction of total volume not occupied by soil assuming a particle density of 2 65 g cm 3 danielson and sutherland 1986 total porosity 1 bulk density g cm 3 2 65 g cm 3 2 4 data analysis the normality of the data was tested prior to statistical evaluation the data had normal distribution the levene s test was performed to confirm equality of variances of fc pwp awc and total porosity between replicated measurements four way analysis of variance anova technique was used to test the differences between treatments least significant difference test lsd at 0 05 level of probability was used test to assess the differences among the means bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the significance level of multiple comparisons the difference in soil water contents between two growing seasons was tested by a paired t test all the statistical analyses were conducted using spss spss inc chicago il usa statistical software version 21 the results presented here included both individual effects soil type biochar type biochar application rate and fertilizer application rate on soil water and total porosity and two way interactions among individual factors data for individual factors and two way interactions except biochar types fertilizer application rate have been given in tables 3 6 three and four way interactions have not been presented due to the large tables and avoiding the repetition anova results of three and four way interaction are given in a separate table and the interactions were evaluated by a general discussion 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of individual factors on soil water retention the difference in soil water contents between two growing seasons of wheat under controlled conditions was significant p 0 01 thus the data was analyzed separately for both seasons table 2 3 1 1 soil type the soil type had significant effect p 0 01 on fc pwp and awc that were higher in loamy soils than sandy loam soil fig 1 the total porosity was also significantly higher in loamy soil 49 6 than sandy soil 46 3 the aging of biochar increased the fc of loamy soil by 7 6 while water content at pwp were not affected in contrast to loamy soil pwp decreased with aging by 10 5 and fc did not significantly vary in sandy loam soil the awc in the second season increased by 11 9 in loamy soil due to the higher water content in fc and 8 1 in sandy loam soil due to the lower water content in pwp the higher awc in loamy soil is apparently resulting from the higher total porosity of loamy soil compared to sandy soil 3 1 2 biochar type all of the biochar types had significant effects p 0 01 on soil water contents at fc pwp and awc during both growing seasons with pwp an exception in the first season andrenelli et al 2016 also reported no difference in terms of pwp by two types of biochar obtained by the same feedstock but differing for pyrolysis process the biochar types had also significant impact on the total porosity of soils soils containing rb had significantly higher total porosity compared to soils with cb and bb soils with rb in the first season had the lowest fc 17 0 pwp 7 5 and awc 9 46 while bb application resulted the highest water contents for fc 18 2 pwp 7 6 and awc 10 6 in contrast to the first season the highest fc 18 7 pwp 7 3 and awc 11 3 values in the second season were obtained in soils with rb treatments fig 2 the highest water content of soils with rb treatment is consistent with the highest total porosity of soils treated with rb in the second season the moisture contents of soils at pwp in all biochar applications showed a decrease compared to the first season this decrease was 2 4 in rb 4 2 in cb and 8 7 in bb treatment after incorporation to the soil exposure to water by time causes conversion of hydrophobic surfaces of biochar types into hydrophilic das and sarmah 2015 which may have improved the water retention at lower tensions and have negative effect on water retention at higher tension the awc was increased by the aging of all three biochar types at a rate of 19 9 in rb 6 0 in cb and 6 1 in bb the differences in water contents between two growing seasons necessitate the importance of long term studies to make a reliable suggestion for biochar types aller et al 2017 have concluded that aged biochars may have different influence on soil water retention relative to freshly produced biochar thus the results obtained in a short term experiment with fresh biochar amendment may not be useful to predict the long term effects of biochar the reports on the effects of biochar types on water retention are contradictory due to the differences in biochar types application rate age dahooki et al 2017 pyrolysis conditions and soils treated jeffery et al 2015 reported that the hydrophobicity of the biochar significantly reduced the infiltration of water into the biochar particles which prevented the water from being held in the soil in contrast biochar application to mesic typic hapludolls increased the moisture contents at 0 33 bar 1 0 bar and 5 0 bar pressure suction by 15 13 and 10 respectively laird et al 2010 the specific surface areas of cb rb and bb were 398 212 and 118 m2 g 1 respectively table 1 the increase in soil water retention with biochar amendment has been attributed to the porous structure and higher surface area verheijen et al 2010 sandhu and kumar 2017 however the higher surface area of cb compared to rb and bb did not improve the moisture retention of soils with cb application the highest awc in the first season was recorded with bb 10 6 which had the lowest surface area during the second season the highest awc value 11 3 was observed in rb treatment the increase or decrease in water contents and total porosity of soils treated with different biochar types may not only be related to the specific surface area of biochar materials but may also be influenced by the differences in other biochar features i e particle size shape and internal structure which cause a significant change in pore characteristics of soils liu et al 2017 sandhu and kumar 2017 the hydrophobic nature of varying biochar materials may also cause differences in water retention biochars produced from forest wastes are naturally hydrophobic page dumroese et al 2015 though kinney et al 2012 reported that the extent of water repellence of biochars may vary depending on both the nature of feedstock and pyrolysis conditions 3 1 3 biochar application rate biochar application rate had significant effects p 0 01 on water contents at fc pwp and awc and total porosity of soils the increased rate of biochar significantly improved the water retention at fc and pwp and total porosity fig 3 the addition of highly porous biochar materials to the soils linearly increased the total porosity and moisture contents increase in total porosity can be related to improvement in soil aggregation interaction of biochars with mineral particles and reduced soil compaction blanco canqui 2017 during the first season moisture content at fc was increased by 0 2 2 5 5 7 and 9 3 by br2 br3 br4 br5 respectively compared to control treatment of the study similar trend was observed in the second growing season fig 3 the total porosity of soils with 3 0 biochar amendment was 7 2 higher compared to the control treatment the changes in water contents and total porosity were the results of interactions between the soil and the applied biochar particles the increase in soil water contents and total porosity with the increased biochar addition are in accordance with dokoohaki et al 2017 who applied red oak wood biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c to sandy loam soil biochar amendment at 3 and 6 rates significantly increased the porosity compared to the control treatment and caused a significant increase in water content retained both in fc and pwp the increase in water content at lower tensions such as field capacity has also been associated to the increase in total porosity by several other studies hardie et al 2014 sun et al 2015 igalavithana et al 2017 the pores in biochar particles might be considered as the main contributors of higher total porosity of soils furthermore increased aggregate stability and higher soil biota in biochar amended soils may also cause to higher soil porosity hardie et al 2014 the biochar addition at 0 5 rate did not cause any significant change in pwp though further increase in biochar rate increased the water content at pwp relative to control by 2 1 5 1 and 6 3 with br3 br4 and br5 treatments respectively similar increases in pwp water content with respect to biochar rate treatments were obtained in the second season the results obtained are consistent with the findings from hardie et al 2014 who did not find any significant increase in pwp with lower rate of biochar addition however significant increase in pwp was reported with the addition of 20 biochar and attributed this to the increase in microporosity the increase of water retention at higher tensions with higher doses of biochar types relative to control and lower doses has also been related to the increase in specific surface area abel et al 2013 ulyett et al 2014 liu et al 2017 ulyett et al 2014 indicated that the higher specific surface area of biochar increased the ability of soil to hold more water at high matric tensions compared to the first season the fc at the end of the second season was higher in all treatments in contrast to fc water content at pwp was lower than the first season the awc had a similar trend as fc significantly increased higher br application rate fig 3 the highest awc in both seasons was obtained with br5 and the lowest was observed in control treatment in the first season the awc in br5 treatment was 11 5 higher than control treatment similarly the awc increased by 7 8 with br4 and 8 8 by br5 treatments during the second season fig 3 application of each mg ha 1 biochar produced by pyrolysis of eucalyptus wood increased the awc of sandy loam soil by a rate of 0 8 the increase in awc was attributed to the positive effect of biochar on total porosity of sandy loam soil water content at saturation and macro porosity of soil increased by 0 5 and 1 6 with each of mg ha 1 biochar application compared to no biochar amendment respectively carvalho de melo et al 2014 water retention of soils is expected to increase with aging of biochar relative to the fresh biochar due to lower hydrophobicity of biochar with aging ojeda et al 2015 mia et al 2017 observed improvement in water holding capacity of soils due to the changes in physicochemical properties of biochars by time biochar application improved awc though the rate of increase in the first season was higher relative to increase in the second season the findings of kerré et al 2017 supports the higher water retention of soils with aged biochar soils under historical charcoal kilns more than 150 years reported to retain 11 0 higher awc than the adjacent regular arable soils in belgium kerré et al 2017 the pwp content of soils in the second season decreased compared to the first season the decrease in pwp water content with the aging of biochars will contribute positively to the high pwp moisture content problem 3 1 4 fertilizer application rate fertilizer application rates had significant effects p 0 01 on fc pwp awc and total porosity of soils fig 4 the highest fc in the first season was obtained with fr5 17 9 whereas fr2 18 8 caused the highest fc in the second season fig 4 there was no significant relationship between the decrease or increase in fr and awc in both seasons while the first four treatments in the first season were statistically similar to each other in terms of awc the fr5 treatment caused a 3 3 increase in awc compared to fr1 in the second season the awc in fr2 and fr3 doses were higher compared to awc in fr1 treatment whereas awc in fr4 and fr5 treatments where full fertilization performed was decreased by 4 3 and 2 9 respectively compared to control the lowest fc in both seasons was observed in fr4 treatment 17 2 and 17 8 the fc values in fr treatments were mostly lower compared to the control fr1 treatment 3 2 interactions of factors on soil water retention 3 2 1 interaction of soil type and biochar type soil water contents at fc and pwp awc and total porosity were significantly p 0 01 affected by the interactions of soil type and biochar type table 3 the improvement of water holding capacity in biochar amended soils is reported due to the combined effects of soil and biochar type biochar amendment rate and biochar properties barnes et al 2014 andrenelli et al 2016 similarly gray et al 2014 also indicated the influence of feedstock and production technology on water uptake potential of biochars in contrast to these findings aller et al 2017 could not distinguish the effects of twelve different biochar types on biochar s ability to retain water the lowest water content at fc in both growing season was obtained with sandy loam soil rb interaction 14 9 and 14 8 while the highest fc in the first season was obtained with loamy soil bb interactions 21 2 and in the second season was with loamy soil rb 20 9 interactions the fc water content of sandy loam soil was significantly lower compared to that of loamy soil in all biochar types the highest pwp was observed in loamy soil bb 8 0 loamy cb 7 8 interactions during first and second growth seasons respectively the lowest pwp values in both seasons were noted in sandy loam soil bb interactions 7 1 and 6 2 the pwp values of second season increased by 4 0 and 1 6 with rb and cb respectively in the loamy soils compared with the first season while pwp was decreased with bb by 5 0 in contrast to loamy soil water content at pwp was significantly decreased with the aging of all biochar types in sandy loam soil table 3 in the first season the highest awc 13 3 was recorded in loamy soil with bb while the highest awc in the second season was observed under rb treatment 15 0 compared with other two biochar types the highest awc in loamy soils with rb during the second season is consistent with the highest mean total porosity value of soils containing rb in sandy loam soil the highest awc 8 5 in the first season was noted with cb whereas the bb treatment had the highest awc 9 2 during the second season the main reason of the differences obtained in awc for the same soil type is probably related to the differences in inherent properties of three biochar types shown by specific surface area cation exchange capacity and other characteristics table 1 the awc in the second season for both soil types was higher compared to the first season the increase in fc and awc shows that the aging of biochar probably improved the stability of aggregates and reduced water retention at the pwp the highest difference in awc between the two seasons was observed with rb in loamy soil 27 2 and by bb in sandy loam soil 15 6 these findings are consistent with the studies reporting the hydrophobicity of biochars das and sarmah 2015 aller et al 2017 mia et al 2017 aged biochars relative to their fresh ones were found to be less hydrophobic which helped to retain more water by time mia et al 2017 irrigation of plants throughout two growing seasons helped biochar particles to be less hydrophilic aller et al 2017 which lead to higher awc of soils treated with all three types of biochars 3 2 2 interaction of soil type and biochar application rate the soil type biochar rate interactions revealed that water content at fc was similar to all biochar application rates however the interaction appeared statistically significant p 0 01 at the end of the second season table 4 water contents of soils under aged biochar doses were significantly higher compared to the control treatments while the effect of soil type and biochar dose factors on fc moisture content in the first season was non significant p 0 1650 while quite significant during the second season the highest fc moisture contents during the first season in the soil br interactions during both seasons were obtained by interactions of loam soil br5 20 9 and 22 0 and lowest fc values were recorded in sandy loam soil br1 14 6 and 14 0 interactions the highest fc moisture contents in both soils were observed with br5 3 0 biochar which is the highest biochar dose and the lowest fc moisture contents were recorded by the control br1 treatment table 4 increasing amount of biochar caused an increase in total porosity of both soils thus led to higher moisture contents at fc the increment in moisture contents at fc was higher in sandy loam soil than loamy soil for each biochar dose the highest fc moisture content increase compared to the control treatment was observed in the interactions of sandy loam br5 by 10 9 and 11 1 in first and second growth season respectively the significant increase in water content and total porosity with higher biochar application rate observed in this study is consistent with findings of other researchers jeffery et al 2011 reported that biochar pores improve the porosity of coarse textured soil and enhance the soil water retention improvement in the ability of soils to retain and maintain high water content during drought periods makes biochar as an important additive material especially for arid and semi arid regions nelissen et al 2015 the effects of biochar aging even at lower biochar doses were more obvious in sandy loam soils compared to the first season considering the residual effect water retention at fc with lower biochar doses 0 5 and 1 0 in sandy loam soil were higher at the rates of 8 3 and 9 9 compared to control in both soil types the highest pwp values were obtained with br5 and the lowest values were found in br1 doses except for the first season of loam soil the highest biochar rate resulted in an increase of pwp of loamy soil by 7 7 and 5 7 rates in the first and second seasons respectively compared to control treatment for the sandy loam soil the increase in pwp with br5 relative to control was 4 9 and 6 5 for the first and second seasons table 4 the findings on increased pwp with biochar amendment are partially consistent with the data reported by aller et al 2017 who found increased soil water retention at pwp with fresh biochar and decreased pwp moisture content with aged biochar similar findings for higher water retention at pwp with biochar amendment have also been reported by hansen et al 2016 who attributed the results to higher water retention at fc as in our case however our results that biochar addition has positive influence on pwp partially differ from the findings of hardie et al 2014 who found non significant effect of biochar addition of 5 to pwp while significant increase in pwp with 20 biochar in a clay loam soil in both growing seasons the awc of sandy soil for all br treatments remained significantly lower than the loamy soil the addition of biochars continually increased the awc of both soils though the effect was higher in the loamy soil higher biochar amendment considerably increased the awc in the loamy soil while the differences between the control and br5 treatments were more pronounced in sandy loam soil table 4 comparing the water retention of br1 with br4 and br5 for the first season the increase of awc was much higher in sandy loam soil compared to loamy soil the improvements in soil water holding capacity by biochar application especially in coarse textured soils have also been reported by glaser et al 2002 and nelissen et al 2015 moragues saitua et al 2017 reported that the ability of the biochar to retain water can vary considerably depending on soil type the effect of soils on awc was generally associated with improved porosity surface area and sorption capacity of biochars compared to other organic wastes downie et al 2009 sandhu and kumar 2017 3 2 3 interaction of soil type and fertilizer application rate significant interaction p 0 01 of soil type and fertilizer application rate was found for fc pwp awc and total porosity table 5 the highest mean fc and awc moisture content was obtained in loamy soil fr5 interactions 20 4 and 12 8 and loamy soil fr3 22 3 and 14 6 interaction during first and second growth season respectively the lowest mean fc and pwp were obtained by interactions of sandy loam soil fr4 14 6 and 6 9 in the first season and sandy loam soil fr3 14 5 and 6 3 in the second season the lowest fc moisture contents in loamy soil were obtained by fr1 treatment during both seasons the increase in the fr resulted in an increase in fc moisture content of loamy sols during both periods whereas fc moisture content at fr1 was higher relative to other fr treatments in sandy loam soil the highest pwp values was recorded in sandy loam soil fr1 8 0 and loamy soil fr4 8 0 interactions during first and second growth season the lowest pwp were noted in sandy loam soil fr4 6 9 and sandy loam soil fr3 6 3 interactions in the first and second seasons respectively 3 2 4 interaction of biochar and fertilizer application rates biochar and fertilizer application rate interactions had significant p 0 01 effects on fc pwp awc in both seasons and total porosity in the second season table 6 the highest mean fc values in the first period were obtained by br5 fr5 19 1 and in the second season with br5 fr2 19 7 interactions on the other hand the lowest fc moisture content was observed with br1 fr3 16 5 and br2 fr5 17 2 interactions during first and second growth season the highest fc moisture contents in both seasons were obtained under br4 and br5 in all fr doses in both seasons the highest pwp was recorded under br5 fr5 8 0 and 7 7 interactions while the lowest was noted in br1 fr3 6 9 and br1 fr2 6 7 interactions table 6 no significant decrease or increase was observed between the fr and the change in awc under the different brs in both seasons the awc increased in some treatments while some of the treatments caused a decrease in awc table 6 however water retention significantly increased with the increase in br at a given fr treatment even in the case of fr1 fr2 and fr3 which did not contain adequate plant nutrients the increase in awc by the addition of biochar enabled plants to utilize the existing sources more effectively the highest awc in the first season was obtained in br5 fr1 11 0 and br5 fr5 11 0 treatments whereas br5 fr2 12 5 interactions resulted in the highest awc during the second growth season table 6 however the lowest awc was noted in br1 fr1 9 4 and br5 fr4 10 0 during first and second growth season respectively 3 2 5 interaction of biochar type and biochar application rate biochar type and application rate interactions had significant effects p 0 01 on water contents at fc pwp awc and total porosity table 7 the highest fc in the first season with all biochar types were obtained with br5 as 17 5 for rb 18 5 for cb and 19 6 for bb the lowest fc values were obtained in rb br2 16 5 cb br1 and cb br2 16 9 and 16 9 and bb br1 17 1 interactions the lowest fc moisture contents of the second season were observed in br1 treatments of all three biochar types in contrast the highest fc values were observed in br2 19 1 with rb br4 18 4 with cb and in br5 19 2 with bb the increase in fc with the increase of br was prominent in bb treatments for both growing seasons the br4 and br5 treatments of bean biochar compared to br1 increased fc moisture content by 9 4 and 14 2 and 11 0 and 13 8 in the first and second seasons respectively the highest pwp were recorded with bb br5 7 9 and rb br5 7 5 treatments in the first and second season respectively table 7 the lowest pwp moisture contents were found with cb br2 7 2 and bb br1 6 5 interactions during first and second season the increase in biochar rate and water retained at pwp was in good agreement for all three types in both seasons the highest awc was obtained in bb br5 11 7 and 12 0 interactions table 7 the awc of the soils was significantly increased with the addition of all three types of biochar the increase in awc is directly proportional to the br increase in cb and bb applied soils the amount of water retained in the soil was increased with the increase in biochar addition for example in bean biochar application during the first season the increase in awc compared to br1 was higher at a rate of 4 3 with br2 4 8 with br3 11 8 with br4 and 18 6 with br5 the tendency to increase in awc with increased br was similar in the second season the increase rate of awc compared to br1 in the second season was 5 6 br2 8 5 br3 12 7 br4 and 16 0 br5 the rest of interactions of factors presented in table 8 had significant impacts on soil water retention and total porosity of soils 3 3 relationship between biochar application water retention and dry matter yield the relationship between shoot dry matter sdm yield and fc pwp and awc were varied depending on soil type the sdm yield of wheat had significant positive p 0 01 correlations with fc pwp and awc of loamy soil in the first growing season whereas sdm yield had significant negative correlations with fc p 0 05 and awc p 0 01 and no correlation with pwp of sandy loam soil similarly plant phosphorus p concentration had significant p 0 01 positive correlations p 0 01 with fc pwp and awc of loamy soil and negative correlations with fc pwp and awc of sandy loam soil the increase in awc content had significant positive effect on sdm yield plant k p and n concentrations of wheat at the first growing season in loamy soil while sdm yield plant fe k and p concentrations negatively affected by increase in awc in sandy soil similar findings for effects of biochar application on awc and crop performance were also reported by others kammann et al 2011 hansen et al 2016 hansen et al 2016 showed that straw gasified and wood gasified biochar applications caused an increase in awc by 18 and 17 in sandy loam and 42 and 31 in coarse sandy soil respectively they have also stated that straw gasified biochar application to coarse sandy soil increased the shoot growth by 165 while wood gasified biochar had a negative effect on shoot growth despite the positive effect on awc the interactions of factors such as biochar application rate biochar characteristics and soil texture cause varying effects of biochar application on water retention and plant growth table 9 4 conclusions impacts of three different biochar types on water retention of two soils differing in texture have been examined in a greenhouse experiment by growing winter wheat all biochar types used in the study improved the hydrological properties of loamy and sandy loam soils though differences in inherent properties of three biochar materials resulted in varied water retention for the same soil type the results revealed that biochar application had positive influence on water retention of loamy and sandy loam soils due to significant improvement in total porosity though the impact on sandy soil was more prominent compared to loamy soil the positive impact of increased biochar rates was higher especially at lower matric potentials as in field capacity however we only determined water retained at 0 33 bar and 15 bar suction pressures the higher water contents obtained at the end of second growing season relative to the first season show the importance of long lasting influence of biochars on improving water holding capacity of coarse textures soils improving water holding capacity of coarse textured soils means maintaining higher amount of water during drought periods this makes biochar as an important additive material especially for arid and semi arid regions in conclusion all of the tested biochar types can be used for improving water retention of coarse textured soils under arid and semi arid conditions acknowledgements the authors feel indebted to dr hikmet günal and dr shahid farooq for their valuable comments and careful

11376,water scarcity is the major constraint to social economic development in arid and semiarid regions where irrigation needs to be scheduled properly for the main crops in this study a simulation optimization model for crop optimal irrigation scheduling under uncertainty was developed to maximize the net benefit the model integrated a water driven crop model aquacrop with the optimization model and incorporated the generation technique for the interval values of hydrological parameters i e precipitation and evapotranspiration and crop market prices to deal with uncertainties in these variables the water price was assumed constant the model was calibrated based on field experimental data obtained in 2014 and validated using 2015 data the field experiments involved spring wheat yongliang no 4 at shiyang river basin experiment station in wuwei city gansu province of northwest china the model was then used to generate the optimal irrigation schedules under various irrigation amounts irrigation events initial soil water storage and crop market price under uncertainty results indicated that the model is applicable for reflecting the complexities of simulation optimization under uncertainties for spring wheat irrigation water scheduling the optimization results indicated that the optimal irrigation amount range was 185 322 mm with the corresponding optimal net benefit of 1 05 2 77 104 yuan hm2 and yield of 7 4 7 6 kg hm2 for extreme wet conditions in the basin defined as the combination of the 5 frequency precipitation with 95 frequency evapotranspiration for extreme dry conditions the optimal irrigation amount range was 442 507 mm with the optimal net benefit of 0 85 2 64 104 yuan hm2 and the corresponding yield of 6 6 7 4 kg hm2 results also showed that four irrigation events under higher initial soil water storage were more likely to produce the higher net benefit and the optimal net benefit would increase as the crop market price increases as expected this work can be used to guide irrigation management for local farmers keywords irrigation optimization aquacrop interval numbers bootstrap genetic algorithm spring wheat 1 introduction china a big agricultural country faces a great challenge of severe water scarcity wang et al 2015 in china more than 60 of water is used for agricultural purposes so agricultural water consumption plays an important role in the overall water balance of the country wang et al 2010 deng et al 2015 in the northern part of china water shortage is very serious because this region has half of the total area of china but less than 20 of total national available water resources deng et al 2006 especially in northwestern regions natural rainfall cannot match crop water requirements and supplementary irrigation is needed to sustain and possibly increase crop yields zhou 1996 2001 deng et al 2006 however the water available for irrigation has been decreasing in recent years partly as a consequence of climate change but also due to the increasing competition for water demand from other sectors of the economy especially industry and domestic consumption singh 2012 wang et al 2017 therefore it is important that the scarce water resources used in irrigation are optimally allocated in order to guarantee food security improve farmers income and improve the general socio economic well being in the region the basic requirement work for irrigation water allocation in regional scales is to guarantee the crop yield with the limited irrigation water at farm or plot scale in doing this irrigation should be accurately timed and quantified i e there must be a robust irrigation scheduling program that ensures non productive soil water evapotranspiration or drainage losses are minimized arora and gajri 1998 thus optimization of irrigation scheduling is basically for optimization of irrigation water allocation this is essential to ensure water saving and by extension high net benefit for local farmers achieving the optimization of irrigation water scheduling would require knowledge about the response of crop growth yield to soil water situation and a model of the economic returns of crop production in the current study the former used one of the numerous available crop simulation models and the latter is a bespoke economic model depicting the net benefits for the project crop models were developed in the last few decades for simulating the indices of dynamic crop growth under different irrigation schedules bouman et al 1996 water driven models one type of crop growth models are based on crop growth controlled by phonological development processes and they normally assume that crop growth rate is linearly proportional to transpiration through a constant of proportionality steduto and albrizio 2005 water driven models are the least complex and most parsimonious as compared to other crop growth models steduto et al 2007 2009 it is particularly suitable for semi arid and arid regions where water is the key limiting factor for crop production one of the most popular water driven crop models is aquacrop steduto et al 2009 which was developed by the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations in recent years aquacrop has been widely used to simulate the crop water consumption and crop yield under different irrigation schedules salemi et al 2011 kiptum et al 2013 lorite et al 2013 nazari et al 2013 vanuytrecht et al 2014 kim and kaluarachchi 2015 paredes et al 2015 voloudakis et al 2015 li et al 2016a b c although simulation models for crop growth are good at describing the effects of various irrigation schedules on the crop growth they could only be used to get the answers to what if questions singh 2014b it means that the irrigation schedules are based on scenario analysis of several user defined alternatives in this case a number of pre specified irrigation schedules will be evaluated by comparing the results of crop yield and or water use efficiency simulated by crop growth models then the irrigation schedule with higher crop yield or net benefit will be recommended however whilst the recommended irrigation scheduling may be the best one among the chosen options it is unlikely to be exactly the global optimal irrigation schedule shang and mao 2006a b to achieve a truly global optimum optimization methods must be combined with simulation models to derive optimal irrigation schedules singh and panda 2013 singh 2014a genetic algorithm ga introduced in the 1970s holland 1975 is one of the frequently used algorithms for solving optimization problems in water management ga is based on the analogy of the mechanics of biological genetics and imitate the phenomenon of selection of the fittest individuals baron 1998 the solution set in ga is represented by a population of strings which comprises a number of blocks each block represents the individual decision variables of the optimization problem strings are processed and combined according to their fitness in order to generate new strings that have the best features of two parent strings selection crossover and mutation are the three fundamental operations involved in ga to manipulate strings and move to a new generation compared with other traditional methods linear method nonlinear method and dynamic programming ga is more likely to be used in solving the simulation optimization model and it has been widely used in irrigation scheduling optimization or irrigation water allocation wu et al 2007 moghaddasi et al 2010 wen et al 2017 in previous simulation optimization models the simulation part was usually an integration of crop water production functions jensen 1968 and water balance equation for example shang and mao 2006a b developed a simulation optimization model based on crop water production functions and produced the optimal irrigation date series for winter wheat in north china yu and shang 2016 determined the optimal irrigation scheduling on a crop rotation system with a multi objective simulation optimization model by integrating water balance model crop water production functions and optimization model wen et al 2017 analyzed the optimal irrigation schedules for spring wheat under plastic mulching using a simulation optimization model by coupling water balance model crop water production functions and optimization model however crop water production functions were traditionally obtained from long term field experiments which are site specific expensive and time consuming the resulting outcomes of such empiricisms are therefore unlikely to be sufficiently generic as to be transferable to other settings thus limiting their usefulness to our best knowledge there are few irrigation scheduling simulation optimization modelling schemes that have coupled crop growth simulation model and optimization model this is mainly because most of the crop growth simulation models are complex and not convenient to be readily coupled with the other models our current work is therefore an effort at closing this knowledge gap another relevant issue to consider is that irrigation scheduling optimizations in real field conditions are more challenging because many uncertain factors are involved such as climate parameters and economic parameters li and guo 2014 li et al 2016a b c these climate parameters usually change temporally and are complicated by various uncertainties such uncertainties will compound the complexity of irrigation scheduling optimization by simulation optimization models or other traditional methods li et al 2016a b c most of the previous simulation optimization models used the average values for the uncertain factors which would neglect their randomness accordingly introducing uncertainty theory into traditional simulation optimization method can help to tackle the uncertainty in various input factors thus reflecting the true complexity and reality of irrigation systems among the widely used uncertainty methods the interval mathematical programming approach is popular because of its computational efficiency li et al 2018 it considers the uncertainty by approximating the lower and upper boundaries of the variables concerned in addition as the major driving factors hydrological elements such as precipitation and evapotranspiration usually exhibit various degrees of stochasticity in their behavior that must be accommodated therefore it is more thorough for the simulation optimization based irrigation scheduling to consider the stochasticity occurring in these inputs by fully specifying their complete probability distribution function whence derive the uncertainty characterization of the optimization decision variables and objective function evaluation wheat one of the most important food crops is the staple food for about 34 40 of the world s population and 50 of chinese population jia 2013 china is the largest wheat producing country in the world in china the perennial wheat planting area accounts for 25 of the total food crops planting area yang 2010 in the arid regions of northwest china spring wheat is also widely cultivated with irrigation as expected tong et al 2007 jiang et al 2012 wheat has a high seasonal water requirement for maximum yields border irrigation sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation are the main types of irrigation systems although drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation are more efficient than border irrigation deng et al 2006 farmers in arid regions of china prefer to adopt border irrigation because of the low cost of irrigation equipment he et al 2013 thus spring wheat and border irrigation were selected as the target crop type and the irrigation technology respectively for the purpose of investigating irrigation scheduling optimization in this study taking into account the considerations above the aim of this study is to develop a simulation optimization model for wheat crop irrigation scheduling that maximizes farmers net benefit given uncertainties in both the climatological and economic situations the model will integrate a simulation model for crop growth aquacrop and the optimization model formulated to maximize the net economic benefit from the project uncertainty in both hydrological and economic inputs was handled using the interval parameter approach because of its relative simplicity compared to other more formal and sophisticated stochastic optimization approaches this study thus entailed several elements as listed below i evaluating the performance of aquacrop for predicting soil water storage canopy cover above ground biomass and crop yield based on the field experiment data from 2014 calibration and 2015 validation ii generating uncertainty interval numbers for hydrological precipitation and evapotranspiration and economic crop price for different frequencies iii coupling the simulation optimization models to develop optimum irrigation scheduling based on the generated uncertainty interval values iv application of the coupled model to the optimal irrigation scheduling for spring wheat in northwest china the remainder of the manuscript is arranged as follows in the next section fuller details about the adopted methodology are provided this is followed by a description of the field experiments to obtain data for driving the models next the results are presented and discussed and finally the main conclusions of the study are presented 2 simulation optimization model for irrigation scheduling

evaluation the model was calibrated and validated using data collected during field experiments over two years 2014 and 2015 including soil water storage at 1 m depth canopy cover above ground biomass and the crop yield the measured canopy cover was converted from the observed lai according to the empirical equation iqbal et al 2010 the measured data in 2014 were used to calibrate the model using a trial and error approach which involves altering the parameter values and evaluating the performance of the model using indices in eq 4 and 5 the calibration was stopped when the indices attained acceptable ranges as discussed below to validate the model the final calibrated parameters were applied to simulate the 2015 field data and the resulting performance during validation was also evaluated using similar indices employed during the calibration moriasi et al 2007 as noted above the performance of the aquacrop model was evaluated during calibration to determine when to terminate the process the performance of the calibrated model was evaluated using both the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the determination coefficient r 2 the equations are as follows 4 n r m s e

e g precipitation reference evapotranspiration et 0 and crop market price in both simulation model and optimization model the interval numbers for them were considered and the optimization model with interval parameters was solved by best worst method huang et al 1995 the data series of precipitation and et 0 obtained from china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn site index html are usually more than 30 years the bootstrap method hu et al 2015 was used to generate the interval numbers for them the steps for generating the interval numbers for precipitation and et 0 are as set below i firstly obtain the empirical distribution of the data precipitation or et 0 and fit a theoretical frequency curve by comparing the fit with the empirical frequency distribution curve ii secondly using monte carlo simulation method resample from the theoretical frequency distribution of the original sample and repeat the re sampling for 1000 times with each replicate sample record having the same length as the original record length iii estimate the parameters for each new sample and fit the probability distribution iv finally for each of the fitted distributions obtain values corresponding to specific frequencies v obtain the interval for each of the frequencies in iv as x x where x is the minimum of all the 1000 values at a given frequency and x is the corresponding maximum in this study five scenarios were set according to the commonly used classification standard of wet and dry conditions of china scenario 1 extreme wet condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 5 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 95 scenario 2 wet condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 25 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 75 scenario 3 normal condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 50 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 50 scenario 4 dry condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 75 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 25 scenario 5 extreme dry condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 95 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 5 the data series of crop market price collected from agricultural product price net http www 3w3n com index goindex were from 2012 to 2017 the frequency of the price data were analyzed to obtain the probability density function 95 confidence interval was chosen to get the interval numbers for market price 2 4 framework for simulation optimization model under uncertainty the framework for simulation optimization model under uncertainty contains mainly three parts fig 1 the first part focused on the generation of interval parameters the second part was the application of aquacrop model and the third part was the solution for the optimization model in the first part the uncertainties for hydrometeorological parameters and socioeconomic parameters were considered for hydrometeorological data the interval numbers of parameters were generated by bootstrap method i e precipitation and reference evapotranspiration as to socioeconomic parameters e g the market price for crop frequency distribution was analyzed and 95 confidence interval were chosen to obtain the interval numbers in the second part aquacrop model was calibrated and validated with the experimental data and then applied to simulate the corresponding crop yield under various irrigation schedules based on the first two parts the optimal irrigation scheduling for maximum net benefit was solved by the genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 the framework was realized on the platform of matlab r2016a mathworks inc ma usa first the interval numbers were generated by the functions of matlab then the initial inputs of aquacrop model were prepared and aquacropplug in exe was called by the matlab command dos to simulate the corresponding yield after that the objective function of optimal model was calculated and the optimal irrigation scheduling was solved by genetic algorithm toolbox through the functions on matlab 3 field experiment field experiments were carried out at shiyang river basin experiment station in wuwei city gansu province of northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e and 1581 m above sea level in 2014 and 2015 the experimental station lies in a typical arid region with 164 mm mean annual precipitation and 2000 mm pan evaporation e601 jiang et al 2016 the soil at the experiment site is loam with an average bulk density of 1 44 g cm3 and a filed capacity of 280 mm in 0 100 cm soil layer the groundwater depth is more than 30 m in recent years spring wheat yongliang no 4 was selected as the target crop and was sowed on march 26 and harvested on july 24 in 2014 and sowed on march 21 and harvested on july 19 in 2015 the experimental design was a randomized block and each plot had an area of 5 5 7 5 m2 the treatments included mulched and non mulched cases although here we only concentrated on the non mulched ones the non mulched cases include one sufficient irrigation treatment and four deficient ones with different water stress in growing stages table 1 each treatment with three replicates in 2014 and two in 2015 spring wheat was irrigated through border irrigation with the water pumped from the aquifer and irrigation volume was measured by the flow meter in addition pre sowing irrigation was applied to promote seed emergence and ensure seedling growth time domain reflectometry imko micromodultechnik gmbh germany was used to measure volumetric soil water content periodically every 6 9 days at the plot center along the soil profile every 20 cm depth to 100 cm a canopy analysis system sunscan delta t devices ltd cambridge uk was used to record leaf area index lai with 3 replicates in each plot the above ground biomass was measured by oven drying method the crop yield was determined from two uniform areas of 1 1 m2 each with the ears air dried naturally and weighed by scale soil samples were taken in five soil layers with three replications along the soil profile to measure soil properties table 2 in laboratory after harvest 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation for aquacrop results of model calibration and validation are shown in fig 2 and the calibrated parameters are presented in table 3 results showed that the simulated values were in good agreement with the measured values for both model calibration and validation all the evaluation indicators were within acceptable ranges for example the determination coefficient r 2 were all above 0 65 and most of them were above 0 90 for model calibration in model validation the values of r 2 were a little lower than calibration but all of them were above 0 57 in terms of nrmse they ranged from 2 44 to 15 1 for calibration and ranged from 5 41 to 13 7 for validation results showed a good performance of aquacrop and indicated it was capable to be used for predicting the soil water storage canopy cover above ground biomass and crop yield for spring wheat at the field site fig 3 shows the measured and simulated values of soil water storage in 1 m soil layer canopy cover and above ground biomass for two irrigation treatments irrigation treatment ⅰ and ⅴ in 2014 each irrigation depth in irrigation treatment ⅴ 170 mm for total was half of the depth in irrigation treatment ⅰ 340 mm for total results of soil water storage in 1 m soil layer figs 3a and b showed that the simulated values were in accordance with the observations with the sharp increase in soil water storage responding to water input through irrigation precipitation followed by a gradual decrease due to the continuous evapotranspiration soil water storage after the first irrigation in treatment ⅴ was significantly lower than that in treatment ⅰ it indicated some of the soil water was used for crop evapotranspiration because of the insufficient water input under treatment ⅴ feng et al 2014 results of canopy cover figs 3c and d showed that the simulated canopy cover was in good agreement with the measured values the maximum canopy cover reached 99 in irrigation treatment ⅰ and 97 in irrigation treatment ⅴ which indicated that deficit irrigation could decrease the canopy cover for spring wheat figs 3e and f showed that the simulation results of above ground biomass fitted well with the measured values both increasing almost linearly during the growth period in the end of the growth stage above ground biomass in irrigation treatment ⅰ was 16 34 t hm2 and it reduced to 13 34 t hm2 when the irrigation amount was cut down to 50 for the crop yield the simulated values ranged from 5 11 t hm2 to 7 48 t hm2 under various irrigation treatments which were consistent with previous study in the same study area he et al 2013 yang et al 2017 2018 results also confirmed those of lamm et al 1995 pandey et al 2000 and igbadun et al 2008 who stated that deficit irrigation would reduce the crop yield therefore it is very necessary to balance the precious irrigation water and the crop yield net benefit in other words irrigation scheduling optimization is very essential to the local farmers in the arid regions 4 2 interval numbers for parameters 4 2 1 precipitation and reference evapotranspiration time series for precipitation and reference evapotranspiration are 55 year from 1951 to 2016 and they were collected from wuwei hydrological station 37 55 n 102 40 e and 1532 m above sea level through the china meteorological data sharing service system in this study ten days precipitation and reference evapotranspiration over the growing period were analyzed and the interval numbers of them were obtained using the bootstrap method described previously through hydrological curve fitting the probability distribution of ten days precipitation or reference evapotranspiration was determined and parameters were estimated the pearson type ⅲ distribution was fitted to the values of ten days precipitation or reference evapotranspiration with the distribution parameters estimated using the method of least squares the eleventh ten days in spring wheat growing period 110 to 120 day after sowing precipitation and reference evapotranspiration were used as examples to demonstrate the generation of interval numbers by the bootstrap method and the probability distributions are shown in fig 4 the eleventh ten days reference evapotranspiration et 0 in spring wheat growing period was taken as an example fig 5 presents the frequency histogram and the normal probability plot of ten days et 0 values under the frequencies of 5 25 50 75 and 95 the figure shows that the normal distribution function fitted the frequency histogram well under each frequency the scatters were evenly distributed around the 45 line showing the distribution values of ten days et 0 under each frequency was approximately a normal distribution therefore using the normal distribution the interval number of each frequency was obtained for the 95 confidence interval similarly the interval numbers of the other ten days et 0 and all ten days precipitation were obtained and listed in table 4 4 2 2 market price for spring wheat the market price for spring wheat in gansu province fig 6 was collected from agricultural product price net the frequency distribution of market price fig 7 was fitted according to the series values by kernel density estimation rosenblatt 1956 parzen 1962 and 95 confidence interval was chosen to get the interval numbers for spring wheat market price i e 2 03 4 21 yuan kg 4 3 optimal irrigation scheduling of spring wheat 4 3 1 influence of irrigation amount on optimal net benefit the simulation optimization model was used to solve the optimal net benefit for spring wheat under various irrigation amounts i min and i max in eq 6b as detailed in table 5 and the initial soil water storage was set at field capacity 0 28 m3 m 3 considering pre sowing irrigation results of the interval values of the net benefit at various irrigation amounts are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the optimal net benefit initially increased almost linearly with the increase of irrigation amount and then peaks before declining slightly as the irrigation water volume increased for all the scenarios the corresponding yield of spring wheat with the optimal net benefit was also closely related with the irrigation amount which increased with the increasing of irrigation amount at lower level and became stable at higher level this is to be expected because irrigation is crucial to the crop yield when the crop water demand was not satisfied as the soil becomes wetter with further irrigation however the marginal return on yield from any over irrigation will be minimal indeed as shown by the plots in fig 8 over irrigation can be detrimental to crop yield in addition to being wasteful of water under this condition the extra irrigation water would not produce more crop yield but waste more money on water fee and finally contributed to the decrease of net benefit regarding the benefits it can be seen that the upper optimal net benefits were around 2 70 104 yuan hm2 and the lower optimal net benefits were around 9 97 103 yuan hm2 fig 9 the optimal irrigation amount i e the irrigation amount at which net benefit peaks can be seen to increase as the precipitation frequency increases while the optimal net benefit decreased slightly with increasing precipitation frequency under the extreme wet condition 5 precipitation frequency the optimal net benefit was the highest 1 05 2 77 104 yuan hm2 with the irrigation amount 185 322 mm under the extreme dry condition 95 precipitation frequency the optimal net benefit decreased to 0 85 2 64 104 yuan hm2 for the irrigation amount 442 507 mm when the optimal net benefit was obtained the corresponding yields under different frequencies were around 6 6 t hm2 to 7 6 t hm2 the upper and lower corresponding yields would be approximately equal when the irrigation amount was large enough in a previous study on optimal irrigation scheduling of spring wheat in the same study area feng et al 2014 used a crop growth simulation model to simulate the crop yields under different irrigation schedules and selected the scheduling with the highest crop yield as the optimal irrigation schedule they finally obtained recommended irrigation amounts of 322 mm 328 mm and 400 mm for wet condition normal condition and dry condition respectively the wet and dry conditions results by feng et al 2014 fall within the corresponding optimal values of our study i e 300 400 mm for wet condition and 383 473 mm for dry condition their result of 328 mm for normal conditions however is totally outside the corresponding optimal range of 350 433 mm of the current study a possible reason for this discrepancy may have to do with the fact that the work by feng et al 2014 involved only simulation and hence their results may not have been the global optimum in addition uncertainties in both hydrometeorological data and socioeconomic data were considered in searching for the optimal irrigation schedules in our study 4 3 2 influence of irrigation times on optimal net benefit the optimal irrigation amount in section 4 3 1 fig 9 were used to investigate the influence of irrigation times on optimal net benefit and its corresponding yield the initial soil water storage was also set at the field capacity results are shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows that for almost all the scenarios the optimal net benefit of four irrigation events was the highest followed by the three irrigation events and the least was two irrigations under scenario 1 extreme wet condition the upper boundary of optimal net benefit under three irrigation events was a little higher than the others in other words irrigation times had little influence on the optimal net benefit under the extreme wet condition it can also be seen from the figure that with four irrigation events the optimal net benefit decreased slightly when the condition becomes drier with the average intervals 1 0 2 7 104 yuan hm2 with four irrigation events the optimal net benefits would decrease by 22 for the lower boundary and 6 for the upper boundary when the precipitation frequency increased to 95 at two irrigation events however the optimal net benefit decreased sharply with the increasing of the precipitation frequency with the average intervals 0 6 2 3 104 yuan hm2 the optimal net benefits would decrease by 55 for the lower boundary and 35 for the upper boundary when the precipitation frequency increased to 95 under two irrigation events fig 10 also shows that the intervals of optimal net benefit under higher irrigation frequency would be smaller when the precipitation frequency become larger in other words fewer irrigation events would cause larger uncertainties because of the weather variations as also reported previously by he et al 2013 all of the above indicates that four irrigation events would produce higher net benefit under the higher precipitation frequency i e dry conditions additionally irrespective of the prevailing climate scenario wet normal and dry the acceptable optimal net benefit would only be obtained if the irrigation was accurately scheduled and programmed the yield results were similar to the net benefit with the yield for four irrigation events being the highest for all scenarios this also further reinforces earlier findings by he et al 2013 that four irrigation events were more likely to be the best choice for spring wheat in shiyang river basin therefore four irrigation events can be set as the optimal irrigation frequency for spring wheat in the study area 4 3 3 influence of initial soil water storage on optimal net benefit pre sowing irrigation was popular to improve the initial soil water storage but in some places pre sowing irrigation was not implemented and the initial soil water storage would not reach the field capacity therefore it is essential to program the optimal irrigation schedules under different initial soil water storage thus optimal irrigation amount in section 4 3 1 fig 9 and four irrigation events during the crop growing period were used to investigate the influence of initial soil water storage on the optimal net benefit and its corresponding yield the initial soil water storage was set as 20 40 60 and 80 of the field capacity results are shown in fig 11 fig 11 shows that the optimal net benefit increased with the increase of the initial soil water storage under all scenarios with the average intervals of 0 4 1 2 104 yuan hm2 under 20 field capacity 0 6 1 8 104 yuan hm2 under 40 field capacity 0 8 2 4 104 yuan hm2 under 60 field capacity and 0 8 2 5 104 yuan hm2 under 80 field capacity they were all smaller than the result under the initial storage of field capacity 1 0 2 7 104 yuan hm2 which means increasing the initial soil water storage would help to increase the net benefit for spring wheat as to its corresponding yields they also increased with the increase of initial soil water storage but differed distinctly under different scenarios from 2 65 t hm2 to 7 46 t hm2 indicating pre sowing irrigation was essential to promote crop yield and net benefit these results are consistent with previous study wen et al 2017 in the same study area that the higher initial soil water storage would produce higher crop yield 4 3 4 sensitivity analysis of market price on optimal net benefit the simulation optimization model was used to solve the optimal net benefit for spring wheat under various crop market price to analyze the influence of market price on the results in this section the initial soil water storage was set at field capacity 0 28 m3 m 3 considering pre sowing irrigation results are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the optimal net benefit increased almost linearly with the increase of crop market price at both upper and lower boundary the upper optimal net benefit ranged from 1 01 104 yuan hm2 to 3 37 104 yuan hm2 and the lower optimal net benefit were from 0 83 104 yuan hm2 to 3 29 104 yuan hm2 under the lowest market price 2 yuan kg the optimal net benefit was 1 05 1 10 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 1 1 03 1 07 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 2 1 01 1 04 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 3 0 97 1 03 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 4 and 0 83 1 01 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 5 respectively when the crop market price reached 5 yuan kg the optimal net benefit would increase to 3 29 3 37 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 1 3 26 3 32 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 2 3 23 3 27 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 3 3 12 3 26 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 4 and 2 80 3 22 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 5 respectively it can be seen from the picture that the corresponding yield would not change with the crop market yield and it would reach the highest value when the optimal net benefit reached to the max value under scenarios of 1 2 3 and 4 the corresponding yield spring wheat were all around 7 4 7 5 t hm2 on the extreme dry condition scenario 5 the corresponding crop yield was 6 5 7 4 t hm2 as to the optimal irrigation amount it neither differed with the crop market prices as a conclusion the crop market price was the crucial factor to the optimal net benefit and it would not influence the corresponding crop yield and optimal irrigation amount 5 conclusions to program the irrigation scheduling of spring wheat in northwest china and obtain the optimal net benefit we proposed a simulation optimization model considering the uncertainty of both hydrological parameters and crop market price this model integrated aquacrop model with optimization model and incorporated the bootstrap method this study constitutes a framework which was capable of 1 simulating the response of different irrigation schedules on crop yields based on crop growth model 2 searching out the global optimal irrigation scheduling by optimization model solved by genetic algorithm and 3 considering the uncertainties on hydrological elements and economic parameters by generating their interval numbers the developed model was firstly calibrated and validated based on experiment data in 2014 and 2015 then interval numbers of crop market price and hydrological elements such as precipitation and reference evapotranspiration were generated lastly the optimal irrigation schedules for spring wheat under various irrigation amount irrigation times initial soil water storage and crop market price were solved results show that the model is applicable for reflecting the complexities of simulation optimization under uncertainties for spring wheat irrigation scheduling the optimization results indicated that the optimal net benefit was around 9 97 27 0 103 yuan hm2 and the optimal irrigation amount increased with the increase of drought degree from 185 322 mm for the extreme wet condition to 442 507 mm for the extreme dry condition the net benefit with four irrigation events during the crop growing period was higher than the cases with three or two irrigation events and the net benefit was the highest with the largest initial soil water storage through pre sowing irrigations for spring wheat in the study area crop market price was the crucial factor to the net benefit and the optimal net benefit increased almost linearly with the increase of market price it should be noted that the above conclusions have some caveats that must be borne in mind when using the results firstly this study was for the plot scale in the farmland and only the typical crop type spring wheat and irrigation method border irrigation were considered more crop types and other irrigation methods should be considered in future studies to get their optimal water allocation strategies secondly although the market price was considered as a random variable in the study its variation with time or quantify of crop production was not considered the analysis of relationship between market price and time or crop production requires that much more data are available therefore further market research about the price and its related data is required in order to analyze the influence of prices on

11376,water scarcity is the major constraint to social economic development in arid and semiarid regions where irrigation needs to be scheduled properly for the main crops in this study a simulation optimization model for crop optimal irrigation scheduling under uncertainty was developed to maximize the net benefit the model integrated a water driven crop model aquacrop with the optimization model and incorporated the generation technique for the interval values of hydrological parameters i e precipitation and evapotranspiration and crop market prices to deal with uncertainties in these variables the water price was assumed constant the model was calibrated based on field experimental data obtained in 2014 and validated using 2015 data the field experiments involved spring wheat yongliang no 4 at shiyang river basin experiment station in wuwei city gansu province of northwest china the model was then used to generate the optimal irrigation schedules under various irrigation amounts irrigation events initial soil water storage and crop market price under uncertainty results indicated that the model is applicable for reflecting the complexities of simulation optimization under uncertainties for spring wheat irrigation water scheduling the optimization results indicated that the optimal irrigation amount range was 185 322 mm with the corresponding optimal net benefit of 1 05 2 77 104 yuan hm2 and yield of 7 4 7 6 kg hm2 for extreme wet conditions in the basin defined as the combination of the 5 frequency precipitation with 95 frequency evapotranspiration for extreme dry conditions the optimal irrigation amount range was 442 507 mm with the optimal net benefit of 0 85 2 64 104 yuan hm2 and the corresponding yield of 6 6 7 4 kg hm2 results also showed that four irrigation events under higher initial soil water storage were more likely to produce the higher net benefit and the optimal net benefit would increase as the crop market price increases as expected this work can be used to guide irrigation management for local farmers keywords irrigation optimization aquacrop interval numbers bootstrap genetic algorithm spring wheat 1 introduction china a big agricultural country faces a great challenge of severe water scarcity wang et al 2015 in china more than 60 of water is used for agricultural purposes so agricultural water consumption plays an important role in the overall water balance of the country wang et al 2010 deng et al 2015 in the northern part of china water shortage is very serious because this region has half of the total area of china but less than 20 of total national available water resources deng et al 2006 especially in northwestern regions natural rainfall cannot match crop water requirements and supplementary irrigation is needed to sustain and possibly increase crop yields zhou 1996 2001 deng et al 2006 however the water available for irrigation has been decreasing in recent years partly as a consequence of climate change but also due to the increasing competition for water demand from other sectors of the economy especially industry and domestic consumption singh 2012 wang et al 2017 therefore it is important that the scarce water resources used in irrigation are optimally allocated in order to guarantee food security improve farmers income and improve the general socio economic well being in the region the basic requirement work for irrigation water allocation in regional scales is to guarantee the crop yield with the limited irrigation water at farm or plot scale in doing this irrigation should be accurately timed and quantified i e there must be a robust irrigation scheduling program that ensures non productive soil water evapotranspiration or drainage losses are minimized arora and gajri 1998 thus optimization of irrigation scheduling is basically for optimization of irrigation water allocation this is essential to ensure water saving and by extension high net benefit for local farmers achieving the optimization of irrigation water scheduling would require knowledge about the response of crop growth yield to soil water situation and a model of the economic returns of crop production in the current study the former used one of the numerous available crop simulation models and the latter is a bespoke economic model depicting the net benefits for the project crop models were developed in the last few decades for simulating the indices of dynamic crop growth under different irrigation schedules bouman et al 1996 water driven models one type of crop growth models are based on crop growth controlled by phonological development processes and they normally assume that crop growth rate is linearly proportional to transpiration through a constant of proportionality steduto and albrizio 2005 water driven models are the least complex and most parsimonious as compared to other crop growth models steduto et al 2007 2009 it is particularly suitable for semi arid and arid regions where water is the key limiting factor for crop production one of the most popular water driven crop models is aquacrop steduto et al 2009 which was developed by the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations in recent years aquacrop has been widely used to simulate the crop water consumption and crop yield under different irrigation schedules salemi et al 2011 kiptum et al 2013 lorite et al 2013 nazari et al 2013 vanuytrecht et al 2014 kim and kaluarachchi 2015 paredes et al 2015 voloudakis et al 2015 li et al 2016a b c although simulation models for crop growth are good at describing the effects of various irrigation schedules on the crop growth they could only be used to get the answers to what if questions singh 2014b it means that the irrigation schedules are based on scenario analysis of several user defined alternatives in this case a number of pre specified irrigation schedules will be evaluated by comparing the results of crop yield and or water use efficiency simulated by crop growth models then the irrigation schedule with higher crop yield or net benefit will be recommended however whilst the recommended irrigation scheduling may be the best one among the chosen options it is unlikely to be exactly the global optimal irrigation schedule shang and mao 2006a b to achieve a truly global optimum optimization methods must be combined with simulation models to derive optimal irrigation schedules singh and panda 2013 singh 2014a genetic algorithm ga introduced in the 1970s holland 1975 is one of the frequently used algorithms for solving optimization problems in water management ga is based on the analogy of the mechanics of biological genetics and imitate the phenomenon of selection of the fittest individuals baron 1998 the solution set in ga is represented by a population of strings which comprises a number of blocks each block represents the individual decision variables of the optimization problem strings are processed and combined according to their fitness in order to generate new strings that have the best features of two parent strings selection crossover and mutation are the three fundamental operations involved in ga to manipulate strings and move to a new generation compared with other traditional methods linear method nonlinear method and dynamic programming ga is more likely to be used in solving the simulation optimization model and it has been widely used in irrigation scheduling optimization or irrigation water allocation wu et al 2007 moghaddasi et al 2010 wen et al 2017 in previous simulation optimization models the simulation part was usually an integration of crop water production functions jensen 1968 and water balance equation for example shang and mao 2006a b developed a simulation optimization model based on crop water production functions and produced the optimal irrigation date series for winter wheat in north china yu and shang 2016 determined the optimal irrigation scheduling on a crop rotation system with a multi objective simulation optimization model by integrating water balance model crop water production functions and optimization model wen et al 2017 analyzed the optimal irrigation schedules for spring wheat under plastic mulching using a simulation optimization model by coupling water balance model crop water production functions and optimization model however crop water production functions were traditionally obtained from long term field experiments which are site specific expensive and time consuming the resulting outcomes of such empiricisms are therefore unlikely to be sufficiently generic as to be transferable to other settings thus limiting their usefulness to our best knowledge there are few irrigation scheduling simulation optimization modelling schemes that have coupled crop growth simulation model and optimization model this is mainly because most of the crop growth simulation models are complex and not convenient to be readily coupled with the other models our current work is therefore an effort at closing this knowledge gap another relevant issue to consider is that irrigation scheduling optimizations in real field conditions are more challenging because many uncertain factors are involved such as climate parameters and economic parameters li and guo 2014 li et al 2016a b c these climate parameters usually change temporally and are complicated by various uncertainties such uncertainties will compound the complexity of irrigation scheduling optimization by simulation optimization models or other traditional methods li et al 2016a b c most of the previous simulation optimization models used the average values for the uncertain factors which would neglect their randomness accordingly introducing uncertainty theory into traditional simulation optimization method can help to tackle the uncertainty in various input factors thus reflecting the true complexity and reality of irrigation systems among the widely used uncertainty methods the interval mathematical programming approach is popular because of its computational efficiency li et al 2018 it considers the uncertainty by approximating the lower and upper boundaries of the variables concerned in addition as the major driving factors hydrological elements such as precipitation and evapotranspiration usually exhibit various degrees of stochasticity in their behavior that must be accommodated therefore it is more thorough for the simulation optimization based irrigation scheduling to consider the stochasticity occurring in these inputs by fully specifying their complete probability distribution function whence derive the uncertainty characterization of the optimization decision variables and objective function evaluation wheat one of the most important food crops is the staple food for about 34 40 of the world s population and 50 of chinese population jia 2013 china is the largest wheat producing country in the world in china the perennial wheat planting area accounts for 25 of the total food crops planting area yang 2010 in the arid regions of northwest china spring wheat is also widely cultivated with irrigation as expected tong et al 2007 jiang et al 2012 wheat has a high seasonal water requirement for maximum yields border irrigation sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation are the main types of irrigation systems although drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation are more efficient than border irrigation deng et al 2006 farmers in arid regions of china prefer to adopt border irrigation because of the low cost of irrigation equipment he et al 2013 thus spring wheat and border irrigation were selected as the target crop type and the irrigation technology respectively for the purpose of investigating irrigation scheduling optimization in this study taking into account the considerations above the aim of this study is to develop a simulation optimization model for wheat crop irrigation scheduling that maximizes farmers net benefit given uncertainties in both the climatological and economic situations the model will integrate a simulation model for crop growth aquacrop and the optimization model formulated to maximize the net economic benefit from the project uncertainty in both hydrological and economic inputs was handled using the interval parameter approach because of its relative simplicity compared to other more formal and sophisticated stochastic optimization approaches this study thus entailed several elements as listed below i evaluating the performance of aquacrop for predicting soil water storage canopy cover above ground biomass and crop yield based on the field experiment data from 2014 calibration and 2015 validation ii generating uncertainty interval numbers for hydrological precipitation and evapotranspiration and economic crop price for different frequencies iii coupling the simulation optimization models to develop optimum irrigation scheduling based on the generated uncertainty interval values iv application of the coupled model to the optimal irrigation scheduling for spring wheat in northwest china the remainder of the manuscript is arranged as follows in the next section fuller details about the adopted methodology are provided this is followed by a description of the field experiments to obtain data for driving the models next the results are presented and discussed and finally the main conclusions of the study are presented 2 simulation optimization model for irrigation scheduling under uncertainty 2 1 aquacrop model description and evaluation 2 1 1 model description the aquacrop crop growth simulation model version 5 0 was used to assess the response of spring wheat to different irrigation treatments aquacrop simulates daily water balance in the root zone and crop development with a small number of inputs e g meteorological conditions initial values of the model parameters soil characteristics and management practices a full description of the theory and functions of aquacrop can be found in previous research hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 consequently only the key components of aquacrop for simulating crop yield are provided here the biomass produced over the growth period b kg m2 is represented as 1 b w p l l t r l e t 0 l where trl is the actual crop transpiration in lth day mm day and is given by 2 t r l k s c c k c t r x e t 0 l the resulting yield y kg m2 is 3 y b h i where wp is the normalized water productivity kg m2

variables were estimated during model calibration table 3 contains the complete list of the model parameters needed calibrated and their brief descriptions 2 1 2 model calibration and performance evaluation the model was calibrated and validated using data collected during field experiments over two years 2014 and 2015 including soil water storage at 1 m depth canopy cover above ground biomass and the crop yield the measured canopy cover was converted from the observed lai according to the empirical equation iqbal et al 2010 the measured data in 2014 were used to calibrate the model using a trial and error approach which involves altering the parameter values and evaluating the performance of the model using indices in eq 4 and 5 the calibration was stopped when the indices attained acceptable ranges as discussed below to validate the model the final calibrated parameters were applied to simulate the 2015 field data and the resulting performance during validation was also evaluated using similar indices employed during the calibration moriasi et al 2007 as noted above the performance of the aquacrop model was evaluated during calibration to determine when to terminate the process the performance of the calibrated model was evaluated using both the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the determination coefficient r 2 the equations are as follows 4 n r m s e 100 m a v e 1 k k 1 k m k s k 2 5 r 2 k 1 k m k m a v e s k s a v e 2 k 1 k m k m a v e 2 k 1 k s k s a v e 2 where k is the number of the evaluated points sk is the simulated value mk is the measured

field experiment and in situ investigation i min and i max are the minimum and maximum volumes for irrigation water 2 3 interval parameter programming in this study there are some uncertain parameters e g precipitation reference evapotranspiration et 0 and crop market price in both simulation model and optimization model the interval numbers for them were considered and the optimization model with interval parameters was solved by best worst method huang et al 1995 the data series of precipitation and et 0 obtained from china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn site index html are usually more than 30 years the bootstrap method hu et al 2015 was used to generate the interval numbers for them the steps for generating the interval numbers for precipitation and et 0 are as set below i firstly obtain the empirical distribution of the data precipitation or et 0 and fit a theoretical frequency curve by comparing the fit with the empirical frequency distribution curve ii secondly using monte carlo simulation method resample from the theoretical frequency distribution of the original sample and repeat the re sampling for 1000 times with each replicate sample record having the same length as the original record length iii estimate the parameters for each new sample and fit the probability distribution iv finally for each of the fitted distributions obtain values corresponding to specific frequencies v obtain the interval for each of the frequencies in iv as x x where x is the minimum of all the 1000 values at a given frequency and x is the corresponding maximum in this study five scenarios were set according to the commonly used classification standard of wet and dry conditions of china scenario 1 extreme wet condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 5 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 95 scenario 2 wet condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 25 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 75 scenario 3 normal condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 50 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 50 scenario 4 dry condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 75 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 25 scenario 5 extreme dry condition corresponds to the combination of precipitation with frequency of 95 and evapotranspiration with frequency of 5 the data series of crop market price collected from agricultural product price net http www 3w3n com index goindex were from 2012 to 2017 the frequency of the price data were analyzed to obtain the probability density function 95 confidence interval was chosen to get the interval numbers for market price 2 4 framework for simulation optimization model under uncertainty the framework for simulation optimization model under uncertainty contains mainly three parts fig 1 the first part focused on the generation of interval parameters the second part was the application of aquacrop model and the third part was the solution for the optimization model in the first part the uncertainties for hydrometeorological parameters and socioeconomic parameters were considered for hydrometeorological data the interval numbers of parameters were generated by bootstrap method i e precipitation and reference evapotranspiration as to socioeconomic parameters e g the market price for crop frequency distribution was analyzed and 95 confidence interval were chosen to obtain the interval numbers in the second part aquacrop model was calibrated and validated with the experimental data and then applied to simulate the corresponding crop yield under various irrigation schedules based on the first two parts the optimal irrigation scheduling for maximum net benefit was solved by the genetic algorithm ga holland 1975 the framework was realized on the platform of matlab r2016a mathworks inc ma usa first the interval numbers were generated by the functions of matlab then the initial inputs of aquacrop model were prepared and aquacropplug in exe was called by the matlab command dos to simulate the corresponding yield after that the objective function of optimal model was calculated and the optimal irrigation scheduling was solved by genetic algorithm toolbox through the functions on matlab 3 field experiment field experiments were carried out at shiyang river basin experiment station in wuwei city gansu province of northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e and 1581 m above sea level in 2014 and 2015 the experimental station lies in a typical arid region with 164 mm mean annual precipitation and 2000 mm pan evaporation e601 jiang et al 2016 the soil at the experiment site is loam with an average bulk density of 1 44 g cm3 and a filed capacity of 280 mm in 0 100 cm soil layer the groundwater depth is more than 30 m in recent years spring wheat yongliang no 4 was selected as the target crop and was sowed on march 26 and harvested on july 24 in 2014 and sowed on march 21 and harvested on july 19 in 2015 the experimental design was a randomized block and each plot had an area of 5 5 7 5 m2 the treatments included mulched and non mulched cases although here we only concentrated on the non mulched ones the non mulched cases include one sufficient irrigation treatment and four deficient ones with different water stress in growing stages table 1 each treatment with three replicates in 2014 and two in 2015 spring wheat was irrigated through border irrigation with the water pumped from the aquifer and irrigation volume was measured by the flow meter in addition pre sowing irrigation was applied to promote seed emergence and ensure seedling growth time domain reflectometry imko micromodultechnik gmbh germany was used to measure volumetric soil water content periodically every 6 9 days at the plot center along the soil profile every 20 cm depth to 100 cm a canopy analysis system sunscan delta t devices ltd cambridge uk was used to record leaf area index lai with 3 replicates in each plot the above ground biomass was measured by oven drying method the crop yield was determined from two uniform areas of 1 1 m2 each with the ears air dried naturally and weighed by scale soil samples were taken in five soil layers with three replications along the soil profile to measure soil properties table 2 in laboratory after harvest 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation for aquacrop results of model calibration and validation are shown in fig 2 and the calibrated parameters are presented in table 3 results showed that the simulated values were in good agreement with the measured values for both model calibration and validation all the evaluation indicators were within acceptable ranges for example the determination coefficient r 2 were all above 0 65 and most of them were above 0 90 for model calibration in model validation the values of r 2 were a little lower than calibration but all of them were above 0 57 in terms of nrmse they ranged from 2 44 to 15 1 for calibration and ranged from 5 41 to 13 7 for validation results showed a good performance of aquacrop and indicated it was capable to be used for predicting the soil water storage canopy cover above ground biomass and crop yield for spring wheat at the field site fig 3 shows the measured and simulated values of soil water storage in 1 m soil layer canopy cover and above ground biomass for two irrigation treatments irrigation treatment ⅰ and ⅴ in 2014 each irrigation depth in irrigation treatment ⅴ 170 mm for total was half of the depth in irrigation treatment ⅰ 340 mm for total results of soil water storage in 1 m soil layer figs 3a and b showed that the simulated values were in accordance with the observations with the sharp increase in soil water storage responding to water input through irrigation precipitation followed by a gradual decrease due to the continuous evapotranspiration soil water storage after the first irrigation in treatment ⅴ was significantly lower than that in treatment ⅰ it indicated some of the soil water was used for crop evapotranspiration because of the insufficient water input under treatment ⅴ feng et al 2014 results of canopy cover figs 3c and d showed that the simulated canopy cover was in good agreement with the measured values the maximum canopy cover reached 99 in irrigation treatment ⅰ and 97 in irrigation treatment ⅴ which indicated that deficit irrigation could decrease the canopy cover for spring wheat figs 3e and f showed that the simulation results of above ground biomass fitted well with the measured values both increasing almost linearly during the growth period in the end of the growth stage above ground biomass in irrigation treatment ⅰ was 16 34 t hm2 and it reduced to 13 34 t hm2 when the irrigation amount was cut down to 50 for the crop yield the simulated values ranged from 5 11 t hm2 to 7 48 t hm2 under various irrigation treatments which were consistent with previous study in the same study area he et al 2013 yang et al 2017 2018 results also confirmed those of lamm et al 1995 pandey et al 2000 and igbadun et al 2008 who stated that deficit irrigation would reduce the crop yield therefore it is very necessary to balance the precious irrigation water and the crop yield net benefit in other words irrigation scheduling optimization is very essential to the local farmers in the arid regions 4 2 interval numbers for parameters 4 2 1 precipitation and reference evapotranspiration time series for precipitation and reference evapotranspiration are 55 year from 1951 to 2016 and they were collected from wuwei hydrological station 37 55 n 102 40 e and 1532 m above sea level through the china meteorological data sharing service system in this study ten days precipitation and reference evapotranspiration over the growing period were analyzed and the interval numbers of them were obtained using the bootstrap method described previously through hydrological curve fitting the probability distribution of ten days precipitation or reference evapotranspiration was determined and parameters were estimated the pearson type ⅲ distribution was fitted to the values of ten days precipitation or reference evapotranspiration with the distribution parameters estimated using the method of least squares the eleventh ten days in spring wheat growing period 110 to 120 day after sowing precipitation and reference evapotranspiration were used as examples to demonstrate the generation of interval numbers by the bootstrap method and the probability distributions are shown in fig 4 the eleventh ten days reference evapotranspiration et 0 in spring wheat growing period was taken as an example fig 5 presents the frequency histogram and the normal probability plot of ten days et 0 values under the frequencies of 5 25 50 75 and 95 the figure shows that the normal distribution function fitted the frequency histogram well under each frequency the scatters were evenly distributed around the 45 line showing the distribution values of ten days et 0 under each frequency was approximately a normal distribution therefore using the normal distribution the interval number of each frequency was obtained for the 95 confidence interval similarly the interval numbers of the other ten days et 0 and all ten days precipitation were obtained and listed in table 4 4 2 2 market price for spring wheat the market price for spring wheat in gansu province fig 6 was collected from agricultural product price net the frequency distribution of market price fig 7 was fitted according to the series values by kernel density estimation rosenblatt 1956 parzen 1962 and 95 confidence interval was chosen to get the interval numbers for spring wheat market price i e 2 03 4 21 yuan kg 4 3 optimal irrigation scheduling of spring wheat 4 3 1 influence of irrigation amount on optimal net benefit the simulation optimization model was used to solve the optimal net benefit for spring wheat under various irrigation amounts i min and i max in eq 6b as detailed in table 5 and the initial soil water storage was set at field capacity 0 28 m3 m 3 considering pre sowing irrigation results of the interval values of the net benefit at various irrigation amounts are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the optimal net benefit initially increased almost linearly with the increase of irrigation amount and then peaks before declining slightly as the irrigation water volume increased for all the scenarios the corresponding yield of spring wheat with the optimal net benefit was also closely related with the irrigation amount which increased with the increasing of irrigation amount at lower level and became stable at higher level this is to be expected because irrigation is crucial to the crop yield when the crop water demand was not satisfied as the soil becomes wetter with further irrigation however the marginal return on yield from any over irrigation will be minimal indeed as shown by the plots in fig 8 over irrigation can be detrimental to crop yield in addition to being wasteful of water under this condition the extra irrigation water would not produce more crop yield but waste more money on water fee and finally contributed to the decrease of net benefit regarding the benefits it can be seen that the upper optimal net benefits were around 2 70 104 yuan hm2 and the lower optimal net benefits were around 9 97 103 yuan hm2 fig 9 the optimal irrigation amount i e the irrigation amount at which net benefit peaks can be seen to increase as the precipitation frequency increases while the optimal net benefit decreased slightly with increasing precipitation frequency under the extreme wet condition 5 precipitation frequency the optimal net benefit was the highest 1 05 2 77 104 yuan hm2 with the irrigation amount 185 322 mm under the extreme dry condition 95 precipitation frequency the optimal net benefit decreased to 0 85 2 64 104 yuan hm2 for the irrigation amount 442 507 mm when the optimal net benefit was obtained the corresponding yields under different frequencies were around 6 6 t hm2 to 7 6 t hm2 the upper and lower corresponding yields would be approximately equal when the irrigation amount was large enough in a previous study on optimal irrigation scheduling of spring wheat in the same study area feng et al 2014 used a crop growth simulation model to simulate the crop yields under different irrigation schedules and selected the scheduling with the highest crop yield as the optimal irrigation schedule they finally obtained recommended irrigation amounts of 322 mm 328 mm and 400 mm for wet condition normal condition and dry condition respectively the wet and dry conditions results by feng et al 2014 fall within the corresponding optimal values of our study i e 300 400 mm for wet condition and 383 473 mm for dry condition their result of 328 mm for normal conditions however is totally outside the corresponding optimal range of 350 433 mm of the current study a possible reason for this discrepancy may have to do with the fact that the work by feng et al 2014 involved only simulation and hence their results may not have been the global optimum in addition uncertainties in both hydrometeorological data and socioeconomic data were considered in searching for the optimal irrigation schedules in our study 4 3 2 influence of irrigation times on optimal net benefit the optimal irrigation amount in section 4 3 1 fig 9 were used to investigate the influence of irrigation times on optimal net benefit and its corresponding yield the initial soil water storage was also set at the field capacity results are shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows that for almost all the scenarios the optimal net benefit of four irrigation events was the highest followed by the three irrigation events and the least was two irrigations under scenario 1 extreme wet condition the upper boundary of optimal net benefit under three irrigation events was a little higher than the others in other words irrigation times had little influence on the optimal net benefit under the extreme wet condition it can also be seen from the figure that with four irrigation events the optimal net benefit decreased slightly when the condition becomes drier with the average intervals 1 0 2 7 104 yuan hm2 with four irrigation events the optimal net benefits would decrease by 22 for the lower boundary and 6 for the upper boundary when the precipitation frequency increased to 95 at two irrigation events however the optimal net benefit decreased sharply with the increasing of the precipitation frequency with the average intervals 0 6 2 3 104 yuan hm2 the optimal net benefits would decrease by 55 for the lower boundary and 35 for the upper boundary when the precipitation frequency increased to 95 under two irrigation events fig 10 also shows that the intervals of optimal net benefit under higher irrigation frequency would be smaller when the precipitation frequency become larger in other words fewer irrigation events would cause larger uncertainties because of the weather variations as also reported previously by he et al 2013 all of the above indicates that four irrigation events would produce higher net benefit under the higher precipitation frequency i e dry conditions additionally irrespective of the prevailing climate scenario wet normal and dry the acceptable optimal net benefit would only be obtained if the irrigation was accurately scheduled and programmed the yield results were similar to the net benefit with the yield for four irrigation events being the highest for all scenarios this also further reinforces earlier findings by he et al 2013 that four irrigation events were more likely to be the best choice for spring wheat in shiyang river basin therefore four irrigation events can be set as the optimal irrigation frequency for spring wheat in the study area 4 3 3 influence of initial soil water storage on optimal net benefit pre sowing irrigation was popular to improve the initial soil water storage but in some places pre sowing irrigation was not implemented and the initial soil water storage would not reach the field capacity therefore it is essential to program the optimal irrigation schedules under different initial soil water storage thus optimal irrigation amount in section 4 3 1 fig 9 and four irrigation events during the crop growing period were used to investigate the influence of initial soil water storage on the optimal net benefit and its corresponding yield the initial soil water storage was set as 20 40 60 and 80 of the field capacity results are shown in fig 11 fig 11 shows that the optimal net benefit increased with the increase of the initial soil water storage under all scenarios with the average intervals of 0 4 1 2 104 yuan hm2 under 20 field capacity 0 6 1 8 104 yuan hm2 under 40 field capacity 0 8 2 4 104 yuan hm2 under 60 field capacity and 0 8 2 5 104 yuan hm2 under 80 field capacity they were all smaller than the result under the initial storage of field capacity 1 0 2 7 104 yuan hm2 which means increasing the initial soil water storage would help to increase the net benefit for spring wheat as to its corresponding yields they also increased with the increase of initial soil water storage but differed distinctly under different scenarios from 2 65 t hm2 to 7 46 t hm2 indicating pre sowing irrigation was essential to promote crop yield and net benefit these results are consistent with previous study wen et al 2017 in the same study area that the higher initial soil water storage would produce higher crop yield 4 3 4 sensitivity analysis of market price on optimal net benefit the simulation optimization model was used to solve the optimal net benefit for spring wheat under various crop market price to analyze the influence of market price on the results in this section the initial soil water storage was set at field capacity 0 28 m3 m 3 considering pre sowing irrigation results are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the optimal net benefit increased almost linearly with the increase of crop market price at both upper and lower boundary the upper optimal net benefit ranged from 1 01 104 yuan hm2 to 3 37 104 yuan hm2 and the lower optimal net benefit were from 0 83 104 yuan hm2 to 3 29 104 yuan hm2 under the lowest market price 2 yuan kg the optimal net benefit was 1 05 1 10 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 1 1 03 1 07 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 2 1 01 1 04 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 3 0 97 1 03 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 4 and 0 83 1 01 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 5 respectively when the crop market price reached 5 yuan kg the optimal net benefit would increase to 3 29 3 37 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 1 3 26 3 32 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 2 3 23 3 27 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 3 3 12 3 26 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 4 and 2 80 3 22 104 yuan hm2 in scenario 5 respectively it can be seen from the picture that the corresponding yield would not change with the crop market yield and it would reach the highest value when the optimal net benefit reached to the max value under scenarios of 1 2 3 and 4 the corresponding yield spring wheat were all around 7 4 7 5 t hm2 on the extreme dry condition scenario 5 the corresponding crop yield was 6 5 7 4 t hm2 as to the optimal irrigation amount it neither differed with the crop market prices as a conclusion the crop market price was the crucial factor to the optimal net benefit and it would not influence the corresponding crop yield and optimal irrigation amount 5 conclusions to program the irrigation scheduling of spring wheat in northwest china and obtain the optimal net benefit we proposed a simulation optimization model considering the uncertainty of both hydrological parameters and crop market price this model integrated aquacrop model with optimization model and incorporated the bootstrap method this study constitutes a framework which was capable of 1 simulating the response of different irrigation schedules on crop yields based on crop growth model 2 searching out the global optimal irrigation scheduling by optimization model solved by genetic algorithm and 3 considering the uncertainties on hydrological elements and economic parameters by generating their interval numbers the developed model was firstly calibrated and validated based on experiment data in 2014 and 2015 then interval numbers of crop market price and hydrological elements such as precipitation and reference evapotranspiration were generated lastly the optimal irrigation schedules for spring wheat under various irrigation amount irrigation times initial soil water storage and crop market price were solved results show that the model is applicable for reflecting the complexities of simulation optimization under uncertainties for spring wheat irrigation scheduling the optimization results indicated that the optimal net benefit was around 9 97 27 0 103 yuan hm2 and the optimal irrigation amount increased with the increase of drought degree from 185 322 mm for the extreme wet condition to 442 507 mm for the extreme dry condition the net benefit with four irrigation events during the crop growing period was higher than the cases with three or two irrigation events and the net benefit was the highest with the largest initial soil water storage through pre sowing irrigations for spring wheat in the study area crop market price was the crucial factor to the net benefit and the optimal net benefit increased almost linearly with the increase of market price it should be noted that the above conclusions have some caveats that must be borne in mind when using the results firstly this study was for the plot scale in the farmland and only the typical crop type spring wheat and irrigation method border irrigation were considered more crop types and other irrigation methods should be considered in future studies to get their optimal water allocation strategies secondly although the market price was considered as a random variable in the study its variation with time or quantify of crop production was not considered the analysis of relationship between market price and time or crop production requires that much more data are available therefore further market research about the price and its related data is required in order to analyze the influence of prices on

11377,there is a notion that more withdrawal of groundwater for irrigating the rice crop in rice wheat cropping system is responsible for water table decline in central punjab of india any reduction in irrigation water by the improved irrigation schedules in rice like alternate wetting and drying and based on soil moisture potential shifting planting date crop diversification of higher irrigation requirement to lower direct seeded rice laser levelling etc and appropriate tillage system to reduce percolation losses save water and increase water productivity however the present study showed that water deficit evapotranspiration rainfall surface water can approximate the water table decline rise rather than groundwater withdrawal alone in rice wheat system though irrigation water requirement of wheat crop is less 300 400 mm than rice 1500 2000 mm yet the water deficit responsible for water table decline is more in wheat crop than rice in rice transplanted at recommended time evapotranspiration et is almost equal to the rainfall while in wheat et is 3 9 times that of rainfall it warrants the et reduction in wheat overlooked so far for supplementary amelioration of water table decline in rice wheat cropping system reduction in et and saving of energy by different technologies in wheat crop has also been discussed keywords rice wheat system water deficit water table decline dynamics of water balance component in wheat 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l wheat triticum aestivum l cropping system being highly productive and profitable dominates the irrigated alluvial tract of indo gangetic plains of south asia in indo gangetic basin of india area under rice wheat double cropping is 10 million hectare m ha out of that 2 6 m ha falls in indian punjab the grain bowl of india the productivity of rice is 5 5 6 5 t ha 1 and that of wheat is 4 0 5 5 t ha 1 rice is grown during the months of june to october locally named as kharif season and wheat from october to april locally named as rabi season under irrigated conditions water resources in the state are scarce in conjunction with problems of water table decline and increased energy demand for pumping of groundwater the annual utilizable water resources are 3 48 million hectare meter m ha m constituted by 1 80 m ha m by surface water entering punjab from indus river system plus 1 68 m ha m by groundwater the total water demand as evapotranspiration et for agricultural plus non agricultural uses is 4 76 m ha m resulting in annual deficit of 1 28 m ha m jain 2013 approximately 61 per cent of the total water demand is through by the two major crops i e 33 per cent by rice and 28 per cent by wheat for meeting the et demand the total water input made is normally 2200 mm 600 mm by rain 1600 mm by irrigation in rice and 510 mm 110 mm by rain 400 mm by irrigation in wheat however the water input and et varies spatially depending upon soil type crop variety and seasonal weather conditions jalota and arora 2002 jalota et al 2011 2014 in wheat based cropping system rice was introduced during the end of seventies from that time onward the area under both the crops has increased in 1980 the area under rice and wheat was 1 18 and 2 81 m ha which increased to 2 60 and 3 50 m ha in 2013 respectively this shift in cropped area has led to over exploitation of sub soil water in 80 per cent blocks of the state coupled with increased energy demand from 1850 m kwh to 10 780 m kwh anonymous 2014 for pumping water due to fast declining of water table during that period water table decline rate increased from 0 20 m yr 1 1980 1990 to 0 45 m yr 1 2008 13 with intervening decline rates of 0 90 m yr 1 2000 2005 and 0 75 m yr 1 2005 2008 the average water table depth in central punjab was 6 0 m in 1980 that increased to 9 0 m in 1995 and 21 0 m in 2013 there is a general notion that more withdrawal of groundwater for rice is the main cause of water table decline in rice wheat cropping system however field water budgeting by jalota 2004 showed that it is not rice crop per se but is its transplanting date that decides the decline or rise in water table depending upon the water deficit or gain evapotranspiration rainfall surface water during the crop season water table declines when et exceeds rainfall plus surface water and vice versa based on that concept and using mean values of et and rainfall for 20 years 1981 2000 it has been estimated that in june 1st julian day 162 transplanted rice water table declined by 0 28 m while in that of june 21st julian day 182 water table moved up by 0 08 m it suggests that for ameliorating water table decline et has to be managed following that approach an integrated management in rice i e shifting transplanting date to lower evaporative demand on june 25 concomitant with shorter duration cultivars 90 days from transplanting to harvest was advocated by jalota et al 2009 by which et was reduced by 140 mm almost double than managing the single i e 69 mm by shifting transplanting from may 25 or 71 mm by growing shorter duration variety than longer of 110 days in wheat crop water management strategies from the last five decades have been focussed mainly on increasing yield and rationalization of irrigation water in a simulation study options for increasing yield and water productivity of wheat in punjab india has been evaluated by timsina et al 2008 using the dssat csm ceres wheat model different adaptations including irrigation technology irrigation scheduling and methods and allied management i e crop varietal diversification tillage and use of fertilizers use of crop residue for mulching and cultural practices like planting time and plant population for reducing irrigation water in wheat have been accomplished but not even a single study explaining water table change corresponding to water deficit in wheat crop is available therefore the present study was undertaken to understand dynamics of water balance components in wheat and water table change in relation to seasonal water deficit overlooked so far under rice wheat cropping system 2 materials and methods the study pertains to rice wheat cropping system in central zone of the punjab state india fig 1 this zone covers 2 36 m ha 44 area of the state the climate of the zone is characterized by hot dry semi arid with summers april to june months with maximum temperature of 35 39 c and cool winters december to february months with minimum temperature of 6 9 c the temperature reaches as high as 46 c in summer months of may and june comprising the hottest months of the year january is the coldest month of the year occasionally drops to 2 3 c the major portion of the rain is through summer monsoons which generally set in july and continue till september covering kharif season during rabi season the rains are by western disturbances the annual average rainfall over last 40 years is 573 109 mm the area is highly productive underlain with good quality water two third of the state s tube wells are located in this zone and provide irrigation to 85 percent area in several parts of this zone water table has gone beyond 30 m depth and has increased the energy requirement for pumping water in the present study water balance components in wheat were simulated using the weather data collected from agro meteorological laboratory at punjab agricultural university ludhiana and already customized cropsyst model jalota et al 2011 2013 in an independent field experiment on rice wheat cropping system at punjab agricultural university farm water table depth was measured with automatic water table depth recorder annual rabi and kharif water table change was worked for ludhiana from water table depth data reported by directorate of water resources and environment govt of punjab and approximated from water deficit divided by specific yield 0 20 the energy required to lift water was worked out using eq 1 1 e m g h t i m e c f p u m p i n g e f f i c i e n c y where e is energy required in kwh m is mass of water in kg g is acceleration due to gravity in newton 9 8 m s 2 h is height of water lifting in m timecf is time conversion factor 3 6 102 pumping efficiency was taken as 50 percent 3 results and discussion in the last two decades a number of technologies focussing on reduction in irrigation for saving water in rice crop have been established by the researchers in the region table 1 based on that punjab agricultural university ludhiana made laudable recommendations in rice crop like shifting of trans planting date to june 20 which became an act in 2009 growing shorter duration varieties and scheduling irrigation based on soil water potential of 16 k pa like rice in wheat crop also irrigation water saving technologies like planting date in relation to crop duration and irrigation scheduling based on irrigation water cumulative pan evaporation iw pan e ratio and appropriate tillage have been recommend to reduce irrigation water by punjab agricultural university http web pau edu content pf pp all these irrigation water saving technologies in rice and wheat crops resulted in reduction of withdrawal of groundwater by 0 91 m ha m during the period 2008 2014 compared to that of 2002 2008 however no relation of these management interventions and decline of groundwater table was developed in rice and wheat crops individually and in the cropping system this warrants the understanding of water balance dynamics water table change in the crop season and ways to reduce et in wheat crop 3 1 dynamics of water balance components in wheat the dynamics of water balance components in wheat crop based on an averaged data of past 10 years 1999 2009 simulations with cropsyst model showed that accumulated et remained higher than rainfall throughout the growing period irrigation water remained higher than et during initial 90 days of planting and became equal thereafter fig 2 at 155 days cumulative et irrigation water and rainfall were 363 mm 355 mm and 86 mm respectively indicating that water lost as et was more than groundwater withdrawn for irrigation the drainage 84 mm was almost equal to rainfall 86 mm however water balance components varied with soil texture e g the et was more by 36 per cent and drainage less by 44 per cent in medium than coarse textured soils jalota and arora 2002 3 2 water table change the analysis of observed groundwater data during 2001 2016 showed decline in water table annually in all the years except 2002 2004 and 2009 fig 3 a season wise water table mostly moved up during mid june to mid october kharif and fell during mid october to mid june rabi fig 3b water table also declined in some kharif seasons but that was less than that in rabi season jain and sondhi 1998 also reported falling of water table 0 94 m yr 1 during rabi seasons from 1980 to 1992 in bist doab tract of indian punjab these observations and that of minhas et al 2010 do not corroborate the general notion that rice in the rice wheat system is the major culprit for the water table decline but supports that there are seasonal changes in water table which are related to water deficit in the crop seasonal water deficit averaged across years 1999 2009 showed that water table moved up during rice as rainfall 649 mm exceeded et 553 mm by 96 mm and fell during wheat as rainfall 86 mm was less than et 363 mm by 277 mm it indicates that rice though requiring higher irrigation water input than wheat 1600 mm against 355 mm cannot be considered as the reason for overall water decline since most of it helps in the recharge of the water table depending upon rainfall and water table depth the wheat crop though expends less groundwater as irrigation than rice yet causes decline in water table because almost the whole groundwater withdrawn for irrigation due to low rainfall is expended as et fig 2 in a field experiment of rice wheat cropping system water table depth measured with automatic water table depth recorder also confirmed that there was a rise of water table during rice crop and decline during wheat fig 4 for the same years seasonal change in water table depth computed from water deficit and specific yield showed that the measured continuous line and computed hollow points trends were identical however there was some temporal deviation in magnitude that may be due to characteristics of vadose zone and specific yield besides the water deficit the results suggest that i water table decline or rise in a crop season can be approximated if et rain surface water supply and specific yield characteristics of vadose zone and depth of water table are known precisely and ii water table decline can be ameliorated by adopting the et and water deficit reduction measures 3 3 ways to reduce et in wheat 3 3 1 irrigation scheduling irrigation scheduling to a crop mainly aims at developing amount and time of irrigation water that eliminates over or under irrigation and ensures optimum yields with high water productivity the irrigation scheduling differs with amount of water supply and the purpose under ample water supplies irrigation is applied before any yield or quality reducing water stress builds keeping this in view an irrigation schedule based on the plant phenology was developed by which 5 6 post sowing irrigations to wheat crop are applied at fixed growth stages i e crown root initiation tillering jointing booting and grain formation this schedule along with optimum dose of fertilizers gave maximum yield 5 5 t ha 1 no doubt yield was maximized by this approach but a considerable amount of water 100 mm i e one third of the post sowing irrigation got percolated jalota et al 1985 further water productivity yield irrigation water and water use efficiency yield et were less by this approach as irrigation water and et above threshold values did not contribute to yield to overcome those prihar et al 1974 suggested a simple concept to schedule irrigations to wheat based on the ratio of fixed depth of irrigation water to cumulative pan e minus rainfall since previous irrigation being a deficit irrigation technique it promoted use of profile stored water by inducing deeper rooting in wheat and saved 75 125 mm irrigation water prihar et al 1976 reduced 83 mm et and 88 mm percolation compared to irrigations at fixed growth stages without any loss in yield jalota et al 1985 3 3 2 crop diversification diversification of wheat to crops with lower et like raya brassica juncea l and gram cicer aeritinum l reduced 100 mm and 90 mm et respectively jalota 2004 irrigation water saved by each diversified crop was 150 mm the reduction of et by diversifying wheat to winter maize or sunflower was negligible 3 3 3 cultural practices planting time and cultivars the wheat crop sown from end of october to first week of december months experiences a wide range of weather conditions which may influence the crop yield and water balance components under irrigated jalota et al 2011 as well as rain fed vashisht et al 2013 environments for instance averaged across six cropping seasons 2008 09 to 2014 15 yields in october 20 november 05 and november 20 sown irrigated wheat were statistically at par vashisht and jalota 2018 but there was a saving of 80 mm irrigation water and reduction of 81 mm et in november 20th sown wheat compared to october 20th table 2 crop residues surface retention of crop residues as mulch is known to have multifarious effects these conserve soil water moderate the thermal regime suppress weeds and improve soil health and result in irrigation water saving the benefits of saving irrigation water by straw mulch are as much as 70 300 mm in summer crops for comparable yield jalota et al 2007 straw mulching in crops also reduce soil water evaporation jalota and arora 2002 planting of wheat with happy seeder in the presence of rice residue not only saves pre sowing irrigation but also reduces 45 mm post sowing soil water evaporation losses sidhu et al 2009 singh et al 2011a b row spacing with decreasing row spacing soil water evaporation e is reduced in irrigated wheat e under row spacing of 22 5 cm 15 0 cm and 7 5 cm was less by 9 mm 25 mm and 26 mm respectively compared to 112 mm under the 30 cm row spacing chen et al 2010 however under irrigated conditions with adequate nutrient levels transpiration t may increase with decreased row spacing which may restrict the et reduction practically decreasing row spacing is of less utility as it restricts the farm operations and use of machinery saving of irrigation water by improving its application efficiency through laser levelling and plot size in relation to water delivery discharge soil type and slope has also been documented in package of practices of punjab agricultural university http web pau edu content pf pp but no information is available on et reduction and amelioration of water table decline 4 general discussion and conclusions the results reported in this study reveal that in rice wheat cropping system the observed water table declines annually if analysed season wise water table rises in most of the years during rice however water table declines in almost all the years during wheat it challenges the long and widely accepted view that excessive cultivation of rice and more withdrawal of groundwater for rice in central punjab is the main culprit for depletion and decline of groundwater in the state on the other hand theoretically it is not only the withdrawal of groundwater which causes change in groundwater as per eq 2 but precipitation evapotranspiration inflow and outflow runoff are also the factors that affect tremendously 2 δsg p i et ebs qp qsro δsm qg δss where δsg change in groundwater storage mm p total precipitation over the area mm i irrigation water applied over the area mm et evapotranspiration from cropped forest lands mm ebs evaporation from bare soil mm qp quantity of groundwater pumped draft mm qs surface run off from the area mm δsm change in soil moisture storage mm qg outflow of groundwater across the basin boundaries mm δssro change in surface storage in distribution system mm the equation points out that groundwater change is mainly constituted by three components i water deficit evapotranspiration rainfall surface water supply ii difference in subsurface inflow and outflow and iii groundwater withdrawal in the present study difference in subsurface inflow and outflow is taken nil which is based on an independent study wherein computed net flux over 10 years using gis and groundwater model was only up to 1 mm maximum kaur et al 2015 runoff is taken negligible as the rice fields are enclosed with sufficiently raised bunds it is also assumed that only that fraction of the total withdrawal contributes to water table decline which is used as et thus ruling out the contributions of total withdrawal and subsurface flow water deficit and specific yield have been used for evaluation of water table change the water deficit mainly varies with cropping system under a given soil and climatic conditions the computed water deficit in rice wheat based on the water balance model using information on soil crop weather management factors is 291 mm at ludhiana which is more by 51 mm in maize wheat less by 218 more in cotton wheat and 295 mm in sugarcane jalota and arora 2002 on analysing seasonal water deficit critically in the rice transplanted at recommended date after june 20 it is negligible however it is more with long duration varieties transplanted in may jalota 2004 water deficit in wheat crop individually is 95 percent of that in rice wheat system no doubt punjab agricultural university has recommended a number of management practices table 1 to save irrigation water in rice which have benefitted the farmers economically by dipping the cost of pumping water or using the saved water for irrigating extra land in rice or other crops but ironically no relation of these adaptation measures with decline of groundwater table was primed actually the reduced water deficit due to more rainfall and a part of return flow of the irrigation water in the soil beyond the root zone jalota and arora 2002 facilitate percolation and subsequently groundwater water recharge which is quite evident from the observed seasonal trends of groundwater change fig 3 these results confirm that growing of rice synchronizing period of low evaporative demand and rainy season helps in reducing pumpage and recharging the groundwater to some extent depending upon amount and distribution of rainfall the thickness permeability and homogeneity of the vadose zone and water table depth on the other hand during wheat crop rainfall is very less compared to evapotranspiration demand and whatsoever ground water is pumped to meet irrigation requirement is lost as et and causes decline in water table such a high water deficit 277 mm necessitates exploring possibility to reduce et in wheat by different water saving technologies and relate it with water table decline water in a cropping system is saved for two purposes i decreasing groundwater draft and ii preventing ameliorating water table decline groundwater draft is decreased by applying less irrigation water and increasing water application efficiency through practices of land leveling by laser optimum plot size efficient water conveyance and irrigation techniques and better irrigation scheduling the saving of irrigation water through decreased groundwater draft is called dry or apparent water saving seckler 1996 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 as it may be recycled within the basin unless it is polluted actually saving of irrigation water lowers cost of production saves energy and reduces the carbon emission the emission caused by pumping is 19 kg carbon ha 1 per meter fall in water level kaur et al 2016 reduction in et known as real water saving for ameliorating water table decline in wheat can be realized through replacing it wheat with relatively low et crops synchronizing crop period with lower evaporative demand by shifting planting time adopting shorter duration variety adopting subsurface irrigation and using crop residues as mulch such saving is called wet or real water saving the amount of real and apparent water savings varies with management practices table 3 the present study suggests that water deficit estimated from rainfall et and surface water supply a part of the complex groundwater equation can be of help to understand the water table change under the situations where subsurface inflow and outflow of water do not contribute to water table change runoff is negligible and profile is of high permeability which facilitates the contribution of the return flow to recharge the critical analysis of water deficit evapotranspiration rainfall surface water supply and water table decline in rice wheat cropping system demonstrates that during rice season if transplanted at 166 177 julian day water deficit is almost negligible whatsoever groundwater is withdrawn a part of that contributes towards percolation and subsequently to recharge depending upon rainfall and water table depth profile wetness permeability and homogeneity water table is declined only if transplanting time is 135 166 julian day high evaporative demand when water deficit is positive in wheat more et than rainfall 3 to 4 folds results in appreciable water deficit and whatsoever groundwater is withdrawn to irrigate the crop is totally expended as et which causes water table decline moreover the area covered under wheat is large though the study is location specific and needs extensive verification at other locations due to complex phenomenon of groundwater change eq 2 yet it induces rethinking of type of water saving real or apparent for ameliorating water table decline in rice wheat cropping system in alluvial soils in semi arid conditions thus it can be concluded that to ameliorate water table decline in rice wheat cropping system there is a need to reduce et in wheat also in addition to in rice which can be realized by implementing real water saving technologies like scheduling irrigation based on deficit irrigation diversification of wheat to low et crops chickpea and raya and reduction in evaporation during the bare period all these plausible ways of water saving for reducing et will be meaningful only if adopted in both the crops at regional scale apart from reducing et another option strategy to reduce water deficit is meeting the et demand of rice wheat cropping system by enhancing surface water supply 
11377,there is a notion that more withdrawal of groundwater for irrigating the rice crop in rice wheat cropping system is responsible for water table decline in central punjab of india any reduction in irrigation water by the improved irrigation schedules in rice like alternate wetting and drying and based on soil moisture potential shifting planting date crop diversification of higher irrigation requirement to lower direct seeded rice laser levelling etc and appropriate tillage system to reduce percolation losses save water and increase water productivity however the present study showed that water deficit evapotranspiration rainfall surface water can approximate the water table decline rise rather than groundwater withdrawal alone in rice wheat system though irrigation water requirement of wheat crop is less 300 400 mm than rice 1500 2000 mm yet the water deficit responsible for water table decline is more in wheat crop than rice in rice transplanted at recommended time evapotranspiration et is almost equal to the rainfall while in wheat et is 3 9 times that of rainfall it warrants the et reduction in wheat overlooked so far for supplementary amelioration of water table decline in rice wheat cropping system reduction in et and saving of energy by different technologies in wheat crop has also been discussed keywords rice wheat system water deficit water table decline dynamics of water balance component in wheat 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l wheat triticum aestivum l cropping system being highly productive and profitable dominates the irrigated alluvial tract of indo gangetic plains of south asia in indo gangetic basin of india area under rice wheat double cropping is 10 million hectare m ha out of that 2 6 m ha falls in indian punjab the grain bowl of india the productivity of rice is 5 5 6 5 t ha 1 and that of wheat is 4 0 5 5 t ha 1 rice is grown during the months of june to october locally named as kharif season and wheat from october to april locally named as rabi season under irrigated conditions water resources in the state are scarce in conjunction with problems of water table decline and increased energy demand for pumping of groundwater the annual utilizable water resources are 3 48 million hectare meter m ha m constituted by 1 80 m ha m by surface water entering punjab from indus river system plus 1 68 m ha m by groundwater the total water demand as evapotranspiration et for agricultural plus non agricultural uses is 4 76 m ha m resulting in annual deficit of 1 28 m ha m jain 2013 approximately 61 per cent of the total water demand is through by the two major crops i e 33 per cent by rice and 28 per cent by wheat for meeting the et demand the total water input made is normally 2200 mm 600 mm by rain 1600 mm by irrigation in rice and 510 mm 110 mm by rain 400 mm by irrigation in wheat however the water input and et varies spatially depending upon soil type crop variety and seasonal weather conditions jalota and arora 2002 jalota et al 2011 2014 in wheat based cropping system rice was introduced during the end of seventies from that time onward the area under both the crops has increased in 1980 the area under rice and wheat was 1 18 and 2 81 m ha which increased to 2 60 and 3 50 m ha in 2013 respectively this shift in cropped area has led to over exploitation of sub soil water in 80 per cent blocks of the state coupled with increased energy demand from 1850 m kwh to 10 780 m kwh anonymous 2014 for pumping water due to fast declining of water table during that period water table decline rate increased from 0 20 m yr 1 1980 1990 to 0 45 m yr 1 2008 13 with intervening decline rates of 0 90 m yr 1 2000 2005 and 0 75 m yr 1 2005 2008 the average water table depth in central punjab was 6 0 m in 1980 that increased to 9 0 m in 1995 and 21 0 m in 2013 there is a general notion that more withdrawal of groundwater for rice is the main cause of water table decline in rice wheat cropping system however field water budgeting by jalota 2004 showed that it is not rice crop per se but is its transplanting date that decides the decline or rise in water table depending upon the water deficit or gain evapotranspiration rainfall surface water during the crop season water table declines when et exceeds rainfall plus surface water and vice versa based on that concept and using mean values of et and rainfall for 20 years 1981 2000 it has been estimated that in june 1st julian day 162 transplanted rice water table declined by 0 28 m while in that of june 21st julian day 182 water table moved up by 0 08 m it suggests that for ameliorating water table decline et has to be managed following that approach an integrated management in rice i e shifting transplanting date to lower evaporative demand on june 25 concomitant with shorter duration cultivars 90 days from transplanting to harvest was advocated by jalota et al 2009 by which et was reduced by 140 mm almost double than managing the single i e 69 mm by shifting transplanting from may 25 or 71 mm by growing shorter duration variety than longer of 110 days in wheat crop water management strategies from the last five decades have been focussed mainly on increasing yield and rationalization of irrigation water in a simulation study options for increasing yield and water productivity of wheat in punjab india has been evaluated by timsina et al 2008 using the dssat csm ceres wheat model different adaptations including irrigation technology irrigation scheduling and methods and allied management i e crop varietal diversification tillage and use of fertilizers use of crop residue for mulching and cultural practices like planting time and plant population for reducing irrigation water in wheat have been accomplished but not even a single study explaining water table change corresponding to water deficit in wheat crop is available therefore the present study was undertaken to understand dynamics of water balance components in wheat and water table change in relation to seasonal water deficit overlooked so far under rice wheat cropping system 2 materials and methods the study pertains to rice wheat cropping system in central zone of the punjab state india fig 1 this zone covers 2 36 m ha 44 area of the state the climate of the zone is characterized by hot dry semi arid with summers april to june months with maximum temperature of 35 39 c and cool winters december to february months with minimum temperature of 6 9 c the temperature reaches as high as 46 c in summer months of may and june comprising the hottest months of the year january is the coldest month of the year occasionally drops to 2 3 c the major portion of the rain is through summer monsoons which generally set in july and continue till september covering kharif season during rabi season the rains are by western disturbances the annual average rainfall over last 40 years is 573 109 mm the area is highly productive underlain with good quality water two third of the state s tube wells are located in this zone and provide irrigation to 85 percent area in several parts of this zone water table has gone beyond 30 m depth and has increased the energy requirement for pumping water in the present study water balance components in wheat were simulated using the weather data collected from agro meteorological laboratory at punjab agricultural university ludhiana and already customized cropsyst model jalota et al 2011 2013 in an independent field experiment on rice wheat cropping system at punjab agricultural university farm water table depth was measured with automatic water table depth recorder annual rabi and kharif water table change was worked for ludhiana from water table depth data reported by directorate of water resources and environment govt of punjab and approximated from water deficit divided by specific yield 0 20 the energy required to lift water was worked out using eq 1 1 e m g h t i m e c f p u m p i n g e f f i c i e n c y where e is energy required in kwh m is mass of water in kg g is acceleration due to gravity in newton 9 8 m s 2 h is height of water lifting in m timecf is time conversion factor 3 6 102 pumping efficiency was taken as 50 percent 3 results and discussion in the last two decades a number of technologies focussing on reduction in irrigation for saving water in rice crop have been established by the researchers in the region table 1 based on that punjab agricultural university ludhiana made laudable recommendations in rice crop like shifting of trans planting date to june 20 which became an act in 2009 growing shorter duration varieties and scheduling irrigation based on soil water potential of 16 k pa like rice in wheat crop also irrigation water saving technologies like planting date in relation to crop duration and irrigation scheduling based on irrigation water cumulative pan evaporation iw pan e ratio and appropriate tillage have been recommend to reduce irrigation water by punjab agricultural university http web pau edu content pf pp all these irrigation water saving technologies in rice and wheat crops resulted in reduction of withdrawal of groundwater by 0 91 m ha m during the period 2008 2014 compared to that of 2002 2008 however no relation of these management interventions and decline of groundwater table was developed in rice and wheat crops individually and in the cropping system this warrants the understanding of water balance dynamics water table change in the crop season and ways to reduce et in wheat crop 3 1 dynamics of water balance components in wheat the dynamics of water balance components in wheat crop based on an averaged data of past 10 years 1999 2009 simulations with cropsyst model showed that accumulated et remained higher than rainfall throughout the growing period irrigation water remained higher than et during initial 90 days of planting and became equal thereafter fig 2 at 155 days cumulative et irrigation water and rainfall were 363 mm 355 mm and 86 mm respectively indicating that water lost as et was more than groundwater withdrawn for irrigation the drainage 84 mm was almost equal to rainfall 86 mm however water balance components varied with soil texture e g the et was more by 36 per cent and drainage less by 44 per cent in medium than coarse textured soils jalota and arora 2002 3 2 water table change the analysis of observed groundwater data during 2001 2016 showed decline in water table annually in all the years except 2002 2004 and 2009 fig 3 a season

measurements of change in soil physical properties due to biochar application under real field conditions in this study we use a unique dataset of soil water content measurements in a corn soybean cropping system with biochar and no biochar for two years soil water content was measured every 30 min at 4 different depths and with 3 replications in corn plots the effect of biochar was expected to be the difference between the physical soil properties of the two treatments the apsim model a process oriented crop model was employed in order to find the physical properties of biochar and no

increase in crop water and nutrient uptake cannot be fully investigated in lab studies and requires a dynamic method that is capable of directly and indirectly capturing the interaction among soil

aim of estimating soil physical properties model verification or uncertainty analysis e g mertens et al 2006 abbaspour et al 1999 for example wöhling et al 2008 suggested that inverse modeling of process oriented crop models like apsim agricultural production systems simulator is a promising technique for obtaining effective hydraulic properties of soils application of this technique for estimation of hydrological parameters accounts for more dynamic interactions of soil properties compared to lab measurements this study used the apsim model holzworth et al 2014 along with a unique dataset of continuous soil water content measurements in two cropping systems biochar vs no biochar treatment for two years we propose an optimization framework to inversely estimate hydraulic parameters for the apsim model this optimization framework uses measurements of soil moisture for two years as input data we hypothesize that the analysis of this dataset with a process oriented crop

experiment calibration was performed using topp s equation topp et al 1980 according to the sensor s manual which converts the bulk dielectric constants to bulk volumetric soil water content soil moisture measured in the time interval from nov 20th in 2013 until the end of may in 2014 was not included in this study because the soil was frozen and the sensors were not working properly during early 2014 there were more extreme cold days compared to 2013 and the total precipitation was 882 mm for the first year and 1123 mm for the second year the experimental site received an average of 15 8 mj m 2 solar radiation per day and 5778 mj m 2 in total over the course of 2013 and 15 6 mj m 2 per day and 5694 mj m 2 in total in 2014 the highest temperature recorded in 2013 was 36 c whereas 26 c was the lowest temperature likewise maximum temperature in 2014 was 34 c and the minimum was 25 c 2 2 apsim model the apsim model has been designed in a modular fashion allowing users to perform their own simulations using numerous soil crop climate and management components mccown et al 1996 the apsim model can simulate soil water content soil temperature and nutrient cycling as well as their interaction with different crop and management practices e g irrigation fertilization on a daily time step keating et al 2003 specifically for the u s midwest apsim has been used as a way to examine the indirect effect of new management practices on different soil and crop properties e g basche et al 2016 archontoulis et al 2014 the soilwat module in apsim probert et al 1998 estimates daily changes in soil water content for different soil layers due to infiltration of irrigation and rainfall vertical drainage unsaturated and saturated flow soil evaporation and root water uptake processes the model uses a tipping bucket approach for computing soil water drainage ritchie 1972 in this method the excess water above the field capacity of a layer is passed directly to the layer below upward unsaturated flow is also computed using a conservative estimate of the soil water diffusivity and differences in volumetric soil water content of adjacent layers 2 3 sensitivity analysis and optimization the following framework was developed and employed to inversely estimate the soil hydrological parameters see table 1 for definitions in the apsim model 1 a global sensitivity analysis was performed gsa on the most relevant hydrological parameters the output variable of primary interest for this task is the soil water content gsa was performed as a screening tool for eliminating non influential parameters and identifying the most sensitive those to be optimized 2 the most sensitive parameters were inversely estimated using an approximate bayesian computation framework abc a set of rules were adopted to ensure that samples generated from hydrological parameters are valid i e soil water content parameters must be in the 0 1 range and have a meaningful relationship e g ll15 should be smaller than dul and dul should be smaller than sat 3 a diagnostic test was performed to ensure the convergence of the algorithm 4 soil water content simulated from accepted samples were used to display the uncertainty range of soil water contents for the simulation period 2 3 1 sensitivity analysis in the current study the analysis of variance method was used for sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2004 in this method we decompose the variability of the output soil water content and determine the contribution of each input parameter wallach et al 2014a 2014b this method estimates the main effect for each parameter as well as its linear interactions main effects and total sensitivity indices can be calculated using the sums of squares ssq as follows wallach et al 2014a 2014b main effect sensitivity indices s 1 s s 1 s s t s 2 s s 2 s s t interaction sensitivity indices s 12 s s 12 s s t total sensitivity indices t s 1 s s 1 s s 12 s s t t s 2 s s 2 s s 12 s s t where s s 1 is the ssq for the first parameter s s 12 is the ssq of the interaction between first and second parameter and s s t is the total ssq a set of 26 parameters were selected to measure the sensitivity of simulated soil water content in apsim model to soil hydrological inputs table 1 using random samples taken from a proposed distribution for each parameter the apsim model was run 12 000 times and the resulting mean soil water content was stored after each simulation then an analysis of variance of the mean considering each parameter as a factor was performed and the contribution of each factor with its first interactions were assessed 2 3 2 bayesian parameter estimation we used an approximate bayesian computation framework abc to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters the main outcome of the bayesian inference is the posterior distribution which is the conditional distribution of a vector of parameters θ soil hydrological inputs of the apsim for a given observed dataset d o b s measured soil water content given by p θ d o b s c p d o b s m θ p θ where c is a constant p θ is the prior distribution and p d o b s m θ is the likelihood toni and stumpf 2010 the prior distribution generally reflects our prior understanding about θ while the likelihood is a function which returns the probability of finding observed data given θ analytically driving the posterior distribution is possible but not practical for most real world problems therefore numerical estimation based on random sampling techniques is preferred within the abc framework the idea of evaluating the likelihood is replaced with a difference measure such as the sums of squares hartig et al 2014 toni et al 2009 the metropolis hastings algorithm was used to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters this algorithm builds a markov chain monte carlo mcmc in which new samples are proposed according to a distribution designated as a proposal distribution and evaluated using the bayes rule the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an approximate distribution of parameters given d o b s toni et al 2009 choices of prior and proposal distributions and how the likelihood is set up can have a significant effect on the efficiency of the algorithm the following generic algorithm was implemented 1 initialize θ i as the starting point 2 propose θ according to the proposal distribution q θ θ i 3 simulate a dataset d s i m from m d o b s θ 4 estimate the l x θ given data d o b s 5 if u uniform 0 1 p θ l x θ p θ i l x θ i accept the move 6 repeat go to step 2 where the likelihood adapted from hartig et al 2014 was defined as l d o b s m θ c exp 1 2 d o b s d s i m 2 σ s i m 2 θ prior distributions were set as normal with mean and variances estimated based on the soil type and it was set to be identical for the two treatments the proposal distribution was also set to be normal and an appropriate variance step size was found by trial and error fig 1 samples of hydrological soil parameters were required to be physically meaningful for some of the parameters samples were checked to be less than one and greater than zero ll15 dul and sat were also required to obey the following rule sat dul ll15 using accepted samples soil water content was simulated and compared to the corresponding observed soil moisture the root mean square error rmse was used as the statistic 1 r m s e i 1 n o i s i n 2 where o i is the observed soil moisture and s i is the corresponding simulated soil moisture 2 3 3 diagnostic test the mcmc algorithm was implemented in r and a modified version of the apsimr package was used to interact with the apsim model we ran three chains to ensure the convergence of the algorithm and that the generated samples could be assumed to be taken from the same posterior distributions convergence was evaluated visually and also using the gelman rubin diagnostics from the coda package in r gelman and rubin 1992 plummer et al 2006 2 3 4 apsim setup the apsim model version 7 7 r3632 was used in the current study the soil profile was divided into 7 layers to a depth of 110 cm and the initial soil moisture was set to saturation at the beginning of the simulation simulations in 2013 were initialized on february 15 and ended on november 29 planting dates were set to may 17 in 2013 and may 8 in 2014 and harvesting date was set to october 28 for both years 3 results and discussion in 2013 the average yield for all plots was 11 3 mg ha 1 with a 1 4 mg ha 1 standard deviation while in 2014 these values were 9 3 and 1 6 mg ha 1 respectively for both treatments measured daily mean soil moisture for the biochar treatment was 0 19 and 0 24 cm3 cm 3 in 2013 and 2014 respectively which is greater compared to the no biochar treatment with a mean of 0 17 and 0 19 cm3 cm 3 for the same years fig 2 interestingly in both years the biochar treatment hit a lower minimum soil water content 0 07 and 0 13 cm3 cm 3 compared to no biochar treatment 0 1 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 during the growing season suggesting higher water uptake by the crop 3 1 sensitivity analysis dul2 followed by ks1 explained a large proportion of the variability of the swc in other words these two parameters showed the highest sensitivity moreover maxpond along with dul1 sat1 kl2 and ll15 2 showed high sensitivity over the two years of analysis each of the most sensitive parameters explains a different aspect of the soil water cycle within the tipping bucket framework used for simulation of swc in apsim dul ll15 and sat are the most important parameters for defining the bucket size the capacity of the soil for storing water while maxpond is used in infiltration calculations and subsequent calculation of the amount of runoff in addition ks is the main driver of saturated water flow and soil seepage ll15 2 ll and kl2 directly affect crop water uptake transpiration and indirectly affect soil evaporation residuals containing the leftover interactions of higher than second order interactions among all the parameters resulted in less than approximately 10 of the total variance fig 3 the number of parameters chosen for the optimization process highly depends on the number of target variables as well as the total number of independent measurements corresponding to the target variable swc in our case even though a total of 296 swc measurements were made the autocorrelation correlation in time among the measurements among the observations reduces the total number of independent measurements to about 20 25 considering this number of independent measurements we decided to use no more than 10 parameters half the measurements and by trial and error found that 8 was the most appropriate number of parameters therefore only the top 8 most sensitive parameters were used for optimization the ranking for parameters found as a results of the sensitivity analysis is only valid for this study hence no inference should be extended to other soils crops or weather environments however it is highly likely that for example any simulation that involves soil water content will find dul as a very sensitive parameter 3 2 optimization the bayesian approach enabled us not only to use prior information and different sources of data for parameter estimation but also supported quantification of the model output uncertainty wallach et al 2014b thus using the optimization process in this study both the marginal posterior distribution of selected parameters and the uncertainty of the simulated soil moisture due to parameter uncertainty were estimated uncertainty of the model inputs may arise from several sources of uncertainty including temporal and spatial variability in the nature of the process measurement error or model deficiencies given that marginal densities do not reveal correlations among parameters and make the uncertainties appear larger compared to when joint distributions are investigated the posterior densities need to be carefully interpreted in this study the marginal density of all parameters exhibited low to moderate uncertainty about 5 40 around their medians confirming that all contributed to the model fit some level of association was also observed among ks1 sat1 and maxpond in both treatments resulting in larger variability compared to other parameters the medians of dul2 and dul1 for the biochar treatment were found to be approximately 0 35 and 0 34 m3 m 3 respectively while these values were 0 32 and 0 35 for the no biochar control fig 4 6 this suggests that in the current study biochar application resulted on average in about 10 increase in water holding capacity assuming no change in lower limit pwp for water uptake the estimated increase in water holding capacity in this study is lower than 27 to 35 increase found by abel et al 2013 and 20 to 50 increase found by liu et al 2012 those experiments were conducted in the field on a sandy soil and loamy sand texture respectively with biochar application ranging from 5 to 30 mg ha 1 streubel et al 2011 also found a range of 5 35 increase in water holding capacity for combinations of five different soil types with 4 different biochar sources in an incubation study this increase is possibly linked to a change in the total number of pores pore size distribution psd or changes in soil surface area dokoohaki et al 2017 predicted saturated hydraulic conductivity ks1 was insensitive to the biochar no biochar treatments the first quantile q1 of ks1 for no biochar controls is 0 6 and the third quantile q3 is 1 3 m day 1 for the biochar treatment q1 is also 0 6 while q3 is 1 2 m day 1 which is not a highly meaningful difference between treatments the biochar treatment exhibited greater sat1 with a median of 0 42 m3 m 3 compared to the no biochar treatment with a median of 0 39 m3 m 3 the lower sat found in the no biochar treatment could be associated with a reduction in soil porosity due to settlement after a long series of intensive wetting and drying cycles yao et al 2011 dokoohaki et al 2017 in contrast we speculate that the biochar treatment reduced the number of macro pores and increased aggregate stability because of higher organic carbon content and that this resulted in less soil settling and compaction and less reduction in total porosity and hence higher sat since the saturated water content is highly related to the soil porosity and given the greater sat in the biochar treatment we can speculate that biochar application resulted in a slight increase in porosity which could lead to significant improvements in root growth and water uptake the maximum rate of water uptake by plants kl usually happens when there is a maximum demand high vapor pressure deficit from the atmosphere but it is also limited by the capacity of the soil to supply this demand therefore kl as well as ll incorporate both plant and soil factors to define the water uptake capacity in the apsim model the kl and ll values found in this study indicated a higher capacity of the crop for water uptake in the biochar treatments relative to the controls higher kl and lower ll found for the biochar treatment is consistent with an increase in the soil water holding capacity capacity to supply the water demand and our speculation about an increase in total porosity and root growth not including these parameters in the simulation of soil water content would not allow us to capture the different rates of water uptake by the biochar and no biochar treatments in addition given the fact that the apsim model was able to estimate the yield for both years within a plausible range of observed values 12 5 0 65 mg ha 1 in 2013 and 8 6 0 4 mg ha 1 in 2014 we expect that transpiration water uptake by the crop was also estimated it was not measured in a reasonable range because the approach in apsim typically results in tightly linked yield biomass and transpiration simulated values the uncertainty band estimated for soil moisture using the posterior distribution of parameters falls within the error bars of the observations for both treatments this shows that the samples generated from the posterior distributions produced plausible values for soil moisture the mean rmse between simulated and observed soil moisture was 0 025 cm3 cm 3 for the no biochar treatment and 0 032 cm3 cm 3 for the biochar treatment in a similar study scharnagl et al 2011 used inverse modeling for estimation of soil hydraulic parameters using the hydrus 1d model simulations of soil moisture in a bare soil resulted in a rmse of 0 009 cm3 cm 3 in another study houska et al 2014 used a monte carlo based glue generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method for optimization of their new coupled catchment model in their study simulations of top 30 cm soil moisture resulted in a rmse of approximately 0 024 cm3 cm 3 overall results of the parameter estimation for both years show trends in agreement with expected effects on soil physical properties of application of biochar fig 6 the biochar treated plots showed an increase in dul field capacity and sat in the amended soil layer compared to the no biochar treatment on the other hand no significant change to slight decrease compared to margin of error of the parameter estimate was found on the median value of ll15 2 ks and maxpond furthermore the higher water uptake capacity observed in the soil moisture measurements fig 2 was also reflected in the higher kl and lower ll values for the biochar treatment relative to the control direct field measurements of complex variables such as plant water uptake requires an expensive and usually time consuming approach such as lysimeters or frequent destructive plant sampling however inverse modeling using apsim offered a more convenient approach and helped us to convert soil water content measurements into a set of hydrological parameters which show the effect of the biochar treatment these types of modeling exercises enabled us to extend our understanding of new management practices like biochar application beyond lab and incubation studies the accuracy of estimated soil properties obtained using inverse modeling is highly dependent on the accuracy of the measurements and the spatial variation of soil water content within the field 4 conclusion we provided evidence that biochar application resulted in improved soil physical properties in corn plots under field conditions for over two years an increase was found in dul and kl along with a slight increase in sat which can be attributed to the biochar treatment while no significant change in ll15 ks and maxpond was observed increase in the capacity of the soil for holding water resulted in higher water uptake with lower ll for the biochar treatment a key novel component in this study was the integration of field level measurements with a modeling component for estimation of more realistic soil properties as a result of biochar application acknowledgement this project was supported by the global climate and energy project by stanford subaward agreement

used to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters this algorithm builds a markov chain monte carlo mcmc in which new samples are proposed according to a distribution designated as a proposal distribution and evaluated using the bayes rule the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an approximate distribution of parameters given d o b s toni et al 2009 choices of prior and proposal distributions and how the likelihood is set up can have a significant effect on the efficiency of the algorithm the following generic algorithm was implemented 1 initialize θ i as the starting point 2 propose θ according to the proposal distribution q θ θ i 3 simulate a dataset d s i m from m d o b s θ 4 estimate the l x θ given data d o b s 5 if u uniform 0 1 p θ l x θ p θ i l x θ i accept the move 6 repeat go to step 2 where the likelihood adapted from hartig et al 2014 was defined as l d o b s m θ c exp 1 2 d o b s d s i m 2 σ s i m 2 θ prior distributions were set as normal with mean and variances estimated based on the soil type and it was set to be identical for the two treatments the proposal distribution was also set to be normal and an appropriate variance step size was found by trial and error fig 1 samples of hydrological soil parameters were required to be physically meaningful for some of the parameters samples were checked to be less than one and greater than zero ll15 dul and sat were also required to obey the following rule sat dul ll15 using accepted samples soil water content was simulated and compared to the corresponding observed soil moisture the root mean square error rmse was used as the statistic 1 r m s e i 1 n o i s i n 2 where o i is the observed soil moisture and s i is the corresponding simulated soil moisture 2 3 3 diagnostic test the mcmc algorithm was implemented in r and a modified version of the apsimr package was used to interact with the apsim model we ran three chains to ensure the convergence of the algorithm and that the generated samples could be assumed to be taken from the same posterior distributions convergence was evaluated visually and also using the gelman rubin diagnostics from the coda package in r gelman and rubin 1992 plummer et al 2006 2 3 4 apsim setup the apsim model version 7 7 r3632 was used in the current study the soil profile was divided into 7 layers to a depth of 110 cm and the initial soil moisture was set to saturation at the beginning of the simulation simulations in 2013 were initialized on february 15 and ended on november 29 planting dates were set to may 17 in 2013 and may 8 in 2014 and harvesting date was set to october 28 for both years 3 results and discussion in 2013 the average yield for all plots was 11 3 mg ha 1 with a 1 4 mg ha 1 standard deviation while in 2014 these values were 9 3 and 1 6 mg ha 1 respectively for both treatments measured daily mean soil moisture for the biochar treatment was 0 19 and 0 24 cm3 cm 3 in 2013 and 2014 respectively which is greater compared to the no biochar treatment with a mean of 0 17 and 0 19 cm3 cm 3 for the same years fig 2 interestingly in both years the biochar treatment hit a lower minimum soil water content 0 07 and 0 13 cm3 cm 3 compared to no biochar treatment 0 1 and 0 15 cm3 cm 3 during the growing season suggesting higher water uptake by the crop 3 1 sensitivity analysis dul2 followed by ks1 explained a large proportion of the variability of the swc in other words these two parameters showed the highest sensitivity moreover maxpond along with dul1 sat1 kl2 and ll15 2 showed high sensitivity over the two years of analysis each of the most sensitive parameters explains a different aspect of the soil water cycle within the tipping bucket framework used for simulation of swc in apsim dul ll15 and sat are the most important parameters for defining the bucket size the capacity of the soil for storing water while maxpond is used in infiltration calculations and subsequent calculation of the amount of runoff in addition ks is the main driver of saturated water flow and soil seepage ll15 2 ll and kl2 directly affect crop water uptake transpiration and indirectly affect soil evaporation residuals containing the leftover interactions of higher than second order interactions among all the parameters resulted in less than approximately 10 of the total variance fig 3 the number of parameters chosen for the optimization process highly depends on the number of target variables as well as the total number of independent measurements corresponding to the target variable swc in our case even though a total of 296 swc measurements were made the autocorrelation correlation in time among the measurements among the observations reduces the total number of independent measurements to about 20 25 considering this number of independent measurements we decided to use no more than 10 parameters half the measurements and by trial and error found that 8 was the most appropriate number of parameters therefore only the top 8 most sensitive parameters were used for optimization the ranking for parameters found as a results of the sensitivity analysis is only valid for this study hence no inference should be extended to other soils crops or weather environments however it is highly likely that for example any simulation that involves soil water content will find dul as a very sensitive parameter 3 2 optimization the bayesian approach enabled us not only to use prior information and different sources of data for parameter estimation but also supported quantification of the model output uncertainty wallach et al 2014b thus using the optimization process in this study both the marginal posterior distribution of selected parameters and the uncertainty of the simulated soil moisture due to parameter uncertainty were estimated uncertainty of the model inputs may arise from several sources of uncertainty including temporal and spatial variability in the nature of the process measurement error or model deficiencies given that marginal densities do not reveal correlations among parameters and make the uncertainties appear larger compared to when joint distributions are investigated the posterior densities need to be carefully interpreted in this study the marginal density of all parameters exhibited low to moderate uncertainty about 5 40 around their medians confirming that all contributed to the model fit some level of association was also observed among ks1 sat1 and maxpond in both treatments resulting in larger variability compared to other parameters the medians of dul2 and dul1 for the biochar treatment were found to be approximately 0 35 and 0 34 m3 m 3 respectively while these values were 0 32 and 0 35 for the no biochar control fig 4 6 this suggests that in the current study biochar application resulted on average in about 10 increase in water holding capacity assuming no change in lower limit pwp for water uptake the estimated increase in water holding capacity in this study is lower than 27 to 35 increase found by abel et al 2013 and 20 to 50 increase found by liu et al 2012 those experiments were conducted in the field on a sandy soil and loamy sand texture respectively with biochar application ranging from 5 to 30 mg ha 1 streubel et al 2011 also found a range of 5 35 increase in water holding capacity for combinations of five different soil types with 4 different biochar sources in an incubation study this increase is possibly linked to a change in the total number of pores pore size distribution psd or changes in soil surface area dokoohaki et al 2017 predicted saturated hydraulic conductivity ks1 was insensitive to the biochar no biochar treatments the first quantile q1 of ks1 for no biochar controls is 0 6 and the third quantile q3 is 1 3 m day 1 for the biochar treatment q1 is also 0 6 while q3 is 1 2 m day 1 which is not a highly meaningful difference between treatments the biochar treatment exhibited greater sat1 with a median of 0 42 m3 m 3 compared to the no biochar treatment with a median of 0 39 m3 m 3 the lower sat found in the no biochar treatment could be associated with a reduction in soil porosity due to settlement after a long series of intensive wetting and drying cycles yao et al 2011 dokoohaki et al 2017 in contrast we speculate that the biochar treatment reduced the number of macro pores and increased aggregate stability because of higher organic carbon content and that this resulted in less soil settling and compaction and less reduction in total porosity and hence higher sat since the saturated water content is highly related to the soil porosity and given the greater sat in the biochar treatment we can speculate that biochar application resulted in a slight increase in porosity which could lead to significant improvements in root growth and water uptake the maximum rate of water uptake by plants kl usually happens when there is a maximum demand high vapor pressure deficit from the atmosphere but it is also limited by the capacity of the soil to supply this demand therefore kl as well as ll incorporate both plant and soil factors to define the water uptake capacity in the apsim model the kl and ll values found in this study indicated a higher capacity of the crop for water uptake in the biochar treatments relative to the controls higher kl and lower ll found for the biochar treatment is consistent with an increase in the soil water holding capacity capacity to supply the water demand and our speculation about an increase in total porosity and root growth not including these parameters in the simulation of soil water content would not allow us to capture the different rates of water uptake by the biochar and no biochar treatments in addition given the fact that the apsim model was able to estimate the yield for both years within a plausible range of observed values 12 5 0 65 mg ha 1 in 2013 and 8 6 0 4 mg ha 1 in 2014 we expect that transpiration water uptake by the crop was also estimated it was not measured in a reasonable range because the approach in apsim typically results in tightly linked yield biomass and transpiration simulated values the uncertainty band estimated for soil moisture using the posterior distribution of parameters falls within the error bars of the observations for both treatments this shows that the samples generated from the posterior distributions produced plausible values for soil moisture the mean rmse between simulated and observed soil moisture was 0 025 cm3 cm 3 for the no biochar treatment and 0 032 cm3 cm 3 for the biochar treatment in a similar study scharnagl et al 2011 used inverse modeling for estimation of soil hydraulic parameters using the hydrus 1d model simulations of soil moisture in a bare soil resulted in a rmse of 0 009 cm3 cm 3 in another study houska et al 2014 used a monte carlo based glue generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation method for optimization of their new coupled catchment model in their study simulations of top 30 cm soil moisture resulted in a rmse of approximately 0 024 cm3 cm 3 overall results of the parameter estimation for both years show trends in agreement with expected effects on soil physical properties of application of biochar fig 6 the biochar treated plots showed an increase in dul field capacity and sat in the amended soil layer compared to the no biochar treatment on the other hand no significant change to slight decrease compared to margin of error of the parameter estimate was found on the median value of ll15 2 ks and maxpond furthermore the higher water uptake capacity observed in the soil moisture measurements fig 2 was also reflected in the higher kl and lower ll values for the biochar treatment relative to the control direct field measurements of complex variables such as plant water uptake requires an expensive and usually time consuming approach such as lysimeters or frequent destructive plant sampling however inverse modeling using apsim offered a more convenient approach and helped us to convert soil water content measurements into a set of hydrological parameters which show the effect of the biochar treatment these types of modeling exercises enabled us to extend our understanding of new management practices like biochar application beyond lab and incubation studies the accuracy of estimated soil properties obtained using inverse modeling is highly dependent on the accuracy of the measurements and the spatial variation of soil water content within the field 4 conclusion we provided evidence that biochar application resulted in improved soil physical properties in corn plots under field conditions for over two years an increase was found in dul and kl along with a slight increase in sat which can be attributed to the biochar treatment while no significant change in ll15 ks and maxpond was observed increase in the capacity of the soil for holding water resulted in higher water uptake with lower ll for the biochar treatment a key novel component in this study was the integration of field level measurements with a modeling component for estimation of more realistic soil properties as a result of biochar application acknowledgement this project was supported by the global climate and energy project by stanford subaward agreement

11379,the transformation and fate of fertilizer n applied to soil is particularly important for increasing n retention in soil crop systems and minimizing n loss from agroecosystems however it is obscure how the transformation and fate of fertilizer n will be affected by n input rates and crop residue amendment in present study an outdoor experiment was conducted in mollisols of northeast china throughout three crop cultivations using 15n labeled tracer techniques to evaluate the effects of n fertilization levels and maize straw application on the conversion of applied fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n recently fixed nh4 and mineral n in soil crop systems generally six treatments were set up no n fertilization ck application of only maize straw m 16 49 mg n kg 1 soil low n input levels n1 44 64 mg n kg 1 soil n1 plus maize straw n1 m 61 13 mg n kg 1 soil high n input levels n2 89 28 mg n kg 1 soil and n2 plus maize straw n2 m 105 77 mg n kg 1 soil the results showed that the majority of applied fertilizer n was rapidly transformed into newly synthesized organic n followed by recently fixed nh4 compared with the n1 and or n2 treatments maize straw amendment in the n1 m and n2 m treatments significantly increased the residual amount of applied fertilizer n in soil by accelerating the conversion of fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n or recently fixed nh4 among three crop cultivations the percentages of recovery of applied fertilizer n in crops pr ncrop and in soil pr nsoil were averagely 61 1 and 15 8 respectively while the percentage of n loss pl n was 23 1 applying maize straw significantly elevated the pr ncrop and pr nsoil but decreased the pl n compared to those without maize straw these results suggested that the application of maize straw with high c n ratio is important to retain applied fertilizer n in soil crop systems balancing carbon and nitrogen inputs in soil through proper combination of fertilizer n and maize straw will be a potentially practical management to increase fertilizer n recovery in crop and soil and therefore reduce fertilizer n loss from crop soil systems keywords straw application 15n labeling transformation and fate of fertilizer n mollisol soil 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the primarily limiting nutrient elements in agriculture production and the crop productivity strongly depends on the application rate of fertilizer n malhia et al 2001 alam et al 2006 however excessive n application may cause severe ecological and environmental problems including nitrate contamination of groundwater eutrophication of surface waters and greenhouse effects etc abril et al 2007 dunn et al 2005 islam et al 2007 vallejo et al 2006 fertilizer n applied to soil can be converted into different n forms by multiple soil physical chemical processes including mineral n i e extractable nh4 n and no3 n newly synthesized organic n or recently clay mineral fixed nh4 liang and mackenzie 1994 lu et al 2010a lü et al 2013 schneiders and scherer 1998 the n uptakes and yields of crops are closely related to the availability of inorganic and organic n forms amanullah 2016 zhang et al 2016 soil mineral n is not only the available n source for crop growth but also the common source of various n losses zhu 2000 the superfluous mineral n in excess of crop n demand could be lost by nh3 volatilization nitrification denitrification processes and n leaching cassman et al 2002 lin et al 2007 zhu and chen 2002 whereas the immobilization and fixation of fertilizer n in soil organic n and fixed nh4 pools respectively are critical processes of n transformation in soil which play an important role in regulating soil n supply potential elmaci et al 2002 reddy et al 2003 it was reported that remarkable quantities of fixed nh4 could be released during a growing season in the luvisol van praag et al 1980 and chicot soil liang and mackenzie 1994 lu et al 2010b lu et al 2018 also found high conversion rates of newly synthesized organic n especially amino acid n from fertilizer n for the period of three crop cultivations and thus how to reduce the superfluous accumulation of mineral n derived from fertilizer in soil and more importantly accelerate the conversion of fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n and or recently fixed nh4 are crucial to increase the recovery of fertilizer n in crop and soil and decrease fertilizer n loss zhu 2000 haynes 2005 understanding the controlling factors of transformation and fate of fertilizer n is of considerable importance in developing proper n management practice for maximizing n retention while minimizing its losses in crop soil systems quiñones et al 2007 takahashi et al 2004 specifically the transformation and fate of fertilizer n are affected by many factors such as the growing environment of crop i e soil type and climate n management practices fertilizer type rate timing and methods of n application and crop development period angás et al 2006 lü et al 2013 raghuram et al 2006 application of crop residues back to soil is a common but advantageous agricultural practice which has drawn more and more attention for its significant benefits to soil fertility and carbon sequestration bierke et al 2008 fuentes et al 2009 gangwar et al 2006 crop residues with sufficient energy and nutrient sources strongly affect the microbial immobilization of mineral n and consequently influence the conversion of fertilizer n to organic n or clay mineral fixed nh4 and n availability for crop growth dawson et al 2008 lu et al 2010b 2018 rodrigues et al 2006 semenov et al 2007 singh et al 2007 studies showed that soil receiving crop residues with c n ratios over 30 would lead to a high n immobilize rate and thus decrease the accumulation of mineral n in soil and reduce the environmental pollution risk caused by n loss khalil et al 2005 mungai and motavalli 2006 it is critical to accurately evaluate the effects of n fertilization and crop residue amendment on the transformation and fate of applied fertilizer n to different soil n pools in crop soil systems because these processes affect the n use efficiency crop productivity agriculture sustainability and environment pollution risk de neve et al 2004 gentile et al 2008 2009 kumar and goh 2002 macdonald et al 2002 however the conversion of applied fertilizer n to soil mineral n organic n or clay mineral fixed nh4 as three key processes involved in fertilizer n fate in agricultural ecosystems still remain obscure in mollisols of northeast china by evaluating these transformation processes using 15n labeled tracer techniques we can clearly understand how much n in each soil n pool is derived from fertilizer n as well as their availability for subsequent crop growth in present study we evaluated the effects of n input rates and maize straw application on the conversion of applied fertilizer n to three soil n pools i e soil mineral n organic n and clay mineral fixed nh4 and the fate in crop soil systems in a mollisol in northeast china for three crop cultivations with the help of 15n tracer method we hypothesized that applying maize straw would reduce the accumulation of fertilizer derived mineral n and promote the conversion of fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n and or recently fixed nh4 and therefore increase the fertilizer n retention in crop and soil but accordingly decrease the n loss from agro ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site an outdoor pot experiment was conducted at the national field observation and

fig 4c 4 discussions 4 1 transformation of applied fertilizer n to three different soil n pools among three crop cultivations fertilizer n applied to soil is converted into different n forms such as fertilizer derived mineral n i e fertilizer derived exchangeable nh4 n and no3 n fertilizer derived new synthesized organic n or fertilizer derived recently clay mineral fixed nh4 lu et al 2010a lü et al 2013 schneiders and scherer 1998 our results from present pot experiment showed that both treatment and date significantly affected the residual amount of applied fertilizer n in soil and its transformation to different soil n pools figs 1 and 2 newly synthesized organic n accounted for the majority of applied fertilizer n irrespective of n fertilization treatment or sampling dates followed by recently clay mineral fixed nh4 and fertilizer derived mineral n fig 3 suggesting that fertilizer n applied to soil was mainly transformed into newly synthesized organic n by n immobilization of soil microbes these results also indicated that newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 play an important role in retaining and enhancing the n supplying capacity of soil which is consistent with previous reports that immobilization of fertilizer n in soil may be regarded as a means of storing n for subsequent crops burger and jackson 2003 de neve et al 2004 glendining et al 1997 2001 haynes 1999 kumar and goh 2002 our previous results showed that straw amendment at two n levels significantly degraded the conversion of applied fertilizer n to mineral n pool lu et al 2010a but promoted fertilizer n conversion to newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 pools compared with straw free control lu et al 2010b 2018 xu et al 2005 reported that the combined application of chemical fertilizer and rice straw decreased the level of soil mineral n compared to that of chemical fertilizer alone chaves et al 2006 2008 found that application of cereal straw with a 105 c n ratio significantly increased microbial biomass n but decreased the amount of mineral n mubarak et al 2001 reported that n immobilization shortly occurred after adding crop residue with a high c n ratio to soil cheng et al 2017 found from this meta analysis that the quantity and quality of exogenous organic c input affected the no3 immobilization of soil microorganisms and plant residues addition increased microbial no3 immobilization and reduced soil no3 accumulation accelerating the transformation of fertilizer n to soil organic n and fixed nh4 pool could minimize the n loss of applied fertilizer at the same time the re mineralization and release of the newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 would decide the n availability and n synchronous supply of applied fertilizer to subsequent crops the fact that the contents of newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 decreased significantly with consecutive crop cultivation for all treatments showed that newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 were quite active and thus could be rapidly converted and released to be available for subsequent crops fig 2 our results further supported that the microbial immobilization of applied fertilizer n is an important mechanism of n storage for subsequent crop n utilization in which newly synthesized organic n was an important n pool derived from applied fertilizer lu et al 2018 our results also confirmed that the recently fixed nh4 derived from applied fertilizer was an important available n source for crops in season and next season lu et al 2010b our previous studies have shown that straw amendment had less effect on the release rates of recently fixed nh4 and the change rates of newly synthesized organic n lu et al 2010b 2018 which suggested a relatively high activity of recently fixed nh4 and the newly synthesized organic n derived from applied fertilizer n irrespective of n levels or straw amendment the higher release percentages of recently fixed nh4 than the change rates of newly synthesized organic n confirmed that recently clay mineral fixed nh4 is a more labile n fraction of soil n pools derived from applied fertilizer n in contrast the n release of newly synthesized organic n was a relatively long term process our results that the nf p decreased significantly with consecutive crop cultivation but the no p increased significantly with consecutive crop cultivation further verified the above mentioned results fig 3 4 2 fate of applied fertilizer n in soil crop systems among three crop cultivations our results from present pot experiment showed that the pr ncrop for all treatments was averagely 47 7 during the first crop cultivation the n uptakes of crop for applied fertilizer mainly occurred between the tillering stage and the flowering stage 19 may 5 jun 2016 which accounted for the 54 5 of the pr ncrop from the first crop cultivation the pr ncrop for all treatments declined significantly during the second crop cultivation amounting to 11 9 with the pr ncrop for all treatments and was even lower than 1 5 during the third crop cultivation these results suggested that the n availability of applied fertilizer to crops mainly occurred among the first and second crop cultivations these results were consistent with the high release potential of recently fixed nh4 and newly synthesized organic n indicating that temporary immobilization fixation and subsequent release of applied fertilizer n improved n synchrony between n availability and crop requirement lu et al 2018 vanlauwe et al 2001a 2001b vanlauwe et al 2002 compared to the n1 and n1 m treatments with low n application rate the n2 and n2 m treatments with high n application rate significantly reduced the pr ncrop on may 19 2006 but this effect was not observed for the consecutive crop cultivations fig 4a a major reason was that low n application rate could meet the low n demand of crop at the tillering stage of the first crop cultivation and thus different n application rate resulted in the significant differences in the pr ncrop in spite of nearly the same amount of applied fertilizer n was absorbed by crop biomass for all treatments compared with n1 and n2 treatments straw amendment in the n1 m and n2 m treatments increased the pr ncrop among three crop cultivations except for the tillering stage of the first crop cultivation 19 may 2006 with the significant differences at the ripening stage of the first and second crop cultivations fig 4a these results suggested that straw amendment had positive effects on the n use efficiency of applied fertilizer n the pr nsoil decreased significantly with consecutive crop cultivation compared with n1 and n2 treatments straw amendment in the n1 m and n2 m treatments increased the pr nsoil among three crop cultivations with the significant differences at the tillering stage of the first crop cultivation 19 may 2006 and at the ripening stage of three crop cultivations indicating that the combination application of chemical fertilizer and crop residues was beneficial for fertilizer n storage in soil and subsequent crop use glendining et al 1997 2001 although the pr nsoil amounted to 20 2 at the ripening stage of the second crop cultivation the pr ncrop for all treatments was only averagely 1 5 during the third crop cultivation the low availability of residual fertilizer n during the third crop cultivation could be due to the chemical and physical protection of newly synthesized organic n which considerably reduces n availability microbial accessibility and pore water exchange schulten and schnitzer 1997 mccarthy et al 2008 zhuang et al 2008 lu et al 2018 the pl n for all treatments was averagely 17 4 during the first crop cultivation in which 84 0 of n loss from applied fertilizer in the first crop cultivation occurred within 10 days after fertilization suggesting that soil nitrogen nutrient management to accelerate the transformation of applied fertilizer n to soil organic n and fixed nh4 pools was vital for minimizing fertilizer n loss within short time following fertilization the pl n for all treatments was similar during the second and third crop cultivations averagely 2 8 compared with n1 and n2 treatments straw amendment in the n1 m and n2 m treatments reduced the pl n during the first and second crop cultivations with the significant differences at the ripening stage of the first crop cultivation 3 jul 2006 indicating that loss risk of applied fertilizer n may also be reduced through combined application of n fertilizer and maize straw gentile et al 2008 2009 xu et al 2005 also reported that the combined application of chemical fertilizer and rice straw significantly increased the recovery of chemical fertilizer n compared to the application of chemical fertilizer alone kimani et al 2003 pointed out that integrated soil fertility management isfm is currently promoted as a management approach and supported that the combined application of mineral fertilizer and crop residues benefit crop n synchrony and n loss reduction through interactive effects between both types of inputs 5 conclusions the challenge in managing soil organic matter pools is how to balance c and n inputs to synchronize the supply of available n with plant uptake during peak periods of crop n demand and thus minimize n loss of fertilizer our study indicated that maize straw amendment with a high c n ratio is an important regulator of transformation and fate of applied fertilizer n the temporary immobilization and fixation of applied fertilizer n are two important mechanisms of n storage and n synchrony supply for subsequent crops application of maize straw increased the soil residue of applied fertilizer n and accelerated the conversion of residual fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 without affecting the n availability of the two n pools after being applied to soil fertilizer n was mainly converted into newly synthesized organic n followed by recently clay mineral fixed nh4 maize straw amendment also elevated the pr ncrop and pr nsoil in crop and soil but degraded the pl n utilization and loss of applied fertilizer n mainly occurs in the first crop cultivation especially within ten days after fertilization for the n loss thus accommodating the application proportion of carbon source and nitrogen nutrition in soil through properly combined application of chemical fertilizer and maize straw may be a potential means for regulating the transformation and fate of applied fertilizer n increasing fertilizer n retention and minimizing fertilizer n loss in crop soil systems acknowledgements this research was

11379,the transformation and fate of fertilizer n applied to soil is particularly important for increasing n retention in soil crop systems and minimizing n loss from agroecosystems however it is obscure how the transformation and fate of fertilizer n will be affected by n input rates and crop residue amendment in present study an outdoor experiment was conducted in mollisols of northeast china throughout three crop cultivations using 15n labeled tracer techniques to evaluate the effects of n fertilization levels and maize straw application on the conversion of applied fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n recently fixed nh4 and mineral n in soil crop systems generally six treatments were set up no n fertilization ck application of only maize straw m 16 49 mg n kg 1 soil low n input levels n1 44 64 mg n kg 1 soil n1 plus maize straw n1 m 61 13 mg n kg 1 soil high n input levels n2 89 28 mg n kg 1 soil and n2 plus maize straw n2 m 105 77 mg n kg 1 soil the results showed that the majority of applied fertilizer n was rapidly transformed into newly synthesized organic n followed by recently fixed nh4 compared with the n1 and or n2 treatments maize straw amendment in the n1 m and n2 m treatments significantly increased the residual amount of applied fertilizer n in soil by accelerating the conversion of fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n or recently fixed nh4 among three crop cultivations the percentages of recovery of applied fertilizer n in crops pr ncrop and in soil pr nsoil were averagely 61 1 and 15 8 respectively while the percentage of n loss pl n was 23 1 applying maize straw significantly elevated the pr ncrop and pr nsoil but decreased the pl n compared to those without maize straw these results suggested that the application of maize straw with high c n ratio is important to retain applied fertilizer n in soil crop systems balancing carbon and nitrogen inputs in soil through proper combination of fertilizer n and maize straw will be a potentially practical management to increase fertilizer n recovery in crop and soil and therefore reduce fertilizer n loss from crop soil systems keywords straw application 15n labeling transformation and fate of fertilizer n mollisol soil 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the primarily limiting nutrient elements in agriculture production and the crop productivity strongly depends on the application rate of fertilizer n malhia et al 2001 alam et al 2006 however excessive n application may cause severe ecological and environmental problems including nitrate contamination of groundwater eutrophication of surface waters and greenhouse effects etc abril et al 2007 dunn et al 2005 islam et al 2007 vallejo et al 2006 fertilizer n applied to soil can be converted into different n forms by multiple soil physical chemical processes including mineral n i e extractable nh4 n and no3 n newly synthesized organic n or recently clay mineral fixed nh4 liang and mackenzie 1994 lu et al 2010a lü et al 2013 schneiders and scherer 1998 the n uptakes and yields of crops are closely related to the availability of inorganic and organic n forms amanullah 2016 zhang et al 2016 soil mineral n is not only the available n source for crop growth but also the common source of various n losses zhu 2000 the superfluous mineral n in excess of crop n demand could be lost by nh3 volatilization nitrification denitrification processes and n leaching cassman et al 2002 lin et al 2007 zhu and chen 2002 whereas the immobilization and fixation of fertilizer n in soil organic n and fixed nh4 pools respectively are critical processes of n transformation in soil which play an important role in regulating soil n supply potential elmaci et al 2002 reddy et al 2003 it was reported that remarkable quantities of fixed nh4 could be released during a growing season in the luvisol van praag et al 1980 and chicot soil liang and mackenzie 1994 lu et al 2010b lu et al 2018 also found high conversion rates of newly synthesized organic n especially amino acid n from fertilizer n for the period of three crop cultivations and thus how to reduce the superfluous accumulation of mineral n derived from fertilizer in soil and more importantly accelerate the conversion of fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n and or recently fixed nh4 are crucial to increase the recovery of fertilizer n in crop and soil and decrease fertilizer n loss zhu 2000 haynes 2005 understanding the controlling factors of transformation and fate of fertilizer n is of considerable importance in developing proper n management practice for maximizing n retention while minimizing its losses in crop soil systems quiñones et al 2007 takahashi et al 2004 specifically the transformation and fate of fertilizer n are affected by many factors such as the growing environment of crop i e soil type and climate n management practices fertilizer type rate timing and methods of n application and crop development period angás et al 2006 lü et al 2013 raghuram et al 2006 application of crop residues back to soil is a common but advantageous agricultural practice which has drawn more and more attention for its significant benefits to soil fertility and carbon sequestration bierke et al 2008 fuentes et al 2009 gangwar et al 2006 crop residues with sufficient energy and nutrient sources strongly affect the microbial immobilization of mineral n and consequently influence the conversion of fertilizer n to organic n or clay mineral fixed nh4 and n availability for crop growth dawson et al 2008 lu et al 2010b 2018 rodrigues et al 2006 semenov et al 2007 singh et al 2007 studies showed that soil receiving crop residues with c n ratios over 30 would lead to a high n immobilize rate and thus decrease the accumulation of mineral n in soil and reduce the environmental pollution risk caused by n loss khalil et al 2005 mungai and motavalli 2006 it is critical to accurately evaluate the effects of n fertilization and crop residue amendment on the transformation and fate of applied fertilizer n to different soil n pools in crop soil systems because these processes affect the n use efficiency crop productivity agriculture sustainability and environment pollution risk de neve et al 2004 gentile et al 2008 2009 kumar and goh 2002 macdonald et al 2002 however the conversion of applied fertilizer n to soil mineral n organic n or clay mineral fixed nh4 as three key processes involved in fertilizer n fate in agricultural ecosystems still remain obscure in mollisols of northeast china by evaluating these transformation processes using 15n labeled tracer techniques we can clearly understand how much n in each soil n pool is derived from fertilizer n as well as their availability for subsequent crop growth in present study we evaluated the effects of n input rates and maize straw application on the conversion of applied fertilizer n to three soil n pools i e soil mineral n organic n and clay mineral fixed nh4 and the fate in crop soil systems in a mollisol in northeast china for three crop cultivations with the help of 15n tracer method we hypothesized that applying maize straw would reduce the accumulation of fertilizer derived mineral n and promote the conversion of fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n and or recently fixed nh4 and therefore increase the fertilizer n retention in crop and soil but accordingly decrease the n loss from agro ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site an outdoor pot experiment was conducted at the national field observation and

fig 4c 4 discussions 4 1 transformation of applied fertilizer n to three different soil n pools among three crop cultivations fertilizer n applied to soil is converted into different n forms such as fertilizer derived mineral n i e fertilizer derived exchangeable nh4 n and no3 n fertilizer derived new synthesized organic n or fertilizer derived recently clay mineral fixed nh4 lu et al 2010a lü et al 2013 schneiders and scherer 1998 our results from present pot experiment showed that both treatment and date significantly affected the residual amount of applied fertilizer n in soil and its transformation to different soil n pools figs 1 and 2 newly synthesized organic n accounted for the majority of applied fertilizer n irrespective of n fertilization treatment or sampling dates followed by recently clay mineral fixed nh4 and fertilizer derived mineral n fig 3 suggesting that fertilizer n applied to soil was mainly transformed into newly synthesized organic n by n immobilization of soil microbes these results also indicated that newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 play an important role in retaining and enhancing the n supplying capacity of soil which is consistent with previous reports that immobilization of fertilizer n in soil may be regarded as a means of storing n for subsequent crops burger and jackson 2003 de neve et al 2004 glendining et al 1997 2001 haynes 1999 kumar and goh 2002 our previous results showed that straw amendment at two n levels significantly degraded the conversion of applied fertilizer n to mineral n pool lu et al 2010a but promoted fertilizer n conversion to newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 pools compared with straw free control lu et al 2010b 2018 xu et al 2005 reported that the combined application of chemical fertilizer and rice straw decreased the level of soil mineral n compared to that of chemical fertilizer alone chaves et al 2006 2008 found that application of cereal straw with a 105 c n ratio significantly increased microbial biomass n but decreased the amount of mineral n mubarak et al 2001 reported that n immobilization shortly occurred after adding crop residue with a high c n ratio to soil cheng et al 2017 found from this meta analysis that the quantity and quality of exogenous organic c input affected the no3 immobilization of soil microorganisms and plant residues addition increased microbial no3 immobilization and reduced soil no3 accumulation accelerating the transformation of fertilizer n to soil organic n and fixed nh4 pool could minimize the n loss of applied fertilizer at the same time the re mineralization and release of the newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 would decide the n availability and n synchronous supply of applied fertilizer to subsequent crops the fact that the contents of newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 decreased significantly with consecutive crop cultivation for all treatments showed that newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 were quite active and thus could be rapidly converted and released to be available for subsequent crops fig 2 our results further supported that the microbial immobilization of applied fertilizer n is an important mechanism of n storage for subsequent crop n utilization in which newly synthesized organic n was an important n pool derived from applied fertilizer lu et al 2018 our results also confirmed that the recently fixed nh4 derived from applied fertilizer was an important available n source for crops in season and next season lu et al 2010b our previous studies have shown that straw amendment had less effect on the release rates of recently fixed nh4 and the change rates of newly synthesized organic n lu et al 2010b 2018 which suggested a relatively high activity of recently fixed nh4 and the newly synthesized organic n derived from applied fertilizer n irrespective of n levels or straw amendment the higher release percentages of recently fixed nh4 than the change rates of newly synthesized organic n confirmed that recently clay mineral fixed nh4 is a more labile n fraction of soil n pools derived from applied fertilizer n in contrast the n release of newly synthesized organic n was a relatively long term process our results that the nf p decreased significantly with consecutive crop cultivation but the no p increased significantly with consecutive crop cultivation further verified the above mentioned results fig 3 4 2 fate of applied fertilizer n in soil crop systems among three crop cultivations our results from present pot experiment showed that the pr ncrop for all treatments was averagely 47 7 during the first crop cultivation the n uptakes of crop for applied fertilizer mainly occurred between the tillering stage and the flowering stage 19 may 5 jun 2016 which accounted for the 54 5 of the pr ncrop from the first crop cultivation the pr ncrop for all treatments declined significantly during the second crop cultivation amounting to 11 9 with the pr ncrop for all treatments and was even lower than 1 5 during the third crop cultivation these results suggested that the n availability of applied fertilizer to crops mainly occurred among the first and second crop cultivations these results were consistent with the high release potential of recently fixed nh4 and newly synthesized organic n indicating that temporary immobilization fixation and subsequent release of applied fertilizer n improved n synchrony between n availability and crop requirement lu et al 2018 vanlauwe et al 2001a 2001b vanlauwe et al 2002 compared to the n1 and n1 m treatments with low n application rate the n2 and n2 m treatments with high n application rate significantly reduced the pr ncrop on may 19 2006 but this effect was not observed for the consecutive crop cultivations fig 4a a major reason was that low n application rate could meet the low n demand of crop at the tillering stage of the first crop cultivation and thus different n application rate resulted in the significant differences in the pr ncrop in spite of nearly the same amount of applied fertilizer n was absorbed by crop biomass for all treatments compared with n1 and n2 treatments straw amendment in the n1 m and n2 m treatments increased the pr ncrop among three crop cultivations except for the tillering stage of the first crop cultivation 19 may 2006 with the significant differences at the ripening stage of the first and second crop cultivations fig 4a these results suggested that straw amendment had positive effects on the n use efficiency of applied fertilizer n the pr nsoil decreased significantly with consecutive crop cultivation compared with n1 and n2 treatments straw amendment in the n1 m and n2 m treatments increased the pr nsoil among three crop cultivations with the significant differences at the tillering stage of the first crop cultivation 19 may 2006 and at the ripening stage of three crop cultivations indicating that the combination application of chemical fertilizer and crop residues was beneficial for fertilizer n storage in soil and subsequent crop use glendining et al 1997 2001 although the pr nsoil amounted to 20 2 at the ripening stage of the second crop cultivation the pr ncrop for all treatments was only averagely 1 5 during the third crop cultivation the low availability of residual fertilizer n during the third crop cultivation could be due to the chemical and physical protection of newly synthesized organic n which considerably reduces n availability microbial accessibility and pore water exchange schulten and schnitzer 1997 mccarthy et al 2008 zhuang et al 2008 lu et al 2018 the pl n for all treatments was averagely 17 4 during the first crop cultivation in which 84 0 of n loss from applied fertilizer in the first crop cultivation occurred within 10 days after fertilization suggesting that soil nitrogen nutrient management to accelerate the transformation of applied fertilizer n to soil organic n and fixed nh4 pools was vital for minimizing fertilizer n loss within short time following fertilization the pl n for all treatments was similar during the second and third crop cultivations averagely 2 8 compared with n1 and n2 treatments straw amendment in the n1 m and n2 m treatments reduced the pl n during the first and second crop cultivations with the significant differences at the ripening stage of the first crop cultivation 3 jul 2006 indicating that loss risk of applied fertilizer n may also be reduced through combined application of n fertilizer and maize straw gentile et al 2008 2009 xu et al 2005 also reported that the combined application of chemical fertilizer and rice straw significantly increased the recovery of chemical fertilizer n compared to the application of chemical fertilizer alone kimani et al 2003 pointed out that integrated soil fertility management isfm is currently promoted as a management approach and supported that the combined application of mineral fertilizer and crop residues benefit crop n synchrony and n loss reduction through interactive effects between both types of inputs 5 conclusions the challenge in managing soil organic matter pools is how to balance c and n inputs to synchronize the supply of available n with plant uptake during peak periods of crop n demand and thus minimize n loss of fertilizer our study indicated that maize straw amendment with a high c n ratio is an important regulator of transformation and fate of applied fertilizer n the temporary immobilization and fixation of applied fertilizer n are two important mechanisms of n storage and n synchrony supply for subsequent crops application of maize straw increased the soil residue of applied fertilizer n and accelerated the conversion of residual fertilizer n to newly synthesized organic n and recently fixed nh4 without affecting the n availability of the two n pools after being applied to soil fertilizer n was mainly converted into newly synthesized organic n followed by recently clay mineral fixed nh4 maize straw amendment also elevated the pr ncrop and pr nsoil in crop and soil but degraded the pl n utilization and loss of applied fertilizer n mainly occurs in the first crop cultivation especially within ten days after fertilization for the n loss thus accommodating the application proportion of carbon source and nitrogen nutrition in soil through properly combined application of chemical fertilizer and maize straw may be a potential means for regulating the transformation and fate of applied fertilizer n increasing fertilizer n retention and minimizing fertilizer n loss in crop soil systems acknowledgements this research was
