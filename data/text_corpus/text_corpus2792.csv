biochemical oxygen demand bod 1 cheese whey is one of the main components from dairy wastewaters dairy wastewaters can be treated using biological process such as activated sludge system trickling filters aerated lagoons sequencing batch reactor sbr as well as anaerobic process as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and anaerobic filters among others 2 anaerobic processes are widely used for treating dairy wastewaters these treatments offer some advantages such as methane production no aeration requirement and low sludge production 3 however several disadvantages have been reported fats from dairy wastewaters have an inhibitory action on the anaerobic processes and operational problems such as formation of scum sludge flotation and loss of cod removal efficiency can take place 4 enzymatic hydrolysis of fats has been proposed as pretreatment 5 however these processes may lead to higher costs in anaerobic digestion various microbial groups with different growth rates are involved hence the main processes acidogenesis and methanogenesis are not commonly in balance 6 this imbalance among the microbial groups can lead to less methane production and process failure 6 in addition anaerobic treatment of dairy wastewaters requires commonly an aerobic post treatment in order to meet the effluent discharge limits 7 aerobic processes allow achieving excellent effluent quality in terms of cod bod and nutrient removal among the aerobic processes the sbr seems to be the most promising technology for treatment of dairy wastewaters 8 the sbr offers operational flexibility and excellent process control possibilities smaller foot print area lower investment cost and lower operation complexity as compared to conventional process 9 however for dairy wastewater treatment aerobic processes can be affected by limitations in oxygen transfer as well as sludge settling problems cheese whey wastewaters has a mean cod n p ratio of 100 1 75 0 5 which has been considered nitrogen deficient for effluents treatment by biological processes 1 the optimum cod n p ratio of 100 5 1 is widely accepted for aerobic processes based on heterotrophic growth to overcome the mentioned difficulties dilution of dairy wastewaters with ammonium rich effluents could be implemented in aerobic treatment systems several wastewaters contain high ammonium concentrations and low cod n ratio the landfill leachate is a complex mixture of biodegradable and recalcitrant organic matter ammonia metals and organic and inorganic salts 10 mature leachates show commonly low bod cod ratio and high ammonia concentration 11 ammonium rich effluents are also generated from anaerobic digestion of sludge in wastewater treatment plants 12 municipal wastewaters show low carbon nitrogen ratio 13 ammonium contamination from industrial wastewaters negatively affects water bodies and causes several environmental problems such as eutrophication increased dissolved oxygen do consumption reduced disinfection efficiency and toxic effects on fish 14 several methods have been developed to remove ammonium from wastewater physical chemical methods include air stripping membrane filtration ion exchange absorption 15 reverse osmosis breakpoint chlorination chemical precipitation microwave radiation and supercritical water oxidation 16 among others biological methods include biofiltration and nitrification denitrification processes 17 physical chemical methods are commonly applied for nitrogen removal however high cost high sensitivity to ph and temperature addition of chemical compounds facilities maintenance and operational problems are the main difficulties 14 16 co treatment of dairy wastewaters with ammonium rich effluents would allow adjusting the cod n ratio to suitable values for biological treatment cod n 100 5 this strategy avoids the costs caused by the addition of carbon or nitrogen which would be necessary if each type of effluentis treated individually by biological methods combined wastewater with cod n ratio lower than 100 5 obtained from the mixture of dairy and ammonium rich effluents can also be treated provided that biological nitrogen removal bnr takes place at these conditions higher volume of ammonium rich effluents can be processed co treatment of landfill leachate and dairy wastewater has been proposed by neczaj et al 2008 18 bnr involves commonly two processes aerobic nitrification by autotrophs and anaerobic denitrification by heterotrophs autotrophicnitrification comprises two steps nitritation oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n carried out by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitration oxidation of no2 n to no3 n driven by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 19 the denitrification involves the anoxic degradation of no2 no3 yielding nitrogen gas n2 as final product 20 the autotrophic nitrifiers have slow specific growth rates and low biomass yields and are sensitive to ph heavy metals and toxic agents 21 the bnr process generally requires separate aerobic and anaerobic tanks and strict control of the ammonia and organic matter loads 22 simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd can be achieved in granular systems under aerobic conditions with denitrifying activity taking place in the anoxic zones inside of the granules 23 however the snd efficiency is strongly affected by the do concentration and granule size according to those authors to overcome these problems nitrifying heterotrophic bacteria can be used in bnr processes with a single aerobic tank rhodococcus sp 24 paracoccus pantotrophus 25 pseudomonas tolaasii 26 acinetobacter junii 27 alcaligenes faecalis 28 bacillus subtilis 29 and diaphorobacter sp 30 among others have been recognized as heterotrophic nitrifiers these bacteria has the capability to carry out snd 30 allowing the aerobic conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas however the operating conditions that affect the growth of nitrifying heterotrophic bacteria are not fully understood aerobic granules are commonly generated in sbrs under feast famine regime in these operational conditions external organic carbon is commonly stored by the microorganisms as intracellular polymers polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen volatile fatty acids are stored as pha glucose is mainly converted to glycogen 31 pha and glycogen can be used as carbon source for denitrification 32 in aerobic granular sbr it has been reported that the nitrifying activity increases progressively as the cod n ratio decreases from 100 5 to 100 30 33 however the effect of other growth factors such as micronutrients on the nitrifying activity has been poorly studied in the co treatment of dairy and ammonium rich wastewater nitrification could be encouraged by micronutrients provided by wastewaters from municipal treatment plants anaerobic digesters or leachate and so adequate treatment at low cod n ratio could be achieved molecular biological techniques such as pcr dgge are the most widely used to investigate the structure of microbial communities present in wastewater treatment systems however they only allow an evaluation of the dominant members of the communities 34 next generation sequencing ngs is a very strong technology that allows to investigate the composition of complex bacterial communities 35 not only shedding light on the community composition but also on the functional features and the relationship between the microbial community and environmental factors 36 the general objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility to achieve treatment of dairy wastewater supplemented with ammonia using aerobic granular sequencing batch reactors sbrs and to apply next generation sequencing technique to analyze the composition of the microbial communities the specific objectives were a to evaluate the effect of the organic load the cod n ratio and micronutrients on the nitrification and denitrification capacities of sbrs fed with a synthetic wastewater based on commercial cheese whey supplemented with ammonia b to analyze the capacity of accumulation of intracellular carbon reserves as glycogen and pha and its use as carbon source for denitrification in the reactors that exhibited nitrification c to relate the microbial composition of the sbr determined by ngs technology with the biological processes detected for each operating condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequential batch biological reactors sbrs three sequential discontinuous reactors sbr1 sbr2 and sbr3 were used at laboratory scale consisting of bubble columns build in acrylic with a height a of 25 cm an internal diameter d of 9 cm giving an a d ratio of 2 7 the air was supplied by two diffusers located at the bottom of the reactors generating an upward flow to favor the granulation the superficial upflow air velocity was 0 6 cm s 1 the do was greater than 6 0 mg o2 l 1 avoiding oxygen limitation of the nitrifying activity 2 2 synthetic wastewater and experimental design all the assayed reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater sww of the dairy industry supplemented with ammonia and phosphorus the role of micronutrients was analyzed cheese whey cw powder lactofood argentina with a cod content of 1 g cod g cw and a cod n ratio of 100 1 55 was used cheese whey was amended with ammonia to obtain cod n ratios lower than 100 5 which are favorable for biological treatment especially nitrification the sww showed the following composition cheese whey nh4 2so4 k2hpo4 kh2po4 and nahco3 with the purpose of maintaining the ph between 7 0 and 8 0 ph conditions suitable for the growth of nitrifying microorganisms for this the effect of several nahco3 concentrations on ph was evaluated throughout the operating cycle of the reactors the following experiments were carried out to analyze the role of micronutrients and the cod n ratio sbr1 and sbr2 were operated at cod n ratio of 100 12 favorable for the nitrification process in both reactors identical conditions were applied with the exception of two trace element solutions m1 and m2 that were added only to the sbr2 sww m1 had the following composition g l 1 feso4 7h2o 15 0 znso4 7h2o 5 0 mnso4 h2o 3 0 cuso4 5h2o 0 75 cocl2 6h2o 0 15 citric acid 6 0 m2 showed the following composition g l 1 nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 0 5 bo3h3 0 1 ik 0 1 a 1 ml volume of both m1 and m2 solutions was added to 1 l of sbr2 sww then sbr1 and sbr2 were studied to evaluate the effect of micronutrients addition on nitrification process the sbr3 presented half of the organic load and consequently its cod n p ratio was reduced from 100 12 5 to 100 22 10 being operated in the absence of trace elements table 1 this operating condition was set in order to evaluate the effect of a relatively low organic load on the nitrifying activity 2 3 start up of sbrs acclimation and formation of hybrid granules the sbr1 containing sww 0 8 l was inoculated with an aerobic microbial consortium activated sludge 0 2 l the granules generated in this reactor were used as inoculum of sbr2 and sbr3 the reactors were operated manually at room temperature with 24 h cycles determined by the following phases addition of sww 2 min reaction phase 1428 min sludge purge 1 min sedimentation phase 5 20 min and extraction of the supernatant 2 min it must be considered that in all reactors cod n ratios lower than 100 5 and large cycle duration were applied in order to favor nitrifying bacteria growth and feast famine regime respectively under these operating conditions intracellular polymers can be accumulated and snd could be encouraged the granulation of the biomass was carried out following the method of adav et al 37 with slight modifications the sbr1 was initially operated with a sedimentation time of 20 min for 20 days and then this time was gradually reduced to 5 min 38 with the purpose of favoring the retention of firm and dense microbial aggregates granules and flocs the continuous operation of the reactor under a strong hydraulic selection pressure and a short sedimentation time 5 min favored the enrichment of granules this last settling time remained constant during the operation of the reactors being 100 days for sbr1 and 400 days for sbr2 and sbr3 the operation of the reactors was evaluated throughout the operating cycles by determining the following parameters concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn chemical soluble oxygen demand cods as a measure of the organic substrate and total cod codt of the mixed liquor at different operating times defined by the number of crts elapsed the following kinetic parameters were determined specific and volumetric cod uptake rates rcods and qcods and specific and volumetric ammonium uptake rates rnh4 n and qnh4 n settling properties and granule size of the biomass were periodically determined the period of acclimatization of the biomass was completed once 100 cod removals and good settling properties were achieved in the reactors that exhibited nitrification the capacity of accumulation of intracellular carbon reserves as glycogen and pha was evaluated in these reactors a complete genomic analysis was carried out with the purpose of characterizing the microbial composition of the biomass finally the relationship between the microbial structure and the performance of the reactors with nitrifying activity was evaluated 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 determinations of chemical oxygen demand and biomass soluble cod cods mg cod l 1 was determined in filtered samples 0 45 μm and used as a measure of the organic substrate concentration the cod corresponding to the biomass codb mg cod l 1 was obtained from the difference between total cod of the mixed liquor codt mg cod l 1 and cods the cod determinations were carried out using a commercial kit hach company loveland co the biomass concentration of the sbrs was also determined as total solids ts samples were taken from the mixed liquor of the reactors which were centrifuged and resuspended in distilled water this washing process was performed twice the samples were placed in an oven 105 c for 24 h the biomass concentration x was expressed as g ts l 1 the values obtained were correlated with the codb measurements 2 4 2 determination of ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrite and total nitrogen kjeldahl the different forms of inorganic nitrogen ni nh4 n no3 n and no2 n of the reactors were determined using previously filtered mixed liquor samples 0 45 μm nh4 n mg nh4 n l 1 was determined by the nessler method hach method no 8038 no3 n mg no3 n l 1 was quantified by the method of reduction by cadmium hach method no 8039 the concentration of nitrite mg no2 n l 1 was determined by the ferrous sulfate method hach method no 8153 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn mg n l 1 was determined for cheese whey mixed liquor and filtered samples 0 45 μm of the reactors tkn was determined by the method of microkjeldahl proposed by nkonge and balance 39 tkn of cheese whey tkncw allowed estimating the contribution of organic nitrogen norg to biological reactors the wastewater tkn tknw included tkn provided by cheese whey as norg and nh3 n 2 4 3 determination of total carbohydrates tc the concentration of total carbohydrates tc of the biomass was determined by the anthrone method following a modification of the technique proposed by osborne and voogt 40 in biological processes with feast famine regimen glycogen is commonly cycled and it is assumed that changes in the concentration of total carbohydrates occur on the glycogen component 41 in the biological reactors used in the present study fed with high content of hydrolyzed lactose it is expected that changes in the tc concentration were associated with the synthesis of glycogen as an intracellular reserve substance and subsequent degradation for ct determination tubes containing 1 0 ml of diluted and washed biomass samples and 5 ml of the anthrone reagent 0 2 g anthrone in 95 v v sulphuric acid were boiling in a water bath 10 min then the tubes were incubated in a cooling water bath for 10 min to stop the reaction finally at room temperature the glucose concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at 620 nm using sulfuric acid as blank a standard curve was prepared using a glucose solution 100 μg glucose ml 1 results were expressed as mg glucose l 1 2 5 microscopic detection of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha sudan black staining of mixed liquor samples 30 μl from the reactors was performed for the detection of intracellular pha granules 42 the stained samples were observed with a leica dmlb microscope germany with a built in camera micrographs were taken under illumination with phase contrast 1000 x 2 6 sludge volume index svi and granule size the settling properties of the sbrs biomass were evaluated by the sludge volume index svi determined after 30 min of sedimentation in a 100 ml test tube svi30 ml g ts 1 it has been proposed that the svi should be less than 90 ml g ts 1 to get an excellent settling of the granules 43 the particle size distribution of the biomass was determined using a mastersizer e 20003 14 equipment the results were expressed in standard percentiles d 0 5 and average diameter in volume d 4 3 these determinations were made at different crts elapsed 2 7 kinetic parameters the volumetric cod uptake rate rcods and volumetric ammonium uptake rate rnh4 n were determined from the slope of the decay curves of cods and nh4 n as a function of time respectively then the specific uptake rates of cod qcods and n nh4 n qnh4 n were calculated from the ratio between the volumetric rates and the biomass concentration expressed as ts of each reactor all parameters were determined for each sbr at different crt 2 8 quantification of the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen inorganic nitrogen and total kjeldahl nitrogen the ammonia nitrogen removal nh3 nr was determined by the following expression 1 n h 3 n r n h 3 n o n h 3 n f n h 3 n o 100 where nh3 n o and nh3 n f correspond to the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen at the beginning and end of the operating cycle respectively the inorganic nitrogen removal nir was determined from the following expression 2 n i r n i o n i f n i o 100 where nio is the nitrogen concentration ni at the start of the operating cycle mg l 1 and nif is the ni concentration mg l 1 at the end of cycle sbr effluent nio was given by the nh3 n from the wastewater nif corresponds to the sum of nh3 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations the nitrate and nitrite concentrations at the beginning of the cycle from the remaining supernatant of the preceding cycle were not considered in the determination of the nio concentration total kjeldahl nitrogen removal tknr was determined by the following expression 3 t k n r t k n o t k n f t k n o 100 where tkno is the concentration of tkn at the beginning of the operating cycle given by the sum of the ammonia nitrogen concentration and the organic nitrogen norg contributed by the cheese whey it should be noted that norg can occur in particulate form being difficult to separate it from biomass for quantification therefore at the beginning of the cycle norg was estimated indirectly from the tkn analysis of cheese whey tknf corresponds to the tkn concentration of the sbr final effluent 2 9 respirometric assays determination of the oxidation rate of particulate and soluble cheese whey respirometric assays were carried out in order to estimate the oxidation rate of particulate and soluble cheese whey the respirometer consisted of an oxygen electrode ysi model 58 inside a sealed flask the oxygen probe was calibrated in air saturated with water vapor measurements of dissolved oxygen do from the electrode were recorded at a frequency of 1 data 10 s the samples of mixed liquor were subjected to a pretreatment and then placed in the respirometer as indicates below mixed liquor 90 ml from sbr2 was centrifuged and re suspended in running water this washing process was performed twice the following tests were carried out a determination of heterotrophic oxygen uptake rate our for particulate cheese whey pcw synthetic wastewater sww 15 ml was added to vessel 50 ml containing washed mixed liquor 25 ml the mixture was stirred 1 min and then it was centrifuged 3000 rpm 10 min and re suspended in running water this washing process was performed twice in order to eliminate the soluble fraction of the cheese whey 0 45 μm then the biomass together with the pcw was supplemented with ammonia phosphorus and trace element solutions the mixture was stirred 1 min and allylthiourea was added in order to inhibit the nitrifying activity finally the mixture was aerated during 1 min and then the aeration was stopped the slope obtained from the linear decrease of the dissolved oxygen concentration corresponded to oura b determination of heterotrophic our for soluble cheese whey scw running water 15 ml was added to a vessel containing washed mixed liquor 25 ml the mixture was subjected to the same centrifugation and washing processes described for assay a in order to submit the sludge to identical physical treatment then the biomass was re suspended in filtered sww 0 45 μm and supplemented with ammonia phosphorus and trace element solutions finally allylthiourea was added the mixture was aerated and our was determined ourb as described above it should be noted that oura and ourb involved not only the oxidation of particulate and soluble cheese whey respectively but also the oxidation of endogenous reserves and auto oxidation therefore the endogenous respiratory activity was also determined c determination of heterotrophic endogenous our the same procedure corresponding to the assay b was followed however in this case the biomass was re suspended in running water and the our corresponded to the endogenous activity of heterotrophs ourend finally ours corresponding to the oxidation of particulate cheese whey ourpcw and soluble cheese whey ourscw were determined from the following expressions 4 o u r p c w o u r a o u r e n d 5 o u r s c w o u r b o u r e n d 2 10 dna extraction and sequencing the microbial genomic dna from bioreactors sbr2 and sbr3 was extracted for

microscope sem observation the morphology of the biomass was observed with high resolution sem fei la b6 eindhoven netherlands at 5 kv accelerating voltage with an electron detector for low vacuum conditions biomass samples from the reactors were washed with phosphate buffer and allowed to settle then the biomass were treated with 4 paraformaldehyde and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solution 50 70 80 90 and 100 finally the samples were dried at room temperature for sem observation 3 results and discussion in the sbr1 a complete removal of organic carbon was achieved nevertheless the system did not show nitrifying activity during the period of operation 100 days the results of the reactors that exhibited nitrification sbr2 and sbr3 are presented below 3 1 variation of ph it is widely accepted that nitrifying bacteria grow adequately at ph values between 7 0 and 8 0 below the neutrality conditions the metabolism of these microorganisms decreases significantly an issue to be taken into account in aerobic reactors with nitrifying activity concerns to the ph decrease to values lower than 6 0 this phenomenon is caused by the nitrification process which involves the production of protons generating acidity 47 for this reason in the present study a sww containing a phosphate buffer 3 3 mm and an optimal concentration of sodium bicarbonate 0 75 g l 1 was used to maintain adequate ph conditions in all systems 7 5 8 5 3 2 stability of the systems granules size and svi the heterotrophic granular biomass of sbr1 was used as inoculum of the sbr2 and sbr3 reactors the concentration of biomass reached in the reactors was 3 g ts l 1 for sbr1 and sbr2 and 1 5 g ts l 1 for sbr3 which remained constant throughout the operation time the evolution of the granules size and sludge volume index along the different crt was studied in those systems that exhibited nitrifying activity sbr2 and sbr3 approximately 68 days 3 5 trc were required for the formation of hybrid granules with an average diameter of approximately 0 25 mm in both reactors fig 1 the average size of aerobic granules according to literature is between 0 2 and 5 mm 38 it can be observed that the average diameter of the granules increased with time until reaching stability conditions in terms of the granular size at 134 days for the sbr2 0 3 0 35 mm 6 7 trc and 260 days 0 3 0 35 mm 13 trc for the sbr3 fig 1a and b the svi was below 90 ml g ts 1 during the operating period of sbr2 fig 1a and sbr3 fig 1b which indicates a good sedimentation in the case of sbr2 a decrease of the svi can be observed along the elapsed crts up to 50 60 ml g ts 1 under stability conditions a lower svi was observed for sbr3 granules about 25 ml g ts 1 microscopic examination of the biomass from reactors showed granular morphology sem micrographs of the granules are shown in fig 2 a and b sbr2 and fig 2 c and d sbr3 micrographs revealed that the granules in both reactors had regular and three dimensional structure 3 3 consumption of soluble organic carbon and ammonia in the sbr2 soluble organic carbon measured as cods represented 60 70 of the initial organic load provided by the cheese whey cods was removed almost entirely in the first 2 h of the operating cycle with simultaneous glycogen accumulation this phase with availability of readily biodegradable cod corresponded to the feast period ammonia decreased progressively throughout the cycle glycogen degradation and the nitrification process took place in the famine period nitrifying activity led to the formation of no3 n whose concentration increased continuously until the end of the cycle without significant accumulation of no2 n fig 3 a and b the sbr3 was operated with half the organic load with respect to the sbr2 which implied a reduction of the cod n ratio from 100 12 to 100 22 and without micronutrients table 1 cods represented almost completely the initial organic carbon the reduction of the organic load leads to a lower heterotrophic growth as a consequence the development of the autotrophic nitrifying biomass could be favored in this system cods removal and glycogen accumulation took place in the first 4 h of the operating cycle feast period ammonia was partially removed throughout the cycle glycogen was degraded in the famine phase nitrification took place from the beginning to the end of the cycle an increase in the no3 n concentration was observed throughout the cycle a small no2 n accumulation was observed 2 4 h and then nitrite rapidly decreased to non detectable levels fig 3c and d a mass balance in cod units was carried out for feast period of the reactors including the uptake rate of external organic carbon cheese whey oxygen uptake rate associated to heterotrophic activity heterotrophic growth rate from cheese whey and production rate of glycogen and pha according to this balance glycogen was the main intracellular carbon reserve synthetized from cheese whey during the period feast and pha synthesis was negligible poor pha staining with sudan black allowed confirming these results cheese whey from wastewater showed high content of hydrolyzed lactose glucose and galactose monosaccharides were probably stored as glycogen these results agree with those informed in bibliography miao et al 31 reported that glucose is mainly converted to glycogen both systems showed percentage ammonium removal and specific rates of ammonium and cod removal that were not significantly different table 2 3 4 consumption of particulate cheese whey organic nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn from wastewater and respirometric assays the changes in total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were studied throughout the operating cycles of the sbr2 and sbr3 reactors in which significant removal of organic carbon and nitrogen was observed tkn of the cheese whey and the mixed liquor and filtered mixed liquor 0 45 μm samples of the sbrs were quantified in order to determine the components that contribute to the nitrogen load of all systems tkn of the mixed liquor tknml included organic nitrogen norg soluble and particulate contributed by cheese whey ammonia nitrogen nh3 n soluble from the wastewater ammonium sulfate and norg corresponding to the microbial biomass as well as the lysis products thereof the filtered samples from the mixed liquor contained all the soluble forms of tkn tkns contributed by the cheese whey nh3 n and microbial lysis products the particulate tkn tknp was determined from the difference between tknml and tkns and included the organic nitrogen contributed by the cheese whey and the biomass the concentrations of tkns were similar to those corresponding to the nh4 n determined by the nessler method section 2 4 2 this implies that both cheese whey and biomass did not contribute significant amounts of nitrogen to the soluble phase the tkn contributed by cheese whey tkncw to each reactor resulted 11 23 mg n l 1 and 5 5 mg n l 1 for sbr2 and sbr3 respectively fig 4 shows the changes of tknml tkns and nh3 n throughout an operating cycle for sbr2 and sbr3 the decrease of tknml was caused by the nitrification process efficiencies of tkn removal were similar for both reactors table 2 the tkn of the modified dairy wastewater tknw included two nitrogen components particulate organic nitrogen provided by cheese whey proteins and soluble ammonia nitrogen supplemented to the wastewater ammonia uptake was easily determined by spectrophotometry fig 3 organic nitrogen consumption could not be quantified by the used analytical techniques since it occurs in particulate form 0 45 μm from respirometric assays section 2 9 it was found that the oxygen uptake rate associated to the consumption of particulate cheese whey ourpcw represented 22 of the our corresponding to the soluble cheese whey ourscw that is ourpcw 0 22 ourscw consumption of particulate cheese whey and organic nitrogen present in particulate form cannot be directly determined by cod and kjeldahl methods respectively since it is very difficult to separate them from biomass for quantification the uptake rate of the particulate cheese whey was indirectly determined from our measurements taken into account the following considerations and assumptions the oxygen uptake rate is proportional to the substrate degradation rate rs i e our yo s rs being yo s the substrate oxidation coefficient it was assumed that yo s for particulate cheese whey is the same that the corresponding to soluble cheese whey which led to the following expression 6 o u r p c w r p c w o u r scw r s c w where rpcw and rscw is the degradation rate of particulate cheese whey and soluble cheese whey respectively rearranging eq 6 and taking into consideration that ourpcw 0 22 ourscw the degradation rate of particulate cheese whey rpcw was equivalent to 22 of that corresponding to the soluble fraction of cheese whey rscw it should be noted that rscw is easily determined from soluble cod measurements the uptake rate of organic nitrogen present in particulate form can be considered proportional to the degradation rate of particulate cheese whey since organic nitrogen comes from cheese whey proteins the uptake rate of organic nitrogen was estimated taken into account the following assumptions firstly it must be considered that the nitrogen uptake rate rn is proportional to the substrate degradation rate for microbial synthesis rn yn s rs being yn s the coefficient that relates nitrogen and substrate uptake assuming that yn s for particulate cheese whey is the same that the corresponding to soluble cheese whey the following expression is obtained 7 r n p c w r p c w r n s c w r s c w where rnpcw and rnscw is the nitrogen uptake rate associated to the consumption of particulate cheese whey and soluble cheese whey respectively taking in consideration that rpcw 0 22 rscw rn for particulate cheese whey rnpcw can be determined as 0 22 rnscw the nitrogen uptake rate associated to the consumption of soluble cheese whey corresponded to nh3 n uptake rate the relatively slow degradation rate of the particulate cheese whey involved also a slow uptake rate of organic nitrogen according to these analyses it was estimated that organic nitrogen was completely consumed in about 8 and 3 h for sbr2 and sbr3 respectively from the results of ammonium and organic nitrogen uptake the tknw removed in each reactor could be estimated both systems showed similar removal percentage of tknw table 2 tknw consumed in feast period including ammonia and organic nitrogen was estimated by using the following expression 8 δ t k n w f e δ n h 3 n f e 0 22 δ n h 3 n f e where δ tkn wfe and δ nh3 n fe correspond to tknw and ammonia nitrogen consumed in the feast period respectively and 0 22 δ nh3 n fe corresponds to norg consumed in feast period in famine period the tknw consumed was estimated as follows 9 δ t k n w f a δ n h 3 n f a t k n c w 0 22 δ n h 3 n f e where δ tkn wfa and δ nh3 n fa correspond to tknw and ammonia nitrogen consumed in the famine period respectively tkn cw is the tkn provided by cheese whey which was completely consumed in each operating cycle 3 5 nitrogen removal by heterotrophic growth nitrification and nitrification denitrification processes mass balances both ammonia and organic nitrogen can be oxidized by nitrifying activity or used for heterotrophic growth identification of each process is very difficult by two reasons a active biomass increases slightly during each operating cycle which cannot be satisfactorily detected by gravimetry b nitrite and or nitrate generated by nitrifying activity can be simultaneously denitrified and consequently the nitrification process could be underestimated wastewater tkn consumed can be expressed as follows 10 δ t k n w δ t k n o x δ t k n x where δ tkn w corresponds to the wastewater tkn consumed δ tkn ox corresponds to the tkn oxidized by nitrifying activity and δ tkn x is the tkn used for heterotrophic growth in sbr2 tknw ammonia and organic nitrogen in feast period was used for heterotrophic growth since nitrification process did not take place then δ tkn x corresponded to δ tkn w in sbr3 the nitrification process took place from the beginning to the end of the operating cycle in this system at low cod n it was assumed that nitrification process prevailed over the heterotrophic growth for simplification the nitrogen uptake in the feast period was attributed exclusively to the nitrifying activity then δ tkn ox corresponded to δ tkn w for sbr3 in the famine period of both reactors the nitrification process and heterotrophic growth from glycogen simultaneously occurred in this period the biomass growth was estimated by using the theoretical stoichiometric coefficient 0 5 c mol x c mol glycogen 1 the nitrogen assimilated by heterotrophic growth was estimated by using the stoichiometric coefficient that relates the nitrogen and carbon contents of the biomass 0 2 mol n c mol x 1 assuming the elemental formula ch1 8o0 5n0 2 δ tkn ox in the famine period was estimated by means of eq 10 for feast and famine periods nitrogen removal by simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd was estimated by means of the following expression 11 s n d δ t k n o x δ n o x n δ t k n o x x 100 where δ nox n ox corresponds to the oxidized forms of nitrogen nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen generated in each period in steady state sbr2 the nitrate generated represented approximately 65 of the removed tknw indicating a good nitrifying activity of the system removal of tkn was mainly attributed to the nitrification process and to a lesser extent to nitrogen assimilation by heterotrophic growth table 2 simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd took place in the famine period snd process was relevant as about 52 of the nitrified nitrogen was denitrified inorganic nitrogen removal was about 50 which was mainly attributed to the aerobic denitrification process driven by intracellular carbon reserves glycogen and to a lesser extent to the heterotrophic nitrogen assimilation table 2 this study demonstrates that the addition of micronutrients to dairy effluents is a good alternative to promote the growth of nitrifying bacteria which contributes significantly to the biological elimination of nitrogen the sbr3 showed a good nitrifying activity as the formed nitrate represented about 85 of the removed tknw tkn was removed almost exclusively by nitrifying activity and in a lesser degree by heterotrophic assimilation a relatively low organic load favored the nitrifying activity nitrate at the end of each operational cycle represented almost totally the removed tknw amount snd process was not important inorganic nitrogen removal was poor which could be attributed to the relatively low heterotrophic growth and to low denitrifying activity table 2 3 6 analysis of bacterial composition of the granules by high yield sequencing technology with the aim of knowing the detailed composition and the relative abundances of the bacterial populations present in the bioreactors that exhibit nitrification a high yield sequencing technology was used due to the potential advantages of being more accurate flexible and easily automatable 48 the sequencing of the pcr fragments of the 16s rrna gene was carried out from the total dna extracted from the microorganisms present in each of the reactors which generated sequences grouped into 905 otus for the sbr2 and 685 otus for the sbr3 all the representative sequences of each otu were classified within the domain bacteria the relative frequency in the reactors revealed the presence of 14 main bacterial orders in the sbr2 within which 27 genera were prevalent and 7 bacterial orders in the sbr3 with 22 genera prevalent fig 5 the most abundant phyla found in the bioreactors were bacteroidetes representing 39 for sbr2 and 52 for sbr3 being the division more abundant proteobacteria which represent 35 of the sbr2 and 24 of the sbr3 respectively with a similar proportion between the beta alpha and gamma classes for both bioreactors in a lower proportion other phyla were highlighted they are actinobacteria 12 for sbr2 and 14 for sbr3 and planctomycetes 5 for sbr2 and 6 for sbr3 fig 5 in addition chloroflexi phylo was found uniquely in sbr2 representing 5 of the total fig 6 within the phylo bacteroidetes the most abundant order for both bioreactors corresponded to sphingobacteriales 27 for sbr2 and 16 for sbr3 dominated by niabella genus a large number of the species belonging to this genus have been characterized as ammonium oxidant strains 49 examples of them are emticicia and spirosoma characterized as positive strains in the reduction of nitrates 50 terrimonas found in previous studies as positive for the reduction of nitrates and accumulators of the polyhydroxybutyrate polymer 51 figs 4 y 5 it should be noted that genera such as chitoinophaga and flexibacter have been found within sphingobacteriales order there are currently no bibliography confirming their active or direct participation in the nitrification process additional studies with pure cultures of these genera would determine their potential metabolic abilities in the nitrogen removal process regarding the proteobacteria phylo the most abundant orders found were xanthomonadales burkholderiales and rhizobiales xanthomonadales order dominated by aquimonas dokdonella lysobacter and xylophilus genera is present in different proportions in the sbrs studied 13 for sbr2 and 8 for sbr3 figs 4 y 5 and are recognized as denitrifying microorganisms for the case of many of their species 17 burkholderiales order dominated by hydrogenophaga diaphorobacter pseudorhodoferax acidovorax andsimplicispira genera posses several genera as denitrifying strains capable of degrading poly 3 hydroxybutyrate 49 in addition zhang et al 52 demonstrated that diaphorobacter is capable of both heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification rhizobiales order dominated by mesorhizobium devosia and shinella genera were found in 5 in sbr2 and 1 5 in sbr3 reported some species as nitrogen fixing bacteria 53 finally actinobacteria phylo was represented by actinomycetales as majority order 12 for sbr2 and 14 for sbr3 respectively and planctomycetes was represented by planctomycetales 4 for sbr2 and 6 for sbr3 approximately planctomycetales possess among their main functions the oxidation of ammonium with an active participation of the nitrification process 54 candidatus kuenenia represented less than 1 of the microbial community in both reactors ca kuenenia is one of the bacteria capable of anaerobic oxidation of ammonium anammox which forms a deep branching clade within the planctomycetes 55 the anammox process converts ammonia into n2 gas by using nitrite as electron acceptor under anoxic conditions 56 it is important to highlight that in this study the most common genera corresponding to autotrophic nitrifying microorganisms aob and nob have been found in low percentages the genera found for aob were nitrosococcus 0 406 and 0 012 in the sbr2 and sbr3 respectively nitrosomonas 0 191 and 0 037 in the sbr2 and sbr3 respectively nitrosospira and nitrosovibrio were found in lower percentages for nob nitrospira and nitrobacter order nitrosomonadales were found with percentages lower than 0 02 and 0 15 respectively in conclusion total aob represented 0 63 and 0 06 in the sbr2 and sbr3 and total nob corresponded to 0 162 and 0 03 in the sbr2 and sbr3 respectively the average shannon index for both bioreactors was 4 58 which indicates an identical genetic diversity for the studies carried out 3 7 characterization of the biological processes it should be considered that all systems sbr1 sbr2 and sbr3 were operated under conditions of excess do and macronutrients n and p consequently the competition between autotrophic nitrifiers non nitrifying heterotrophs ordinary heterotrophs and nitrifying heterotrophs was mainly given by micronutrients in nitrifying reactors sbr2 and sbr3 conventional autotrophic nitrification by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob was very poorly represented as determined by genomic analysis ammonium oxidation up to nitrate was mainly attributed to heterotrophic nitrification about this at least two genera niabella and diaphorobacter with potential nitrifying ability were found in both reactors planctomycetes bacteria could also have contributed to the process of heterotrophic nitrification since they represented about 5 of the microbial community of both systems a relatively high organic load sbr1 and sbr2 stimulated competition for micronutrients between microbial groups in the sbr1 the high organic load caused an excessive growth of non nitrifying microorganisms displacing the nitrifying community by competition heterotrophic nitrification is an unfavorable biological process from the energetic point of view which could be stimulated under more favorable ecological conditions given by non severe microbial competition about this in the sbr2 with identical organic load to sbr1 the addition of micronutrients probably minimized the competition phenomenon allowing the development of nitrifying heterotrophic bacteria in the case of sbr3 it can be assumed that the microbial competition was controlled by reducing the organic load and consequently a low growth of non nitrifying microorganisms was achieved thus a reduction in competition between the species could explain the growth of nitrifying heterotrophs however it is necessary to deepen the study in order to confirm that hypothesis cheese whey with high content of hydrolyzed lactose was mainly stored as glycogen intracellular carbon reserve in both reactors pha accumulation was poor simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd was relevant in sbr2 in which intracellular reserves were used as carbon source for aerobic denitrification in the sbr3 denitrification was poor which could be due to the relatively low organic load applied in the snd process there is no need to add additional organic substances like methanol or acetate 57 alkalinity caused by denitrification and acidification generated by nitrification could help maintain ph in the snd which involves less additional cost and easy operation 58 however for the granular sbr fed with modified dairy wastewater used in the present study operating parameters should be optimized in order to improve the removal of inorganic nitrogen by snd processes microorganisms with high relative abundance that could participate in the nitrogen removal process were identified such as luteimonas hydrogenophaga niabella emticicia and terrimonas in the sbr2 and lysobacter simplicispira and spirosoma in the sbr3 however it is necessary to study in greater detail the mechanisms of nitrogen elimination by the genera found with regard to the remaining genera very similar proportions have been found for both reactors figs 5 and 6 it should be noted that numerous genera were identified in nitrifying sbrs of which no bibliography has been found that is directly related to the process of nitrification denitrification or nitrogen fixation many microorganisms with the capacity of heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying have been screened and applied to biological nitrogen removal systems exhibiting a greater nitrogen removal performance 59 however a greater number of studies are required for the reliable implementation of the snd process based on heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification for the nitrogen biological removal ammonia addition to dairy wastewaters is a good strategy to obtain cod n ratios favorable for nitrification cod n 100 5 however in the present study the sbr1 fed with cheese whey wastewaters supplemented with ammonia did not show nitrifying activity at cod n ratio of 100 12 when a relatively high organic load 716 8 mg cod l day 1 was used for these experimental conditions a good nitrifying activity was achieved once the ammonium enriched cheese whey wastewater was amended with trace elements sbr2 in absence of micronutrients the nitrification process was favored when the organic load was reduced by half sbr3 it should be noted that the anammox process did not take place or was poorly developed since the essential bacteria for this process were found in a low percentage in both reactors according to the biodiversity analysis environmental conditions were not favorable for the anammox process since no nitrite accumulation took place in the systems and fully aerobic conditions high do of about 7 5 mg l 1 given by the high air flow were observed an interesting strategy for the treatment of dairy effluents arised from these results dairy wastewaters can be supplemented by effluents containing ammonia and micronutrients such as landfill leachates municipal wastewaters and anaerobic digestion supernatant for biological treatment the co treatment of dairy and ammonium rich wastewaters constitutes a promise strategy for the effluents treatment of the dairy industry simultaneous removal of organic carbon and tkn by organic matter oxidation and nitrification can be achieved however the process of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification should be improved in order to achieve nitrate concentrations below allowable discharge limits 4 conclusions dairy effluents are deficient in nitrogen for biological treatment in the present study synthetic dairy wastewater based on cheese whey powder was supplemented with ammonia to obtain cod n ratios lower than 100 5 which were adequate for biological processes simultaneous removal of organic carbon and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn was achieved in aerobic granular sequential batch reactors sbrs at laboratory scale fed with the modified dairy wastewater the effects of both the addition of micronutrients and reduction of organic load on the nitrification and denitrification processes were evaluated in both cases nitrifying activity was achieved in the sbrs complete removal of organic matter was obtained in all the studies carried out better nitrifying activity was achieved when the ammonium enriched dairy wastewater was amended with trace elements at an organic load of 716 8 mg cod l day 1 and cod n of 100 12 at these conditions simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd took place and thus higher removal of inorganic nitrogen was achieved inorganic nitrogen removal was mainly attributed to the aerobic denitrification process driven by intracellular glycogen pha was poorly synthetized by the microorganisms being probably irrelevant in the denitrification process in the absence of micronutrients the nitrification process took place at cod n of 100 22 however in this condition a low denitrifying activity led to poor removal of inorganic nitrogen the presence of micronutrients improved the nitrification process to a greater extent than the reduction of the organic load next generation sequencing ngs allowed characterizing the composition of the bacterial communities high heterotrophic nitrifying activity took place the nitrification process involved oxidation of ammonium and probably organic nitrogen up to nitrate being mainly attributed to nitrifying heterotrophic bacteria as determined by genomic

biochemical oxygen demand bod 1 cheese whey is one of the main components from dairy wastewaters dairy wastewaters can be treated using biological process such as activated sludge system trickling filters aerated lagoons sequencing batch reactor sbr as well as anaerobic process as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and anaerobic filters among others 2 anaerobic processes are widely used for treating dairy wastewaters these treatments offer some advantages such as methane production no aeration requirement and low sludge production 3 however several disadvantages have been reported fats from dairy wastewaters have an inhibitory action on the anaerobic processes and operational problems such as formation of scum sludge flotation and loss of cod removal efficiency can take place 4 enzymatic hydrolysis of fats has been proposed as pretreatment 5 however these processes may lead to higher costs in anaerobic digestion various microbial groups with different growth rates are involved hence the main processes acidogenesis and methanogenesis are not commonly in balance 6 this imbalance among the microbial groups can lead to less methane production and process failure 6 in addition anaerobic treatment of dairy wastewaters requires commonly an aerobic post treatment in order to meet the effluent discharge limits 7 aerobic processes allow achieving excellent effluent quality in terms of cod bod and nutrient removal among the aerobic processes the sbr seems to be the most promising technology for treatment of dairy wastewaters 8 the sbr offers operational flexibility and excellent process control possibilities smaller foot print area lower investment cost and lower operation complexity as compared to conventional process 9 however for dairy wastewater treatment aerobic processes can be affected by limitations in oxygen transfer as well as sludge settling problems cheese whey wastewaters has a mean cod n p ratio of 100 1 75 0 5 which has been considered nitrogen deficient for effluents treatment by biological processes 1 the optimum cod n p ratio of 100 5 1 is widely accepted for aerobic processes based on heterotrophic growth to overcome the mentioned difficulties dilution of dairy wastewaters with ammonium rich effluents could be implemented in aerobic treatment systems several wastewaters contain high ammonium concentrations and low cod n ratio the landfill leachate is a complex mixture of biodegradable and recalcitrant organic matter ammonia metals and organic and inorganic salts 10 mature leachates show commonly low bod cod ratio and high ammonia concentration 11 ammonium rich effluents are also generated from anaerobic digestion of sludge in wastewater treatment plants 12 municipal wastewaters show low carbon nitrogen ratio 13 ammonium contamination from industrial wastewaters negatively affects water bodies and causes several environmental problems such as eutrophication increased dissolved oxygen do consumption reduced disinfection efficiency and toxic effects on fish 14 several methods have been developed to remove ammonium from wastewater physical chemical methods include air stripping membrane filtration ion exchange absorption 15 reverse osmosis breakpoint chlorination chemical precipitation microwave radiation and supercritical water oxidation 16 among others biological methods include biofiltration and nitrification denitrification processes 17 physical chemical methods are commonly applied for nitrogen removal however high cost high sensitivity to ph and temperature addition of chemical compounds facilities maintenance and operational problems are the main difficulties 14 16 co treatment of dairy wastewaters with ammonium rich effluents would allow adjusting the cod n ratio to suitable values for biological treatment cod n 100 5 this strategy avoids the costs caused by the addition of carbon or nitrogen which would be necessary if each type of effluentis treated individually by biological methods combined wastewater with cod n ratio lower than 100 5 obtained from the mixture of dairy and ammonium rich effluents can also be treated provided that biological nitrogen removal bnr takes place at these conditions higher volume of ammonium rich effluents can be processed co treatment of landfill leachate and dairy wastewater has been proposed by neczaj et al 2008 18 bnr involves commonly two processes aerobic nitrification by autotrophs and anaerobic denitrification by heterotrophs autotrophicnitrification comprises two steps nitritation oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n carried out by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitration oxidation of no2 n to no3 n driven by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 19 the denitrification involves the anoxic degradation of no2 no3 yielding nitrogen gas n2 as final product 20 the autotrophic nitrifiers have slow specific growth rates and low biomass yields and are sensitive to ph heavy metals and toxic agents 21 the bnr process generally requires separate aerobic and anaerobic tanks and strict control of the ammonia and organic matter loads 22 simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd can be achieved in granular systems under aerobic conditions with denitrifying activity taking place in the anoxic zones inside of the granules 23 however the snd efficiency is strongly affected by the do concentration and granule size according to those authors to overcome these problems nitrifying heterotrophic bacteria can be used in bnr processes with a single aerobic tank rhodococcus sp 24 paracoccus pantotrophus 25 pseudomonas tolaasii 26 acinetobacter junii 27 alcaligenes faecalis 28 bacillus subtilis 29 and diaphorobacter sp 30 among others have been recognized as heterotrophic nitrifiers these bacteria has the capability to carry out snd 30 allowing the aerobic conversion of ammonia to nitrogen gas however the operating conditions that affect the growth of nitrifying heterotrophic bacteria are not fully understood aerobic granules are commonly generated in sbrs under feast famine regime in these operational conditions external organic carbon is commonly stored by the microorganisms as intracellular polymers polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen volatile fatty acids are stored as pha glucose is mainly converted to glycogen 31 pha and glycogen can be used as carbon source for denitrification 32 in aerobic granular sbr it has been reported that the nitrifying activity increases progressively as the cod n ratio decreases from 100 5 to 100 30 33 however the effect of other growth factors such as micronutrients on the nitrifying activity has been poorly studied in the co treatment of dairy and ammonium rich wastewater nitrification could be encouraged by micronutrients provided by wastewaters from municipal treatment plants anaerobic digesters or leachate and so adequate treatment at low cod n ratio could be achieved molecular biological techniques such as pcr dgge are the most widely used to investigate the structure of microbial communities present in wastewater treatment systems however they only allow an evaluation of the dominant members of the communities 34 next generation sequencing ngs is a very strong technology that allows to investigate the composition of complex bacterial communities 35 not only shedding light on the community composition but also on the functional features and the relationship between the microbial community and environmental factors 36 the general objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility to achieve treatment of dairy wastewater supplemented with ammonia using aerobic granular sequencing batch reactors sbrs and to apply next generation sequencing technique to analyze the composition of the microbial communities the specific objectives were a to evaluate the effect of the organic load the cod n ratio and micronutrients on the nitrification and denitrification capacities of sbrs fed with a synthetic wastewater based on commercial cheese whey supplemented with ammonia b to analyze the capacity of accumulation of intracellular carbon reserves as glycogen and pha and its use as carbon source for denitrification in the reactors that exhibited nitrification c to relate the microbial composition of the sbr determined by ngs technology with the biological processes detected for each operating condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequential batch biological reactors sbrs three sequential discontinuous reactors sbr1 sbr2 and sbr3 were used at laboratory scale consisting of bubble columns build in acrylic with a height a of 25 cm an internal diameter d of 9 cm giving an a d ratio of 2 7 the air was supplied by two diffusers located at the bottom of the reactors generating an upward flow to favor the granulation the superficial upflow air velocity was 0 6 cm s 1 the do was greater than 6 0 mg o2 l 1 avoiding oxygen limitation of the nitrifying activity 2 2 synthetic wastewater and experimental design all the assayed reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater sww of the dairy industry supplemented with ammonia and phosphorus the role of micronutrients was analyzed cheese whey cw powder lactofood argentina with a cod content of 1 g cod g cw and a cod n ratio of 100 1 55 was used cheese whey was amended with ammonia to obtain cod n ratios lower than 100 5 which are favorable for biological treatment especially nitrification the sww showed the following composition cheese whey nh4 2so4 k2hpo4 kh2po4 and nahco3 with the purpose of maintaining the ph between 7 0 and 8 0 ph conditions suitable for the growth of nitrifying microorganisms for this the effect of several nahco3 concentrations on ph was evaluated throughout the operating cycle of the reactors the following experiments were carried out to analyze the role of micronutrients and the cod n ratio sbr1 and sbr2 were operated at cod n ratio of 100 12 favorable for the nitrification process in both reactors identical conditions were applied with the exception of two trace element solutions m1 and m2 that were added only to the sbr2 sww m1 had the following composition g l 1 feso4 7h2o 15 0 znso4 7h2o 5 0 mnso4 h2o 3 0 cuso4 5h2o 0 75 cocl2 6h2o 0 15 citric acid 6 0 m2 showed the following composition g l 1 nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 0 5 bo3h3 0 1 ik 0 1 a 1 ml volume of both m1 and m2 solutions was added to 1 l of sbr2 sww then sbr1 and sbr2 were studied to evaluate the effect of micronutrients addition on nitrification process the sbr3 presented half of the organic load and consequently its cod n p ratio was reduced from 100 12 5 to 100 22 10 being operated in the absence of trace elements table 1 this operating condition was set in order to evaluate the effect of a relatively low organic load on the nitrifying activity 2 3 start up of sbrs acclimation and formation of hybrid granules the sbr1 containing sww 0 8 l was inoculated with an aerobic microbial consortium activated sludge 0 2 l the granules generated in this reactor were used as inoculum of sbr2 and sbr3 the reactors were operated manually at room temperature with 24 h cycles determined by the following phases addition of sww 2 min reaction phase 1428 min sludge purge 1 min sedimentation phase 5 20 min and extraction of the supernatant 2 min it must be considered that in all reactors cod n ratios lower than 100 5 and large cycle duration were applied in order to favor nitrifying bacteria growth and feast famine regime respectively under these operating conditions intracellular polymers can be accumulated and snd could be encouraged the granulation of the biomass was carried out following the method of adav et al 37 with slight modifications the sbr1 was initially operated with a sedimentation time of 20 min for 20 days and then this time was gradually reduced to 5 min 38 with the purpose of favoring the retention of firm and dense microbial aggregates granules and flocs the continuous operation of the reactor under a strong hydraulic selection pressure and a short sedimentation time 5 min favored the enrichment of granules this last settling time remained constant during the operation of the reactors being 100 days for sbr1 and 400 days for sbr2 and sbr3 the operation of the reactors was evaluated throughout the operating cycles by determining the following parameters concentrations of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn chemical soluble oxygen demand cods as a measure of the organic substrate and total cod codt of the mixed liquor at different operating times defined by the number of crts elapsed the following kinetic parameters were determined specific and volumetric cod uptake rates rcods and qcods and specific and volumetric ammonium uptake rates rnh4 n and qnh4 n settling properties and granule size of the biomass were periodically determined the period of acclimatization of the biomass was completed once 100 cod removals and good settling properties were achieved in the reactors that exhibited nitrification the capacity of accumulation of intracellular carbon reserves as glycogen and pha was evaluated in these reactors a complete genomic analysis was carried out with the purpose of characterizing the microbial composition of the biomass finally the relationship between the microbial structure and the performance of the reactors with nitrifying activity was evaluated 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 determinations of chemical oxygen demand and biomass soluble cod cods mg cod l 1 was determined in filtered samples 0 45 μm and used as a measure of the organic substrate concentration the cod corresponding to the biomass codb mg cod l 1 was obtained from the difference between total cod of the mixed liquor codt mg cod l 1 and cods the cod determinations were carried out using a commercial kit hach company loveland co the biomass concentration of the sbrs

samples were placed in an oven 105 c for 24 h the biomass concentration x was expressed as g ts l 1 the values obtained were correlated with the codb measurements 2 4 2 determination of ammonia

determined by the anthrone method following a modification of the technique proposed by osborne and voogt 40 in biological processes with feast famine regimen glycogen is commonly cycled and it is assumed that changes in the concentration of total carbohydrates occur on the glycogen component 41 in the biological reactors used in the present study fed with high content of hydrolyzed lactose it is expected that changes in the tc concentration were associated with the synthesis of glycogen as an intracellular reserve substance and subsequent degradation for ct determination tubes containing 1 0 ml of diluted and washed biomass samples and 5 ml of the anthrone reagent 0 2 g anthrone in 95 v v sulphuric acid were boiling in a water bath 10 min then the tubes were incubated in a cooling water bath for 10 min to stop the reaction finally at room temperature the glucose concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at 620 nm using sulfuric acid as blank a standard curve was prepared using a glucose solution 100 μg glucose ml 1 results were expressed as mg glucose l 1 2 5 microscopic detection of polyhydroxyalkanoate pha sudan black staining of mixed liquor samples 30 μl from the reactors was performed for the detection of intracellular pha granules 42 the stained samples were observed with a leica dmlb microscope germany with a built in camera micrographs were taken under illumination with phase contrast 1000 x 2 6 sludge volume index svi and granule size the settling properties of the sbrs biomass were evaluated by the sludge volume index svi determined after 30 min of sedimentation in a 100 ml test tube svi30 ml g ts 1 it has been proposed that the svi should be less than 90 ml g ts 1 to get an excellent settling of the granules 43 the particle size distribution of the biomass was determined using a mastersizer e 20003 14 equipment the results were expressed in standard percentiles d 0 5 and average diameter in volume d 4 3 these determinations were made at different crts elapsed 2 7 kinetic parameters the volumetric cod uptake rate rcods and volumetric ammonium uptake rate rnh4 n were determined from the slope of the decay curves of cods and nh4 n as a function of time respectively then the specific uptake rates of cod qcods and n nh4 n qnh4 n were calculated from the ratio between the volumetric rates and the biomass concentration expressed as ts of each reactor all parameters were determined for each sbr at different crt 2 8 quantification of the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen inorganic nitrogen and total kjeldahl nitrogen the ammonia nitrogen removal nh3 nr was determined by the following expression 1 n h 3 n r n h 3 n o n h 3 n f n h 3 n o 100 where nh3 n o and nh3 n f correspond to the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen at the beginning and end of the operating cycle respectively the inorganic nitrogen removal nir was determined from the following expression 2 n i r n i o n i f n i o 100 where nio is the nitrogen concentration ni at the start of the operating cycle mg l 1 and nif is the ni concentration mg l 1 at the end of cycle sbr effluent nio was given by the nh3 n from the wastewater nif corresponds to the sum of nh3 n no2 n and no3 n concentrations the nitrate and nitrite concentrations at the beginning of the cycle from the remaining supernatant of the preceding cycle were not considered in the determination of the nio concentration total kjeldahl nitrogen removal tknr was determined by the following expression 3 t k n r t k n o t k n f t k n o 100 where tkno is the concentration of tkn at the beginning of the operating cycle given by the sum of the ammonia nitrogen concentration and the organic nitrogen norg contributed by the cheese whey it should be noted that norg can occur in particulate form being difficult to separate it from biomass for quantification therefore at the beginning of the cycle norg was estimated indirectly from the tkn analysis of cheese whey tknf corresponds to the tkn concentration of the sbr final effluent 2 9 respirometric assays determination of the oxidation rate of particulate and soluble cheese whey respirometric assays were carried out in order to estimate the oxidation rate of particulate and soluble cheese whey the respirometer consisted of an oxygen electrode ysi model 58 inside a sealed flask the oxygen probe was calibrated in air saturated with water vapor measurements of dissolved oxygen do from the electrode were recorded at a frequency of 1 data 10 s the samples of mixed liquor were subjected to a pretreatment and then placed in the respirometer as indicates below mixed liquor 90 ml from sbr2 was centrifuged and re suspended in running water this washing process was performed twice the following tests were carried out a determination of heterotrophic oxygen uptake rate our for particulate cheese whey pcw synthetic wastewater sww 15 ml was added to vessel 50 ml containing washed mixed liquor 25 ml the mixture was stirred 1 min and then it was centrifuged 3000 rpm 10 min and re suspended in running water this washing process was performed twice in order to eliminate the soluble fraction of the cheese whey 0 45 μm then the biomass together with the pcw was supplemented with ammonia phosphorus and trace element solutions the mixture was stirred 1 min and allylthiourea was added in order to inhibit the nitrifying activity finally the mixture was aerated during 1 min and then the aeration was stopped the slope obtained from the linear decrease of the dissolved oxygen concentration corresponded to oura b determination of heterotrophic our for soluble cheese whey scw running water 15 ml was added to a vessel containing washed mixed liquor 25 ml the mixture was subjected to the same centrifugation and washing processes described for assay a in order to submit the sludge to identical physical treatment then the biomass was re suspended in filtered sww 0 45 μm and supplemented with ammonia phosphorus and trace element solutions finally allylthiourea was added the mixture was aerated and our was determined ourb as described above it should be noted that oura and ourb involved not only the oxidation of particulate and soluble cheese whey respectively but also the oxidation of endogenous reserves and auto oxidation therefore the endogenous respiratory activity was also determined c determination of heterotrophic endogenous our the same procedure corresponding to the assay b was followed however in this case the biomass was re suspended in running water and the our corresponded to the endogenous activity of heterotrophs ourend finally ours corresponding to the oxidation of particulate cheese whey ourpcw and soluble cheese whey ourscw were determined from the following expressions 4 o u r p c w o u r a o u r e n d 5 o u r s c w o u r b o u r e n d 2 10 dna extraction and sequencing the microbial genomic dna from bioreactors sbr2 and sbr3 was extracted for

microscope sem observation the morphology of the biomass was observed with high resolution sem fei la b6 eindhoven netherlands at 5 kv accelerating voltage with an electron detector for low vacuum conditions biomass samples from the reactors were washed with phosphate buffer and allowed to settle then the biomass were treated with 4 paraformaldehyde and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solution 50 70 80 90 and 100 finally the samples were dried at room temperature for sem observation 3 results and discussion in the sbr1 a complete removal of organic carbon was achieved nevertheless the system did not show nitrifying activity during the period of operation 100 days the results of the reactors that exhibited nitrification sbr2 and sbr3 are presented below 3 1 variation of ph it is widely accepted that nitrifying bacteria grow adequately at ph values between 7 0 and 8 0 below the neutrality conditions the metabolism of these microorganisms decreases significantly an issue to be taken into account in aerobic reactors with nitrifying activity concerns to the ph decrease to values lower than 6 0 this phenomenon is caused by the nitrification process which involves the production of protons generating acidity 47 for this reason in the present study a sww containing a phosphate buffer 3 3 mm and an optimal concentration of sodium bicarbonate 0 75 g l 1 was used to maintain adequate ph conditions in all systems 7 5 8 5 3 2 stability of the systems granules size and svi the heterotrophic granular biomass of sbr1 was used as inoculum of the sbr2 and sbr3 reactors the concentration of biomass reached in the reactors was 3 g ts l 1 for sbr1 and sbr2 and 1 5 g ts l 1 for sbr3 which remained constant throughout the operation time the evolution of the granules size and sludge volume index along the different crt was studied in those systems that exhibited nitrifying activity sbr2 and sbr3 approximately 68 days 3 5 trc were required for the formation of hybrid granules with an average diameter of approximately 0 25 mm in both reactors fig 1 the average size of aerobic granules according to literature is between 0 2 and 5 mm 38 it can be observed that the average diameter of the granules increased with time until reaching stability conditions in terms of the granular size at 134 days for the sbr2 0 3 0 35 mm 6 7 trc and 260 days 0 3 0 35 mm 13 trc for the sbr3 fig 1a and b the svi was below 90 ml g ts 1 during the operating period of sbr2 fig 1a and sbr3 fig 1b which indicates a good sedimentation in the case of sbr2 a decrease of the svi can be observed along the elapsed crts up to 50 60 ml g ts 1 under stability conditions a lower svi was observed for sbr3 granules about 25 ml g ts 1 microscopic examination of the biomass from reactors showed granular morphology sem micrographs of the granules are shown in fig 2 a and b sbr2 and fig 2 c and d sbr3 micrographs revealed that the granules in both reactors had regular and three dimensional structure 3 3 consumption of soluble organic carbon and ammonia in the sbr2 soluble organic carbon measured as cods represented 60 70 of the initial organic load provided by the cheese whey cods was removed almost entirely in the first 2 h of the operating cycle with simultaneous glycogen accumulation this phase with availability of readily biodegradable cod corresponded to the feast period ammonia decreased progressively throughout the cycle glycogen degradation and the nitrification process took place in the famine period nitrifying activity led to the formation of no3 n whose concentration increased continuously until the end of the cycle without significant accumulation of no2 n fig 3 a and b the sbr3 was operated with half the organic load with respect to the sbr2 which implied a reduction of the cod n ratio from 100 12 to 100 22 and without micronutrients table 1 cods represented almost completely the initial organic carbon the reduction of the organic load leads to a lower heterotrophic growth as a consequence the development of the autotrophic nitrifying biomass could be favored in this system cods removal and glycogen accumulation took place in the first 4 h of the operating cycle feast period ammonia was partially removed throughout the cycle glycogen was degraded in the famine phase nitrification took place from the beginning to the end of the cycle an increase in the no3 n concentration was observed throughout the cycle a small no2 n accumulation was observed 2 4 h and then nitrite rapidly decreased to non detectable levels fig 3c and d a mass balance in cod units was carried out for feast period of the reactors including the uptake rate of external organic carbon cheese whey oxygen uptake rate associated to heterotrophic activity heterotrophic growth rate from cheese whey and production rate of glycogen and pha according to this balance glycogen was the main intracellular carbon reserve synthetized from cheese whey during the period feast and pha synthesis was negligible poor pha staining with sudan black allowed confirming these results cheese whey from wastewater showed high content of hydrolyzed lactose glucose and galactose monosaccharides were probably stored as glycogen these results agree with those informed in bibliography miao et al 31 reported that glucose is mainly converted to glycogen both systems showed percentage ammonium removal and specific rates of ammonium and cod removal that were not significantly different table 2 3 4 consumption of particulate cheese whey organic nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn from wastewater and respirometric assays the changes in total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were studied throughout the operating cycles of the sbr2 and sbr3 reactors in which significant removal of organic carbon and nitrogen was observed tkn of the cheese whey and the mixed liquor and filtered mixed liquor 0 45 μm samples of the sbrs were quantified in order to determine the components that contribute to the nitrogen load of all systems tkn of the mixed liquor tknml included organic nitrogen norg soluble and particulate contributed by cheese whey ammonia nitrogen nh3 n soluble from the wastewater ammonium sulfate and norg corresponding to the microbial biomass as well as the lysis products thereof the filtered samples from the mixed liquor contained all the soluble forms of tkn tkns contributed by the cheese whey nh3 n and microbial lysis products the particulate tkn tknp was determined from the difference between tknml and tkns and included the organic nitrogen contributed by the cheese whey and the biomass the concentrations of tkns were similar to those corresponding to the nh4 n determined by the nessler method section 2 4 2 this implies that both cheese whey and biomass did not contribute significant amounts of nitrogen to the soluble phase the tkn contributed by cheese whey tkncw to each reactor resulted 11 23 mg n l 1 and 5 5 mg n l 1 for sbr2 and sbr3 respectively fig 4 shows the changes of tknml tkns and nh3 n throughout an operating cycle for sbr2 and sbr3 the decrease of tknml was caused by the nitrification process efficiencies of tkn removal were similar for both reactors table 2 the tkn of the modified dairy wastewater tknw included two nitrogen components particulate organic nitrogen provided by cheese whey proteins and soluble ammonia nitrogen supplemented to the wastewater ammonia uptake was easily determined by spectrophotometry fig 3 organic nitrogen consumption could not be quantified by the used analytical techniques since it occurs in particulate form 0 45 μm from respirometric assays section 2 9 it was found that the oxygen uptake rate associated to the consumption of particulate cheese whey ourpcw represented 22 of the our corresponding to the soluble cheese whey ourscw that is ourpcw 0 22 ourscw consumption of particulate cheese whey and organic nitrogen present in particulate form cannot be directly determined by cod and kjeldahl methods respectively since it is very difficult to separate them from biomass for quantification the uptake rate of the particulate cheese whey was indirectly determined from our measurements taken into account the following considerations and assumptions the oxygen uptake rate is proportional to the substrate degradation rate rs i e our yo s rs being yo s the substrate oxidation coefficient it was assumed that yo s for particulate cheese whey is the same that the corresponding to soluble cheese whey which led to the following expression 6 o u r p c w r p c w o u r scw r s c w where rpcw and rscw is the degradation rate of particulate cheese whey and soluble cheese whey respectively rearranging eq 6 and taking into consideration that ourpcw 0 22 ourscw the degradation rate of particulate cheese whey rpcw was equivalent to 22 of that corresponding to the soluble fraction of cheese whey rscw it should be noted that rscw is easily determined from soluble cod measurements the uptake rate of organic nitrogen present in particulate form can be considered proportional to the degradation rate of particulate cheese whey since organic nitrogen comes from cheese whey proteins the uptake rate of organic nitrogen was estimated taken into account the following assumptions firstly it must be considered that the nitrogen uptake rate rn is proportional to the substrate degradation rate for microbial synthesis rn yn s rs being yn s the coefficient that relates nitrogen and substrate uptake assuming that yn s for particulate cheese whey is the same that the corresponding to soluble cheese whey the following expression is obtained 7 r n p c w r p c w r n s c w r s c w where rnpcw and rnscw is the nitrogen uptake rate associated to the consumption of particulate cheese whey and soluble cheese whey respectively taking in consideration that rpcw 0 22 rscw rn for particulate cheese whey rnpcw can be determined as 0 22 rnscw the nitrogen uptake rate associated to the consumption of soluble cheese whey corresponded to nh3 n uptake rate the relatively slow degradation rate of the particulate cheese whey involved also a slow uptake rate of organic nitrogen according to these analyses it was estimated that organic nitrogen was completely consumed in about 8 and 3 h for sbr2 and sbr3 respectively from the results of ammonium and organic nitrogen uptake the tknw removed in each reactor could be estimated both systems showed similar removal percentage of tknw table 2 tknw consumed in feast period including ammonia and organic nitrogen was estimated by using the following expression 8 δ t k n w f e δ n h 3 n f e 0 22 δ n h 3 n f e where δ tkn wfe and δ nh3 n fe correspond to tknw and ammonia nitrogen consumed in the feast period respectively and 0 22 δ nh3 n fe corresponds to norg consumed in feast period in famine period the tknw consumed was estimated as follows 9 δ t k n w f a δ n h 3 n f a t k n c w 0 22 δ n h 3 n f e where δ tkn wfa and δ nh3 n fa correspond to tknw and ammonia nitrogen consumed in the famine period respectively tkn cw is the tkn provided by cheese whey which was completely consumed in each operating cycle 3 5 nitrogen removal by heterotrophic growth nitrification and nitrification denitrification processes mass balances both ammonia and organic nitrogen can be oxidized by nitrifying activity or used for heterotrophic growth identification of each process is very difficult by two reasons a active biomass increases slightly during each operating cycle which cannot be satisfactorily detected by gravimetry b nitrite and or nitrate generated by nitrifying activity can be simultaneously denitrified and consequently the nitrification process could be underestimated wastewater tkn consumed can be expressed as follows 10 δ t k n w δ t k n o x δ t k n x where δ tkn w corresponds to the wastewater tkn consumed δ tkn ox corresponds to the tkn oxidized by nitrifying activity and δ tkn x is the tkn used for heterotrophic growth in sbr2 tknw ammonia and organic nitrogen in feast period was used for heterotrophic growth since nitrification process did not take place then δ tkn x corresponded to δ tkn w in sbr3 the nitrification process took place from the beginning to the end of the operating cycle in this system at low cod n it was assumed that nitrification process prevailed over the heterotrophic growth for simplification the nitrogen uptake in the feast period was attributed exclusively to the nitrifying activity then δ tkn ox corresponded to δ tkn w for sbr3 in the famine period of both reactors the nitrification process and heterotrophic growth from glycogen simultaneously occurred in this period the biomass growth was estimated by using the theoretical stoichiometric coefficient 0 5 c mol x c mol glycogen 1 the nitrogen assimilated by heterotrophic growth was estimated by using the stoichiometric coefficient that relates the nitrogen and carbon contents of the biomass 0 2 mol n c mol x 1 assuming the elemental formula ch1 8o0 5n0 2 δ tkn ox in the famine period was estimated by means of eq 10 for feast and famine periods nitrogen removal by simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd was estimated by means of the following expression 11 s n d δ t k n o x δ n o x n δ t k n o x x 100 where δ nox n ox corresponds to the oxidized forms of nitrogen nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen generated in each period in steady state sbr2 the nitrate generated represented approximately 65 of the removed tknw indicating a good nitrifying activity of the system removal of tkn was mainly attributed to the nitrification process and to a lesser extent to nitrogen assimilation by heterotrophic growth table 2 simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd took place in the famine period snd process was relevant as about 52 of the nitrified nitrogen was denitrified inorganic nitrogen removal was about 50 which was mainly attributed to the aerobic denitrification process driven by intracellular carbon reserves glycogen and to a lesser extent to the heterotrophic nitrogen assimilation table 2 this study demonstrates that the addition of micronutrients to dairy effluents is a good alternative to promote the growth of nitrifying bacteria which contributes significantly to the biological elimination of nitrogen the sbr3 showed a good nitrifying activity as the formed nitrate represented about 85 of the removed tknw tkn was removed almost exclusively by nitrifying activity and in a lesser degree by heterotrophic assimilation a relatively low organic load favored the nitrifying activity nitrate at the end of each operational cycle represented almost totally the removed tknw amount snd process was not important inorganic nitrogen removal was poor which could be attributed to the relatively low heterotrophic growth and to low denitrifying activity table 2 3 6 analysis of bacterial composition of the granules by high yield sequencing technology with the aim of knowing the detailed composition and the relative abundances of the bacterial populations present in the bioreactors that exhibit nitrification a high yield sequencing technology was used due to the potential advantages of being more accurate flexible and easily automatable 48 the sequencing of the pcr fragments of the 16s rrna gene was carried out from the total dna extracted from the microorganisms present in each of the reactors which generated sequences grouped into 905 otus for the sbr2 and 685 otus for the sbr3 all the representative sequences of each otu were classified within the domain bacteria the relative frequency in the reactors revealed the presence of 14 main bacterial orders in the sbr2 within which 27 genera were prevalent and 7 bacterial orders in the sbr3 with 22 genera prevalent fig 5 the most abundant phyla found in the bioreactors were bacteroidetes representing 39 for sbr2 and 52 for sbr3 being the division more abundant proteobacteria which represent 35 of the sbr2 and 24 of the sbr3 respectively with a similar proportion between the beta alpha and gamma classes for both bioreactors in a lower proportion other phyla were highlighted they are actinobacteria 12 for sbr2 and 14 for sbr3 and planctomycetes 5 for sbr2 and 6 for sbr3 fig 5 in addition chloroflexi phylo was found uniquely in sbr2 representing 5 of the total fig 6 within the phylo bacteroidetes the most abundant order for both bioreactors corresponded to sphingobacteriales 27 for sbr2 and 16 for sbr3 dominated by niabella genus a large number of the species belonging to this genus have been characterized as ammonium oxidant strains 49 examples of them are emticicia and spirosoma characterized as positive strains in the reduction of nitrates 50 terrimonas found in previous studies as positive for the reduction of nitrates and accumulators of the polyhydroxybutyrate polymer 51 figs 4 y 5 it should be noted that genera such as chitoinophaga and flexibacter have been found within sphingobacteriales order there are currently no bibliography confirming their active or direct participation in the nitrification process additional studies with pure cultures of these genera would determine their potential metabolic abilities in the nitrogen removal process regarding the proteobacteria phylo the most abundant orders found were xanthomonadales burkholderiales and rhizobiales xanthomonadales order dominated by aquimonas dokdonella lysobacter and xylophilus genera is present in different proportions in the sbrs studied 13 for sbr2 and 8 for sbr3 figs 4 y 5 and are recognized as denitrifying microorganisms for the case of many of their species 17 burkholderiales order dominated by hydrogenophaga diaphorobacter pseudorhodoferax acidovorax andsimplicispira genera posses several genera as denitrifying strains capable of degrading poly 3 hydroxybutyrate 49 in addition zhang et al 52 demonstrated that diaphorobacter is capable of both heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification rhizobiales order dominated by mesorhizobium devosia and shinella genera were found in 5 in sbr2 and 1 5 in sbr3 reported some species as nitrogen fixing bacteria 53 finally actinobacteria phylo was represented by actinomycetales as majority order 12 for sbr2 and 14 for sbr3 respectively and planctomycetes was represented by planctomycetales 4 for sbr2 and 6 for sbr3 approximately planctomycetales possess among their main functions the oxidation of ammonium with an active participation of the nitrification process 54 candidatus kuenenia represented less than 1 of the microbial community in both reactors ca kuenenia is one of the bacteria capable of anaerobic oxidation of ammonium anammox which forms a deep branching clade within the planctomycetes 55 the anammox process converts ammonia into n2 gas by using nitrite as electron acceptor under anoxic conditions 56 it is important to highlight that in this study the most common genera corresponding to autotrophic nitrifying microorganisms aob and nob have been found in low percentages the genera found for aob were nitrosococcus 0 406 and 0 012 in the sbr2 and sbr3 respectively nitrosomonas 0 191 and 0 037 in the sbr2 and sbr3 respectively nitrosospira and nitrosovibrio were found in lower percentages for nob nitrospira and nitrobacter order nitrosomonadales were found with percentages lower than 0 02 and 0 15 respectively in conclusion total aob represented 0 63 and 0 06 in the sbr2 and sbr3 and total nob corresponded to 0 162 and 0 03 in the sbr2 and sbr3 respectively the average shannon index for both bioreactors was 4 58 which indicates an identical genetic diversity for the studies carried out 3 7 characterization of the biological processes it should be considered that all systems sbr1 sbr2 and sbr3 were operated under conditions of excess do and macronutrients n and p consequently the competition between autotrophic nitrifiers non nitrifying heterotrophs ordinary heterotrophs and nitrifying heterotrophs was mainly given by micronutrients in nitrifying reactors sbr2 and sbr3 conventional autotrophic nitrification by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob was very poorly represented as determined by genomic analysis ammonium oxidation up to nitrate was mainly attributed to heterotrophic nitrification about this at least two genera niabella and diaphorobacter with potential nitrifying ability were found in both reactors planctomycetes bacteria could also have contributed to the process of heterotrophic nitrification since they represented about 5 of the microbial community of both systems a relatively high organic load sbr1 and sbr2 stimulated competition for micronutrients between microbial groups in the sbr1 the high organic load caused an excessive growth of non nitrifying microorganisms displacing the nitrifying community by competition heterotrophic nitrification is an unfavorable biological process from the energetic point of view which could be stimulated under more favorable ecological conditions given by non severe microbial competition about this in the sbr2 with identical organic load to sbr1 the addition of micronutrients probably minimized the competition phenomenon allowing the development of nitrifying heterotrophic bacteria in the case of sbr3 it can be assumed that the microbial competition was controlled by reducing the organic load and consequently a low growth of non nitrifying microorganisms was achieved thus a reduction in competition between the species could explain the growth of nitrifying heterotrophs however it is necessary to deepen the study in order to confirm that hypothesis cheese whey with high content of hydrolyzed lactose was mainly stored as glycogen intracellular carbon reserve in both reactors pha accumulation was poor simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd was relevant in sbr2 in which intracellular reserves were used as carbon source for aerobic denitrification in the sbr3 denitrification was poor which could be due to the relatively low organic load applied in the snd process there is no need to add additional organic substances like methanol or acetate 57 alkalinity caused by denitrification and acidification generated by nitrification could help maintain ph in the snd which involves less additional cost and easy operation 58 however for the granular sbr fed with modified dairy wastewater used in the present study operating parameters should be optimized in order to improve the removal of inorganic nitrogen by snd processes microorganisms with high relative abundance that could participate in the nitrogen removal process were identified such as luteimonas hydrogenophaga niabella emticicia and terrimonas in the sbr2 and lysobacter simplicispira and spirosoma in the sbr3 however it is necessary to study in greater detail the mechanisms of nitrogen elimination by the genera found with regard to the remaining genera very similar proportions have been found for both reactors figs 5 and 6 it should be noted that numerous genera were identified in nitrifying sbrs of which no bibliography has been found that is directly related to the process of nitrification denitrification or nitrogen fixation many microorganisms with the capacity of heterotrophic nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying have been screened and applied to biological nitrogen removal systems exhibiting a greater nitrogen removal performance 59 however a greater number of studies are required for the reliable implementation of the snd process based on heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification for the nitrogen biological removal ammonia addition to dairy wastewaters is a good strategy to obtain cod n ratios favorable for nitrification cod n 100 5 however in the present study the sbr1 fed with cheese whey wastewaters supplemented with ammonia did not show nitrifying activity at cod n ratio of 100 12 when a relatively high organic load 716 8 mg cod l day 1 was used for these experimental conditions a good nitrifying activity was achieved once the ammonium enriched cheese whey wastewater was amended with trace elements sbr2 in absence of micronutrients the nitrification process was favored when the organic load was reduced by half sbr3 it should be noted that the anammox process did not take place or was poorly developed since the essential bacteria for this process were found in a low percentage in both reactors according to the biodiversity analysis environmental conditions were not favorable for the anammox process since no nitrite accumulation took place in the systems and fully aerobic conditions high do of about 7 5 mg l 1 given by the high air flow were observed an interesting strategy for the treatment of dairy effluents arised from these results dairy wastewaters can be supplemented by effluents containing ammonia and micronutrients such as landfill leachates municipal wastewaters and anaerobic digestion supernatant for biological treatment the co treatment of dairy and ammonium rich wastewaters constitutes a promise strategy for the effluents treatment of the dairy industry simultaneous removal of organic carbon and tkn by organic matter oxidation and nitrification can be achieved however the process of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification should be improved in order to achieve nitrate concentrations below allowable discharge limits 4 conclusions dairy effluents are deficient in nitrogen for biological treatment in the present study synthetic dairy wastewater based on cheese whey powder was supplemented with ammonia to obtain cod n ratios lower than 100 5 which were adequate for biological processes simultaneous removal of organic carbon and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn was achieved in aerobic granular sequential batch reactors sbrs at laboratory scale fed with the modified dairy wastewater the effects of both the addition of micronutrients and reduction of organic load on the nitrification and denitrification processes were evaluated in both cases nitrifying activity was achieved in the sbrs complete removal of organic matter was obtained in all the studies carried out better nitrifying activity was achieved when the ammonium enriched dairy wastewater was amended with trace elements at an organic load of 716 8 mg cod l day 1 and cod n of 100 12 at these conditions simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd took place and thus higher removal of inorganic nitrogen was achieved inorganic nitrogen removal was mainly attributed to the aerobic denitrification process driven by intracellular glycogen pha was poorly synthetized by the microorganisms being probably irrelevant in the denitrification process in the absence of micronutrients the nitrification process took place at cod n of 100 22 however in this condition a low denitrifying activity led to poor removal of inorganic nitrogen the presence of micronutrients improved the nitrification process to a greater extent than the reduction of the organic load next generation sequencing ngs allowed characterizing the composition of the bacterial communities high heterotrophic nitrifying activity took place the nitrification process involved oxidation of ammonium and probably organic nitrogen up to nitrate being mainly attributed to nitrifying heterotrophic bacteria as determined by genomic analysis niabella sp diaphorobacter sp and planctomycetes bacteria are the main candidates potentially responsible for the heterotrophic nitrification process the present study proposes an alternative for the biological treatment of dairy wastewaters using aerobic granular sequential batch reactors sbrs supplemented with ammonium rich effluents e supplementary data of this work can be found in

13961,biological sand filtration systems are widely used to remove manganese mn from groundwater different experiences have demonstrated that low environmental temperatures decrease the performance of these systems in order to overcome this problem in a previous work a pseudomonas sagittaria strain named mob 181 that showed high mn ii oxidation and biofilm formation capacities when grown at low temperatures was isolated here the impact of summer and winter temperatures on mn removal efficiencies and on bacterial community profiles of both non bioaugmented and mob 181 bioaugmented sand

the presence of soluble manganese mn ii in groundwater is an important concern in populations that use it as source of drinking water due to several reasons mn ii oxidation leads to the formation of mn oxide precipitates that change the aesthetic and organoleptic properties of water 2 4 and also can induce corrosion and operating problems in water distribution systems 5 moreover mn ii can react with chlorine interfering with the water disinfection process 2 therefore concentrations of mn in drinking water should be limited the standard values for this metal in argentina are 0 05 mg l santa

since is a cost effective and eco friendly technology that abolishes the addition of chemicals 5 9 in argentina biological sand filter plants are supplied with groundwater from different perforations commonly containing iron fe and mn concentrations ranging from 0 10 to 1 60 mg l and 0 25 to 1 00 mg l respectively that are collected in a groundwater reservoir tank these biological sand filter plants are designed and operated taking into consideration the physico chemical and microbiological characteristics of groundwater to be treated in general the process includes a stage of aeration followed by two filtration steps a roughing prefiltration in a gravel bed and a conventional rapid filtration step in a sand bed 10 in groundwater containing fe and mn after the initial aeration fe is completely removed by aerobic oxidation in the roughing prefiltration but mn removal takes place in the sand bed filters and depends on the presence and action of microorganisms capable of oxidizing this metal 5 it has been reported that under appropriate conditions i e with groundwater having adequate microorganisms and warm temperatures the period of maturation of the filter for manganese removal is around eight weeks and during this time mn removal efficiencies increase linearly reaching a 95 5 11 however in many biological sand filter plants the periods of time between the installation of these systems and the beginning of mn removal start up periods are very long and mn removal begins after six months or one year pacini personal communication low efficiencies of mn removal and long start up periods are mostly due to i absence of appropriate microorganisms in groundwater 12 ii loss of the oxidizing microorganisms which may be washed out of the system due to their inability to form biofilms 13 and iii decrease of bacterial growth specifically during winter period where groundwater reservoir tanks and sand filters are exposed to low temperatures 10 consequently the optimization of biological mn ii removal processes may be achieved using bioaugmentation strategies these strategies consist of the addition of specific bacterial cultures able to speed up the rate of degradation or consumption of a contaminant in general organisms present in contaminated areas which are adapted to and able to eliminate or modify the contaminant are isolated and used to inoculate other locations where this contaminant may be inefficiently and or slowly degraded 14 regarding mn removal previous research has shown that bioaugmentation may solve the lack or the washing

optimization of biological groundwater treatment plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the laboratory scale water purification device a laboratory scale water purification device was designed to mimic the actual large scale sand bed filters to investigate mn removal performance with mob 181 inoculations at different temperatures the system consisted of identical 50 cm glass columns with an inside diameter of 2 5 cm the columns were filled with sand of 1 00 1 20 mm effective size with a uniformity coefficient of 1 40 and a porosity of 0 38 similar to that used in biological sand groundwater filter systems 26 groundwater was pumped from a polyethylene storage tank of 80 l capacity using peristaltic pumps pc 25 series apema to feed the columns in a down flow mode at a hydraulic rate of 0 60 m h aeration step was not included since in this system the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in all the samples was around 5 mg l indicating that the amount of o2

experiments the bioaugmented columns were inoculated with mob 181 genbank accession number mk011867 this pseudomonas sagittaria strain was previously obtained from sand collected from biological groundwater filter systems 25 2 5 inoculation of sands with mob 181 bacteria were grown in lb medium with shaking at 28 c until exponential growth phase these cultures were centrifuged 10 min at 5000 rpm and resuspended in lb medium at the optimum mob 181 concentration previously determined as described in fig s1 and incubated with sterilized sand 10 ml of culture per 20 g of sand during 7 days at 28 c under static conditions to enable sand adherence these sands were washed four times with groundwater and packed into the columns named as inoculated columns 2 6 quantification of mn oxides accumulated on sand columns after completing the experiments sands were extracted from each column and homogeneously mixed the composite control sands and the composite inoculated sands were analyzed to determine the amounts of mn oxides retained briefly 50 g of these sands were incubated with 50 ml of buffer hepes 10 mm ph 7 5 and vortexed vigorously to remove attached oxides then 500 μl of these supernatants were incubated with 500 μl of leucoberbelin blue lbb dye solution 0 04 w v lbb in 45 mm acetic acid which in the presence of mn oxides is oxidized producing a blue color that may be quantified measuring the absorbance at 618 nm 30 31 absorbance was measured at this wavelength using a synergy 2 reader biotek the quantity of mn oxides was determined using kmno4 calibration curves in a linear range from 0 to 150 μm quantifications were performed in triplicate for control and inoculated columns and mean values and standard deviation sd were presented in the figures data were statistically analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova p 0 05 2 7 analysis of bacterial community profiles and mob 181 persistence in sand filters bacterial communities profiles were analyzed by illumina sequencing at the facility at instituto de agrobiotecnología rosario rosario argentina as previously described 25 total genomic dna were extracted from sand homogenized samples using powermax soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc following manufacturer s instructions the amount of dna was quantified using quant it picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca usa 16s rrna gene libraries were made based on the procedure described in sample preparation guide illumina briefly for library preparation the v3 and v4 region of the 16s rrna gene were amplified

at a 97 similarity threshold were also done as previously described 25 illumina sequences were deposited in the sra database which is available at ncbi with sra accession prjna548803 to calculate the mob 181 proportion in the bacterial communities present in control and inoculated sand filters the v4 region of its 16s rrna gene sequence genbank accession number mk011867 was searched for in the illumina sequencing dataset then the otu sequence with the highest similarity 99 to the mob 181 rrna gene was used to determine the inoculated strain proportion as previously described 25 2 8 hierarchically clustered heat maps analysis bacterial communities profiles were investigated constructing hierarchically clustered heat maps by means of r statistical software version 3 5 3 r core team 2019 using complexheatmap package from bioconductor 32 these heat maps were constructed based on the most abundant bacterial genera which overall account for 70 of all the sequenced otus 3 results 3 1 optimal mob 181 concentration to inoculate sand filters mob 181 adherence to sterile sand was quantified with ttc an initial mob 181 concentration of 0 75 g l was sufficient to saturate 20 g of filter sand since higher concentrations did not enhance the amount of viable adhered cells detected by the ttc assay fig s1 therefore the concentration of 0 75 g l mob 181 was chosen to perform sand inoculation experiments 3 2 mn removal efficiencies in lab scale sand filters experiments were conducted under summer and winter conditions with lab scale sand filters inside a room with no temperature control temperatures do and ph were daily measured tables 1 and 2 in the influent water temperatures showed a variation of 1 c related to indoor temperatures and the average thermal amplitude were 10 c and 11 c in winter and summer respectively the lowest average temperature was 11 c lower under winter than under summer conditions table 1 do and ph values were consistent with those required for the biological oxidation of mn ii 1 table 2 the performance of the filters was monitored daily measuring total mn concentrations and calculating mn removal efficiencies fig 1 the shortest start up period and the highest initial mn removal capability were observed for inoculated columns operated under summer conditions with over 27 of mn removal efficiency since the first day of system operation p 0 05 a similar efficiency was observed after 15 days for control columns operated under the same conditions p 0 05 inoculated columns operated under winter conditions reached an efficiency of 27 after 20 days of continuous operation p 0 05 in control columns operated under winter conditions 42 days were necessary to reach this 27 removal efficiency p 0 05 fig 1 in inoculated columns operated under summer conditions the optimum mn removal efficiency was reached earlier than in the control columns 23 days and 29 days respectively inoculated columns operated under winter conditions also showed this maximum efficiency faster than controls 39 days and 54 days respectively p 0 05 fig 1 3 3 mn oxides accumulation in sand filters mn oxides accumulation was detected along the columns by the occurrence of dark brown precipitates and under both conditions winter and summer the inoculated sands were darker than the control sands fig 2 a quantifications denoted that mn oxides accumulation in both controls and bioaugmented sands was higher under summer than winter conditions under summer conditions mn oxides accumulation was 2 times higher in control columns and 1 4 in bioaugmented columns than in winter respectively p 0 05 further higher amounts of mn oxides were retained in inoculated columns than in control columns in both experiments fig 2b noticeable inoculated columns operated under winter conditions retained approximately 2 times more oxides than controls p 0 05 whereas the amount of mn oxides accumulates on inoculated column under summer conditions was only a 24 above the quantity of mn oxides present inside the control column p 0 05 fig 2b 3 4 diversity and composition of bacterial communities present in sand filters bacterial communities present in sand filters were characterized using 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing all bacterial rarefaction curves approached the saturation plateau indicating that sequencing depth was adequate and the diversity of the bacterial communities was covered fig s2a and s2c bacterial diversity of control columns was higher under summer conditions shannon diversity index of 7 1 fig s2d than winter shannon diversity index of 6 2 fig s2b the predominant phyla in the control column from winter period compared with summer period were actinobacteria planctomycetes and firmicutes on the other hand bacteroidetes nitrospirae acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia were more abundant in the control from summer than in the control from winter fig 3 table s2 and table s3 in winter bacterial diversity estimated by shannon diversity index from otu data was similar in control and inoculated columns fig s2b proteobacteria bacteroidetes armatimonadetes and verrucomicrobia were more abundant in the inoculated than in control column moreover in the control column actinobacteria and firmicutes were more abundant compared to the inoculated column in addition spirochaetes synergistetes and wwe1 were found only in the control column a similar abundance of planctomycetes was found in both inoculated and control columns fig 3a and table s2 in summer bacterial diversity was lower in the inoculated than in the control columns shannon diversity index of 4 8 and 7 1 respectively fig s2d proteobacteria and actinobacteria were more abundant in the inoculated than in control columns in the control column the phyla verrucomicrobia planctomycetes nitrospirae bacteroidetes and acidobacteria were more abundant compared to the inoculated column fig 3b and table s3 3 5 hierarchically clustered heat map analysis of predominant bacterial genera in the columns in order to search for the presence of known mob genera in the different filters and determine bacterial community profiles variations in the assays hierarchically clustered heat map based on the predominant bacterial genera were built this analysis clearly identified two groups among the samples in the winter experiment control and inoculated columns formed a cluster c1 separated from the experiment conducted under summer conditions c2 indicating that temperature changes were the main responsible for variations in bacterial communities profiles fig 4 moreover three distinctive groups corresponding to bacterial genera found in both periods or present exclusively in winter or summer were found fig 4 bacterial genera that were previously reported in the literature with mn ii oxidation capacity such as pseudomonas 33 34 hyphomonas 35 planctomyces 36 sphingopyxis 25 rhodobacter 37 bacillus 38 hydrogenophaga 39 legionella 25 caulobacter 40 rhodococcus 41 sphingomonas 25 microbacterium 42 corynebacterium 43 acinetobacter 44 and halomonas 45 were found in the columns fig 4 the abundance of most of these bacteria was higher in the control column of the winter period than in the control of summer fig 4 some differences about these putative mob were also observed between inoculated and control columns inoculated column operated under winter conditions was enriched with pseudomonas planctomyces sphingopyxis hydrogenophaga sphingomonas microbacterium and halomonas and other bacterial genera not classified as mob such as limnobacter nevskia and methylibium whereas in the control the putative mob bacterial genera bacillus corynebacterium and acinetobacter were more abundant fig 4 in summer inoculated column was enriched with the putative mob bacterial genera pseudomonas sphingopyxis and sphingomonas and also with limnohabitans terracoccus and exiguobacterium compared to the control in the control column of this period hyphomonas planctomyces rhodobacter and legionella were more abundant compared to the inoculated column fig 4 3 6 representation of mob 181 in control and inoculated columns both in the experiments conducted under winter or summer conditions pseudomonas were increased in inoculated compared with control columns fig 4 in winter out of the total of these pseudomonas otus 0 6 from the control column and 33 5 from the inoculated column corresponded to sequences identical to mob 181 16s rrna gene sequence fig 5 in summer the sequences identical to mob 181 16s rrna gene sequence accounted for 77 8 in the inoculated column which was also higher than in the control column 0 1 fig 5 4 discussion in order to analyze if the mob 181 strain may compensate to some extent the detrimental effects of low winter temperatures on biological mn removal systems performance non bioaugemented and mob 181 bioaugmented sand filters exposed at different temperatures were studied the performance of laboratory scale water purification device used in this work was similar to other systems previously described showing that mn removal efficiencies increased linearly and reach a 95 in a similar time period 6 8 weeks 5 11 as expected mn removal was highly affected by the low temperatures under summer conditions in both control and bioaugmented sand filters mn removal began earlier than under winter conditions p 0 05 moreover the maximal mn removal efficiencies 95 were achieved in a shorter time under summer than winter conditions 25 and 16 days earlier for control and bioaugmented sand filters respectively p 0 05 accordingly the accumulation of mn oxides was higher under summer conditions than under winter conditions control and bioaugmented sands accumulated 2 and 1 4 times more mn oxide respectively in summer than in winter p 0 05 regarding to bacterial diversity in control columns was higher under summer conditions than in winter shannon diversity index of 7 1 in summer and 6 2 in winter these results suggest that higher temperatures favors filter colonization by bacteria with higher capacities for mn ii oxidation and mn oxide retention bacterial genera that were previously reported in the literature with mn ii oxidation capacity were found in control columns both under winter and summer conditions and most of these bacteria were more abundant in winter than in summer however the mob genera planctomyces 36 rhodobacter 37 legionella 25 caulobacter 40 and rhodococcus 41 were more abundant under summer than winter conditions and may account for the higher mn removal in the summer period in addition several bacterial genera whose mn oxidizing activity has not yet been proven were more abundant in summer and also may be the responsible of mn removal future studies about the capacity of these bacteria for mn ii oxidation will confirm their role in this process moreover control columns were enriched with bacteroidetes nitrospirae acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia phyla that have an important role for mn removal in sand filter systems 25 46 47 therefore these bacteria may also be the responsible for the enhanced mn removal observed at higher temperatures although mob present in the groundwater used in this work were able to colonize sand columns and remove mn bioaugmentation with mob 181 increased mn removal both under summer and winter conditions as has been previously demonstrated in other bioaugmentation processes 13 21 24 importantly this work demonstrated that bioaugmentation with mob 181 can counteract the detrimental effect of low temperatures reversing mn removal efficiencies to values similar to those of summer alpha diversity metrics and heat map analyses show that main changes observed in bacterial communities profiles between the filters were due to changes in the temperature and not to the bioaugmentation process the main difference observed regardless of temperature in bioaugmented filters in addition to the increase of pseudomonas due to mob 181 was an enhancement of sphingopyxis sphingomonas and microbacterium genera represented by bacteria members that have been classified as mob 25 48 suggesting that presence of mob 181 favors the adherence to sand filters and growth of several mob in summer the decrease in bacterial diversity in the bioaugmented column shannon diversity index of 4 8 relative to the control column shannon diversity index of 7 1 the differences observed in the bacterial profiles between inoculated and control columns and the evidence of the inoculated strain survival are indicative of the establishment and colonization of the sand filter by mob 181 even if this strain outcompeted various in situ groundwater bacteria its presence favors the acceleration of the start up period of manganese removal similarly in other bioaugmentation strategies with mob decrease in richness and diversity were observed indicating that although the inoculated strains can overcome some in situ bacteria mn removal is improved 49 52 bacterial diversities between columns operated under winter conditions were similar shannon diversity index of 6 2 and mob 181 showed a lower prevalence compared to its presence in the experiment operated under summer conditions suggesting that low temperatures affected mob 181 sand colonization and growth the little changes observed in bacterial diversity after bioaugmentation in the experiment under winter conditions may be due to the fact that in situ groundwater bacteria are more tolerant to cold stress and thus they can survive more than the inoculated strain in spite of the lower survival of mob 181 under winter conditions bioaugmentation improved mn removal process notably at low temperatures and also increased the accumulation of mn oxides within sand filters this may be due to the high capacity of this strain to oxidize mn at lower temperatures 25 pointing out the relevance of using strains that have the ability to oxidize mn ii at different temperatures in bioaugmentation processes 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that a strain with high capacity to oxidize mn ii at different temperatures may improve the detrimental effects of low temperatures in groundwater mn removal process moreover sand filter bacterial communities composition and diversity are mainly influenced by temperature changes lower temperatures decrease bacterial diversity and also affect the survival of the foreign bacteria however the high mn oxidation capacity of the strain mob 181 at low temperatures can reverse mn removal efficiencies to values similar to those of summer conditions these results highlight the importance of isolation and characterization of bacterial strains that can oxidize mn ii in a wide temperature range to improve mn removal processes overall this study contributes with new tools for shortening mn removal start up periods of groundwater treatment plants benefiting a large number of

rpm and resuspended in lb medium at the optimum mob 181 concentration previously determined as described in fig s1 and incubated with sterilized sand 10 ml of culture per 20 g of sand during 7 days at 28 c under static conditions to enable sand adherence these sands were washed four times with groundwater and packed into the columns named as inoculated columns 2 6 quantification of mn oxides accumulated on sand columns after completing the experiments sands were extracted from each column and homogeneously mixed the composite control sands and the composite inoculated sands were analyzed to determine the amounts of mn oxides retained briefly 50 g of these sands were incubated with 50 ml of buffer hepes 10 mm ph 7 5 and vortexed vigorously to remove attached oxides then 500 μl of these supernatants were incubated with 500 μl of leucoberbelin blue lbb dye solution 0 04 w v lbb in 45 mm acetic acid which in the presence of mn oxides is oxidized producing a blue color that may be quantified measuring the absorbance at 618 nm 30 31 absorbance was measured at this wavelength using a synergy 2 reader biotek the quantity of mn oxides was determined using kmno4 calibration curves in a linear range from 0 to 150 μm quantifications were performed in triplicate for control and inoculated columns and mean values and standard deviation sd were presented in the figures data were statistically analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova p 0 05 2 7 analysis of bacterial community profiles and mob 181 persistence in sand filters bacterial communities profiles were analyzed by illumina sequencing at the facility at instituto de agrobiotecnología rosario rosario argentina as previously described 25 total genomic dna were extracted from sand homogenized samples using powermax soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc following manufacturer s instructions the amount of dna was quantified using quant it picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca usa 16s rrna gene libraries were made based on the procedure described in sample preparation guide illumina briefly for library preparation the v3 and v4 region of the 16s rrna gene were amplified by pcr from 12 5 ng of dna using the primers previously described 25 triplicate pcr reactions for each sample 25 μl each were pooled into a single volume 75 μl and purified using the ampure xp beads beckman coulter life sciences indianapolis in united states 25 then index pcrs using the nextera xt index primers were performed and a second purification with ampure xp beads beckman coulter life sciences indianapolis in united states was performed to clean up the final library 25 the library was quantified using quant ittm picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen corporation carlsbad ca united states and denatured with naoh before sequencing on illumina miseq platform illumina inc 25 sequence data pre processing classification and the taxonomic assignment of operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity threshold were also done as previously described 25 illumina sequences were deposited in the sra database which is available at ncbi with sra accession prjna548803 to calculate the mob 181 proportion in the bacterial communities present in control and inoculated sand filters the v4 region of its 16s rrna gene sequence genbank accession number mk011867 was searched for in the illumina sequencing dataset then the otu sequence with the highest similarity 99 to the mob 181 rrna gene was used to determine the inoculated strain proportion as previously described 25 2 8 hierarchically clustered heat maps analysis bacterial communities profiles were investigated constructing hierarchically clustered heat maps by means of r statistical software version 3 5 3 r core team 2019 using complexheatmap package from bioconductor 32 these heat maps were constructed based on the most abundant bacterial genera which overall account for 70 of all the sequenced otus 3 results 3 1 optimal mob 181 concentration to inoculate sand filters mob 181 adherence to sterile sand was quantified with ttc an initial mob 181 concentration of 0 75 g l was sufficient to saturate 20 g of filter sand since higher concentrations did not enhance the amount of viable adhered cells detected by the ttc assay fig s1 therefore the concentration of 0 75 g l mob 181 was chosen to perform sand inoculation experiments 3 2 mn removal efficiencies in lab scale sand filters experiments were conducted under summer and winter conditions with lab scale sand filters inside a room with no temperature control temperatures do and ph were daily measured tables 1 and 2 in the influent water temperatures showed a variation of 1 c related to indoor temperatures and the average thermal amplitude were 10 c and 11 c in winter and summer respectively the lowest average temperature was 11 c lower under winter than under summer conditions table 1 do and ph values were consistent with those required for the biological oxidation of mn ii 1 table 2 the performance of the filters was monitored daily measuring total mn concentrations and calculating mn removal efficiencies fig 1 the shortest start up period and the highest initial mn removal capability were observed for inoculated columns operated under summer conditions with over 27 of mn removal efficiency since the first day of system operation p 0 05 a similar efficiency was observed after 15 days for control columns operated under the same conditions p 0 05 inoculated columns operated under winter conditions reached an efficiency of 27 after 20 days of continuous operation p 0 05 in control columns operated under winter conditions 42 days were necessary to reach this 27 removal efficiency p 0 05 fig 1 in inoculated columns operated under summer conditions the optimum mn removal efficiency was reached earlier than in the control columns 23 days and 29 days respectively inoculated columns operated under winter conditions also showed this maximum efficiency faster than controls 39 days and 54 days respectively p 0 05 fig 1 3 3 mn oxides accumulation in sand filters mn oxides accumulation was detected along the columns by the occurrence of dark brown precipitates and under both conditions winter and summer the inoculated sands were darker than the control sands fig 2 a quantifications denoted that mn oxides accumulation in both controls and bioaugmented sands was higher under summer than winter conditions under summer conditions mn oxides accumulation was 2 times higher in control columns and 1 4 in bioaugmented columns than in winter respectively p 0 05 further higher amounts of mn oxides were retained in inoculated columns than in control columns in both experiments fig 2b noticeable inoculated columns operated under winter conditions retained approximately 2 times more oxides than controls p 0 05 whereas the amount of mn oxides accumulates on inoculated column under summer conditions was only a 24 above the quantity of mn oxides present inside the control column p 0 05 fig 2b 3 4 diversity and composition of bacterial communities present in sand filters bacterial communities present in sand filters were characterized using 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing all bacterial rarefaction curves approached the saturation plateau indicating that sequencing depth was adequate and the diversity of the bacterial communities was covered fig s2a and s2c bacterial diversity of control columns was higher under summer conditions shannon diversity index of 7 1 fig s2d than winter shannon diversity index of 6 2 fig s2b the predominant phyla in the control column from winter period compared with summer period were actinobacteria planctomycetes and firmicutes on the other hand bacteroidetes nitrospirae acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia were more abundant in the control from summer than in the control from winter fig 3 table s2 and table s3 in winter bacterial diversity estimated by shannon diversity index from otu data was similar in control and inoculated columns fig s2b proteobacteria bacteroidetes armatimonadetes and verrucomicrobia were more abundant in the inoculated than in control column moreover in the control column actinobacteria and firmicutes were more abundant compared to the inoculated column in addition spirochaetes synergistetes and wwe1 were found only in the control column a similar abundance of planctomycetes was found in both inoculated and control columns fig 3a and table s2 in summer bacterial diversity was lower in the inoculated than in the control columns shannon diversity index of 4 8 and 7 1 respectively fig s2d proteobacteria and actinobacteria were more abundant in the inoculated than in control columns in the control column the phyla verrucomicrobia planctomycetes nitrospirae bacteroidetes and acidobacteria were more abundant compared to the inoculated column fig 3b and table s3 3 5 hierarchically clustered heat map analysis of predominant bacterial genera in the columns in order to search for the presence of known mob genera in the different filters and determine bacterial community profiles variations in the assays hierarchically clustered heat map based on the predominant bacterial genera were built this analysis clearly identified two groups among the samples in the winter experiment control and inoculated columns formed a cluster c1 separated from the experiment conducted under summer conditions c2 indicating that temperature changes were the main responsible for variations in bacterial communities profiles fig 4 moreover three distinctive groups corresponding to bacterial genera found in both periods or present exclusively in winter or summer were found fig 4 bacterial genera that were previously reported in the literature with mn ii oxidation capacity such as pseudomonas 33 34 hyphomonas 35 planctomyces 36 sphingopyxis 25 rhodobacter 37 bacillus 38 hydrogenophaga 39 legionella 25 caulobacter 40 rhodococcus 41 sphingomonas 25 microbacterium 42 corynebacterium 43 acinetobacter 44 and halomonas 45 were found in the columns fig 4 the abundance of most of these bacteria was higher in the control column of the winter period than in the control of summer fig 4 some differences about these putative mob were also observed between inoculated and control columns inoculated column operated under winter conditions was enriched with pseudomonas planctomyces sphingopyxis hydrogenophaga sphingomonas microbacterium and halomonas and other bacterial genera not classified as mob such as limnobacter nevskia and methylibium whereas in the control the putative mob bacterial genera bacillus corynebacterium and acinetobacter were more abundant fig 4 in summer inoculated column was enriched with the putative mob bacterial genera pseudomonas sphingopyxis and sphingomonas and also with limnohabitans terracoccus and exiguobacterium compared to the control in the control column of this period hyphomonas planctomyces rhodobacter and legionella were more abundant compared to the inoculated column fig 4 3 6 representation of mob 181 in control and inoculated columns both in the experiments conducted under winter or summer conditions pseudomonas were increased in inoculated compared with control columns fig 4 in winter out of the total of these pseudomonas otus 0 6 from the control column and 33 5 from the inoculated column corresponded to sequences identical to mob 181 16s rrna gene sequence fig 5 in summer the sequences identical to mob 181 16s rrna gene sequence accounted for 77 8 in the inoculated column which was also higher than in the control column 0 1 fig 5 4 discussion in order to analyze if the mob 181 strain may compensate to some extent the detrimental effects of low winter temperatures on biological mn removal systems performance non bioaugemented and mob 181 bioaugmented sand filters exposed at different temperatures were studied the performance of laboratory scale water purification device used in this work was similar to other systems previously described showing that mn removal efficiencies increased linearly and reach a 95 in a similar time period 6 8 weeks 5 11 as expected mn removal was highly affected by the low temperatures under summer conditions in both control and bioaugmented sand filters mn removal began earlier than under winter conditions p 0 05 moreover the maximal mn removal efficiencies 95 were achieved in a shorter time under summer than winter conditions 25 and 16 days earlier for control and bioaugmented sand filters respectively p 0 05 accordingly the accumulation of mn oxides was higher under summer conditions than under winter conditions control and bioaugmented sands accumulated 2 and 1 4 times more mn oxide respectively in summer than in winter p 0 05 regarding to bacterial diversity in control columns was higher under summer conditions than in winter shannon diversity index of 7 1 in summer and 6 2 in winter these results suggest that higher temperatures favors filter colonization by bacteria with higher capacities for mn ii oxidation and mn oxide retention bacterial genera that were previously reported in the literature with mn ii oxidation capacity were found in control columns both under winter and summer conditions and most of these bacteria were more abundant in winter than in summer however the mob genera planctomyces 36 rhodobacter 37 legionella 25 caulobacter 40 and rhodococcus 41 were more abundant under summer than winter conditions and may account for the higher mn removal in the summer period in addition several bacterial genera whose mn oxidizing activity has not yet been proven were more abundant in summer and also may be the responsible of mn removal future studies about the capacity of these bacteria for mn ii oxidation will confirm their role in this process moreover control columns were enriched with bacteroidetes nitrospirae acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia phyla that have an important role for mn removal in sand filter systems 25 46 47 therefore these bacteria may also be the responsible for the enhanced mn removal observed at higher temperatures although mob present in the groundwater used in this work were able to colonize sand columns and remove mn bioaugmentation with mob 181 increased mn removal both under summer and winter conditions as has been previously demonstrated in other bioaugmentation processes 13 21 24 importantly this work demonstrated that bioaugmentation with mob 181 can counteract the detrimental effect of low temperatures reversing mn removal efficiencies to values similar to those of summer alpha diversity metrics and heat map analyses show that main changes observed in bacterial communities profiles between the filters were due to changes in the temperature and not to the bioaugmentation process the main difference observed regardless of temperature in bioaugmented filters in addition to the increase of pseudomonas due to mob 181 was an enhancement of sphingopyxis sphingomonas and microbacterium genera represented by bacteria members that have been classified as mob 25 48 suggesting that presence of mob 181 favors the adherence to sand filters and growth of several mob in summer the decrease in bacterial diversity in the bioaugmented column shannon diversity index of 4 8 relative to the control column shannon diversity index of 7 1 the differences observed in the bacterial profiles between inoculated and control columns and the evidence of the inoculated strain survival are indicative of the establishment and colonization of the sand filter by mob 181 even if this strain outcompeted various in situ groundwater bacteria its presence favors the acceleration of the start up period of manganese removal similarly in other bioaugmentation strategies with mob decrease in richness and diversity were observed indicating that although the inoculated strains can overcome some in situ bacteria mn removal is improved 49 52 bacterial diversities between columns operated under winter conditions were similar shannon diversity index of 6 2 and mob 181 showed a lower prevalence compared to its presence in the experiment operated under summer conditions suggesting that low temperatures affected mob 181 sand colonization and growth the little changes observed in bacterial diversity after bioaugmentation in the experiment under winter conditions may be due to the fact that in situ groundwater bacteria are more tolerant to cold stress and thus they can survive more than the inoculated strain in spite of the lower survival of mob 181 under winter conditions bioaugmentation improved mn removal process notably at low temperatures and also increased the accumulation of mn oxides within sand filters this may be due to the high capacity of this strain to oxidize mn at lower temperatures 25 pointing out the relevance of using strains that have the ability to oxidize mn ii at different temperatures in bioaugmentation processes 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that a strain with high capacity to oxidize mn ii at different temperatures may improve the detrimental effects of low temperatures in groundwater mn removal process moreover sand filter bacterial communities composition and diversity are mainly influenced by temperature changes lower temperatures decrease bacterial diversity and also affect the survival of the foreign bacteria however the high mn oxidation capacity of the strain mob 181 at low temperatures can reverse mn removal efficiencies to values similar to those of summer conditions these results highlight the importance of isolation and characterization of bacterial strains that can oxidize mn ii in a wide temperature range to improve mn removal processes overall this study contributes with new tools for shortening mn removal start up periods of groundwater treatment plants benefiting a large number of

13962,phenol is one of the most common and poisonous water pollutants treating phenol containing wastewater has been a challenge in recent years mgo activated carbon ac composites were prepared by the equal volume impregnation method for catalytic ozonation of phenol in water mgo ac composites were characterized by icp ir xrd sem tem bet and xps analysis mgo incorporated in the form of nano crystal particles on the surface of ac prepared mgo ac shows good catalytic performance for the removal of phenol and cod catalyst loading ph and initial concentration of phenol solution on catalytic ozonation performance were studied the catalytic performance of ac was significantly improved by the modification with a few amount of mgo the results showed mgo provides additional active sites for the generation of hydroxyl radicals which is favorable for degradation of organic contaminants the intermediate products were determined and the possible degradation pathway was put forward mgo ac shows a promising way to prepare efficient catalysts for the catalytic ozonation of organic polluted water keywords catalytic ozonation mgo ac hydroxyl radical phenol cod removal 1 introduction phenol and its derivatives are an important type of aromatic chemicals which are commonly used in the production of phenolic resin adipic acid aniline and salicylic acid 1 however the emission of phenol does not meet the emission standard which poses a threat to human health they are also one of the common environment contaminants which are frequently found in the industrial effluent and surface water it s necessary to find a way to eliminate phenol in the water conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as biologically methods photocatalytic oxidation electrocatalytic oxidation are inadequate to efficiently mineralize these highly toxic compounds due to their high toxicity non biodegradability and unstability 2 4 photocatalysis usually takes a long time because light produces electrons and holes that can easily be combined 5 7 electrocatalytic oxidation has the disadvantages of high energy consumption cost and incomplete decomposition of organic matter 8 therefore finding an efficient way to remove phenol from wastewater and industrial effluent is great significance for the environmental protection in recent years catalytic ozonation technology has been widely used in wastewater treatment it has high oxidation capacity and can generate strong oxidizing agent hydroxyl radical however separate ozone oxidation shows relatively low rate reaction and incomplete mineralization which may lead to toxic intermediates products 9 adding catalyst can facilitate the production of hydroxyl radicals which can mineralize almost all organic pollutants to avoid this problem 10 some metal ions have been used as the homogenous catalysts for the catalytic ozonation such as fe3 mn2 ni2 11 13 however these homogeneous catalysts are hard to be recovered hence the heterogeneous catalysts such as fe3o4 sio2 ceo2 14 mno2 co3o4 ac have been developed to solve this problem 15 16 among these catalysts activated carbon ac supported metal oxides are widely used in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation mgo has good adsorption capacity and abundant lewis acid and base sites 17 moreover the activity of mgo is related to the low coordination on the surface and the high concentration of structural defects 18 20 the zero charge point of mgo is about 12 which is a suitable adsorbent for anion adsorption it has been reported that mgo has obvious catalytic activity in the treatment of organic wastewater 21 moussavi et al investigated the removal of phenol from salt containing wastewater using mgo nanocrystal powder in catalytic advanced oxidation process 22 their results indicated that 96 of the phenol and 70 of the chemical oxygen demand cod were removed in the catalytic ozonation process under optimum experimental conditions of ph 7 with 4 g l catalyst after 80 min although phenol and its derivatives were degraded in high conversion the cod removal efficiency was not high enough zhu et al 23 have studied the efficiency pathways and mechanisms of quinoline degradation using nano mgo as catalysts which led to 90 8 degradation of quinoline at 295 k however the recovery of powder catalyst still needs to be further solved in order to obtain higher removal efficiency mgo can be loaded on porous support activated carbon ac is one of the most used porous materials in catalytic ozonation process dai et al 14 compared the removal rate of organic matter treated by ac and ce ac in catalytic ozonation technique it has been shown that ac alone is not active enough to degrade phenol and its derivatives efficiently furthermore moussavi et al 24 reported that 98 and 74 5 of the catechol and cod were degraded over mgo ac composite in 60 min they used 10 g l of mgo as catalyst in the process which is relatively high amount of catalyst and consequently leads to increase in the cost of the process rezaei et al 25 also investigated the removal of toluene by catalytic ozonation using mgo ac under the same experimental conditions they found that 90 of toluene can be removed by mgo ac while only 20 of toluene was degraded by ac alone the results showed that the addition of mgo on ac can significantly improve the catalytic performance for vocs catalytic combustion these results show that mgo ac is a promising catalyst in wastewater treatment and waste gas treatment experiments in this work a simple way to prepare high surface and high efficient catalysts for catalytic ozonation of phenol in water is described the advantages of mgo and ac were combined to design efficient catalysts for the catalytic ozonation treatment of organic polluted water low mgo loading was used to make it play a good experimental effect in catalytic ozonation process it provided a promising direction for the industrialization of the catalyst due to its low cost and high catalytic activity the catalyst properties were well characterized and the operating conditions of the catalytic advanced oxidation were optimized the reaction mechanism of the catalyst and the possible degradation pathway in the reaction were studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents activated carbon ac was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co china magnesium nitrate mg no3 2 6h2o sodium hydroxide naoh 0 5 m tert butyl alcohol tba sulfuric acid h2so4 0 5 m manganese sulfate mnso4 phenol potassium acid phthalate c8h5ko4 potassium iodide ki and sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 5h2o were obtained from tianjin yongda chemical reagent co china potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 was purchased from tianjin damao chemical reagent factory china silver sulfate ag2so4 was obtained from tianjin chemical technology development co china ltd ar tianjin yongda chemical reagent co ltd ar deionized water was used to prepare all solution all the reagents were used without further purification 2 2 preparation and characterization of catalyst mgo ac was prepared by equal volume impregnation method firstly in oeder to remove the ash on the surface ac was washed until the washing solution become colorless then the washed ac was dried in the oven at 120 c for 12 h ac 10 g was added into 36 5 ml impregnation solution 1 mg no3 2 and the mixture was ultrasonic immersed for 2 h the impregnated catalyst was dried at 120 c for 5 h in a constant temperature then it was calcined in a tube furnace to convert mg no3 2 to mgo on the surface of ac the catalyst was heated up to 600 c 5 c min for 6 h under a nitrogen 0 1 l min and cooled down to the room temperature the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the catalyst were evaluated by brunauer emmett teller bet and barret joyner halenda bjh methods on a quantachrome nova2000 analyzer respectively the crystalline phase was detected on a d max 2500 x ray diffractometer xrd japan cu kα radiation 60kv 300 ma the chemical states of the catalyst were determined by x ray potoelectron spectroscopy xps with a kratos axis ultra dld spectrometer using a monochromated al kαradiation the scanning electron microscopy sem was carried out on s 4800 i scanning electron microscopy unit with 3 kv voltages and 10 ma of beam current to observe the surface morphology the transmission electron microscope tem was utilized to observe internal structure of the catalyst using lanthanum hexaboride filament as electron emission source to observe the internal structure japan jeol jem 2100 80 200kv inductively coupled plasma icp emission spectrometer was carried out on a thermo icap6300 analyzer to analyze the elements composition of catalysts the content of hydroxyl radicals were analyzed with a fluorescence spectrophotometer f97pro lengguang shanghai the intermediates were detected by mass spectrometry ms america advion plate express 100 24vac 75 w 2 3 catalytic ozonation the experiments were carried out in a three neck reactor 500 ml which was operated in a semi batch mode at 30 c ozone was generated by an ozone generator and then continuously introduced into the solution the concentration of ozone at import and export of reactor were measured by the iodine method according to the cj t3028 2 1994 standard the flow rated of mixed gas was 1 5 l min and the excess ozone was passed into gas absorption bottle containing ki solution 2 wt 24 the solution in the reactor was mixed by a magnetic stirrer agitated the synthesized mgo ac was used as the catalyst to mineralize phenol by the catalytic ozonation process initially the 300 ml of phenol solution with concentration of 210 mg l was placed in the reactor samples were taken every ten minutes and subsequently were filtered with the 0 22 μm microfilter 26 after each reaction the catalyst was washed alternately with ethanol or water and then the mixture was calcined for regeneration 2 4 analytical method the solution ph was measured by a ph meter phs 3c leici china which was calibrated by standard solution the maximum absorption wavelength of phenol at 270 nm was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer persee tu 1900 and the standard curve of phenol was made to calculate the concentration of phenol in order to measure the amount of adsorbed phenol and its intermediates on the surface of the catalyst 30 ml naoh 0 5 m solution was used to soak the adsorbed substances from used dry catalyst for 1 h the soaking solution ph was adjusted to 7 using h2so4 the residual ozone in the samples was stripped using air before analysis the terephthalic acid ta is used to examine hydroxyl radical ta can react with hydroxyl radicals not o3 to form 2 hydroxytephthalic acid hta which has a bright stable fluorescence when the excitation wavelength is set at 315 nm and the emission is measured at 425 nm 47 the cod of the solution can be an index of organic contaminants concentration which shows the removal efficiency in catalytic advanced oxidation therefore digestion and determination of samples were carried out according to standard method by cod digestion instrument and cod analyzer leici cod 571 5 26 27 the rate of phenol degradation was calculated as following 1 d e g r a d a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct were the phenol concentrations before and after the reaction respectively the degree of phenol mineralization in the selected process was measured based on the initial cod cod0 and the cod of the solution after the reaction codt 2 c o d r e m o v e e f f i c i e n c y c o d 0 c o d t c o d 0 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization 3 1 1 x ray diffraction xrd xrd was utilized to characterize the crystal phase of pure activated carbon and mgo ac as illustrated in fig 1 xrd spectra of ac show a broad peak at 27 34 which can be corresponded to 002 lattice plane and a small diffraction peak around 42 58 which can be assigned to 100 lattice plane of activated carbon 28 compared to the pure ac a sharp diffraction peak emerged at 42 72 on the patterns of the mgo ac composites which can be corresponded to mgo 200 facet figure s1 in addition to this sharp peak diffraction peaks at 2θ 38 62 42 68 63 18 78 6 are present for mgo content catalyst particularly for 10 of mgo can be corresponded to the 111 200 220 and 222 crystal facet of mgo therefore the results indicate that mgo was successfully loaded on ac as can be seen from the diagram with the increase of load concentration the peak intensity becomes more and more obvious which is due to the increasing of mgo crystal size in addition no other impurities crystallite peaks have been found for all samples 3 1 2 scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem analysis the morphology of the catalyst which was characterized by sem is demonstrated in fig 2 a it can be seen from fig 2 a that ac exhibits the initial morphology of coconut shell and its surface was full of worm like pores these pores may have positive effect on the adsorption of phenol its derivatives and o3 after the loading of mgo some nano particles emerged on the surface of ac these particles increased by increasing the mgo loading figure s2 the internal structure of the 10 mgo ac which was characterized by sem is showed in figs 2 b and s3 it can be seen in this figure that some disorder pores appear in the ac structure while the particles on the surface of ac have crystal structure the lattice spacing of the loaded oxide is 0 218 nm which suggests these oxides are mgo it is important to note that magnesium particles are mainly on the surface of the ac since the pore size of the ac is too small and the particles of the magnesium nitrate that produce the oxide after the calcination are relatively large 3 1 3 nitrogen isothermal adsorption and desorption the porous nature of the ac and mgo ac were investigated by nitrogen adsorption desorption measurements as illustrated in fig 3 both samples show type of iv isotherms with hysteresis loops which can be attributed to the mesoporous structure of ac 29 the corresponding bet surface area pore size and pore volume of ac with different ratio of mgo loading are summarized in table s1 as can be seen in table s1 the ac modified by mgo showed no significant differences in the pore size and volume as well as bet surface area of catalysts with different mgo content the surface area average pore diameter and pore volume of ac were about 1207 6 m2 g 2 34 nm and 0 219 cm3 g respectively after the loading of 0 5 of mgo on ac the surface area average pore diameter showed no obvious changing when mgo loading amount increased to 5 surface area decreased to 994 m2 g n2 physical adsorptive and desorption isotherms of catalysts suggests that the pore structure of ac only changed a little after the loading of mgo 3 1 4 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy it is important to note that oxygen containing functional groups are one of most crucial active sites for the catalytic advanced oxidation process ftir analysis was used to detect these functional groups on the surface of catalysts ftir spectra of ac mgo ac and used mgo ac are shown in fig 4 as depicted in fig 4 the stretching vibration of functional groups on ac surface mainly appear at 2351 1533 and 1045 cm 1 which are corresponded to vs c h vs cooh vs oh respectively 30 the presence of vs cooh at 1533 cm 1 indicates that the surface of ac was acidic after the modification of ac with mgo new peaks were appeared at 3673 2987 and 1393 cm 1 which can be assigned to vs oh vs c h and vs o c respectively 30 the peak at 1393 cm 1 suggests that the surface of ac became alkaline after the modification it is also clear that the stretching vibration at 1045 cm 1 shifted to 1065 cm 1 and became stronger indicating the enhancement of hydroxyl groups after the loading of mgo on ac hence adding mgo on ac increased the number of oxygen containing species and increased the intensity of previous peaks on ac these groups might be favorable for the catalytic ozonation of organic pollutants to better understand the behavior of the mgo ac catalyst the used catalyst was also examined four main peaks at 977 725 and 645 534 cm 1 were appeared on the surface of mgo ac which can be corresponded to vs h c c h vs c h and aromatic rings respectively this may be due to that aromatic and open ring organic compounds were adsorbed on the surface of catalyst while the oxygen containing functional groups were disappeared after the reaction it demonstrates that these oxygen containing groups may be covered by adsorbed organic compounds or consumed during the catalytic advanced oxidation reaction 3 1 5 xps analysis xps was used to further confirm the surface chemistry of the catalyst and the surface species of c mg and o on ac and 1 mgo ac fig 5 provides the xps spectra of the pure ac and 1 mgo ac by loading mgo on ac two kinds of mg species were detected by xps the peak of 1304 ev can be corresponded to mg species in mgo 31 32 and the peak of 1305 ev can be assigned to mg2 which combined with the functional groups on ac 33 indicating that mgo was successfully loaded on ac in addition the c 1s binding energy spectra could be recounted into four regions carbon atoms with two or three oxygen atoms such as lactone carboxylic acid carboxylic anhydride quinine and ketone 287 7ev carbon atoms with one oxygen atoms such as ether phenol or lactone 286 ev co bond 286 4 ev and cc in basal plane of sp2 carbon exposing the hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms 284 8 ev after mgo being loaded on ac the carbon binding energy and the ratio of different carbon species were changed table s3 the binding energy of carbon species bonded with oxygen increased due to the loading of mgo which was positive charge the ratio of co also increased suggesting that the surface oh amount increased which was positive for the generation of hydroxyl radicals the oxygen species with binding energy of 531 6 533 3 ev and 536 5 ev can be originated from different oxygen species namely oh c o or c o on ac respectively 34 36 the oxygen species with binding energy of 534 3 ev can be assigned to oxygen in c o on ac the ratio of oxygen species binding energy of 533 3 ev decreased and ratio of oxygen species binding energy of 536 5 ev increased after the loading of mgo due to the addition of mg species with positive charge 37 38 the presence of functional group o c had a positive effect on the reaction of organic matter adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst with ozone and the active sites of the catalyst in aqueous solution 39 40 3 2 catalytic ozonation in order to verify the prepared catalyst performance in catalytic ozonation of phenolic wastewater a series of experiments has performed the synergistic effect of mgo ac was verified and calculated the import concentration of ozone is 43 mg l in both systems the export concentration was 24 5 mg l and 10 8 mg l in mgo and mgo ac systems respectively the utilization rate of ozone in mgo ac system is 1 75 times higher than that in mgo system the results show that more ozone was decomposed in mgo ac system mgo ac composites with different mgo content namely 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 were evaluated by phenol degradation in catalytic ozonation process the cod removal of water in the presence of these catalysts is shown in figure s5 in order to demonstrate the activity of the catalyst a series of experiments with or without different catalysts have been tested for the phenolic wastewater treatment it can be seen from fig 6 that the cod removal with single ozonation only reached to 21 3 almost 71 5 of cod was removed by the adsorption of phenol on the ac in 80 min as shown in figure s5 however it showed slower removal rate than the catalytic ozonation which reached to 72 cod removal only in 30 min the catalytic ozonation performed over mgo led to 65 cod removal it is clear that the cod removal increased significantly over mgo ac as shown in figure s5 in fact the ac catalyst modified by mgo gives the best performance overall 83 5 cod removal compared to ac and mgo individually due to the synergy effect between ac and mgo in the modified catalyst the results also showed that cod removal in the presence of ac and mgo ac firstly decreased significantly from 520 mg l to 200 mg l in 10 min and then decreased gradually as the reaction time increased from 10 min to 120 min the first region is mainly due to the adsorption of phenol on the surface of catalyst as well as the catalytic ozonation of phenol the reason for the second stage may be that the reaction rates are mass transfer control due to the sharply decreased of phenol concentration at first stage the details of the reaction dynamic and mechanism would be discussed in the following sections to confirm the increase of cod removal mainly related to catalytic ozonation rather than the adsorption the adsorption amount of phenol during reaction was measured the cod of initial soaking solution was 520 mg l it can be seen from the fig 6 if mgo ac adsorbed only cod can reach 441 mg l after 120 min the cod of solution removal rate can reach 15 1 however the cod of solution decreased 83 5 after 120 min in catalytic ozonation reaction over mgo ac it indicates that more than 60 of cod was removed by catalytic ozonation over mgo ac sem bet and bjt analysis showed no apparent changes in structure morphology surface area and pore size distribution of the ac after modification by mgo therefore the physical parameters do not contribute to the better performance of mgo ac than ac in catalytic ozonation when mgo was loaded on ac the presence of functional group o c had a positive effect on the reaction of organic matter adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst with ozone because aromatic rings and surface carbonyl groups can form electron donor receptor complexes 39 40 xps showed that after mgo was loaded on ac the lattice oxygen decreased the oxygen vacancy increased and the oxygen containing groups on ac increased which may be the reason for the increase of cod removal rate in order to verify the synergistic effect of mgo ac in the reaction the calculation was carried out as synergistic influence cod removed in cop sum of cod removed in sop and adsorbed onto the catalyst 22 as can be seen from fig 6 the combination of synthesized mgo ac and ozone has a significant synergistic effect on phenol removal 61 5 from 30 min reaction time with the increase of reaction time the synergistic effect of mgo ac and ozone reached 61 5 at 30 min and then decreased slowly it may be due to the production of short chain hydrocarbons gradually increasing with the progress of the reaction at the later stage of the reaction and the direct aggression of ozone also played a certain role 3 3 the mechanism and kinetics of catalytic ozonation over mgo ac 3 3 1 effect of solution ph the ph evolution in the process is important in catalytic ozonation of phenol the solution ph influences the surface properties of catalysts and generation of active radicals eq 3 4 22 41 3 m o h h m o h 2 p h ph z c 4 m o h o h m o h 2 o p h ph z c the initial ph of phenol solution used in these experiments was 5 51 the mgo ac has strong alkaline phzc of around 10 11 when the mgo ac catalyst is added the ph of the solution can reach about 9 and the cod removal ratio was 83 5 fig 7 by decreasing the solution ph to 4 05 using h2so4 the cod removal of phenol and its derivatives decreased to 79 it is well known that the degradation of phenol at low ph is mainly carried out by direct oxidation of ozone 14 the oxidation ability of o3 is lower than oh with the decrease of ph more and more substances are produced to inhibit the ozone reaction the ratio of phenol oxidized by o3 increased and cod removal ratio decreased when the solution ph was adjusted to 8 by naoh solution the cod removal ratio increased to 86 6 the reason may be that under alkaline conditions the solubility of ozone in the solution was increased and more hydroxyl radicals were generated by the interaction with the active site and the solution of the catalyst hydroxyl radicals have strong oxidation properties against a variety of unsaturated bonds short chain substances and small molecules 42 however further increase in solution ph to 10 and 12 leads to the reduction of cod removal to 75 6 and 67 1 respectively with the increases in solution ph oh concentration can increase and quenching reactions between hydroxyl radicals become stronger which can hinder the further increase in oh concentration 38 on the other hand more co2 can be generated by increasing in the solution ph from the decomposition of phenol and its intermediates these generated co2 molecules can react with oh and produce co3 2 and hco3 in the solution oh can also be consumed by co3 2 and hco3 which can decrease the oh concentration 22 it is worth mentioning that prepared mgo ac can mitigate the experimental ph because some organic acids produced during the treatment of phenol by catalytic ozonation lead the decrease of ph it is also the reason why the mgo ac can achieve high removal effect under the action of the catalyst 23 the strong alkalescent condition would change the mg species and oxygen containing species on the surface of catalysts which results in the reduction of catalytic activity 3 3 2 the kinetics of the catalytic ozonation to find out the kinetic of this reaction the catalytic performance of mgo ac in different phenol solution was detected and the results are shown in fig 8 it showed that the initial concentration of phenol is negatively correlated with the reaction rate constant by increasing the initial concentration of phenol and its related intermediate products the amount of the ozone or hydroxyl radicals obtained per corresponding pollutant concentration unit would decrease moreover some intermediate products such as co3 2 hco3 would capture the hydroxyl radical which leads to the decrease of k value 44 45 according to the results of different phenol concentrations the kinetics of this process with different phenol concentrations was fitted the fitting results were shown in table 1 the results show that the catalytic ozonation of phenol over mgo ac accords with the first order kinetic law it can be seen from table 1 that with the increase in initial concentration of phenol the reaction rate constant increased from 0 6370 at 100 mg l to 0 7874 min 1 at 210 mg l and then decreased gradually to 0 4760 min 1 at 700 mg l it shows that the initial concentration of phenol is negatively correlated with the reaction rate constant 3 4 reaction mechanism 3 4 1 effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers in order to determine whether hydroxyl free radicals or ozone play a major role in that course of the experiment tba was used as radical scavenger to suppress the generated hydroxyl radicals which can react with oh at a high reaction rate constant of 6 108 m 1 s 1 and react with o3 only at 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 46 the cod removal ratio reached 64 4 in 10 min and 83 5 in 120 min without tba while the cod removal ratio reached 7 in 10 min and 26 16 in 120 min with tba which were much lower than the one without tba the main reason is that the existing tba consumes the formed hydroxyl radical and part of ozone to reduce the removal rate of cod it also obeys the catalytic mechanism hence the results indicate that the hydroxyl radicals were main oxidants in this process fig 9 3 4 2 effect of sulfate to find out if mg species were the active sites in catalytic ozonation mnso4 was added into the reaction system which can combine with lewis acid sites provided by mg species 23 as can be seen in fig 10 the cod removal ratio reached 64 4 in 10 min and 83 5 in 120 min without mnso4 while the cod removal ratio reached 35 in 10 min and 54 in 120 min with mnso4 which was much lower than the one without mnso4 the results suggest that although ac can provide some active sites for the generation of hydroxyl radicals the catalytic activity decreased obviously after the suppression of mg species by mnso4 the results showed that mgo on ac provides the additional active sites for the reaction 3 4 3 qualitative analysis of hydroxyl radical hydroxyl radical plays a key role in the reaction it can be seen from fig 11 that the maximum fluorescence intensity was gotten in the mgo ac system which indicates the most amount of hydroxyl radicals was generated among these four systems the content of hydroxyl radical produced by mgo ac system is about twice as much as that produced by mgo system alone it is also related to the surface characteristics of the catalyst loading mgo on activated carbon does have synergistic effect on the reaction there are few hydroxyl radicals produced in the process of ozone oxidation alone because ozone does not react with ta 47 in the mgo ac system with 1 g l of tba the fluorescence intensity is lower than that of the mgo ac system without tba which is due to suppress of the hydroxyl radical by tba the result also indirectly but accurately proves the formation of hydroxyl radicals in this process 3 4 4 possible mechanisms of phenol degradation the mechanisms of phenol degradation are suggested based on the experimental results and the previous studies 22 23 44 49 52 there are two main mechanisms for the phenol degradation by catalytic ozonation one is the reactions between phenol and hydroxyl radicals generated from the reaction between o3 and h2o 48 this reaction is quite fast due to the strong oxidability of hydroxyl radicals this reaction has two pathways for the phenol degradation which are shown in eq 5 9 11 12 the first pathway takes place on the surface of catalysts eq 5 8 it is indirect reaction in eq 5 and eq 6 o3 attacks the lewis acid site of mg species and generates o and o2 on the surface mg species the surface o further reacts with h2o and o3 to produce oh on the mg species surface eq 7 phenol reacts with the surface oh and produces intermediates co2 and h2o the intermediates are degraded by the surface oh to co2 and h2o the secondary pathway takes place in the solution the phenol reacts with oh in the solution to produce intermediates and co2 h2o the intermediates are further degraded by oh to co2 and h2o eq 7 the other kind mechanism is the direct reactions between ozone molecules and phenol or its intermediates generally aldehydes or carboxylic acids are produced after the reaction between ozone and phenol these two types of substances would not react with ozone which is also a disadvantage of ozone catalytic oxidation the presence of aldehydes or carboxylic acids could not be completely mineralized by o3 moreover the results showed that degradation of phenol by o3 is relatively slow fig 6 49 the results of experiments with tba suggest that this reaction is the minor reaction indirect and direct reactions can occur on the surface of the catalyst as well as in the solution eq 9 10 13 o3 is firstly absorbed on surface of mg species the absorbed o3 reacts with phenol to produce intermediates and eventually co2 h2o the intermediates are degraded by absorbed o3 to co2 and h2o eq 9 10 phenol also can react with o3 dissolved in the solution to produce intermediates co2 and h2o the intermediates are degraded by dissolved o3 to co2 and h2o eq 13 detailed proposed mechanisms in this study were revealed in fig 11 indirect reaction a on the surface of catalyst 5 a c m g o s o 3 a c m g o s o o o 6 a c m g o s o o o a c m g o s o o 2 7 a c m g o s o 2 h 2 o o 3 a c m g o s o h 3 o h o 2 8

e s o 3 c o 2 h 2 o 3 4 5 the possible reaction pathway the intermediates of the phenol degradation were determined by ms figure s7 fig 12 shows the probable pathway of phenol degradation in the catalytic ozonation process over mgo ac firstly electrophilic hydroxyl radicals preferentially attack adjacent or para position of benzene ring in the reaction and phenol is oxidized to the catechol or hydroquinone which agrees with zeng et al study 51 catechol and hydroquinone can also be interconverted with 1 2 benzoquinone and 1 4 benzoquinone respectively then 1 2 benzoquinone ring is attacked by hydroxyl radicals to form adipic acid according to other studies it is possible to form maleic acid 32 since the final solution is acidic it can be inferred that there are some small molecular acids such as formic acid acetic acid etc the hydroxyl radicals may also attacks the 2 position of p benzoquinone and generate 1 2 4 benzenetriol 2 5 dihydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone and acetic acid 52 the final products of both these possible pathways are co2 and h2o during the reaction it was also speculated that there might be macromolecular substances such as acid anhydride or ester by ms analysis and the specific formation process needs to be further studied fig 13 3 5 stability of mgo ac the stability of the catalyst is important in the application of catalytic ozonation in the same conditions mgo ac was recycled five times to test its stability it can be seen from the fig 14 that the cod removal rate can reach 83 5 in the first recycle and in the fifth recycle the cod removal rate can reach 73 6 the results are within the allowable range of experimental error the experimental results are relatively stable the decrease of cod removal rate may be due to the loss of mgo particles and the decrease of the number of surface active sites 4 conclusions ac was successfully modified by mg oxides to improve its catalytic ozonation performance in catalytic for ozonation of phenol and its intermediates in catalytic ozonation and its catalytic activity is significantly improved in our study the adsorption performance and catalytic activity showed a good synergistic effect mgo was in form of nano crystal particles on the surface of activated carbon which provided additional active sites for the generation of hydroxyl radicals from ozone when under the suitable conditions the removal ratio of cod reaches 83 5 the reaction mechanism of the catalytic reaction was verified by adding tert butanol and sulfate it was found that the degradation of phenol by catalytic ozonation over mgo ac is a first order reaction the phenol degradation mechanism and pathway were also performed in this work some intermediates were determined and the possible degradation pathway of the wastewater by the catalytic ozonation using mgo ac was also put forward this research shows an efficient way for the modification of ac to remove organic pollution from wastewater by

13962,phenol is one of the most common and poisonous water pollutants treating phenol containing wastewater has been a challenge in recent years mgo activated carbon ac composites were prepared by the equal volume impregnation method for catalytic ozonation of phenol in water mgo ac composites were characterized by icp ir xrd sem tem bet and xps analysis mgo incorporated in the form of nano crystal particles on the surface of ac prepared mgo ac shows good catalytic performance for the removal of phenol and cod catalyst loading ph and initial concentration of phenol solution on catalytic ozonation performance were studied the catalytic performance of ac was significantly improved by the modification with a few amount of mgo the results showed mgo provides additional active sites for the generation of hydroxyl radicals which is favorable for degradation of organic contaminants the intermediate products were determined and the possible degradation pathway was put forward mgo ac shows a promising way to prepare efficient catalysts for the catalytic ozonation of organic polluted water keywords catalytic ozonation mgo ac hydroxyl radical phenol cod removal 1 introduction phenol and its derivatives are an important type of aromatic chemicals which are commonly used in the production of phenolic resin adipic acid aniline and salicylic acid 1 however the emission of phenol does not meet the emission standard which poses a threat to human health they are also one of the common environment contaminants which are frequently found in the industrial effluent and surface water it s necessary to find a way to eliminate phenol in the water conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as biologically methods photocatalytic oxidation electrocatalytic oxidation are inadequate to efficiently mineralize these highly toxic compounds due to their high toxicity non biodegradability and unstability 2 4 photocatalysis usually takes a long time because light produces electrons and holes that can easily be combined 5 7 electrocatalytic oxidation has the disadvantages of high energy consumption cost and incomplete decomposition of organic matter 8 therefore finding an efficient way to remove phenol from wastewater and industrial effluent is great significance for the environmental protection in recent years catalytic ozonation technology has been widely used in wastewater treatment it has high oxidation capacity and can generate strong oxidizing agent hydroxyl radical however separate ozone oxidation shows relatively low rate reaction and incomplete mineralization which may lead to toxic intermediates products 9 adding catalyst can facilitate the production of hydroxyl radicals which can mineralize almost all organic pollutants to avoid this problem 10 some metal ions have been used as the homogenous catalysts for the catalytic ozonation such as fe3 mn2 ni2 11 13 however these homogeneous catalysts are hard to be recovered hence the heterogeneous catalysts such as fe3o4 sio2 ceo2 14 mno2 co3o4 ac have been developed to solve this problem 15 16 among these catalysts activated carbon ac supported metal oxides are widely used in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation mgo has good adsorption capacity and abundant lewis acid and base sites 17 moreover the activity of mgo is related to the low coordination on the surface and the high concentration of structural defects 18 20 the zero charge point of mgo is about 12 which is a suitable adsorbent for anion adsorption it has been reported that mgo has obvious catalytic activity in the treatment of organic wastewater 21 moussavi et al investigated the removal of phenol from salt containing wastewater using mgo nanocrystal powder in catalytic advanced oxidation process 22 their results indicated that 96 of the phenol and 70 of the chemical oxygen demand cod were removed in the catalytic ozonation process under optimum experimental conditions of ph 7 with 4 g l catalyst after 80 min although phenol and its derivatives were degraded in high conversion the cod removal efficiency was not high enough zhu et al 23 have studied the efficiency pathways and mechanisms of quinoline degradation using nano mgo as catalysts which led to 90 8 degradation of quinoline at 295 k however the recovery of powder catalyst still needs to be further solved in order to obtain higher removal efficiency mgo can be loaded on porous support activated carbon ac is one of the most used porous materials in catalytic ozonation process dai et al 14 compared the removal rate of organic matter treated by ac and ce ac in catalytic ozonation technique it has been shown that ac alone is not active enough to degrade phenol and its derivatives efficiently furthermore moussavi et al 24 reported that 98 and 74 5 of the catechol and cod were degraded over mgo ac composite in 60 min they used 10 g l of mgo as catalyst in the process which is relatively high amount of catalyst and consequently leads to increase in the cost of the process rezaei et al 25 also investigated the removal of toluene by catalytic ozonation using mgo ac under the same experimental conditions they found that 90 of toluene can be removed by mgo ac while only 20 of toluene was degraded by ac alone the results showed that the addition of mgo on ac can significantly improve the catalytic performance for vocs catalytic combustion these results show that mgo ac is a promising catalyst in wastewater treatment and waste gas treatment experiments in this work a simple way to prepare high surface and high efficient catalysts for catalytic ozonation of phenol in water is described the advantages of mgo and ac were combined to design efficient catalysts for the catalytic ozonation treatment of organic polluted water low mgo loading was used to make it play a good experimental effect in catalytic ozonation process it provided a promising direction for the industrialization of the catalyst due to its low cost and high catalytic activity the catalyst properties were well characterized and the operating conditions of the catalytic advanced oxidation were optimized the reaction mechanism of the catalyst and the possible degradation pathway in the reaction were studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents activated carbon ac was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co china magnesium

was obtained from tianjin chemical technology development co china ltd ar tianjin yongda chemical reagent co ltd ar deionized water was used to prepare all solution all the reagents were used without further purification 2 2 preparation and characterization of catalyst mgo ac was prepared by equal volume impregnation method firstly in oeder to remove the ash on the surface ac was washed until the washing solution become colorless then the washed ac was dried in the oven at 120 c for 12 h ac 10 g was added into 36 5 ml impregnation solution 1 mg no3 2 and the mixture was ultrasonic immersed for 2 h the impregnated catalyst was dried at 120 c for 5 h in a constant temperature then it was calcined in a tube furnace to convert mg no3 2 to mgo on the surface of ac the catalyst was heated up to 600 c 5 c min for 6 h under a nitrogen 0 1 l min and cooled down to the room temperature the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the catalyst were evaluated by brunauer emmett teller bet and barret joyner halenda bjh methods on a quantachrome nova2000 analyzer respectively the crystalline phase was detected on a d max 2500 x ray diffractometer xrd japan cu kα radiation 60kv 300 ma the chemical states of the catalyst were determined by x ray potoelectron spectroscopy xps with a kratos axis ultra dld spectrometer using a monochromated al kαradiation the scanning electron microscopy sem was carried out on s 4800 i scanning electron microscopy unit with 3 kv voltages and 10 ma of beam current to observe the surface morphology the transmission electron microscope tem was utilized to observe internal structure of the catalyst using lanthanum hexaboride filament as electron emission source to observe the internal structure japan jeol jem 2100 80 200kv inductively coupled plasma icp emission spectrometer was carried out on a thermo icap6300 analyzer to analyze the elements composition of catalysts the content of hydroxyl radicals were analyzed with a fluorescence spectrophotometer f97pro lengguang shanghai the intermediates were detected by mass spectrometry ms america advion plate express 100 24vac 75 w 2 3 catalytic ozonation the experiments were carried out in a three neck reactor 500 ml which was operated in a semi batch mode at 30 c ozone was generated by an ozone generator and then continuously introduced into the solution the concentration of ozone at import and export of reactor were measured by the iodine method according to the cj t3028 2 1994 standard the flow rated of mixed gas was 1 5 l min and the excess ozone was passed into gas absorption bottle containing ki solution 2 wt 24 the solution in the reactor was mixed by a magnetic stirrer agitated the synthesized mgo ac was used as the catalyst to mineralize phenol by the catalytic ozonation process initially the 300 ml of phenol solution with concentration of 210 mg l was placed in the reactor samples were taken every ten minutes and subsequently were filtered with the 0 22 μm microfilter 26 after each reaction the catalyst was washed alternately with ethanol or water and then the mixture was calcined for regeneration 2 4 analytical method the solution ph was measured by a ph meter phs 3c leici china which was calibrated by standard solution the maximum absorption wavelength of phenol at 270 nm was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer persee tu 1900 and the standard curve of phenol was made to calculate the concentration of phenol in order to measure the amount of adsorbed phenol and its intermediates on the surface of the catalyst 30 ml naoh 0 5 m solution was used to soak the adsorbed substances from used dry catalyst for 1 h the soaking solution ph was adjusted to 7 using h2so4 the residual ozone in the samples was stripped using air before analysis the terephthalic acid ta is used to examine hydroxyl radical ta can react with hydroxyl radicals not o3 to form 2 hydroxytephthalic acid hta which has a bright stable fluorescence when the excitation wavelength is set at 315 nm and the emission is measured at 425 nm 47 the cod of the solution can be an index of organic contaminants concentration which shows the removal efficiency in catalytic advanced oxidation therefore digestion and determination of samples were carried out according to standard method by cod digestion instrument and cod analyzer leici cod 571 5 26 27 the rate of phenol degradation was calculated as following 1 d e g r a d a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct were the phenol concentrations before and after the reaction respectively the degree of phenol mineralization in the selected process was measured based on the initial cod cod0 and the cod of the solution after the reaction codt 2 c o d r e m o v e e f f i c i e n c y c o d 0 c o d t c o d 0 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization 3 1 1 x ray diffraction xrd xrd was utilized to characterize the crystal phase of pure activated carbon and mgo ac as illustrated in fig 1 xrd spectra of ac show a broad peak at 27 34 which can be corresponded to 002 lattice plane and a small diffraction peak around 42 58 which can be assigned to 100 lattice plane of activated carbon 28 compared to the pure ac a sharp diffraction peak emerged at 42 72 on the patterns of the mgo ac composites which can be corresponded to mgo 200 facet figure s1 in addition to this sharp peak diffraction peaks at 2θ 38 62 42 68 63 18 78 6 are present for mgo content catalyst particularly for 10 of mgo can be corresponded to the 111 200 220 and 222 crystal facet of mgo therefore the results indicate that mgo was successfully loaded on ac as can be seen from the diagram with the increase of load concentration the peak intensity becomes more and more obvious which is due to the increasing of mgo crystal size in addition no other impurities crystallite peaks have been found for all samples 3 1 2 scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem analysis the morphology of the catalyst which was characterized by sem is demonstrated in fig 2 a it can be seen from fig 2 a that ac exhibits the initial morphology of coconut shell and its surface was full of worm like pores these pores may have positive effect on the adsorption of phenol its derivatives and o3 after the loading of mgo some nano particles emerged on the surface of ac these particles increased by increasing the mgo loading figure s2 the internal structure of the 10 mgo ac which was characterized by sem is showed in figs 2 b and s3 it can be seen in this figure that some disorder pores appear in the ac structure while the particles on the surface of ac have crystal structure the lattice spacing of the loaded oxide is 0 218 nm which suggests these oxides are mgo it is important to note that magnesium particles are mainly on the surface of the ac since the pore size of the ac is too small and the particles of the magnesium nitrate that produce the oxide after the calcination are relatively large 3 1 3 nitrogen isothermal adsorption and desorption the porous nature of the ac and mgo ac were investigated by nitrogen adsorption desorption measurements as illustrated in fig 3 both samples show type of iv isotherms with hysteresis loops which can be attributed to the mesoporous structure of ac 29 the corresponding bet surface area pore size and pore volume of ac with different ratio of mgo loading are summarized in table s1 as can be seen in table s1 the ac modified by mgo showed no significant differences in the pore size and volume as well as bet surface area of catalysts with different mgo content the surface area average pore diameter and pore volume of ac were about 1207 6 m2 g 2 34 nm and 0 219 cm3 g respectively after the loading of 0 5 of mgo on ac the surface area average pore diameter showed no obvious changing when mgo loading amount increased to 5 surface area decreased to 994 m2 g n2 physical adsorptive and desorption isotherms of catalysts suggests that the pore structure of ac only changed a little after the loading of mgo 3 1 4 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy it is important to note that oxygen containing functional groups are one of most crucial active sites for the catalytic advanced oxidation process ftir analysis was used to detect these functional groups on the surface of catalysts ftir spectra of ac mgo ac and used mgo ac are shown in fig 4 as depicted in fig 4 the stretching vibration of functional groups on ac surface mainly appear at 2351 1533 and 1045 cm 1 which are corresponded to vs c h vs cooh vs oh respectively 30 the presence of vs cooh at 1533 cm 1 indicates that the surface of ac was acidic after the modification of ac with mgo new peaks were appeared at 3673 2987 and 1393 cm 1 which can be assigned to vs oh vs c h and vs o c respectively 30 the peak at 1393 cm 1 suggests that the surface of ac became alkaline after the modification it is also clear that the stretching vibration at 1045 cm 1 shifted to 1065 cm 1 and became stronger indicating the enhancement of hydroxyl groups after the loading of mgo on ac hence adding mgo on ac increased the number of oxygen containing species and increased the intensity of previous peaks on ac these groups might be favorable for the catalytic ozonation of organic pollutants to better understand the behavior of the mgo ac catalyst the used catalyst was also examined four main peaks at 977 725 and 645 534 cm 1 were appeared on the surface of mgo ac which can be corresponded to vs h c c h vs c h and aromatic rings respectively this may be due to that aromatic and open ring organic compounds were adsorbed on the surface of catalyst while the oxygen containing functional groups were disappeared after the reaction it demonstrates that these oxygen containing groups may be covered by adsorbed organic compounds or consumed during the catalytic advanced oxidation reaction 3 1 5 xps analysis xps was used to further confirm the surface chemistry of the catalyst and the surface species of c mg and o on ac and 1 mgo ac fig 5 provides the xps spectra of the pure ac and 1 mgo ac by loading mgo on ac two kinds of mg species were detected by xps the peak of 1304 ev can be corresponded to mg species in mgo 31 32 and the peak of 1305 ev can be assigned to mg2 which combined with the functional groups on ac 33 indicating that mgo was successfully loaded on ac in addition the c 1s binding energy spectra could be recounted into four regions carbon atoms with two or three oxygen atoms such as lactone carboxylic acid carboxylic anhydride quinine and ketone 287 7ev carbon atoms with one oxygen atoms such as ether phenol or lactone 286 ev co bond 286 4 ev and cc in basal plane of sp2 carbon exposing the hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms 284 8 ev after mgo being loaded on ac the carbon binding energy and the ratio of different carbon species were changed table s3 the binding energy of carbon species bonded with oxygen increased due to the loading of mgo which was positive charge the ratio of co also increased suggesting that the surface oh amount increased which was positive for the generation of hydroxyl radicals the oxygen species with binding energy of 531 6 533 3 ev and 536 5 ev can be originated from different oxygen species namely oh c o or c o on ac respectively 34 36 the oxygen species with binding energy of 534 3 ev can be assigned to oxygen in c o on ac the ratio of oxygen species binding energy of 533 3 ev decreased and ratio of oxygen species binding energy of 536 5 ev increased after the loading of mgo due to the addition of mg species with positive charge 37 38 the presence of functional group o c had a positive effect on the reaction of organic matter adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst with ozone and the active sites of the catalyst in aqueous solution 39 40 3 2 catalytic ozonation in order to verify the prepared catalyst performance in catalytic ozonation of phenolic wastewater a series of experiments has performed the synergistic effect of mgo ac was verified and calculated the import concentration of ozone is 43 mg l in both systems the export concentration was 24 5 mg l and 10 8 mg l in mgo and mgo ac systems respectively the utilization rate of ozone in mgo ac system is 1 75 times higher than that in mgo system the results show that more ozone was decomposed in mgo ac system mgo ac composites with different mgo content namely 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 were evaluated by phenol degradation in catalytic ozonation process the cod removal of water in the presence of these catalysts is shown in figure s5 in order to demonstrate the activity of the catalyst a series of experiments with or without different catalysts have been tested for the phenolic wastewater treatment it can be seen from fig 6 that the cod removal with single ozonation only reached to 21 3 almost 71 5 of cod was removed by the adsorption of phenol on the ac in 80 min as shown in figure s5 however it showed slower removal rate than the catalytic ozonation which reached to 72 cod removal only in 30 min the catalytic ozonation performed over mgo led to 65 cod removal it is clear that the cod removal increased significantly over mgo ac as shown in figure s5 in fact the ac catalyst modified by mgo gives the best performance overall 83 5 cod removal compared to ac and mgo individually due to the synergy effect between ac and mgo in the modified catalyst the results also showed that cod removal in the presence of ac and mgo ac firstly decreased significantly from 520 mg l to 200 mg l in 10 min and then decreased gradually as the reaction time increased from 10 min to 120 min the first region is mainly due to the adsorption of phenol on the surface of catalyst as well as the catalytic ozonation of phenol the reason for the second stage may be that the reaction rates are mass transfer control due to the sharply decreased of phenol concentration at first stage the details of the reaction dynamic and mechanism would be discussed in the following sections to confirm the increase of cod removal mainly related to catalytic ozonation rather than the adsorption the adsorption amount of phenol during reaction was measured the cod of initial soaking solution was 520 mg l it can be seen from the fig 6 if mgo ac adsorbed only cod can reach 441 mg l after 120 min the cod of solution removal rate can reach 15 1 however the cod of solution decreased 83 5 after 120 min in catalytic ozonation reaction over mgo ac it indicates that more than 60 of cod was removed by catalytic ozonation over mgo ac sem bet and bjt analysis showed no apparent changes in structure morphology surface area and pore size distribution of the ac after modification by mgo therefore the physical parameters do not contribute to the better performance of mgo ac than ac in catalytic ozonation when mgo was loaded on ac the presence of functional group o c had a positive effect on the reaction of organic matter adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst with ozone because aromatic rings and surface carbonyl groups can form electron donor receptor complexes 39 40 xps showed that after mgo was loaded on ac the lattice oxygen decreased the oxygen vacancy increased and the oxygen containing groups on ac increased which may be the reason for the increase of cod removal rate in order to verify the synergistic effect of mgo ac in the reaction the calculation was carried out as synergistic influence cod removed in cop sum of cod removed in sop and adsorbed onto the catalyst 22 as can be seen from fig 6 the combination of synthesized mgo ac and ozone has a significant synergistic effect on phenol removal 61 5 from 30 min reaction time with the increase of reaction time the synergistic effect of mgo ac and ozone reached 61 5 at 30 min and then decreased slowly it may be due to the production of short chain hydrocarbons gradually increasing with the progress of the reaction at the later stage of the reaction and the direct aggression of ozone also played a certain role 3 3 the mechanism and kinetics of catalytic ozonation over mgo ac 3 3 1 effect of solution ph the ph evolution in the process is important in catalytic ozonation of phenol the solution ph influences the surface properties of catalysts and generation of active radicals eq 3 4 22 41 3 m o h h m o h 2 p h ph z c 4 m o h o h m o h 2 o p h ph z c the initial ph of phenol solution used in these experiments was 5 51 the mgo ac has strong alkaline phzc of around 10 11 when the mgo ac catalyst is added the ph of the solution can reach about 9 and the cod removal ratio was 83 5 fig 7 by decreasing the solution ph to 4 05 using h2so4 the cod removal of phenol and its derivatives decreased to 79 it is well known that the degradation of phenol at low ph is mainly carried out by direct oxidation of ozone 14 the oxidation ability of o3 is lower than oh with the decrease of ph more and more substances are produced to inhibit the ozone reaction the ratio of phenol oxidized by o3 increased and cod removal ratio decreased when the solution ph was adjusted to 8 by naoh solution the cod removal ratio increased to 86 6 the reason may be that under alkaline conditions the solubility of ozone in the solution was increased and more hydroxyl radicals were generated by the interaction with the active site and the solution of the catalyst hydroxyl radicals have strong oxidation properties against a variety of unsaturated bonds short chain substances and small molecules 42 however further increase in solution ph to 10 and 12 leads to the reduction of cod removal to 75 6 and 67 1 respectively with the increases in solution ph oh concentration can increase and quenching reactions between hydroxyl radicals become stronger which can hinder the further increase in oh concentration 38 on the other hand more co2 can be generated by increasing in the solution ph from the decomposition of phenol and its intermediates these generated co2 molecules can react with oh and produce co3 2 and hco3 in the solution oh can also be consumed by co3 2 and hco3 which can decrease the oh concentration 22 it is worth mentioning that prepared mgo ac can mitigate the experimental ph because some organic acids produced during the treatment of phenol by catalytic ozonation lead the decrease of ph it is also the reason why the mgo ac can achieve high removal effect under the action of the catalyst 23 the strong alkalescent condition would change the mg species and oxygen containing species on the surface of catalysts which results in the reduction of catalytic activity 3 3 2 the kinetics of the catalytic ozonation to find out the kinetic of this reaction the catalytic performance of mgo ac in different phenol solution was detected and the results are shown in fig 8 it showed that the initial concentration of phenol is negatively correlated with the reaction rate constant by increasing the initial concentration of phenol and its related intermediate products the amount of the ozone or hydroxyl radicals obtained per corresponding pollutant concentration unit would decrease moreover some intermediate products such as co3 2 hco3 would capture the hydroxyl radical which leads to the decrease of k value 44 45 according to the results of different phenol concentrations the kinetics of this process with different phenol concentrations was fitted the fitting results were shown in table 1 the results show that the catalytic ozonation of phenol over mgo ac accords with the first order kinetic law it can be seen from table 1 that with the increase in initial concentration of phenol the reaction rate constant increased from 0 6370 at 100 mg l to 0 7874 min 1 at 210 mg l and then decreased gradually to 0 4760 min 1 at 700 mg l it shows that the initial concentration of phenol is negatively correlated with the reaction rate constant 3 4 reaction mechanism 3 4 1 effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers in order to determine whether hydroxyl free radicals or ozone play a major role in that course of the experiment tba was used as radical scavenger to suppress the generated hydroxyl radicals which can react with oh at a high reaction rate constant of 6 108 m 1 s 1 and react with o3 only at 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 46 the cod removal ratio reached 64 4 in 10 min and 83 5 in 120 min without tba while the cod removal ratio reached 7 in 10 min and 26 16 in 120 min with tba which were much lower than the one without tba the main reason is that the existing tba consumes the formed hydroxyl radical and part of ozone to reduce the removal rate of cod it also obeys the catalytic mechanism hence the results indicate that the hydroxyl radicals were main oxidants in this process fig 9 3 4 2 effect of sulfate to find out if mg species were the active sites in catalytic ozonation mnso4 was added into the reaction system which can combine with lewis acid sites provided by mg species 23 as can be seen in fig 10 the cod removal ratio reached 64 4 in 10 min and 83 5 in 120 min without mnso4 while the cod removal ratio reached 35 in 10 min and 54 in 120 min with mnso4 which was much lower than the one without mnso4 the results suggest that although ac can provide some active sites for the generation of hydroxyl radicals the catalytic activity decreased obviously after the suppression of mg species by mnso4 the results showed that mgo on ac provides the additional active sites for the reaction 3 4 3 qualitative analysis of hydroxyl radical hydroxyl radical plays a key role in the reaction it can be seen from fig 11 that the maximum fluorescence intensity was gotten in the mgo ac system which indicates the most amount of hydroxyl radicals was generated among these four systems the content of hydroxyl radical produced by mgo ac system is about twice as much as that produced by mgo system alone it is also related to the surface characteristics of the catalyst loading mgo on activated carbon does have synergistic effect on the reaction there are few hydroxyl radicals produced in the process of ozone oxidation alone because ozone does not react with ta 47 in the mgo ac system with 1 g l of tba the fluorescence intensity is lower than that of the mgo ac system without tba which is due to suppress of the hydroxyl radical by tba the result also indirectly but accurately proves the formation of hydroxyl radicals in this process 3 4 4 possible mechanisms of phenol degradation the mechanisms of phenol degradation are suggested based on the experimental results and the previous studies 22 23 44 49 52 there are two main mechanisms for the phenol degradation by catalytic ozonation one is the reactions between phenol and hydroxyl radicals generated from the reaction between o3 and h2o 48 this reaction is quite fast due to the strong oxidability of hydroxyl radicals this reaction has two pathways for the phenol degradation which are shown in eq 5 9 11 12 the first pathway takes place on the surface of catalysts eq 5 8 it is indirect reaction in eq 5 and eq 6 o3 attacks the lewis acid site of mg species and generates o and o2 on the surface mg species the surface o further reacts with h2o and o3 to produce oh on the mg species surface eq 7 phenol reacts with the surface oh and produces intermediates co2 and h2o the intermediates are degraded by the surface oh to co2 and h2o the secondary pathway takes place in the solution the phenol reacts with oh in the solution to produce intermediates and co2 h2o the intermediates are further degraded by oh to co2 and h2o eq 7 the other kind mechanism is the direct reactions between ozone molecules and phenol or its intermediates generally aldehydes or carboxylic acids are produced after the reaction between ozone and phenol these two types of substances would not react with ozone which is also a disadvantage of ozone catalytic oxidation the presence of aldehydes or carboxylic acids could not be completely mineralized by o3 moreover the results showed that degradation of phenol by o3 is relatively slow fig 6 49 the results of experiments with tba suggest that this reaction is the minor reaction indirect and direct reactions can occur on the surface of the catalyst as well as in the solution eq 9 10 13 o3 is firstly absorbed on surface of mg species the absorbed o3 reacts with phenol to produce intermediates and eventually co2 h2o the intermediates are degraded by absorbed o3 to co2 and h2o eq 9 10 phenol also can react with o3 dissolved in the solution to produce intermediates co2 and h2o the intermediates are degraded by dissolved o3 to co2 and h2o eq 13 detailed proposed mechanisms in this study were revealed in fig 11 indirect reaction a on the surface of catalyst 5 a c m g o s o 3 a c m g o s o o o 6 a c m g o s o o o a c m g o s o o 2 7 a c m g o s o 2 h 2 o o 3 a c m g o s o h 3 o h o 2 8

e s o 3 c o 2 h 2 o 3 4 5 the possible reaction pathway the intermediates of the phenol degradation were determined by ms figure s7 fig 12 shows the probable pathway of phenol degradation in the catalytic ozonation process over mgo ac firstly electrophilic hydroxyl radicals preferentially attack adjacent or para position of benzene ring in the reaction and phenol is oxidized to the catechol or hydroquinone which agrees with zeng et al study 51 catechol and hydroquinone can also be interconverted with 1 2 benzoquinone and 1 4 benzoquinone respectively then 1 2 benzoquinone ring is attacked by hydroxyl radicals to form adipic acid according to other studies it is possible to form maleic acid 32 since the final solution is acidic it can be inferred that there are some small molecular acids such as formic acid acetic acid etc the hydroxyl radicals may also attacks the 2 position of p benzoquinone and generate 1 2 4 benzenetriol 2 5 dihydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone and acetic acid 52 the final products of both these possible pathways are co2 and h2o during the reaction it was also speculated that there might be macromolecular substances such as acid anhydride or ester by ms analysis and the specific formation process needs to be further studied fig 13 3 5 stability of mgo ac the stability of the catalyst is important in the application of catalytic ozonation in the same conditions mgo ac was recycled five times to test its stability it can be seen from the fig 14 that the cod removal rate can reach 83 5 in the first recycle and in the fifth recycle the cod removal rate can reach 73 6 the results are within the allowable range of experimental error the experimental results are relatively stable the decrease of cod removal rate may be due to the loss of mgo particles and the decrease of the number of surface active sites 4 conclusions ac was successfully modified by mg oxides to improve its catalytic ozonation performance in catalytic for ozonation of phenol and its intermediates in catalytic ozonation and its catalytic activity is significantly improved in our study the adsorption performance and catalytic activity showed a good synergistic effect mgo was in form of nano crystal particles on the surface of activated carbon which provided additional active sites for the generation of hydroxyl radicals from ozone when under the suitable conditions the removal ratio of cod reaches 83 5 the reaction mechanism of the catalytic reaction was verified by adding tert butanol and sulfate it was found that the degradation of phenol by catalytic ozonation over mgo ac is a first order reaction the phenol degradation mechanism and pathway were also performed in this work some intermediates were determined and the possible degradation pathway of the wastewater by the catalytic ozonation using mgo ac was also put forward this research shows an efficient way for the modification of ac to remove organic pollution from wastewater by

13963,the performance nitrogen removal rate microbial community and enzymatic activity of a sequencing batch reactor sbr have been evaluated under long term exposure of oxytetracycline otc the chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n removals displayed no distinct variation under 5 mg l otc and then reduced with the increase of otc concentration from 5 to 30 mg l the microbial oxygen uptake rate and dehydrogenase activity of activated sludge had no evident change under 10 mg l otc and then decreased with the increase of otc concentration from 20 to 30 mg l the nitrification rate denitrification rate nitrifying enzymatic activity and denitrifying enzymatic activity of activated sludge gradually decreased with the increase of otc concentration from 0 to 30 mg l compared with 0 mg l otc the otc concentration at 30 mg l could promote the microorganisms in the activated sludge to produce more reactive oxygen species production and lactate dehydrogenase release the microbial diversity and abundance of sbr displayed some obvious changes under different otc concentrations keywords oxytetracycline sequencing batch reactor nitrification rate microbial enzymatic activity microbial diversity 1 introduction antibiotics have been extensively used in medical and agricultural purposes to prevent or treat different diseases most antibiotics are difficult to metabolize and thus excreted by humans or animals which can cause antibiotics to enter surface water domestic sewage and aquaculture wastewater the antibiotic cefalexin concentration ranged from 0 67 to 2 9 μg l in the influent of a sewage treatment plant in hong kong 1 managali et al 2 reported that the antibiotic sulfamethazine was present at 19 2 μg l in pig farm wastewater however some antibiotics e g ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines were about 31 mg l in the effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment effluent 3 4 the chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen removals of bioreactors treating wastewater are closely associated with their microbial activity whereas the existence of antibiotics can directly produce selective pressure on microorganisms and further impact the bioreactor performance previous reports have illustrated that some antibiotics including ciprofloxacin ibuprofen norfloxacin sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole fluoroquinolone and erythromycin can affect the performances and microbial communities of bioreactors treating wastewater 5 11 oxytetracycline otc is most commonly used in human and veterinary medicine in many countries owing to its broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and low cost 12 14 wang et al 15 reported that the otc concentrations were 1 411 0 225 μg l in untreated hospital wastewater from three hospitals the risk quotient of otc was estimated to be 27 78 94 81 μg l in aquatic environment in china 16 previous researches reported that the otc level was more than 50 mg l in the outflow of an otc production facility in china 17 and the otc concentration was up to 0 34 mg l in surface water 18 in view of otc antimicrobial property the impact of otc on the bioreactor performance has also attracted extensive attentions in recent years 19 21 some researchers have illustrated that the presence of otc could evidently restrain the nitrogen removal and anammox activity of anammox systems 21 24 hu et al 20 reported that 10 mg l otc exerted a distinct inhibition on the microbial specific oxygen uptake rate sour of a bioreactor under 24 h exposure wang et al 25 demonstrated that 12 mg l otc affected the performance of a sequencing batch reactor sbr treating mariculture wastewater the microbial enzymatic activity is closely associated with the pollutant removal rate of bioreactor treating wastewater the presence of otc might exert the change of microbial enzymatic activity which can further affect the cod and nitrogen removal performance of bioreactor in addition the occurrence of otc might promote more lactate dehydrogenase ldh release and reactive oxygen species ros production of microbial aggregates and further affect the bioreactor performance however no research is performed to assess the effect of otc on the microbial enzymatic activity microbial ros production and ldh release and microbial community of sbr under long term exposure the purposes of the present study mainly focused on a assessing the cod and nitrogen removal performance oxygen uptake rate nitrifying rate denitrifying rate and enzymatic activity under otc stress b analyzing the potential otc biological toxicity and c investigating the variation of microbial community under different otc concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a lab scale sbr with 7 7 l effective volume had been utilized in this study the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of sbr was kept at approximately 3 5 g l through regularly discharging excess sludge during the whole operation time an influent pump was used to supply synthetic wastewater the effluent was discharged through an electromagnetic valve in the middle of sbr the operational procedure of one cycle was shown as follows 0 1 h water influent 2 4 h anoxic period 4 h aerobic period 1 3 h settling and 0 2 h drainage an aerating pump was used to provide oxygen at aerobic period and an agitator was applied to stir mixed liquor during anoxic period the hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt were 16 h and 20 d respectively table 1 summarized the influent compositions of sbr the influent cod and nh4 n concentrations were 416 41 10 32 and 22 44 0 79 mg l during the whole operation process respectively the influent otc concentrations of sbr were 0 5 10 20 and 30 mg l on day 1 73 74 152 153 200 201 254 and 255 288 respectively 2 2 analytical methods the cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n mlss and mixed liquor volatile solids mlvss were measured according to apha 26 the sour nitrifying rate denitrifying rate ldh release ros production and enzymatic activity at 0 10 20 and 30 mg l otc were conducted on day 73 200 254 and 288 respectively the specific ammonia oxidizing rate saor specific nitrite oxidizing rate snor specific nitrite reducing rate snirr specific nitrate reducing rate snrr and sour were measured according to wang et al 27 the analysis of microbial enzymatic activities including ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrate reductase nr nitrite reductase nir and dehydrogenase activity dha was according to wang et al 28 the ldh release was determined via the ldh kit nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute jiangsu china and the ros production was analyzed according to previous research 29 to better investigate the effect of different otc concentrations on the microbial community the microbial richness and diversity were compared at the end of operation time under each otc concentration the sludge samples at 0 5 10 and 30 mg l otc were obtained on day 73 152 200 and 288 respectively three parallel sludge samples under steady states were taken from the sbr at each otc concentration and then evenly mixed by a stirrer the genomic dna of the mixed sludge sample was extracted directly with the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions partial 16s rdna based high throughput sequencing was used to determine the microbial diversity and composition of each sludge sample pcr amplifications were performed with the primers 515 f 5 gtgccagcagccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactaccagggtatctaat 3 that amplified the v4 region of the 16s rdna sequencing was subsequently determined on an illumina miseq platform of novogene beijing china paired end reads from the original dna fragments were merged using flash 30 and assigned to each sample according to the unique barcode of each sample qiime software package http qiime org and uparse pipeline http drive5 com uparse were used to analyze the reads and pick operational taxonomic units otus sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same otus a representative sequence was selected for each otu and the rdp classifier was used to assign taxonomic data to each representative sequence 31 rarefaction curves at a distance cutoff level of 3 good s coverage shannon index chao 1 index ace index and simpson index were generated in mothur for each sludge sample 2 3 statistical analysis some data have been carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation an analysis of variance anova has been used for evaluating the experimental results and p 0 05 is regarded as statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of sbr performance under otc stress fig 1 shows the time profiles of cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the influent or effluent during the whole operation time and table 2 summarizes the average cod and nitrogenous compound concentration in the influent or effluent at each otc concentration the cod removal efficiency displayed no evident change at 0 5 mg l otc and decreased from 91 08 1 22 at 5 mg l otc to 79 35 2 27 at 30 mg l otc which illustrated that otc at relatively higher concentration restrained cod removal of sbr the nh4 n removal maintained steady at 0 5 mg l otc nevertheless the nh4 n removal slowly declined from 97 05 1 27 at 5 mg l otc to 63 27 11 73 at 20 mg l otc and then sharply decreased to 32 94 6 74 at 30 mg l otc which demonstrated that otc obviously restrained the ammonia oxidization process due to its biotoxicity 32 33 wang et al 25 also found that otc exerted adverse effect on the cod and nh4 n removals of an sbr treating saline aquaculture wastewater the effluent no2 n slightly increased under 5 mg l otc compared to 0 mg l otc and then gradually decreased to zero at 30 mg l otc however the effluent no3 n decreased with the increase of otc concentration the effluent no2 n and no3 n are associated with ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation nitrite reduction and nitrate reduction the inhibitory effect of otc on ammonia oxidation in the present research resulted in producing lower no2 n and no3 n concentration in nitrification process however otc might exert less inhibition on the denitrification than the nitrification which could lead to the reduction of effluent no2 n and no3 n concentrations with the increase of otc concentration 3 2 variation of microbial sour and nitrogen removal rate under otc stress to further assess the effect of otc on the sbr performance the sour saor snor snirr and snrr have been investigated under otc stress fig 2 compared with 0 mg l otc the sour did not evidently change at 10 mg l otc whereas the sour decreased by 19 31 at 20 mg l otc and 22 69 at 30 mg l otc the reduction of sour under higher otc concentration could produce detrimental effects on the processes of organic matter degradation under aerobic condition ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation hu et al 20 reported that 10 mg l otc under 24 h exposure produced serious inhibitory impact on the microbial sour of an enhanced phosphorus removal bioreactor both the saor and snor gradually reduced with the increase of otc concentration which indicated that the existence of otc inhibited the biological oxidization process of nh4 n and no2 n under aerobic condition the saor and snor decreased by 31 18 and 23 02 at 30 mg l otc by comparison with the absence of otc respectively the presence of otc in the influent could inhibit the saor more than the snor in the sbr similarly both the snirr and snrr illustrated a descending tendency with the increase of otc concentration which was attributed to the inhibitory impact of otc on the biological reduction of nitrite and nitrate compared to the absence of otc the snirr and snrr reduced by 21 62 and 9 92 at 30 mg l otc respectively the change of snirr and snrr indicated that otc produced more inhibition on nitrite reduction than nitrate reduction some researchers have also reported that other antibiotics e g florfenicol and norfloxacin could inhibit the nitrifying and denitrifying rates of sequencing batch biofilm reactors 34 35 3 3 variation of microbial enzymatic activity under otc stress the microbial enzymatic activities were analyzed to further assess the effect of otc on the sbr performance compared with the absence of otc the dha had no distinct change at 10 mg l otc and declined by 19 82 at 20 mg l otc and 33 3 at 30 mg l otc fig 3 a which displayed the similar changing tendency to the sour under otc stress dha is reported to be closely associated with the biodegradation of organic pollutants which conducts the substance and energy exchange through the acceleration of dehydrogenation oxidization reaction 36 the variation of dha demonstrated that higher otc concentration exerted an obvious inhibition on the dehydrogenase activity and might further affect the organic matter removal yang et al 37 have also indicated that dha can catalyze microbial dehydrogenizing process and enhance the removal of hydrogen atom from organic matter as shown in fig 3b both the amo and nor activity slightly reduced at 10 30 mg l otc amo from ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nor from nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob can catalyze the ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation under aerobic condition respectively 38 the amo and nor activity displayed a similar changing trend to the saor and snor respectively by contrast with 0 mg l otc the amo and nor activity diminished by 17 39 and 20 87 at 30 mg l otc which demonstrated that otc produced less inhibition on aob than nob as illustrated in fig 3c both the nir and nr activity illustrated a descending tendency with the increase of otc concentration which indicated that otc inhibited nitrite reducing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria the nir and nr activity displayed a similar changing tendency with the snirr and snrr respectively it was concluded that the inhibition of denitrification rates was caused by the reduction of nir and nr under otc stress compared with 0 mg l otc the nir and nr activity had a decrease of 20 85 and 21 21 at 30 mg l otc respectively the variation of nir and nr activity illustrated that otc produced the almost same inhibition on the nitrite reducing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria of sbr 3 4 variation of microbial ros and ldh under otc stress to assess the otc toxicity to activated sludge the microbial ros and ldh have been investigated at different otc concentrations fig 4 compared with 0 mg l otc the ros production had no obvious change at 10 mg l otc whereas the ros production raised 13 22 at 20 mg l otc and 24 16 at 30 mg l otc the ros variation displayed that otc at higher concentration could promote the microorganisms to generate higher ros production ros was known as the inevitable by product of normal cellular metabolism which can be removed by intracellular antioxidant system however more ros production can destroy the microbial intracellular components and further affect microbial function 39 40 higher ros production could destroy the equilibrium between oxidization and antioxidization to exert the toxic effects to microorganisms and further affect the organic matter degradation and nitrogen removal 41 ldh was regarded as an indicator to investigate the integrity of cytomembrane under unfavorable external conditions 42 by contrast with the absence of otc the ldh release raised 5 24 at 10 mg l otc which indicated less than 10 mg l otc hardly affected the microbial cytomembrane integrity however the microbial ldh release increased by 14 84 at 20 mg l otc and 18 70 at 30 mg l otc by comparison with 0 mg l otc the higher ldh release could destroy the integrity of cell membrane and alter the microbial morphology which might affect the microbial physiological functions of activated sludge 3 5 variation of microbial community under otc stress to evaluate the long term effect of otc concentrations on the microbial community the variations of microbial richness and diversity have been investigated at 0 5 10 and 30 mg l otc as shown in table 3 the effective sequences of the obtained sludge samples on day 73 152 200 and 288 were categorized as 1280 1180 1055 and 933 operational taxonomic units otus based on 3 nucleotide cutoff compared with 0 mg l otc the chao1 and ace indices of obtained sludge samples displayed a slight increase at 5 mg l otc and then reduced at 10 and 30 mg l otc the shannon index decreased from 7 822 to 5 895 with the increase of otc concentration from 0 to 10 mg l and then increased to 6 641 at 30 mg l otc whereas the simpson index increased or reduced at different otc concentrations the current results indicated that otc exerted some distinct variations on the microbial diversity and richness the good s coverage of the above mentioned samples at different otc concentrations exceeded 0 990 which indicated that the acquired sequencing library almost covered the microbial species of sbr according to principal coordinate analysis fig 5 the microbial community under otc stress was divided into three groups a 0 and 5 mg l b 10 mg l and c 30 mg l which suggested higher otc concentration exerted a greater effect on the microbial composition to further analyze the succession of microbial community under otc stress the microbial communities at different otc concentrations were compared at the phylum class and genus level as illustrated in fig 6 a the predominant phyla at each otc concentration were proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes actinobacteria planctomycetes acidobacteria chlorobi armatimonadetes and nitrospirae the relative abundance of proteobacteria varied in range of 64 18 and 73 46 at 0 30 mg l otc bacteroidetes displayed an incremental trend in relative abundance with the increase of otc concentration by contrast with the absence of otc chloroflexi and nitrospirae showed a little increment in relative abundance at 5 mg l otc and then declined at 10 and 30 mg l otc actinobacteria planctomycetes acidobacteria and chlorobi gradually decreased in relative abundance from 6 16 2 05 1 89 and 1 88 at 0 mg l otc to 0 70 0 51 0 50 and 0 56 at 30 mg l otc respectively compared with 0 mg l otc firmicutes slightly decreased in relative abundance at 10 mg l otc and then increased at 30 mg l otc whereas armatimonadetes increased in relative abundances at 5 and 10 mg l otc and reduced at 30 mg l otc the predominant classes were alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria saprospirae and epsilonproteobacteria whereas their relative abundances increased or decreased under each otc concentration by comparing with 0 mg l otc fig 6b both planctomycetia and actinobacteria decreased in relative abundances with the increment of otc concentration flavobacteriia and bacteroidia kept an increasing tendency in relative abundances with the increase of otc concentration by contrast with the absence of otc anaerolineae and cytophagia illustrated a slight increment in relative abundances at 5 mg l otc and then declined at 10 and 30 mg l otc as illustrated in fig 6c both nitrosospira and nitrospira showed a descending tendency in relative abundance with the increase of otc concentration nitrosospira are able to transform ammonia into nitrite and nitrospira have the capability to oxidize nitrite to nitrate 43 44 the relative abundances of some denitrifying genera including azospirillum 45 azoarcus 46 hyphomicrobium 47 and thermomonas 48 had obvious reduction at 30 mg l otc by comparison with 0 mg l otc the presence of otc inhibited the growth development and reproduction of some denitrifying genera and then inhibited the nir and nr activities of activated sludge which might further affect the snirr and snrr however the denitrifying genera paracoccus 49 and dechloromonas 50 displayed some increase at 30 mg l otc by comparing with 0 mg l otc suggesting that they might have good tolerant ability to the otc biotoxicity compared with the absence of otc candidatus accumulibacter had a decrease in relative abundance at 5 10 and 30 mg l otc candidatus accumulibacter can utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor for phosphorus uptake in activated sludge 51 some genera including dokdonella arenimonas pseudoxanthomonas flavihumibacter and phycicoccus kept a decreasing tendency in relative abundances with the increase of otc concentration however flavobacterium and haliscomenobacter maintained an increment trend in relative abundance with the increase of otc concentration additionally some genera reduced or enhanced in relative abundance under otc stress by comparison with 0 mg l otc such as rhodobacter rhizobium hydrogenophaga thermochromatium and arcobacter 4 conclusions the cod and nh4 n removal of sbr did not change at 0 5 mg l otc and then declined with the increase of otc concentration from 5 to 30 mg l the sour and dha activity maintained a stable value at 0 10 mg l otc whereas declined at 20 30 mg l otc the nitrification rate denitrification rate and enzymatic activity related to nitrogen removal kept a gradually decreasing trend with the increase of otc concentration higher otc concentrations enhanced the microbial ros production and ldh release of sbr the microbial abundance and diversity displayed some distinct changes at different otc concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work all the authors

13963,the performance nitrogen removal rate microbial community and enzymatic activity of a sequencing batch reactor sbr have been evaluated under long term exposure of oxytetracycline otc the chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n removals displayed no distinct variation under 5 mg l otc and then reduced with the increase of otc concentration from 5 to 30 mg l the microbial oxygen uptake rate and dehydrogenase activity of activated sludge had no evident change under 10 mg l otc and then decreased with the increase of otc concentration from 20 to 30 mg l the nitrification rate denitrification rate nitrifying enzymatic activity and denitrifying enzymatic activity of activated sludge gradually decreased with the increase of otc concentration from 0 to 30 mg l compared with 0 mg l otc the otc concentration at 30 mg l could promote the microorganisms in the activated sludge to produce more reactive oxygen species production and lactate dehydrogenase release the microbial diversity and abundance of sbr displayed some obvious changes under different otc concentrations keywords oxytetracycline sequencing batch reactor nitrification rate microbial enzymatic activity microbial diversity 1 introduction antibiotics have been extensively used in medical and agricultural purposes to prevent or treat different diseases most antibiotics are difficult to metabolize and thus excreted by humans or animals which can cause antibiotics to enter surface water domestic sewage and aquaculture wastewater the antibiotic cefalexin concentration ranged from 0 67 to 2 9 μg l in the influent of a sewage treatment plant in hong kong 1 managali et al 2 reported that the antibiotic sulfamethazine was present at 19 2 μg l in pig farm wastewater however some antibiotics e g ciprofloxacin and tetracyclines were about 31 mg l in the effluent of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment effluent 3 4 the chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen removals of bioreactors treating wastewater are closely associated with their microbial activity whereas the existence of antibiotics can directly produce selective pressure on microorganisms and further impact the bioreactor performance previous reports have illustrated that some antibiotics including ciprofloxacin ibuprofen norfloxacin sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole fluoroquinolone and erythromycin can affect the performances and microbial communities of bioreactors treating wastewater 5 11 oxytetracycline otc is most commonly used in human and veterinary medicine in many countries owing to its broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and low cost 12 14 wang et al 15 reported that the otc concentrations were 1 411 0 225 μg l in untreated hospital wastewater from three hospitals the risk quotient of otc was estimated to be 27 78 94 81 μg l in aquatic environment in china 16 previous researches reported that the otc level was more than 50 mg l in the outflow of an otc production facility in china 17 and the otc concentration was up to 0 34 mg l in surface water 18 in view of otc antimicrobial property the impact of otc on the bioreactor performance has also attracted extensive attentions in recent years 19 21 some researchers have illustrated that the presence of otc could evidently restrain the nitrogen removal and anammox activity of anammox systems 21 24 hu et al 20 reported that 10 mg l otc exerted a distinct inhibition on the microbial specific oxygen uptake rate sour of a bioreactor under 24 h exposure wang et al 25 demonstrated that 12 mg l otc affected the performance of a sequencing batch reactor sbr treating mariculture wastewater the microbial enzymatic activity is closely associated with the pollutant removal rate of bioreactor treating wastewater the presence of otc might exert the change of microbial enzymatic activity which can further affect the cod and nitrogen removal performance of bioreactor in addition the occurrence of otc might promote more lactate dehydrogenase ldh release and reactive oxygen species ros production of microbial aggregates and further affect the bioreactor performance however no research is performed to assess the effect of otc on the microbial enzymatic activity microbial ros production and ldh release and microbial community of sbr under long term exposure the purposes of the present study mainly focused on a assessing the cod and nitrogen removal performance oxygen uptake rate nitrifying rate denitrifying rate and enzymatic activity under otc stress b analyzing the potential otc biological toxicity and c investigating the variation of microbial community under different otc concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a lab scale sbr with 7 7 l effective volume had been utilized in this study the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of sbr was kept at approximately 3 5 g l through regularly discharging excess sludge during the whole operation time an influent pump was used to supply synthetic wastewater the effluent was discharged through an electromagnetic valve in the middle of sbr the operational procedure of one cycle was shown as follows 0 1 h water influent 2 4 h anoxic period 4 h aerobic period 1 3 h settling and 0 2 h drainage an aerating pump was used to provide oxygen at aerobic period and an agitator was applied to stir mixed liquor during anoxic period the hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt were 16 h and 20 d respectively table 1 summarized the influent compositions of sbr the influent cod and nh4 n concentrations were 416 41 10 32 and 22 44 0 79 mg l during the whole operation process respectively the influent otc concentrations of sbr were 0 5 10 20 and 30 mg l on day 1 73 74 152 153 200 201 254 and 255 288 respectively 2 2 analytical methods the cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n mlss and mixed liquor volatile solids mlvss were measured according to apha 26 the sour nitrifying rate denitrifying rate ldh release ros production and enzymatic activity at 0 10 20 and 30 mg l otc were conducted on day 73 200 254 and 288 respectively the specific ammonia oxidizing rate saor specific nitrite oxidizing rate snor specific nitrite reducing rate snirr specific nitrate reducing rate snrr and sour were measured according to wang et al 27 the analysis of microbial enzymatic activities including ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrate reductase nr nitrite reductase nir and dehydrogenase activity dha was according to wang et al 28 the ldh release was determined via the ldh kit nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute jiangsu china and the ros production was analyzed according to previous research 29 to better investigate the effect of different otc concentrations on the microbial community the microbial richness and diversity were compared at the end of operation time under each otc concentration the sludge samples at 0 5 10 and 30 mg l otc were obtained on day 73 152 200 and 288 respectively three parallel sludge samples under steady states were taken from the sbr at each otc concentration and then evenly mixed by a stirrer the genomic dna of the mixed sludge sample was extracted directly with the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions partial 16s rdna based high throughput sequencing was used to determine the microbial diversity and composition of each sludge sample pcr amplifications were performed with the primers 515 f 5 gtgccagcagccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactaccagggtatctaat 3 that amplified the v4 region of the 16s rdna sequencing was subsequently determined on an illumina miseq platform of novogene beijing china paired end reads from the original dna fragments were merged using flash 30 and assigned to each sample according to the unique barcode of each sample qiime software package http qiime org and uparse pipeline http drive5 com uparse were used to analyze the reads and pick operational taxonomic units otus sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same otus a representative sequence was selected for each otu and the rdp classifier was used to assign taxonomic data to each representative sequence 31 rarefaction curves at a distance cutoff level of 3 good s coverage shannon index chao 1 index ace index and simpson index were generated in mothur for each sludge sample 2 3 statistical analysis some data have been carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation an analysis of variance anova has been used for evaluating the experimental results and p 0 05 is regarded as statistical significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of sbr performance under otc stress fig 1 shows the time profiles of cod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the influent or effluent during the whole operation time and table 2 summarizes the average cod and nitrogenous compound concentration in the influent or effluent at each otc concentration the cod removal efficiency displayed no evident change at 0 5 mg l otc and decreased from 91 08 1 22 at 5 mg l otc to 79 35 2 27 at 30 mg l otc which illustrated that otc at relatively higher concentration restrained cod removal of sbr the nh4 n removal maintained steady at 0 5 mg l otc nevertheless the nh4 n removal slowly declined from 97 05 1 27 at 5 mg l otc to 63 27 11 73 at 20 mg l otc and then sharply decreased to 32 94 6 74 at 30 mg l otc which demonstrated that otc obviously restrained the ammonia oxidization process due to its biotoxicity 32 33 wang et al 25 also found that otc exerted adverse effect on the cod and nh4 n removals of an sbr treating saline aquaculture wastewater the effluent no2 n slightly increased under 5 mg l otc compared to 0 mg l otc and then gradually decreased to zero at 30 mg l otc however the effluent no3 n decreased with the increase of otc concentration the effluent no2 n and no3 n are associated with ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation nitrite reduction and nitrate reduction the inhibitory effect of otc on ammonia oxidation in the present research resulted in producing lower no2 n and no3 n concentration in nitrification process however otc might exert less inhibition on the denitrification than the nitrification which could lead to the reduction of effluent no2 n and no3 n concentrations with the increase of otc concentration 3 2 variation of microbial sour and nitrogen removal rate under otc stress to further assess the effect of otc on the sbr performance the sour saor snor snirr and snrr have been investigated under otc stress fig 2 compared with 0 mg l otc the sour did not evidently change at 10 mg l otc whereas the sour decreased by 19 31 at 20 mg l otc and 22 69 at 30 mg l otc the reduction of sour under higher otc concentration could produce detrimental effects on the processes of organic matter degradation under aerobic condition ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation hu et al 20 reported that 10 mg l otc under 24 h exposure produced serious inhibitory impact on the microbial sour of an enhanced phosphorus removal bioreactor both the saor and snor gradually reduced with the increase of otc concentration which indicated that the existence of otc inhibited the biological oxidization process of nh4 n and no2 n under aerobic condition the saor and snor decreased by 31 18 and 23 02 at 30 mg l otc by comparison with the absence of otc respectively the presence of otc in the influent could inhibit the saor more than the snor in the sbr similarly both the snirr and snrr illustrated a descending tendency with the increase of otc concentration which was attributed to the inhibitory impact of otc on the biological reduction of nitrite and nitrate compared to the absence of otc the snirr and snrr reduced by 21 62 and 9 92 at 30 mg l otc respectively the change of snirr and snrr indicated that otc produced more inhibition on nitrite reduction than nitrate reduction some researchers have also reported that other antibiotics e g florfenicol and norfloxacin could inhibit the nitrifying and denitrifying rates of sequencing batch biofilm reactors 34 35 3 3 variation of microbial enzymatic activity under otc stress the microbial enzymatic activities were analyzed to further assess the effect of otc on the sbr performance compared with the absence of otc the dha had no distinct change at 10 mg l otc and declined by 19 82 at 20 mg l otc and 33 3 at 30 mg l otc fig 3 a which displayed the similar changing tendency to the sour under otc stress dha is reported to be closely associated with the biodegradation of organic pollutants which conducts the substance and energy exchange through the acceleration of dehydrogenation oxidization reaction 36 the variation of dha demonstrated that higher otc concentration exerted an obvious inhibition on the dehydrogenase activity and might further affect the organic matter removal yang et al 37 have also indicated that dha can catalyze microbial dehydrogenizing process and enhance the removal of hydrogen atom from organic matter as shown in fig 3b both the amo and nor activity slightly reduced at 10 30 mg l otc amo from ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nor from nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob can catalyze the ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation under aerobic condition respectively 38 the amo and nor activity displayed a similar changing trend to the saor and snor respectively by contrast with 0 mg l otc the amo and nor activity diminished by 17 39 and 20 87 at 30 mg l otc which demonstrated that otc produced less inhibition on aob than nob as illustrated in fig 3c both the nir and nr activity illustrated a descending tendency with the increase of otc concentration which indicated that otc inhibited nitrite reducing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria the nir and nr activity displayed a similar changing tendency with the snirr and snrr respectively it was concluded that the inhibition of denitrification rates was caused by the reduction of nir and nr under otc stress compared with 0 mg l otc the nir and nr activity had a decrease of 20 85 and 21 21 at 30 mg l otc respectively the variation of nir and nr activity illustrated that otc produced the almost same inhibition on the nitrite reducing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria of sbr 3 4 variation of microbial ros and ldh under otc stress to assess the otc toxicity to activated sludge the microbial ros and ldh have been investigated at different otc concentrations fig 4 compared with 0 mg l otc the ros production had no obvious change at 10 mg l otc whereas the ros production raised 13 22 at 20 mg l otc and 24 16 at 30 mg l otc the ros variation displayed that otc at higher concentration could promote the microorganisms to generate higher ros production ros was known as the inevitable by product of normal cellular metabolism which can be removed by intracellular antioxidant system however more ros production can destroy the microbial intracellular components and further affect microbial function 39 40 higher ros production could destroy the equilibrium between oxidization and antioxidization to exert the toxic effects to microorganisms and further affect the organic matter degradation and nitrogen removal 41 ldh was regarded as an indicator to investigate the integrity of cytomembrane under unfavorable external conditions 42 by contrast with the absence of otc the ldh release raised 5 24 at 10 mg l otc which indicated less than 10 mg l otc hardly affected the microbial cytomembrane integrity however the microbial ldh release increased by 14 84 at 20 mg l otc and 18 70 at 30 mg l otc by comparison with 0 mg l otc the higher ldh release could destroy the integrity of cell membrane and alter the microbial morphology which might affect the microbial physiological functions of activated sludge 3 5 variation of microbial community under otc stress to evaluate the long term effect of otc concentrations on the microbial community the variations of microbial richness and diversity have been investigated at 0 5 10 and 30 mg l otc as shown in table 3 the effective sequences of the obtained sludge samples on day 73 152 200 and 288 were categorized as 1280 1180 1055 and 933 operational taxonomic units otus based on 3 nucleotide cutoff compared with 0 mg l otc the chao1 and ace indices of obtained sludge samples displayed a slight increase at 5 mg l otc and then reduced at 10 and 30 mg l otc the shannon index decreased from 7 822 to 5 895 with the increase of otc concentration from 0 to 10 mg l and then increased to 6 641 at 30 mg l otc whereas the simpson index increased or reduced at different otc concentrations the current results indicated that otc exerted some distinct variations on the microbial diversity and richness the good s coverage of the above mentioned samples at different otc concentrations exceeded 0 990 which indicated that the acquired sequencing library almost covered the microbial species of sbr according to principal coordinate analysis fig 5 the microbial community under otc stress was divided into three groups a 0 and 5 mg l b 10 mg l and c 30 mg l which suggested higher otc concentration exerted a greater effect on the microbial composition to further analyze the succession of microbial community under otc stress the microbial communities at different otc concentrations were compared at the phylum class and genus level as illustrated in fig 6 a the predominant phyla at each otc concentration were proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes actinobacteria planctomycetes acidobacteria chlorobi armatimonadetes and nitrospirae the relative abundance of proteobacteria varied in range of 64 18 and 73 46 at 0 30 mg l otc bacteroidetes displayed an incremental trend in relative abundance with the increase of otc concentration by contrast with the absence of otc chloroflexi and nitrospirae showed a little increment in relative abundance at 5 mg l otc and then declined at 10 and 30 mg l otc actinobacteria planctomycetes acidobacteria and chlorobi gradually decreased in relative abundance from 6 16 2 05 1 89 and 1 88 at 0 mg l otc to 0 70 0 51 0 50 and 0 56 at 30 mg l otc respectively compared with 0 mg l otc firmicutes slightly decreased in relative abundance at 10 mg l otc and then increased at 30 mg l otc whereas armatimonadetes increased in relative abundances at 5 and 10 mg l otc and reduced at 30 mg l otc the predominant classes were alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria saprospirae and epsilonproteobacteria whereas their relative abundances increased or decreased under each otc concentration by comparing with 0 mg l otc fig 6b both planctomycetia and actinobacteria decreased in relative abundances with the increment of otc concentration flavobacteriia and bacteroidia kept an increasing tendency in relative abundances with the increase of otc concentration by contrast with the absence of otc anaerolineae and cytophagia illustrated a slight increment in relative abundances at 5 mg l otc and then declined at 10 and 30 mg l otc as illustrated in fig 6c both nitrosospira and nitrospira showed a descending tendency in relative abundance with the increase of otc concentration nitrosospira are able to transform ammonia into nitrite and nitrospira have the capability to oxidize nitrite to nitrate 43 44 the relative abundances of some denitrifying genera including azospirillum 45 azoarcus 46 hyphomicrobium 47 and thermomonas 48 had obvious reduction at 30 mg l otc by comparison with 0 mg l otc the presence of otc inhibited the growth development and reproduction of some denitrifying genera and then inhibited the nir and nr activities of activated sludge which might further affect the snirr and snrr however the denitrifying genera paracoccus 49 and dechloromonas 50 displayed some increase at 30 mg l otc by comparing with 0 mg l otc suggesting that they might have good tolerant ability to the otc biotoxicity compared with the absence of otc candidatus accumulibacter had a decrease in relative abundance at 5 10 and 30 mg l otc candidatus accumulibacter can utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor for phosphorus uptake in activated sludge 51 some genera including dokdonella arenimonas pseudoxanthomonas flavihumibacter and phycicoccus kept a decreasing tendency in relative abundances with the increase of otc concentration however flavobacterium and haliscomenobacter maintained an increment trend in relative abundance with the increase of otc concentration additionally some genera reduced or enhanced in relative abundance under otc stress by comparison with 0 mg l otc such as rhodobacter rhizobium hydrogenophaga thermochromatium and arcobacter 4 conclusions the cod and nh4 n removal of sbr did not change at 0 5 mg l otc and then declined with the increase of otc concentration from 5 to 30 mg l the sour and dha activity maintained a stable value at 0 10 mg l otc whereas declined at 20 30 mg l otc the nitrification rate denitrification rate and enzymatic activity related to nitrogen removal kept a gradually decreasing trend with the increase of otc concentration higher otc concentrations enhanced the microbial ros production and ldh release of sbr the microbial abundance and diversity displayed some distinct changes at different otc concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work all the authors

13964,oily bilge water obw is complex wastewater generated from ship operation in the present study the application of ozonation pretreatment before the sequential batch reactor sbr for removing organics and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha production from complex obw were investigated obw was subjected to lab scale ozone pretreatment under the various experimental conditions such as a specific reaction time 0 min 120 min inlet ozone dose 0 5 g l 2 5 g l and solution ph 4 8 pretreatment of obw by ozone improved biodegradability index bdi from 0 36 to 0 52 the gc ms analysis revealed that the bdi enhancement was due to the formation of water soluble carboxylic groups after 75 min of ozonation operated at solution ph 6 and 2 g l of o3 dose the cods removal efficiency was 68 and 92 for sbr and ozonized sbr respectively also the biopolymer production rate was increased by 4 5 folds for ozonized sbr as the bioconversion of carboxylic compounds by using a mixed bacterial consortium mbc was stress free the functional groups and thermal property of the produced pha were tested by various analytical techniques these results confirmed that the bioconversion of ozonized obw into valuable biological polyesters using mbc keywords oily bilge water pretreatment ozonation sequential batch reactor bioconversion biopolymer 1 introduction shipboard oily wastewater and its derivatives have been a serious environmental issue worldwide 1 2 in the indian scenario it is stated that more than 90 95 of international goods are transported through ships in the sea as its cost of transportation is efficient 3 during the ship operation it produces three different categories of wastewater namely oily bilge water obw black water and grey water 4 in particular the treatment of obw from engine rooms of ships and oil tanks washing has geared up as it contains complex petroleum hydrocarbons salts surfactants oils cleaning solvents and trace metals this contaminated water is stored in the bilge tank of the ships 5 the accidental spill or discharge of this obw into the sea may cause extraordinary loss of energy extreme natural contamination by hydrocarbon and causing serious environmental pollution in both terrestrial and marine ecosystem 6 the international maritime organization imo prohibited the release of obw contaminants containing oil and grease o g more than 15 mg l into the sea 5 traditionally to meet the imo guidelines it is separated by using oil water separator ows system 7 as obw contains a mixture of oil and surfactants derived from cleaning agent forms emulsion of oil droplets size less than 20 μm which inhibits the oil water separation and reduces the efficiency of ows however the filtration process coupled with reverse osmosis were employed to enhance the separation of the organic oil phase and aqueous phase but it cannot degrade the pollutants present in the obw 8 to counter this commonly employed treatment technologies for the degradation of obw include electrocoagulation floatation batch electrocoagulation 9 10 photocatalysis air stripping 11 hybrid up flow anaerobic sludge bioreactor huasb 12 biofilm membrane bioreactor bfmbr 13 moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr 14 etc firstly the coupling of photocatalysis with air stripping was studied for the degradation of hydrocarbon and o g its extensive aeration converts 10 of hydrocarbon lead to the risk of air emission such as volatile organic carbon 11 mancini et al 15 studied the post biological treatment bfmbr coupled with granular activated carbon gac was adopted for the degradation of emulsified oily wastewater with high salinity content in the presence of salt tolerant microorganisms bfmbr showed 72 effluent cod removal efficiency 15 corsino et al 2015 reported that aerobic granulation could tolerate and degrade toxic organic compounds present in obw despite 25 g l of salinity concentration but it took longer acclimatization period for excellent carbon removal the former showed better good degradation effect in a shorter period than the latter took longer acclimatisation period as obw contains complex hydrocarbons such as cycloalkanes alkenes and alkanes the treatment technologies discussed earlier has its own merits and demerits because this may depend on the complexity of operations capital investment and operating costs 16 the selection of treatment technology relays mainly on the constituents of the wastewater in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops coupled with biological process for the treatment of oily wastewater is trending because of its ability to completely degrade and mineralise the organic pollutants 17 19 among aops ozone is an effective oxidizing agent 17 in particular it oxidizes a wide range of double bond carbon polyaromatic hydrocarbons pah into smaller molecules 20 it is well known that ozone can interact with pollutants in two ways namely i direct reactions i e ozone itself directly attacks the ozone reactive compounds ii indirect reactions i e hydroxyl radicals o h react with recalcitrant pollutants 21 additionally the researchers have studied the effectiveness of ozone pre treatment for enhancing the biodegradability of palm oil mill effluent 17 22 barley straw 23 oily sand process affected water 24 municipal wastewater molasses wastewater 25 26 and phenolic compounds 27 to produce biohydrogen biochemical methane and pha production 17 22 25 however the operating cost of hybrid aops is high to overcome this problem it is necessary to develop energy efficient technology for the treatment of obw therefore ozone pretreatment can favour the subsequent aerobic process and accelerate the biodegradability of obw 28 29 based on the previous studies reported by various researchers the range of operational parameters such as ozone dose 0 6 g of o3 h l to 6 g of o3 h l 24 27 duration of ozonation 10 min 300 min 18 30 and ph 1 9 were selected 18 24 recently some researchers have revealed that biological treatments coupled with aops are giving good results in the degradation of oil water emulsion in a study of dairy wastewater and polyaromatic hydrocarbon pah ozone pre treatment with subsequent biological treatment resulted in 95 of cod removal and it also enhanced the biodegradability of pah 31 32 thus the coupling of ozonation with sbr was established to be an economical method for degrading unsaturated hydrocarbon present in obw because ozonation before biological treatment enhanced biodegradability index bdi of complex wastewater 33 in our previous study 34 demonstrated the effectiveness of aerobic sbr for organics removal and production of polyhydroxyalkanoates pha from synthetic obw rich in both hydrocarbon and salt content using novel mixed bacterial consortium mbc also the study explained the effect of high salinity on pha production and concluded that the wastewater with less cods 5000 mg l and low salinity yielded more pha than the wastewater rich in more cods and high salinity therefore to reduce the organic load pretreatment was employed few researchers indicated that the pre treatment of leachate 35 waste activated sludge 36 olive oil 37 phenol 38 oil sands process water 24 prior to sbr improved the pha production capability by improving the biodegradability of wastewater thus in the present study the ozonation pre treatment technique was employed to enhance the biodegradability of obw initially the influence of process parameters such as reaction time ozone dose and solution ph on organic removal was investigated secondly sbr was incorporated for the synthesis of pha from ozonized obw and its thermal properties of pha were studied using tga and dsc analysis the change in characteristics of obw was studied using gcms analysis 2 materials and method 2 1 ozonation pretreatment process ozone was produced by an ozone generator faraday ozone india ozonation was carried out in a 2 l glass reactor ozone was supplied to the device through a ceramic diffuser located at the bottom of the reactor the outlet of the reactor was passed through a potassium iodide trap to absorb residual ozone concentration in the gas phase 2 2 aerobic sequential batch reactor the inoculum microorganisms for the aerobic sbr was isolated from oil contaminated soil collected from karaikal port india using bushnell haas bh medium selective medium for hydrocarbon degrading bacteria the phylogenetic analysis of isolated strains was conducted by using chromatogram software the chromatogram data file was

of obw were studied before and after pre treatment with ozone followed by an sbr biological reactor the ph meter metrohm switzerland was used to measure ph and also the conductivity meter metrohm switzerland was used to measure the conductivity of the samples the chloride total nitrogen bod5 total and soluble cod were analyzed as per standard methods for water and wastewater 55 the o g content was measured as per iso 11349 gravimetric method briefly 500 ml sample was taken in a separating funnel and 5 ml of 1 1 hcl was added to it to reduce the ph of the solution less than 2 to the mixture 25 ml of solvent n hexane was added and mixed it for 2 min and the clear solution was separated the clear solution was passed to the filter paper no 40 and the solution was collected in a crucible and

japan after filtering the samples through the 0 45 μm glass filter paper the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured 55 to evaluate the organic compounds the solid phase extraction spe of obw raw and ozone pretreated was conducted as per iso 9377 2 2000 briefly i 4 5 g of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate was added to 50 ml of obw ii the ph of the sample was adjusted to 2 using hcl iii twice 25 ml of n hexane was added to the sample and solvent phase was extracted 11 after spe the water extracts were analyzed using gc ms bruker usa the carrier gas helium was supplied at flow rate of 1 ml min and sample volume of 1 μl the oven temperature of gc column db 5ms was detained for 3 min at 50 c and then the programmed heating was supplied at a rate of 10 c min from 50 c to 280 c 2 5 characterization of pha fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectral analysis was employed to detect the functional groups present in the produced biomass the extracted biomass and potassium bromide kbr was mixed in the ratio of 1 3 respectively to form kbr pellet this pellet was subjected to sense ftir spectrum in the range between 400 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 using a bruker spectrometer germany the thermal property of pha was studied using thermo gravimetric analysis tga perkin elmer usa this analysis was carried out using nitrogen as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 50 ml min around 7 4 mg of extracted pha was taken in an aluminium pan and exposed to a heating rate of 20 c min from atmospheric temperature to 600 c the differential scanning calorimetry dsc analysis was carried out to find the thermal property of pha produced by mbc using obw indium standard was used for the calibration of the equipment perkin elmer usa the sample was heated from 30 c to 400 c at 10 c min using the dsc spectrogram the decomposition temperature td was determined for the produced biomass the surface morphology and qualitative elemental analysis were examined using scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray edx bruker germany respectively the produced biomass cells were fixed with 6 glutaraldehyde ph 7 4 for 4 h and washed with phosphate buffer the sample was subjected to dehydration with various ethanol concentrations 30 50 70 90 95 100 v v as reported by 40 then the prepared sample was examined for surface morphology 2 6 statistical analysis if two different sets of data are significantly different from each other student s t test is applied this statistical analysis test was applied to the data obtained under the null hypothesis to check the significance of the differences between the organic removal and mlvss yield achieved by the reference aerobic sbr alone and the sbr coupled with the ozone pre treatment of obw the student s value also called t value to test whether the means are different was calculated for organics removal and mlvss in the presence and absence of ozone pretreatment for obw then the associated p value for obw was determined using a table of values from student s t distribution finally the threshold of 5 was chosen for the statistical significance of the difference between the means accordingly if the p value is below the threshold of 5 then the null hypothesis can be overruled and it can be concluded that the two sets of data are statistically significant 3 results and discussion the objective of the present study was to investigate ozone as an effective pretreatment method for obw to enhance the organic removal and synthesis of biopolymer therefore initially experiments of the ozonation process were carried out to identify the optimum conditions of obw pretreatment subsequently followed by an aerobic sbr was operated for the production of pha from obw using mbc which was isolated from bilge water contaminated site karaikal port india 3 1 phylogenetic analysis of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria the taxonomy of pseudomonas species isolated from obw contaminated site was examined and found based on their comparisons with their physical or genetic characteristics that are conventional by phylogenetic analysis the phylogenetic taxonomy for the identified organisms is presented in fig 1 a and b it confirms that they belong to pseudomonas tuomuerensis ncbi accession number kp973997 and pseudomonas nitroreducens ncbi accession number jf513136 respectively mbc prepared from these two hydrocarbon degrading bacteria was used as inoculum for sbr 3 2 characteristics of wastewater obw characteristics were performed as per standard methods 55 the prepared synthetic obw had a ph of 7 16 and the biodegradable index bod5 cods value of 0 36 which means less biodegradability for subsequent biological treatment the concentration of total cod codt soluble cod cods chloride o g dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were 23 5 g l 14 g l 13 g l 3 9 g l 4 67 g l and 0 2 g l respectively it was observed that the presence of high organic load and limited nutrients in obw favour the pha accumulation 2 3 3 effect of ozonation time on organic removal the chemical oxidation reactor was operated for 0 120 min with constant ozone dosage of 2 g l the sampling was done at a uniform interval of 15 min fig 2 indicates clearly that the removal efficiency of cods increases with an increase in ozone exposure the codt decreased from 23 36 g l to 7 72 g l at the end of 75 min of ozonation and then it remained constant it was also observed that the ratio of cods to codt reached a maximum value at 75 min further increase in contact time up to 120 min decreases the ratio of cods to codt this implies that the treated obw contains more of particulate organic matter when compared to the soluble form it is due to the response of excess ozone molecules interact and forms a bridge between already formed amphiphilic atoms and double bond hydrocarbon present in obw 41 a similar result was observed for natural organic water subjected to ozonation 42 to employ subsequent biological treatment the biodegradable fraction should be higher even though cods at 75 min is more than the cods at contact times less than 75 min the high ratio of cods to codt favours the subsequent biological oxidation therefore 75 min contact time is kept constant for further studies 3 4 effect of ozone dosage on organic removal the ozone dosage is a vital operational parameter affecting the efficiency of the ozonation process because mineralization of carbonyl compounds strongly depends on the ozone dose at the contact time of 75 min the effect of ozone dosage on obw ozonation was studied with ozone dosage ranging from 0 5 g l to 2 5 g l the impact of ozone dosage on cod removal and o g concentration is given in fig 3 a the increase of ozone dosage enhanced cods and o g removal for each dosage the ratio of cods codt also has been increased but after 2 g l of ozone dose the slight reduction of ratio was observed at the ozone dosage of 2 0 g l the o g removal was maximum 55 8 after 75 min of ozonation the variation of ph and conductivity with respect to ozone dose is depicted in fig 3 b it was also observed that when the dosage was increased to 2 5 g l the conductivity also increased with the ozone dosage due to the formation of carboxylic acid groups originating from the degradation of hydrocarbons these ozonation byproducts organic acids formed during the oxidation of hydrocarbons reduced the solution ph of obw 20 3 5 effect of solution ph of pre ozonation on organic removal with ozone dosage of 2 g l and contact time of 75 min the effect of solution ph fig 4 a on soluble organics was studied with ph variation in the range of 4 8 at solution ph of 4 6 7 and 8 the cods removal efficiency was observed as 41 7 68 3 64 5 and 37 6 respectively from obw this result indicated that at ph 6 the removal efficiency of cods was maximum when compared to ph 4 7 and 8 the results of solution ph with time is shown in fig 4 b at ph 6 ph greater than pka of ozone dissociation 4 8 the presence of chloride ions in the obw enhances the ozone decomposition as per eq 2 and via hydroxyl radicals from eqs 3 8 through a radical reaction mechanism this reaction further extends up to eq 10 the reactions for radical generation and ozone decomposition in the presence of salt p in water are given in eqs 2 11 21 43 1 o 3 p products 2 o 3 o h o 2 h 2 o i n i t i a t i o n s t e p 3 h o 2 o h o 2 h 2 o a t p k a 4 8 20 c 4 o 2 o 3 o 3 o 2 5 o 3 h h o 3 5b o 3 p h o 3 6 h o 3 o h o 2 7 h o o 3 h o 4 8 h o 4 h o 2 o 2 9 h o 4 h o 2 h 2 o 2 2 o 2 10 h o p r o d u c t also the reaction of chloride ion with hydroxyl radical takes place only at acidic ph this condition favours the decomposition of ozone as well as the production of hydroxyl radicals leading to more removal of cods through indirect reactions at the same time the production of low molecular organic acids originating from the degradation of hydrocarbons lower the effluent ph approximately 50 of the cods was removed within 30 min contact time further an increase in contact time beyond 30 min lowers the solution ph below the pka equilibrium thus reduces the cods removal after 30 min at ph less than pka there is no ozone decomposition via radicals 43 under this condition the eq 2 and eq 3 are responsible for the decomposition of ozone the removal of soluble organics was accomplished only by direct attack of hydrocarbons by ozone 43 the same trend has been observed for ph 7 at ph 4 ph less than pka the effluent ph was reduced further with the contact time and 41 7 soluble organics was obtained only by direct attack of hydrocarbons by ozone 43 at ph 8 the presence of salts like sulphates or carbonates present in obw which are inhibitors of hydroxyl radicals leads to mechanism termination step is eq 11 it reduces the cods removal at greater ph the slight reduction of ph of the treated obw with time implies that there was no formation of acids during degradation of organics the o g removal efficiency were 48 11 59 10 55 87 and 56 25 for ph 4 6 7 and 8 respectively are shown in fig 4 c the optimum experimental condition of aop treatment was obtained at an ozone concentration of 2 0 g l and a ph of 6 for 75 min further studies were carried out with the above optimum conditions 3 6 gcms analysis gcms was performed to explore the interaction of ozone with obw containing high salinity its degradation pathway contains a three step process i hydroxylation of organics ii oxidation of intermediate compounds of aromatics iii carboxylic group formation 44 several peaks had been identified between retention times of 8 55 min 40 71 min the table 1 shows the new compounds formed after ozonation of obw for 75 min the major compounds formed after ozonation of obw are oxalic acid isobutyl ester acetic acid di propionic acid most of the byproducts were carboxylic acids which are easily biodegradable by mbc used in this study similar compounds were reported from ozonation of hydrocarbons by 45 46 3 7 combined ozonation and sbr treatment the sbr configuration and optimum operational condition were taken from our previous work 34 from the present study optimal condition of ozone pretreatment was explored as contact time 75 min o3 dose 2 g l ph 6 for the subsequent biological treatment the effect of cods removal and mlvss were studied these results are shown in fig 5 the steady state of sbr reached in 14 16 cycle of operation the final cods and mlvss concentrations of ozonized sbr at end of steady state were 1 02 g l and 5 5 g l respectively the pha production obtained was 1 66 g pha l which is 45 05 of its cdm 3 8 comparison of sbr and ozone pretreated sbr for organic removal and pha production the performance of three processes namely sbr ozonation and ozonation coupled with sbr for the treatment of obw is given in table 2 from table 2 it was observed that the ozonation coupled with sbr shows maximum removal efficiency for all the pollutants studied when compared with the individual processes the ozonation process enhanced bod5 cods ratio of obw from 0 36 to 0 52 which supports the subsequent biological treatment this is due to the conversion of complex hydrocarbons into water soluble by products the performance of sbr for raw obw and ozonized obw in terms of mlss cdm and pha production are given in table 3 from the results it was inferred that both the carbon sources support the growth of biomass at the same time the cdm retained during the extraction of pha was much lesser in case of sbr treating raw obw when compared to other systems the presence of lipophilic compounds in the form of aromatics cycloalkanes alkanes alcohols present in treated obw may accumulate on the membranes of microorganisms and damage the structural and functional properties of these membranes as a result the membrane loses its integrity and leads to cell lysis 47 this may be the possible reason for the retention of less amount of cdm even with more mlss growth and substrate consumption these lipophilic compounds may be converted into simpler soluble substances such as carboxylic acid and aldehydes 20 during ozonation helps to retain more amount of cdm even with lesser substrate consumption and biomass growth almost 42 45 of cdm has been converted into pha in both systems the presence of sodium chloride in raw obw and ozonised obw affects the amount of pha inside the cells and also the production rate 48 the student s t test statistical analysis was employed to check the significance of the variations on the organic removal biomass growth and pha yields achieved with and without the coupling of ozone pretreatment it was applied for samples with unequal variance with the level of significance of 0 05 under the null hypothesis the results of statistical analysis are given in table 4 it shows that the p values of both the parameters are below 0 05 this means that the null hypothesis for these parameters can be rejected in other words coupling ozone with sbr improved the organic removal efficiency and the comparative results are given in table 4 3 9 characterization of biopolymer ftir spectrum of pha produced by mbc using obw is shown in fig 6 a the strong absorption peak at 1014 cm 1 indicates the stretching vibrations of co groups the sharp bend at 1454 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 may be due to the bending and stretching of the methyl ch3 group 49 the absorption peak at 1731 cm 1 indicates the pha maker ester carbonyl co group and peak at 2921 cm 1 denote the asymmetric ch3 group the peak at 3679 cm 1 depicts the hydroxyl oh group 50 similar pha absorption peaks were obtained for pha produced by pseudomonas putida isolated from palm oil effluent 51 to study the thermal property of the biopolymer tga curve was measured from the temperature range of 32 39 c 600 c is illustrated in fig 6 b pha extracted by using sodium hypochlorite naclo method is thermally stable up to a temperature of 218 c the degradation of produced pha took place in a single step process from 218 c to 332 83 c at which the biopolymer chain breaks release of co co2 ch4 and ch3cooh 52 the maximum weight loss of 29 29 was observed at a temperature of 300 5 c further weight loss occurred due to the presence of unwanted debris attached to the bacterial biomass dsc spectrum analysis gives the thermal behaviour of the pha produced using mbc and extracted by naclo method is stable it is shown in fig 6 c at initial heating the melting point tm and the enthalpy of fusion δhf of the standard were 155 2 c and 28 45 j g during the second heating pha degradation was observed at 248 c which is similar to pha produced from pseudomonas putida 53 sem with edx spectroscopy of the extracted pha from mbc was performed the percentage weight of carbon c and oxygen o is 59 22 and 28 18 which are higher than the other elements and it is comparable with standard synthetic pha similar results were obtained for the pha extracted from ralstonia eutropha was reported by saratale and oh 54 nevertheless we conclude that the bioconversion of ozonized obw to biopolymer is feasible both quantitative as well as qualitative 4 conclusions the present work establishes the feasibility of ozonized sbr for obw treatment and synthesis of pha at optimized conditions ozone dose 2 g l ph 6 and contact time 75 min cods removal efficiency was observed as 92 and also enhanced the pha production by 4 5 fold the formation of carboxylic groups during ozonation of obw enhanced the pha production which was explored using gcms analysis the functional groups and thermal stability of pha obtained were identified by using ftir spectrum tga analysis dsc analysis are significant and stable thus ozonation coupled with sbr is an effective process for synthesis of biopolymer and treatment of obw declaration of competing interest

13964,oily bilge water obw is complex wastewater generated from ship operation in the present study the application of ozonation pretreatment before the sequential batch reactor sbr for removing organics and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha production from complex obw were investigated obw was subjected to lab scale ozone pretreatment under the various experimental conditions such as a specific reaction time 0 min 120 min inlet ozone dose 0 5 g l 2 5 g l and solution ph 4 8 pretreatment of obw by ozone improved biodegradability index bdi from 0 36 to 0 52 the gc ms analysis revealed that the bdi enhancement was due to the formation of water soluble carboxylic groups after 75 min of ozonation operated at solution ph 6 and 2 g l of o3 dose the cods removal efficiency was 68 and 92 for sbr and ozonized sbr respectively also the biopolymer production rate was increased by 4 5 folds for ozonized sbr as the bioconversion of carboxylic compounds by using a mixed bacterial consortium mbc was stress free the functional groups and thermal property of the produced pha were tested by various analytical techniques these results confirmed that the bioconversion of ozonized obw into valuable biological polyesters using mbc keywords oily bilge water pretreatment ozonation sequential batch reactor bioconversion biopolymer 1 introduction shipboard oily wastewater and its derivatives have been a serious environmental issue worldwide 1 2 in the indian scenario it is stated that more than 90 95 of international goods are transported through ships in the sea as its cost of transportation is efficient 3 during the ship operation it produces three different categories of wastewater namely oily bilge water obw black water and grey water 4 in particular the treatment of obw from engine rooms of ships and oil tanks washing has geared up as it contains complex petroleum hydrocarbons salts surfactants oils cleaning solvents and trace metals this contaminated water is stored in the bilge tank of the ships 5 the accidental spill or discharge of this obw into the sea may cause extraordinary loss of energy extreme natural contamination by hydrocarbon and causing serious environmental pollution in both terrestrial and marine ecosystem 6 the international maritime organization imo prohibited the release of obw contaminants containing oil and grease o g more than 15 mg l into the sea 5 traditionally to meet the imo guidelines it is separated by using oil water separator ows system 7 as obw contains a mixture of oil and surfactants derived from cleaning agent forms emulsion of oil droplets size less than 20 μm which inhibits the oil water separation and reduces the efficiency of ows however the filtration process coupled with reverse osmosis were employed to enhance the separation of the organic oil phase and aqueous phase but it cannot degrade the pollutants present in the obw 8 to counter this commonly employed treatment technologies for the degradation of obw include electrocoagulation floatation batch electrocoagulation 9 10 photocatalysis air stripping 11 hybrid up flow anaerobic sludge bioreactor huasb 12 biofilm membrane bioreactor bfmbr 13 moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr 14 etc firstly the coupling of photocatalysis with air stripping was studied for the degradation of hydrocarbon and o g its extensive aeration converts 10 of hydrocarbon lead to the risk of air emission such as volatile organic carbon 11 mancini et al 15 studied the post biological treatment bfmbr coupled with granular activated carbon gac was adopted for the degradation of emulsified oily wastewater with high salinity content in the presence of salt tolerant microorganisms bfmbr showed 72 effluent cod removal efficiency 15 corsino et al 2015 reported that aerobic granulation could tolerate and degrade toxic organic compounds present in obw despite 25 g l of salinity concentration but it took longer acclimatization period for excellent carbon removal the former showed better good degradation effect in a shorter period than the latter took longer acclimatisation period as obw contains complex hydrocarbons such as cycloalkanes alkenes and alkanes the treatment technologies discussed earlier has its own merits and demerits because this may depend on the complexity of operations capital investment and operating costs 16 the selection of treatment technology relays mainly on the constituents of the wastewater in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops coupled with biological process for the treatment of oily wastewater is trending because of its ability to completely degrade and mineralise the organic pollutants 17 19 among aops ozone is an effective oxidizing agent 17 in particular it oxidizes a wide range of double bond carbon polyaromatic hydrocarbons pah into smaller molecules 20 it is well known that ozone can interact with pollutants in two ways namely i direct reactions i e ozone itself directly attacks the ozone reactive compounds ii indirect reactions i e hydroxyl radicals o h react with recalcitrant pollutants 21 additionally the researchers have studied the effectiveness of ozone pre treatment for enhancing the biodegradability of palm oil mill effluent 17 22 barley straw 23 oily sand process affected water 24 municipal wastewater molasses wastewater 25 26 and phenolic compounds 27 to produce biohydrogen biochemical methane and pha production 17 22 25 however the operating cost of hybrid aops is high to overcome this problem it is necessary to develop energy efficient technology for the treatment of obw therefore ozone pretreatment can favour the subsequent aerobic process and accelerate the biodegradability of obw 28 29 based on the previous studies reported by various researchers the range of operational parameters such as ozone dose 0 6 g of o3 h l to 6 g of o3 h l 24 27 duration of ozonation 10 min 300 min 18 30 and ph 1 9 were selected 18 24 recently some researchers have revealed that biological treatments coupled with aops are giving good results in the degradation of oil water emulsion in a study of dairy wastewater and polyaromatic hydrocarbon pah ozone pre treatment with subsequent biological treatment resulted in 95 of cod removal and it also enhanced the biodegradability of pah 31 32 thus the coupling of ozonation with sbr was established to be an economical method for degrading unsaturated hydrocarbon present in obw because ozonation before biological treatment enhanced biodegradability index bdi of complex wastewater 33 in our previous study 34 demonstrated the effectiveness of aerobic sbr for organics removal and production of polyhydroxyalkanoates pha from synthetic obw rich in both hydrocarbon and salt content using novel mixed bacterial consortium mbc also the study explained the effect of high salinity on pha production and concluded that the wastewater with less cods 5000 mg l and low salinity yielded more pha than the wastewater rich in more cods and high salinity therefore to reduce the organic load pretreatment was employed few researchers indicated that the pre treatment of leachate 35 waste activated sludge 36 olive oil 37 phenol 38 oil sands process water 24 prior to sbr improved the pha production capability by improving the biodegradability of wastewater thus in the present study the ozonation pre treatment technique was employed to enhance the biodegradability of obw initially the influence of process parameters such as reaction time ozone dose and solution ph on organic removal was investigated secondly sbr was incorporated for the synthesis of pha from ozonized obw and its thermal properties of pha were studied using tga and dsc analysis the change in characteristics of obw was studied using gcms analysis 2 materials and method 2 1 ozonation pretreatment process ozone was produced by an ozone generator faraday ozone india ozonation was carried out in a 2 l glass reactor

bushnell haas bh medium selective medium for hydrocarbon degrading bacteria the phylogenetic analysis of isolated strains was conducted by using chromatogram software the chromatogram data file was

organic compounds the solid phase extraction spe of obw raw and ozone pretreated was conducted as per iso 9377 2 2000 briefly i 4 5 g of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate was added to 50 ml of obw ii the ph of the sample was adjusted to 2 using hcl iii twice 25 ml of n hexane was added to the sample and solvent phase was extracted 11 after spe the water extracts were analyzed using gc ms bruker

ozone pre treatment of obw the student s value also called t value to test whether the means are different was calculated for organics removal and mlvss in the presence and absence of ozone pretreatment for obw then the associated p value for obw was determined using a table of values from student s t distribution finally the threshold of 5 was chosen for the statistical significance of the difference between the means accordingly if the p value is below the threshold of 5 then the null hypothesis can be overruled and it can be concluded that the two sets of data are statistically significant 3 results and discussion the objective of the present study was to investigate ozone as an effective pretreatment method for obw to enhance the organic removal and synthesis of biopolymer therefore initially experiments of the ozonation process were carried out to identify the optimum conditions of obw pretreatment subsequently followed by an aerobic sbr was operated for the production of pha from obw using mbc which was isolated from bilge water contaminated site karaikal port india 3 1 phylogenetic analysis of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria the taxonomy of pseudomonas species isolated from obw contaminated site was examined and found based on their comparisons with their physical or genetic characteristics that are conventional by phylogenetic analysis the phylogenetic taxonomy for the identified organisms is presented in fig 1 a and b it confirms that they belong to pseudomonas tuomuerensis ncbi accession number kp973997 and pseudomonas nitroreducens ncbi accession number jf513136 respectively mbc prepared from these two hydrocarbon degrading bacteria was used as inoculum for sbr 3 2 characteristics of wastewater obw characteristics were performed as per standard methods 55 the prepared synthetic obw had a ph of 7 16 and the biodegradable index bod5 cods value of 0 36 which means less biodegradability for subsequent biological treatment the concentration of total cod codt soluble cod cods chloride o g dissolved organic carbon doc and total nitrogen tn were 23 5 g l 14 g l 13 g l 3 9 g l 4 67 g l and 0 2 g l respectively it was observed that the presence of high organic load and limited nutrients in obw favour the pha accumulation 2 3 3 effect of ozonation time on organic removal the chemical oxidation reactor was operated for 0 120 min with constant ozone dosage of 2 g l the sampling was done at a uniform interval of 15 min fig 2 indicates clearly that the removal efficiency of cods increases with an increase in ozone exposure the codt decreased from 23 36 g l to 7 72 g l at the end of 75 min of ozonation and then it remained constant it was also observed that the ratio of cods to codt reached a maximum value at 75 min further increase in contact time up to 120 min decreases the ratio of cods to codt this implies that the treated obw contains more of particulate organic matter when compared to the soluble form it is due to the response of excess ozone molecules interact and forms a bridge between already formed amphiphilic atoms and double bond hydrocarbon present in obw 41 a similar result was observed for natural organic water subjected to ozonation 42 to employ subsequent biological treatment the biodegradable fraction should be higher even though cods at 75 min is more than the cods at contact times less than 75 min the high ratio of cods to codt favours the subsequent biological oxidation therefore 75 min contact time is kept constant for further studies 3 4 effect of ozone dosage on organic removal the ozone dosage is a vital operational parameter affecting the efficiency of the ozonation process because mineralization of carbonyl compounds strongly depends on the ozone dose at the contact time of 75 min the effect of ozone dosage on obw ozonation was studied with ozone dosage ranging from 0 5 g l to 2 5 g l the impact of ozone dosage on cod removal and o g concentration is given in fig 3 a the increase of ozone dosage enhanced cods and o g removal for each dosage the ratio of cods codt also has been increased but after 2 g l of ozone dose the slight reduction of ratio was observed at the ozone dosage of 2 0 g l the o g removal was maximum 55 8 after 75 min of ozonation the variation of ph and conductivity with respect to ozone dose is depicted in fig 3 b it was also observed that when the dosage was increased to 2 5 g l the conductivity also increased with the ozone dosage due to the formation of carboxylic acid groups originating from the degradation of hydrocarbons these ozonation byproducts organic acids formed during the oxidation of hydrocarbons reduced the solution ph of obw 20 3 5 effect of solution ph of pre ozonation on organic removal with ozone dosage of 2 g l and contact time of 75 min the effect of solution ph fig 4 a on soluble organics was studied with ph variation in the range of 4 8 at solution ph of 4 6 7 and 8 the cods removal efficiency was observed as 41 7 68 3 64 5 and 37 6 respectively from obw this result indicated that at ph 6 the removal efficiency of cods was maximum when compared to ph 4 7 and 8 the results of solution ph with time is shown in fig 4 b at ph 6 ph greater than pka of ozone dissociation 4 8 the presence of chloride ions in the obw enhances the ozone decomposition as per eq 2 and via hydroxyl radicals from eqs 3 8 through a radical reaction mechanism this reaction further extends up to eq 10 the reactions for radical generation and ozone decomposition in the presence of salt p in water are given in eqs 2 11 21 43 1 o 3 p products 2 o 3 o h o 2 h 2 o i n i t i a t i o n s t e p 3 h o 2 o h o 2 h 2 o a t p k a 4 8 20 c 4 o 2 o 3 o 3 o 2 5 o 3 h h o 3 5b o 3 p h o 3 6 h o 3 o h o 2 7 h o o 3 h o 4 8 h o 4 h o 2 o 2 9 h o 4 h o 2 h 2 o 2 2 o 2 10 h o p r o d u c t also the reaction of chloride ion with hydroxyl radical takes place only at acidic ph this condition favours the decomposition of ozone as well as the production of hydroxyl radicals leading to more removal of cods through indirect reactions at the same time the production of low molecular organic acids originating from the degradation of hydrocarbons lower the effluent ph approximately 50 of the cods was removed within 30 min contact time further an increase in contact time beyond 30 min lowers the solution ph below the pka equilibrium thus reduces the cods removal after 30 min at ph less than pka there is no ozone decomposition via radicals 43 under this condition the eq 2 and eq 3 are responsible for the decomposition of ozone the removal of soluble organics was accomplished only by direct attack of hydrocarbons by ozone 43 the same trend has been observed for ph 7 at ph 4 ph less than pka the effluent ph was reduced further with the contact time and 41 7 soluble organics was obtained only by direct attack of hydrocarbons by ozone 43 at ph 8 the presence of salts like sulphates or carbonates present in obw which are inhibitors of hydroxyl radicals leads to mechanism termination step is eq 11 it reduces the cods removal at greater ph the slight reduction of ph of the treated obw with time implies that there was no formation of acids during degradation of organics the o g removal efficiency were 48 11 59 10 55 87 and 56 25 for ph 4 6 7 and 8 respectively are shown in fig 4 c the optimum experimental condition of aop treatment was obtained at an ozone concentration of 2 0 g l and a ph of 6 for 75 min further studies were carried out with the above optimum conditions 3 6 gcms analysis gcms was performed to explore the interaction of ozone with obw containing high salinity its degradation pathway contains a three step process i hydroxylation of organics ii oxidation of intermediate compounds of aromatics iii carboxylic group formation 44 several peaks had been identified between retention times of 8 55 min 40 71 min the table 1 shows the new compounds formed after ozonation of obw for 75 min the major compounds formed after ozonation of obw are oxalic acid isobutyl ester acetic acid di propionic acid most of the byproducts were carboxylic acids which are easily biodegradable by mbc used in this study similar compounds were reported from ozonation of hydrocarbons by 45 46 3 7 combined ozonation and sbr treatment the sbr configuration and optimum operational condition were taken from our previous work 34 from the present study optimal condition of ozone pretreatment was explored as contact time 75 min o3 dose 2 g l ph 6 for the subsequent biological treatment the effect of cods removal and mlvss were studied these results are shown in fig 5 the steady state of sbr reached in 14 16 cycle of operation the final cods and mlvss concentrations of ozonized sbr at end of steady state were 1 02 g l and 5 5 g l respectively the pha production obtained was 1 66 g pha l which is 45 05 of its cdm 3 8 comparison of sbr and ozone pretreated sbr for organic removal and pha production the performance of three processes namely sbr ozonation and ozonation coupled with sbr for the treatment of obw is given in table 2 from table 2 it was observed that the ozonation coupled with sbr shows maximum removal efficiency for all the pollutants studied when compared with the individual processes the ozonation process enhanced bod5 cods ratio of obw from 0 36 to 0 52 which supports the subsequent biological treatment this is due to the conversion of complex hydrocarbons into water soluble by products the performance of sbr for raw obw and ozonized obw in terms of mlss cdm and pha production are given in table 3 from the results it was inferred that both the carbon sources support the growth of biomass at the same time the cdm retained during the extraction of pha was much lesser in case of sbr treating raw obw when compared to other systems the presence of lipophilic compounds in the form of aromatics cycloalkanes alkanes alcohols present in treated obw may accumulate on the membranes of microorganisms and damage the structural and functional properties of these membranes as a result the membrane loses its integrity and leads to cell lysis 47 this may be the possible reason for the retention of less amount of cdm even with more mlss growth and substrate consumption these lipophilic compounds may be converted into simpler soluble substances such as carboxylic acid and aldehydes 20 during ozonation helps to retain more amount of cdm even with lesser substrate consumption and biomass growth almost 42 45 of cdm has been converted into pha in both systems the presence of sodium chloride in raw obw and ozonised obw affects the amount of pha inside the cells and also the production rate 48 the student s t test statistical analysis was employed to check the significance of the variations on the organic removal biomass growth and pha yields achieved with and without the coupling of ozone pretreatment it was applied for samples with unequal variance with the level of significance of 0 05 under the null hypothesis the results of statistical analysis are given in table 4 it shows that the p values of both the parameters are below 0 05 this means that the null hypothesis for these parameters can be rejected in other words coupling ozone with sbr improved the organic removal efficiency and the comparative results are given in table 4 3 9 characterization of biopolymer ftir spectrum of pha produced by mbc using obw is shown in fig 6 a the strong absorption peak at 1014 cm 1 indicates the stretching vibrations of co groups the sharp bend at 1454 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 may be due to the bending and stretching of the methyl ch3 group 49 the absorption peak at 1731 cm 1 indicates the pha maker ester carbonyl co group and peak at 2921 cm 1 denote the asymmetric ch3 group the peak at 3679 cm 1 depicts the hydroxyl oh group 50 similar pha absorption peaks were obtained for pha produced by pseudomonas putida isolated from palm oil effluent 51 to study the thermal property of the biopolymer tga curve was measured from the temperature range of 32 39 c 600 c is illustrated in fig 6 b pha extracted by using sodium hypochlorite naclo method is thermally stable up to a temperature of 218 c the degradation of produced pha took place in a single step process from 218 c to 332 83 c at which the biopolymer chain breaks release of co co2 ch4 and ch3cooh 52 the maximum weight loss of 29 29 was observed at a temperature of 300 5 c further weight loss occurred due to the presence of unwanted debris attached to the bacterial biomass dsc spectrum analysis gives the thermal behaviour of the pha produced using mbc and extracted by naclo method is stable it is shown in fig 6 c at initial heating the melting point tm and the enthalpy of fusion δhf of the standard were 155 2 c and 28 45 j g during the second heating pha degradation was observed at 248 c which is similar to pha produced from pseudomonas putida 53 sem with edx spectroscopy of the extracted pha from mbc was performed the percentage weight of carbon c and oxygen o is 59 22 and 28 18 which are higher than the other elements and it is comparable with standard synthetic pha similar results were obtained for the pha extracted from ralstonia eutropha was reported by saratale and oh 54 nevertheless we conclude that the bioconversion of ozonized obw to biopolymer is feasible both quantitative as well as qualitative 4 conclusions the present work establishes the feasibility of ozonized sbr for obw treatment and synthesis of pha at optimized conditions ozone dose 2 g l ph 6 and contact time 75 min cods removal efficiency was observed as 92 and also enhanced the pha production by 4 5 fold the formation of carboxylic groups during ozonation of obw enhanced the pha production which was explored using gcms analysis the functional groups and thermal stability of pha obtained were identified by using ftir spectrum tga analysis dsc analysis are significant and stable thus ozonation coupled with sbr is an effective process for synthesis of biopolymer and treatment of obw declaration of competing interest
