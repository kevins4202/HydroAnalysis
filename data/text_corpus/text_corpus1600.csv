8000,study region agricultural reservoirs are the principal source of irrigation supplies for sustaining rice production and play a critical role in the water resource management of south korea study focus we comprehensively evaluated the performance of 400 major agricultural reservoirs spread throughout the country as a function of climate change during 1973 2017 considering the constituents of reservoir water balance such as watershed runoff irrigation water demand and evaporation loss new hydrological insights based on the trend analysis during the 45 year study period the reservoir inflows remained higher than the irrigation water demands because of the gradually increasing annual rainfall most reservoirs had enough storage capacities their resilience gradually declined particularly during the last 15 years the northern and northeastern region reservoirs had acceptable resilience whereas the reservoirs in the western and southwestern inland and coastal regions showed insufficient resilience reservoirs received sufficient inflows but the residence time of the excess inflow has to be increased to suffice the peak irrigation demands in the coming cropping season study outcomes could help prioritize the reservoirs requiring immediate rehabilitation located in the central and southwest regions with high failure risks results suggested that a reservoir with a watershed irrigated area ratio 5 would have a better chance of coping with future climate change threats graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural reservoirs water balance reliable storage capacity

has led to a consensus that anthropogenic climate warming is dictating the onset frequency severity and duration of extreme hydrometeorological events heavy rainfall heatwaves floods etc ipcc 2022 lee et al 2020 verbist et al 2020 shifting climatic regimes are promulgating unstable agricultural systems by altering the inherent crop growth cycle water use efficiency drought resilience stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration rates consequently the operation and management of irrigation and water storage facilities should be revised to accommodate the anticipated climate induced threats rocha et al 2020 tramblay et al 2020 the climate change situation in south korea is notably acute and spatiotemporal temperature and rainfall variations are mutating the watershed environment runoff generation irrigation water supply and crop water demands cho et al 2021 kim et al 2021 seung hwan et al 2013 regional and catchment scale climate change impact assessment for water resource management is of great interest for policy formulation and implementation to achieve maintain sustainability hakami kermani et al 2020 nguyen et al 2020 in south korea rice is the staple food and the government is adamant about its protection against rampant droughts however the performance of agricultural reservoirs the primary irrigation source for rice cultivation is expected to worsen with climate change lee et al 2020 2017 nam et al 2017 the inabilities of reservoirs to suffice the irrigation demands are mainly caused by the declining monsoon rainfalls country wide frequent droughts jehanzaib and kim 2020 jehanzaib et al 2020 and limited runoff generation in the watersheds bae et al 2019 cho et al 2019 conventionally the planning and management of almost all reservoirs were based on the assumption of hydrological stationarity however the climate and human induced intensifications have magnified the uncertainties in the occurrence probability of extreme events thus undermining the traditional heuristic operation policies for managing the reservoir and river systems kim et al 2019a tramblay et al 2020 the design criterion for south korean agricultural reservoirs is to store and provide water in the event of a 10 year frequency drought which is often not met due to unpredictable rainfall variation and lack of proper care and maintenance cho et al 2019 mun et al 2020 therefore a key challenge of water resource management is to determine reservoir performance in terms of reliability and resilience in the context of climate uncertainties choi et al 2020 song et al 2016 numerous studies have examined the climate vulnerability of south korea by considering various aspects of the water resources system the design water requirements for rice associated with the 10 year frequency of drought have been estimated based on historic and projected future climate change cho et al 2019 lee et al 2020 2017 yoo et al 2008 2012 some studies evaluated the propagation trends and risks associated with agricultural and meteorological droughts bae et al 2019 jehanzaib and kim 2020 jehanzaib et al 2020 lim et al 2019 mun et al 2020 while irrigation vulnerability assessment models have been developed and applied to better understand reservoir responses to climatic variations mun et al 2020 nam and choi 2014 nam et al 2015a hong et al 2016a and kim et al 2018a proposed a decision support system and operation criteria for improved supervision and management of reservoir operations to stabilize the irrigation water supply lee et al 2020 developed a calibration method for optimizing the simulation of reservoir operation modeling and then examined the resilience of reservoirs under climate change kim et al 2019a conducted a reservoir performance sensitivity analysis by stochastically examining water deficit variations under climate change projections in addition to hydrological repercussions climate change impacts on rice yield farming practices growth periods water productivity and the resulting water demands have also been reported cho et al 2021 2019 kim et al 2021 seung hwan et al 2013 yoon and choi 2020 the studies mentioned above were limited to a single or a set of selected reservoirs which is insufficient to develop a national scale policy against the repercussions of climate change in this study we included 400 major agricultural reservoirs spread across the country and examined their performance as a function of climate change during 1973 2017 by comprehensively evaluating various governing factors like watershed runoff irrigation water demands and evaporation losses rice crop evapotranspiration etc irrigation water requirements iwr upstream watershed runoff and volumetric evaporation losses were integrated into a reservoir operation simulation model and annual maximum water demands amwd were estimated based on the paddy water balance and reservoir water balance models to identify reservoirs with reliable storage capacity we compared the amwd for a 10 year frequency drought amwd10 and effective storage capacity esc the recharge index ri and the water deficit index wdi were also derived as functions of available water supply and demand to assess how climate change has impacted reservoir performance in korea 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources in south korea rice production is primarily sustained by irrigation supplies from approximately 17 400 agricultural reservoirs lee et al 2020 of which nearly 81 are managed by local governments but only account for 11 of gross storage the remaining large reservoirs are managed and operated by the korean rural community corporation krc most reservoirs have been operational for more than 50 years and the irrigation supplies are often interrupted due to climate induced rainfall variations and lack of proper care and maintenance cho et al 2021 2019 in this study we selected 400 reservoirs managed by the krc and each has a storage capacity 1000 hectare meter ha m or 107 cubic meters m3 the climate regimes in the reservoir watersheds were represented by 50 weather stations that were selected according to the information provided by the krc fig 1 shows the selected reservoirs and weather stations in this study reservoir specifications such as watershed area irrigated area esc and full storage capacity fsc are shown in supplementary fig s1 the storage capacity range for most reservoirs was 10 000 75 000 103 m3 and the watershed and irrigated areas ranges were 800 36 550 103 m2 and 4370 17 340 103 m2 respectively fig s1 the southern and eastern coastal regions of south korea have a higher density of small to medium sized reservoirs while the larger reservoirs are located in mid latitude inland regions the study methodology is summarized in fig 2 and detailed descriptions are provided in the subsequent sections the korean meteorological administration kma provided daily data of maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin wind speed relative humidity sunshine hours and rainfall p for the 45 years 1973 2017 the 45 years were divided into three time slices 1980s 1973 1987 1990s 1982 2002 and 2000s 2003 2017 and all analyzes were performed for each time slice and throughout the 45 year period south korea receives 1000 1800 mm of p annually of which approximately 60 70 falls as monsoon p from late june to september azam et al 2018 reservoir watersheds are small ungauged and mountainous and monsoon p is the main source of reservoir inflow while snowmelt and p in winters are minor contributors to reservoir inflows kim et al 2019a lee et al 2020 the annual average temperature of 12 3 c fluctuates between 6 6 c winter to 16 6 c summer 2 2 reservoir operation modeling reservoir operation modeling deals with the water balance between inflow and outflow which are governed by rainfall runoff characteristics of the upstream watershed downstream irrigation requirement and volumetric water storage fluctuation cho et al 2019 watershed runoff and incident rainfall on the reservoir surface constitute the inflow and water withdrawal for irrigation evaporation from the reservoir surface and seepage and percolation losses represent the outflow or negative components of the water balance lee et al 2020 in this study the reservoir operation was simulated using the following water balance model 1 s t s t 1 ro t rp t ws t f t re t 2 rp t p t ra 3 f t s t s f if s t s f otherwise 0 where s available reservoir storage ro watershed runoff section 2 2 1 p rainfall on the reservoir surface mm rp rainfall volume m3 ra reservoir surface area at full water level m2 ws water supplied to the irrigation districts section 2 2 3 f overflow through sluice gates re evaporation from the reservoir surface section 2 2 2 sf reservoir storage capacity and t daily time step all the values in eq 1 are in volume units m3 seepage and percolation losses from the reservoir floor were not included in eq 1 because the reservoir groundwater interaction was assumed to be inconsequential in affecting the overall water balance jo et al 2021 2 2 1 simulation of the watershed rainfall runoff process most reservoir watersheds in south korea are small ungauged and located in mountainous regions where accurate estimation of the generated runoff is challenging lee et al 2020 we used the lumped hydrological tank model to simulate the rainfall runoff processes a simple but effective model that has been tested to simulate inflow in low lying flat paddy fields chen et al 2003 2014 nakano et al 2004 sub basin runoff and infiltration rates in the lalindu river in indonesia ahmad 2017 groundwater fluctuations in an observation well in japan hong et al 2016b and reservoir operation modeling in south korea cho et al 2021 2019 jo et al 2021 lee et al 2020 song et al 2016 the model treats the watershed as a tank that can intercept p and then releases it from the side and bottom outlets we used a modified three layered tank model for a typical small sized ungauged south korean watershed and the input parameters were derived empirically by considering watershed land use types such as paddy field upland crop and forest area the water coming out of the first second and third tank s side outlets represented the surface runoff intermediate runoff and baseflow respectively infiltration was represented by the water coming out of the tanks bottom outlets evaporation was subtracted from the bottom tank and p was added to the top tank the detailed working principle and the empirical regression equation used for parameter estimation of the modified tank model can be referenced from song et al 2016 and lee and singh 1999 the regression equations link the watershed characteristics with model parameters to indirectly calibrate the tank model since direct parameter calibration is difficult because the reservoir inflow is usually not measured song et al 2016 2 2 2 estimation of evaporation from the reservoir surface a dam or reservoir stores water to achieve multiple purposes including flood protection provision of irrigation and drinking water and hydropower generation however the evaporation losses are distinctly higher in artificial water storage facilities than in natural water bodies the construction of water storage facilities has significantly increased the worldwide terrestrial water surface area resulting in increased exposure to sunlight and warm air and hence higher evaporation rates for reservoir water budgeting surface evaporation is treated as a loss because water is extracted from the reservoir gorguner and kavvas 2020 zhao and gao 2019 the literature includes a comprehensive discussion on surface evaporation estimation approaches such as the pan evaporation method eddy covariance mass balance and bowen ratio friedrich et al 2018 mcmahon et al 2013 valiantzas 2006 wang and dickinson 2012 the frequently adopted pan evaporation method is regarded as the least accurate and least suitable for precise water balance analyzes a practically viable option for large scale evaporation estimation is the application of physically based combination equations such as the penman equation friedrich et al 2018 in this study we used the penman combination equation for the open water evaporation estimation as follows penman 1948 4 e δ δ γ r n λ γ δ γ ƒ u e s e a 5 ƒ u 1 313 1 381 u 2 where e open water evaporation rate mm d 1 δ slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ psychrometric constant kpa c 1 rn net solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 λ latent heat of vaporization mjkg 1 ƒ u wind function mj m 2 d 1 kpa 1 u2 wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and es ea vapor pressure deficit kpa eq 5 is the penman 1956 wind function which is recommended by mcmahon et al 2006 for open water evaporation estimation weather data should ideally be taken directly above the water body however due to the lack of such data we simulated daily evaporation rates using land based data acquired from 50 weather stations the evaporation volume was the product of reservoir surface area and evaporation rate 2 2 3 estimation of irrigation water requirements in south korea the primary function of agricultural reservoirs is to ensure a consistent water supply to the paddy fields the reservoirs release water according to the iwr determined by the paddy water balance as the difference between etc and effective rainfall er during the rice season april september nursery transplantation to low land paddies is the prevalent rice cultivation practice and iwr is the depth necessary to reimburse etc and percolation losses minus the contribution of p as er lee et al 2020 2017 in addition to reference evapotranspiration eto etc and percolation losses the water required during nursery preparation nursery raising and transplantation is an integral part of paddy water balance cho et al 2019 lee et al 2020 we used the paddy water balance model to estimate the daily iwr as follows 6 iwr et c dp pd lr mr er where etc crop evapotranspiration dp deep percolation pd required ponding depth lr leaching requirements mr miscellaneous requirements er effective rainfall all the entities in eq 6 are in water depth units mm the lr and mr in eq 6 were assumed zero because of their negligible field scale effects and the dp rate and pd were 5 mm d 1 and 140 mm respectively rice etc was calculated as a product of eto from the modified penman equation doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and the 10 day crop coefficients proposed by yoo et al 2008 the incident p during the rice season directly contributes to the pond that has been maintained in the field and the er equals p minus surface runoff lee et al 2020 we used the freeboard model of er estimation to simulate the pond depth and the upper and lower ponding depth thresholds were 80 mm and 20 mm respectively lee et al 2017 seung hwan et al 2013 volumetric iwr was estimated as the product of iwr depth and rice cropping area and was considered equivalent to the water supplied by the reservoirs the detailed procedure for the calculation of the volumetric iwr is provided by cho et al 2021 and also in supplementary section 1 2 of this study 2 3 trend analysis the non parametric rank based mann kendall mk test is widely used for trend detection in the hydrometeorological time series ahmad and choi 2018 serinaldi et al 2018 the underlying assumption of serially independent time series is often not met when dealing with real world data such as streamflow rainfall or temperature and most studies overlook the violation of this assumption in the case of a serially correlated time series the mk test tends to show significant trends when there are no trends in reality douglas et al 2000 farris et al 2021 serinaldi et al 2018 the presence of autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as variance inflation causing over rejection of the null hypothesis ho in the time series by reducing the effective sample size and inflating the variance of the test statistic serinaldi and kilsby 2016 to address the issue of autocorrelated time series two mainly proposed methods include 1 applying a modified mk modmk trend test while properly considering the variance inflation hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 and 2 prewhitening the time series by removing the autocorrelation and then applying the mk trend test katz 1988 von storch 1999 azam et al 2018 applied various techniques aiming at reducing the effects of autocorrelation while detecting rainfall trends in south korea at differing time scales they concluded that modmk has broader applications and is a better choice for trend detection in the rainfall time series in this study the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficients were estimated at α 95 for the annual time series of various hydrometeorological variables such as tmax tmin p etc and iwr etc figs s2 and s3 modmk trend test hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 was adopted for the sites weather stations or reservoirs showing significant lag 1autocorrelation and the corresponding trend magnitudes were estimated using sen s slope estimator at α 95 2 4 field significance another important aspect that needs consideration when simultaneously evaluating multiple ho for numerous spatial points like weather stations or reservoirs is the field significance or test multiplicity when a statistical test is applied at n sites with a significant level of α the ho may be rejected at α n sites in which case a local interpretation of test outcomes can lead to erroneously identifying statistical significant trends at α n sites guerreiro et al 2014 in such cases a global ho assumes that the local ho is true for all the locations at a significance level αglobal and the outcomes of multiple tests are interpreted globally mainly two types of methodologies that have been proposed to deal with the field significance include 1 approaches based on counting the number of ho rejections and comparing them with thresholds derived from the binomial distribution or bootstrapping methods douglas et al 2000 guerreiro et al 2014 and 2 approaches based on reducing the false discovery rate fdr farris et al 2021 wilks 2016 in this study we evaluated the field significance using the fdr test proposed by wilks 2006 which has shown superior performance and straightforward application compared with the alternative computationally extensive field significance tests wilks 2016 the fdr test rejects the local ho for the sites where corresponding p values are lower than a threshold pfdr at a level αglobal αfdr and the presence of field significance is declared furthermore at the sites where local p pfdr all the local ho are also rejected which highlighted the existence of potential spatial correlation among these sites in this study we used αfdr 0 05 and the fdr test was applied to account for the field significance at the 50 weather stations and 400 reservoirs for the annual time series of hydrometeorological variables a detailed explanation of the fdr test and its applications is provided in wilks 2016 and farris et al 2021 2 5 estimation of reliable storage capacity in south korea the reservoir design criterion is to have sufficient storage capacity to store and supply water in the event of a 10 year frequency drought cho et al 2021 2019 in this study reliable storage capacity refers to the state when the esc amwd10 and the reservoirs were categorized as safe and unsafe accordingly the gumbel frequency distribution and the chow frequency factor method were used to estimate the amwd10 as follows 7 x i max s t i 8 x 10 x mean k δ n 1 9 storage capacity safe if eff storage c apacit y x 10 unsafe if eff storage c apacity x 10 where st i reservoir storage in ith year m3 xi annual maximum water demand amwd in ith year m3 x10 amwd for a 10 year frequency drought m3 xmean average amwd m3 k frequency factor based on gumbel frequency distribution and δn 1 standard deviation of amwd 2 6 estimation of recharge and water deficit indices to assess reservoir performance as a function of climate change during the 45 year research period we derived two indices the recharge index ri masia et al 2018 and the water deficit index wdi kim et al 2019a after accounting for the iwr and re the ri indicates how quickly a reservoir can be recharged on average in a year whereas the wdi measures annual reservoir water scarcity as follows 10 recharge index ri total inflow total iwr msc 11 water deficit index wdi total inflow total iwr total iwr where total inflow ro rp total iwr iwr re and msc maximum storage capacity of the reservoir and other terms have been defined in sections 2 2 and 2 2 3 all entities are in volume units m3 the smaller or negative ri and wdi values indicate poor reservoir performance in terms of rechargeability and water availability 3 results 3 1 historic climate variability fig 3 shows the spatiotemporal trends of the annual average tmax tmin and p during 1973 2017 across the 50 weather stations after accounting for the lag 1 autocorrelation fig s2 a c and field significance the temporal trends were evaluated using the modmk test and sen s slope at α 95 it should be noted here that the use of the term nonsignificant trend in this section and henceforth does not imply that no trend is present at the respective site rather it should be treated as the possibility of detecting a trend is weak at the site serinaldi et al 2018 considering the influences of serial correlation and field significance reduce the false ho rejection and consequently comparatively less significant trends are observed azam et al 2018 farris et al 2021 during the study period tmin variability range 4 5 11 5 c was notably higher than that of tmax 16 20 c and spatially higher tmax was prevalent in the northwest coast to mid latitude central inland regions whereas a higher tmin was observed in the northeast coast to mid latitude central inland and southwest coastal regions fig 3a b most weather stations featured significant increasing trends that were markedly higher in the case of tmin compared to tmax while downward trends were mostly nonsignificant shifting climate regimes in the central and southern regions and the relatively cold northern regions were mainly attributed to significant upward tmax and tmin trends respectively fig 3d e in terms of the average absolute change across the time slices the tmax and tmin increased by 0 6 and 0 7 c and 0 4 and 0 9 c during the 1990s and 2000s respectively compared to the 1980s as shown in fig s1 the majority of small and medium sized reservoirs are concentrated in the central and southern regions where climate warming was mainly attributed to significantly increasing tmax trends fig 3d furthermore the larger reservoirs are located in the mid latitude central to upper southern regions where both tmax and tmin showed significant increasing trends during the study period the country received an annual average p of 995 1800 mm the mid latitude inland southeast and southwest coastal regions received comparatively lower annual average p of up to 1280 mm while the south coast and northern parts received the highest annual average p in the range of 1200 1800 mm fig 3c typhoon induced fluctuations and convective air mass systems generate heavy monsoon p in the southern region the annual average p followed the orography and increased from all directions towards the northern parts where the temperature decreased with altitude azam et al 2018 all the selected weather stations had nonsignificant trends with an unclear distinction between the increasing and decreasing p trends fig 3f the south coast with a higher reservoir density predominantly had downward p trends while upward p trends were mostly observed in the northern region the upward and downward p trend ranges were 3 62 mm dec and 1 43 mm dec respectively and the country received 30 and 73 mm extra p during the 1990s and 2020s respectively compared to the 1980s 3 2 crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirement the volumetric water supplies from the reservoirs depend mainly on two components the iwr depth estimated through the paddy water balance and the downstream rice cultivation area etc represents the target water depth during the rice season april september which is partially satisfied by the er and the rest is applied as irrigation we estimate etc er and iwr and their trends during the time slices and the 45 year study period 1973 2017 using eq 6 the reservoirs belonging to a specific weather station had the same etc er and iwr depths thus the spatial variability of these parameters was mapped across the 50 weather stations and the results are presented in figs 4 6 the country wise average etc of 790 mm was almost preserved during the time slices however climate warming prompted higher spatial etc variability that was notably evident during the 1990s and 2000s the 1980s etc mostly ranged between 715 and 800 mm which showed an increasing tendency in the western and eastern coastal regions during the 1990s but remained nearly unchanged during the 2000s regardless of the time slice the southeast and northeast inland and coastal regions had the highest etc values 850 mm compared to the rest of the country fig 4a d despite the clear climate warming unexpectedly dropping etc rates of 3 31 mm dec were detected at 25 weather stations out of which five showed significant trends fig 4e a significant decrease in wind speed caused the drop in etc rates which also highlights the dominance of the aerodynamic component of eto in determining etc rates at these stations a combination of climate warming and a significant increase in the vapor pressure deficit was the main cause of the positive etc trends in the range of 1 5 24 5 mm dec at the remaining weather stations of which seven showed significant trends fig 4e the er is a decisive component of paddy water balance analysis fig 5 shows the spatiotemporal variations of er during the study period the average er of 620 mm for the 50 weather stations was almost similar across the time slices based on the average data during 1973 2017 the west and east coast er range was 500 600 mm and in southwest inland and south coast regions the er range was 600 750 mm fig 5d this spatial trend was distinctly noticeable during the 1980s but gradually diminished during the 1990s and 2000s due to the strong increase in er at the south coast weather stations followed by a simultaneous decline in the southwest inland regions fig 5a c rice season receives the largest proportion of annual p during the monsoon season therefore the annual p and er exhibited similar temporal trends the er temporal trends were nonsignificant and 11 weather stations showed positive trends 1 24 5 mm dec and the remaining 39 weather stations had negative trends 1 31 mm dec the positive er trends were noted in the northern and southwest coast regions while the rest of the country experienced dropping er trends particularly in the northwest and southwest regions fig 5e generally the rice iwr is higher than the difference between etc and iwr since it also includes the additional water requirement for nursery raising and transplanting the country wise iwr average for the 50 weather stations was 805 mm 825 mm 814 mm and 800 mm during the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 1973 2017 respectively similar to the spatial distribution of etc fig 4 the highest iwr range of 800 990 mm was detected in the east coast southeastern inland and southwest coastal regions and for inland regions in the north south direction the iwr range was 700 850 mm regardless of the time slice fig 6a d the iwr trends were nonsignificant and the upward and downward trends were observed at 28 and 22 weather stations in the ranges of 1 22 mm dec and 1 36 mm dec respectively during the study period the iwr increased gradually in the south and east coast regions where the majority of reservoirs were located whereas the northern part of the country with less reservoir density and the mid latitude central region housing the large storage capacity reservoirs experienced an iwr decline which could be explained by the downwards etc trends and or upward er trends observed at these locations fig 6f and fig s1 3 3 reservoir water balance annual total iwr and total inflow were simulated using the reservoir water balance model eq 1 during the time slices and the 45 years from 1973 to 2017 and the results are shown in figs 7 8 the annual total iwr is equal to the sum of the volumetric monthly iwr in the irrigated area of each reservoir during the rice season which is from april to september and the volumetric evaporation from the reservoir surface re throughout the year similarly the total annual inflow refers to the sum of runoff ro generated in the reservoir watershed and the volume of incident p at the reservoir surface rp ro was treated as the inflow that directly enters the reservoirs and the spatiotemporal variations of individual components of the reservoir water balance such as iwr re ro and rp are provided in supplementary figs s4 s6 based on the 45 years data the average annual total iwr for approximately 87 350 out of 400 of the reservoirs was in the range of 356 7000 103 m3 and for the remaining 13 50 out of 400 reservoirs it was 7001 69 079 103 m3 fig 7d the huge disparity in the total iwr among the two groups of reservoirs was chiefly because of different irrigated areas and climate regimes the ranges of irrigated area for the first and second group of reservoirs were 437 29 698 103 m2 and 4460 83 820 103 m2 respectively the inter reservoir variations of total iwr gradually become more noticeable across the time slices particularly during the 1990s when the highest total iwr was shown fig 7 furthermore the reservoirs located in the western and southwest inland and coastal regions had a higher total iwr compared to the rest of the country for most reservoirs the modmk test did not confirm the statistical significance of the trends in total iwr during the 45 years fig 7e considering the clear evidence of climate warming nearly half of the reservoirs unexpectedly exhibited downward iwr trends and these were mostly located in the central inland and western coastal regions this apparent anomaly can be explained by the declining etc trends detected at almost half of the weather stations included in this study section 3 2 fig 4 the reservoirs with increasing trends of total iwr were located mainly on the east coast and in the southern inland and coastal regions generally the reservoirs received a substantially higher total inflow annually in comparison with the total iwr which suggests sufficient water availability since the total iwr estimates in our study only considered the water requirements during the rice season fig 8 during the past 45 years the annual average inflow entering 92 371 out of 400 and 18 29 out of 400 of the reservoirs was 758 28 000 103 m3 and 28 001 419 397 103 m3 respectively and the ranges of watershed area for the two clusters of reservoirs were 800 71 000 103 m2 and 10 400 373 600 103 m2 for all reservoirs total inflow gradually increased across time slices due to the higher annual average p during the 1990s and 2020s respectively compared to the 1980s similar to the total iwr the reservoirs located in western and southwest inland and coastal regions had a higher total inflow compared to the rest of the country the temporal trends of total inflow were in close agreement with the annual p trends section 2 1 fig 3f during 1973 2017 reservoirs showed mainly nonsignificant trends 337 reservoirs had upward trends and 63 reservoirs had downward trends of total inflow all the trends were nonsignificant and positive trends were observed for the reservoirs located in the northern regions fig 8e furthermore the magnitude of positive trends of total inflow was generally higher than those of the negative trends we also analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of the individual components of the reservoir water balance figs s4 s6 and their contribution to the total inflow and total iwr as already mentioned the average annual total inflow into the reservoirs was much higher than the respective total iwr which constituted mainly 30 75 of the total inflow the volumetric iwr solely for rice production showed a progressive increasing tendency throughout the time slices and its value mostly fluctuated in the range of 128 65 400 103 m3 during 1973 2017 fig s4 a d although the iwr trends during the last 45 years were mostly nonsignificant and spatially identical to the total iwr more reservoirs showed the increasing iwr trends than in the case of total iwr fig 7e and fig s4e re loss is also a vital component of the reservoir water budget and is primarily driven by ambient climatic conditions as expected climate warming augmented the average annual re throughout the time slices and for the majority of the reservoirs its value varied in the range of 89 1000 103 m3 during 1973 2017 fig s5 a d moreover depending on the evaporation rate and reservoir surface area the average annual re corresponded to 2 20 and 8 40 of total inflow and total iwr respectively for nearly 85 of the reservoirs during 1973 2017 results not shown here ro was the main contributor to annual total inflow which also showed a rising slope due to higher annual p during time slices and based on the 45 year data its value was from 410 to 28 000 103 m3 for most of the reservoirs fig s6 a d rp was the second component of total inflow which also exhibited similar rising patterns during the time slices for most reservoirs the average annual rp ranged from 105 to 1000 103 m3 and corresponded to 2 20 and 9 40 of total inflow and total iwr respectively for nearly 85 of reservoirs during 1973 2017 results not shown here 3 4 reservoir storage capacity reservoirs with reliable storage capacities were identified by comparing the respective esc and amwd10 which was estimated by using the gumbel frequency distribution and chow frequency factor method section 2 3 cho et al 2021 cho et al 2019 fig 9 presents safe and unsafe reservoirs categorized according to the condition when the esc amwd10 during the three time slices and the 45 year study period regardless of the time slices the amwd10 for all the reservoirs mostly showed declining trends results not shown here because of high total inflow and low total iwr and the esc for nearly 70 of the reservoirs were categorized as safe the unsafe reservoirs with insufficient escs were 119 127 126 and 127 during the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 1973 2017 respectively fig 9a d this suggests that despite the additional total inflow availability the reservoirs have become more susceptible to adverse climate change impacts the watershed irrigated area w iratio ratio was the decisive factor in determining the reliability of the reservoir storage out of the selected 400 unsafe reservoirs were characterized by a w iratio 4 5 and the associated watershed areas were nearly equal to or slightly greater than the respective irrigated areas the 22 unsafe reservoirs had a w iratio 0 which means that these reservoirs had very large irrigated areas compared to the watershed areas the irrigated area watershed area and esc of the unsafe reservoirs w iratio 4 5 were 598 31 550 103 m2 800 62 100 103 m2 and 10 020 151 980 103 m3 respectively and for the remaining safe reservoirs w iratio 4 5 these values were 437 69 170 103 m2 2000 373 600 103 m2 and 10 000 460 702 103 m3 respectively in terms of spatial distribution the unsafe reservoirs were located close to each other along the west and south coast of korea 3 5 recharge index ri is a measure of reservoir resilience that indicates how quickly a reservoir can recover from a failure or stress state masia et al 2018 for each reservoir the ri was estimated using eq 10 as a function of total inflow total iwr and fsc and its spatial variations are presented in fig 9 table s1 presents the five defining classes of reservoir resilience based on ri values which would be used for the interpretation of results in the subsequent section for nearly 82 of the reservoirs the ri was between 0 3 and 0 5 during 1973 2017 and these reservoirs fall under the categories of nonresilient to slightly resilient table s1 whereas most of the remaining reservoirs were resilient and very few were highly resilient fig 10d during the 2000s the reservoir resilience seriously deteriorated as the reservoirs with the ri value between 0 3 and 0 2 were notably higher in this duration compared to the 1980s and 1990s fig 9a c overall the northern and northeastern region reservoirs had acceptable resilience whereas the reservoirs in the western and the southwestern region showed insufficient resilience based on the ri index ri was also closely related to w iratio since for all nonresilient reservoirs ri 0 the w iratio was 1 and the esc of these reservoirs was also unsafe on the contrary highly resilient reservoirs with ri 1 generally had a w iratio 10 while reservoirs with ri values between 0 1 and 1 had a w iratio in the range of 1 10 3 6 water deficit index the wdi was derived as an indicator of total inflow shortages relative to the total iwr for all the reservoirs during the study period a lower value of wdi indicates less inflow availability and values closer to or greater than one indicate sufficient inflow availability against the iwr gondim et al 2018 kim et al 2019a eq 11 was used to derive wdi and fig 11 shows the spatial variation of wdi during the three time slices and the 45 years as explained in section 3 3 that the annual average total inflow entering the reservoirs was generally higher than the total iwr hence the wdi mostly remained 1 indicating no inflow deficit regardless of the time slices fig 11 there were only 21 reservoirs with wdi 1 and these were reservoirs with unsafe storage capacities and the lowest reliability characterized by a w iratio 1 similarly a very high wdi was noted for the reservoirs with w iratio 10 and for the remaining reservoirs 1 w iratio 10 the wdi varied in the range 1 10 fig 11a d the wdi showed spatial patterns similar to those of the ri and the reservoirs in the northern and northeast regions had the least inflow shortages 4 discussion analysis of daily weather data from 50 weather stations during the last 45 years 1973 2017 confirmed that the country is experiencing a warmer and wetter shift in the climate regime seriously detrimental climate shifts were detected in the central and southwestern major agricultural regions which are more socially and environmentally drought prone than the northern regions mun et al 2020 the observed warming of up to 0 6 c could be attributed to anthropogenic intervention however it was difficult to suggest the root cause of the increase of up to 50 mm in the average cumulative annual p the climate change trends identified in our study were well corroborated with previously published studies dealing with historical and future climate change patterns azam et al 2018 cho et al 2019 im et al 2021 kim et al 2021 these climate change trends could propagate two conflicting field scale phenomena that seriously implicate large scale water resource management for rice cultivation climate warming accelerates etc rates producing higher iwr cho et al 2021 2019 chung et al 2011 lee et al 2017 which was also evident in our study while simultaneously reducing rice growth span yield water productivity and overall iwr however more irrigations would be required during the shortened growth span seung hwan et al 2013 yoon and choi 2020 and excessive p would have a limited contribution to er while generating more runoff and pollutant load in paddy fields kim et al 2021 in our study the declining trends in etc and total iwr observed in some locations were surprising given the tangible evidence of climate warming we estimate rice etc as a function of atmospheric evaporative demands or eto which in turn depends on several governing climate variables we further examined the climate conditions at all the weather stations with negative etc trends and a significant decline in the wind speed rates was identified as the reason results not shown here which also suggested that the aerodynamic component was pivotal in dictating eto and etc rates at these stations nam et al 2015b and ghafouri azar et al 2018 also reported similar spatiotemporal eto patterns across south korea caused by a notable decline in the aerodynamic component and wind speed this suggested that apart from temperature other climatic factors can also markedly influence the eto and etc rates and or counteract the undesirable outcomes of climate change therefore considering the composite effect of all the governing climate factors would be a more realistic approach to devising mitigation strategies against the impacts of climate change although the total inflow increased because of the excessive p most reservoirs in our study showed reliable storage capacities studies have predicted that ro in the south korean watersheds would increase while amwd10 would decline simultaneously due to increases in p up to the mid 21st century and then the process would reverse nam et al 2015a seung hwan et al 2013 hence the wdi generally remained 1 implying no water deficit existed which seems to contradict the numerous studies advocating that south korea has become more drought vulnerable during recent years bae et al 2019 kim et al 2018b 2019b mun et al 2020 moreover the resilience in terms of ri also declined over time signifying that the failure recovery time of reservoirs has become longer which should not be the case given the trends of total inflow and wdi water management in south korea is driven by a typical monsoon climate characterized by a hot wet summer and dry cold winters approximately 60 70 of annual p occurs from july to september and the major proportion of annual ro is generated in these summer months azam et al 2018 kim et al 2019a during the spring and winter seasons the total inflow into the reservoirs remains substantially lower than in the summer or rice season while the maximum total iwr is observed during the early rice growth stages from april to june cho et al 2021 jo et al 2021 the excessive total inflow stored in the reservoirs is released during the early drought period of the next rice season due to the misaligned timing of total inflow generation and maximum total iwr farmers can face water shortages from april to june chung et al 2011 kim et al 2018a we analyze monthly p data in the rice season during 1973 2017 and observe nonsignificant downward p trends throughout the peak water demand period from april to june and then these trends reversed from july to september fig s8 as mentioned in section 3 3 that up to 20 of the annual total inflow could be lost as re depending on the climatic conditions and reservoir surface area and the maximum rate of re loss could also occur during the hottest months of april to june a combination of the misaligned monthly p distribution with the peak water demand period and higher re rates could be the cause of the ri decline noted in our study despite the acceptable value of wdi and total inflow trends the primary objective of this study was to perform a large scale water balance analysis that could be used to develop and implement a national scale mitigation policy against climate change threats however there were some limitations in this study because of the data availability constraints for example warming induced growth span shortening was not considered in this study according to the recent krc surveys socioeconomic development and farm mechanization has prolonged the transplanting period and the associated farmers water application patterns have been changed resulting in substantially higher iwr from april to june cho et al 2021 2019 actual water supply data covering 45 years of the study period were not available for all reservoirs therefore we treat the total iwr as the water supplied by the reservoirs but under actual field conditions much higher amounts of water are supplied compared to the total iwr based on eight years 2011 2017 of data for eight selected reservoirs cho et al 2021 concluded that actual water supplies could be 13 44 higher than the total iwr land use variations in the upstream reservoir watersheds and changes in cultivation areas of paddy and upland crops in the downstream irrigated areas during the study period were assumed constant when simulating ro and iwr despite the shortcomings this study provides valuable information on the state of reservoirs in terms of storage capacity resilience and water deficit in addition to the least reliable reservoirs that require immediate attention slightly resilient reservoirs that are most likely to fail soon in the future were also identified so that short and long term mitigation plans could be developed and implemented increasing the storage capacity of suitable reservoirs could be a viable option because more total inflow would be available in the future recently the south korean government has already completed the four major river restoration project in which 16 weirs were constructed across four major rivers and the dam height of large agricultural reservoirs was raised to provide safety against drought and flood jo et al 2021 our results suggested that simply increasing the storage capacity might not necessarily improve the reservoir performance because it would increase the reservoir surface area and hence the re losses kim et al 2019a argued that improving reservoir storage would also aggravate the sensitivity of reservoir performance to climate change we concluded that future climate warming would have more detrimental effects than p variations since additional ro would be lost more quickly to the atmosphere as re finally the southern inland and coastal regions should be the epicenter of mitigation planning and the water supply in these regions should be improved by strategically focusing on the vulnerable dry periods and by tackling the spatial variations of the reservoir water balance 5 conclusions achieving and maintaining rice self sufficiency is clinically important for the food security of south korea and the network of agricultural reservoirs that had been instrumental in providing water for rice cultivation is now threatened by climate change in this study the climate change threats to the water resource infrastructure of south korea were interpreted by conducting a comprehensive water balance analysis for 400 agricultural reservoirs during 1973 2017 1 climate warming was distinctly severe in central and southern major agricultural areas with high reservoirs density and the warming gradient featured markedly higher tmin trends compared to those of tmax 2 the cumulative annual p gradually increased throughout the study period but the exact forcing mechanism and statistical significance of the spatiotemporal p trends were unclear while the er in the rice season exhibited notable declining tendencies 3 climate warming caused an overall increase in annual total iwr particularly in reservoirs where the radiation component of eto was dominant and for nearly half of the reservoirs the decreasing wind speed trends limited the anticipated surge in etc and total iwr 4 generally the reservoir total inflows remained notably higher than the total iwr chiefly because of the p increments which augmented ro generation in the reservoir watersheds 5 the w iratio was a critical design factor and 127 reservoirs were identified on the western and southern coasts that had unsafe storage capacities out of which 22 reservoirs had the lowest reliability and maximum water deficit due to a w iratio 1 6 highly resilient reservoirs showing safe storage capacity and no water deficit had a w iratio 10 large reservoirs in the central region and medium reservoirs in the southwest regions 1 w iratio 5 should be prioritized for rehabilitation activities because these showed a high potential of inevitable failure in the future our results suggested that the reservoirs should have w iratio 5 otherwise a minor disruption in reservoir water balance under the influence of future climate change would seriously compromise the reservoir performance credit authorship contribution statement mirza junaid

8000,study region agricultural reservoirs are the principal source of irrigation supplies for sustaining rice production and play a critical role in the water resource management of south korea study focus we comprehensively evaluated the performance of 400 major agricultural reservoirs spread throughout the country as a function of climate change during 1973 2017 considering the constituents of reservoir water balance such as watershed runoff irrigation water demand and evaporation loss new hydrological insights based on the trend analysis during the 45 year study period the reservoir inflows remained higher than the irrigation water demands because of the gradually increasing annual rainfall most reservoirs had enough storage capacities their resilience gradually declined particularly during the last 15 years the northern and northeastern region reservoirs had acceptable resilience whereas the reservoirs in the western and southwestern inland and coastal regions showed insufficient resilience reservoirs received sufficient inflows but the residence time of the excess inflow has to be increased to suffice the peak irrigation demands in the coming cropping season study outcomes could help prioritize the reservoirs requiring immediate rehabilitation located in the central and southwest regions with high failure risks results suggested that a reservoir with a watershed irrigated area ratio 5 would have a better chance of coping with future climate change threats graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural reservoirs water balance reliable storage capacity

et al 2020 verbist et al 2020 shifting climatic regimes are promulgating unstable agricultural systems by altering the inherent crop growth cycle water use efficiency drought resilience stomatal conductance and evapotranspiration rates consequently the operation and management of irrigation and water storage facilities should be revised to accommodate the anticipated climate induced threats rocha et al 2020 tramblay et al 2020 the climate change situation in south korea is notably acute and spatiotemporal temperature and rainfall variations are mutating the watershed environment runoff generation irrigation water supply and crop water demands cho et al 2021 kim et al 2021 seung hwan et al 2013 regional and catchment scale climate change impact assessment for water resource management is of great interest for policy formulation and implementation to achieve maintain sustainability hakami kermani et al 2020 nguyen et al 2020 in south korea rice is the staple food and the government is adamant about its protection against rampant droughts however the performance of agricultural reservoirs the primary irrigation source for rice cultivation is expected to worsen with climate change lee et al 2020 2017 nam et al 2017 the inabilities of reservoirs to suffice the irrigation demands are mainly caused by the declining monsoon rainfalls country wide frequent droughts jehanzaib and kim 2020 jehanzaib et al 2020 and limited runoff generation in the watersheds bae et al 2019 cho et al 2019 conventionally the planning and management of almost all reservoirs were based on the assumption of hydrological stationarity however the climate and human induced intensifications have magnified the uncertainties in the occurrence probability of extreme events thus undermining the traditional heuristic operation policies for managing the reservoir and river systems kim et al 2019a tramblay et al 2020 the design criterion for south korean agricultural reservoirs is to store and provide water in the event of a 10 year frequency drought which is often not met due to unpredictable rainfall variation and lack of proper care and maintenance cho et al 2019 mun et al 2020 therefore a key challenge of water resource management is to determine reservoir performance in terms of reliability and resilience in the context of climate uncertainties choi et al 2020 song et al 2016 numerous studies have examined the climate vulnerability of south korea by considering various aspects of the water resources system the design water requirements for rice associated with the 10 year frequency of drought have been estimated based on historic and projected future climate change cho et al 2019 lee et al 2020 2017 yoo et al 2008 2012 some studies evaluated the propagation trends and risks associated with agricultural and meteorological droughts bae et al 2019 jehanzaib and kim 2020 jehanzaib et al 2020 lim et al 2019 mun et al 2020 while irrigation vulnerability assessment models have been developed and applied to better understand reservoir responses to climatic variations mun et al 2020 nam and choi 2014 nam et al 2015a hong et al 2016a and kim et al 2018a proposed a decision support system and operation criteria for improved supervision and management of reservoir operations to stabilize the irrigation water supply lee et al 2020 developed a calibration method for optimizing the simulation of reservoir operation modeling and then examined the resilience of reservoirs under climate change kim et al 2019a conducted a reservoir performance sensitivity analysis by stochastically examining water deficit variations under climate change projections in addition to hydrological repercussions climate change impacts on rice yield farming practices growth periods water productivity and the resulting water demands have also been reported cho et al 2021 2019 kim et al 2021 seung hwan et al 2013 yoon and choi 2020 the studies mentioned above were limited to a single or a set of selected reservoirs which is insufficient to develop a national scale policy against the repercussions of climate change in this study we included 400 major agricultural reservoirs spread across the country and examined their performance as a function of climate change during 1973 2017 by comprehensively evaluating various governing factors like watershed runoff irrigation water demands and evaporation losses rice crop evapotranspiration etc irrigation water requirements iwr upstream watershed runoff and volumetric evaporation losses were integrated into a reservoir operation simulation model and annual maximum water demands amwd were estimated based on the paddy water balance and reservoir water balance models to identify reservoirs with reliable storage capacity we compared the amwd for a 10 year frequency drought amwd10 and effective storage capacity esc the recharge index ri and the water deficit index wdi were also derived as functions of available water supply and demand to assess how climate change has impacted reservoir performance in korea 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources in south korea rice production is primarily sustained by irrigation supplies from approximately 17 400 agricultural reservoirs lee et al 2020 of which nearly 81 are managed by local governments but only account for 11 of gross storage the remaining large reservoirs are managed and operated by the korean rural community corporation krc most reservoirs have been operational for more than 50 years and the irrigation supplies are often interrupted due to climate induced rainfall variations and lack of proper care and maintenance cho et al 2021 2019 in this study we selected 400 reservoirs managed by the krc and each has a storage capacity 1000 hectare meter ha m or 107 cubic meters m3 the climate regimes in the reservoir watersheds were represented by 50 weather stations that were selected according to the information provided by the krc fig 1 shows the selected reservoirs and weather stations in this study reservoir specifications such as watershed area irrigated area esc and full storage capacity fsc are shown in supplementary fig s1 the storage capacity range for most reservoirs was 10 000 75 000 103 m3 and the watershed and irrigated areas ranges were 800 36 550 103 m2 and 4370 17 340 103 m2 respectively fig s1 the southern and eastern coastal regions of south korea have a higher density of small to medium sized reservoirs while the larger reservoirs are located in mid latitude inland regions the study methodology is summarized in fig 2 and detailed descriptions are provided in the subsequent sections the korean meteorological administration kma provided daily data of maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin wind speed relative humidity sunshine hours and rainfall p for the 45 years 1973 2017 the 45 years were divided into three time slices 1980s 1973 1987 1990s 1982 2002 and 2000s 2003 2017 and all analyzes were performed for each time slice and throughout the 45 year period south korea receives 1000 1800 mm of p annually of which approximately 60 70 falls as monsoon p from late june to september azam et al 2018 reservoir watersheds are small ungauged and mountainous and monsoon p is the main source of reservoir inflow while snowmelt and p in winters are minor contributors to reservoir inflows kim et al 2019a lee et al 2020 the annual average temperature of 12 3 c fluctuates between 6 6 c winter to 16 6 c summer 2 2 reservoir operation modeling reservoir operation modeling deals with the water balance between inflow and outflow which are governed by rainfall runoff characteristics of the upstream watershed downstream irrigation requirement and volumetric water storage fluctuation cho et al 2019 watershed runoff and incident rainfall on the reservoir surface constitute the inflow and water withdrawal for irrigation evaporation from the reservoir surface and seepage and percolation losses represent the outflow or negative components of the water balance lee et al 2020 in this study the reservoir operation was simulated using the following water balance model 1 s t s t 1 ro t rp t ws t f t re t 2 rp t p t ra 3 f t s t s f if s t s f otherwise 0 where s available reservoir storage ro watershed runoff section 2 2 1 p rainfall on the reservoir surface mm rp rainfall volume m3 ra reservoir surface area at full water level m2 ws water supplied to the irrigation districts section 2 2 3 f overflow through sluice gates re evaporation from the reservoir surface section 2 2 2 sf reservoir storage capacity and t daily time step all the values in eq 1 are in volume units m3 seepage and percolation losses from the reservoir floor were not included in eq 1 because the reservoir groundwater interaction was assumed to be inconsequential in affecting the overall water balance jo et al 2021 2 2 1 simulation of the watershed rainfall runoff process most reservoir watersheds in south korea are small ungauged and located in mountainous regions where accurate estimation of the generated runoff is challenging lee et al 2020 we used the lumped hydrological tank model to simulate the rainfall runoff processes a simple but effective model that has been tested to simulate inflow in low lying flat paddy fields chen et al 2003 2014 nakano et al 2004 sub basin runoff and infiltration rates in the lalindu river in indonesia ahmad 2017 groundwater fluctuations in an observation well in japan hong et al 2016b and reservoir operation modeling in south korea cho et al 2021 2019 jo et al 2021 lee et al 2020 song et al 2016 the model treats the watershed as a tank that can intercept p and then releases it from the side and bottom outlets we used a modified three layered tank model for a typical small sized ungauged south korean watershed and the input parameters were derived empirically by considering watershed land use types such as paddy field upland crop and forest area the water coming out of the first second and third tank s side outlets represented the surface runoff intermediate runoff and baseflow respectively infiltration was represented by the water coming out of the tanks bottom outlets evaporation was subtracted from the bottom tank and p was added to the top tank the detailed working principle and the empirical regression equation used for parameter estimation of the modified tank model can be referenced from song et al 2016 and lee and singh 1999 the regression equations link the watershed characteristics with model parameters to indirectly calibrate the tank model since direct parameter calibration is difficult because the reservoir inflow is usually not measured song et al 2016 2 2 2 estimation of evaporation from the reservoir surface a dam or reservoir stores water to achieve multiple purposes including flood protection provision of irrigation and drinking water and hydropower generation however the evaporation losses are distinctly higher in artificial water storage facilities than in natural water bodies the construction of water storage facilities has significantly increased the worldwide terrestrial water surface area resulting in increased exposure to sunlight and warm air and hence higher evaporation rates for reservoir water budgeting surface evaporation is treated as a loss because water is extracted from the reservoir gorguner and kavvas 2020 zhao and gao 2019 the literature includes a comprehensive discussion on surface evaporation estimation approaches such as the pan evaporation method eddy covariance mass balance and bowen ratio friedrich et al 2018 mcmahon et al 2013 valiantzas 2006 wang and dickinson 2012 the frequently adopted pan evaporation method is regarded as the least accurate and least suitable for precise water balance analyzes a practically viable option for large scale evaporation estimation is the application of physically based combination equations such as the penman equation friedrich et al 2018 in this study we used the penman combination equation for the open water evaporation estimation as follows penman 1948 4 e δ δ γ r n λ γ δ γ ƒ u e s e a 5 ƒ u 1 313 1 381 u 2 where e open water evaporation rate mm d 1 δ slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ psychrometric constant kpa c 1 rn net solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 λ latent heat of vaporization mjkg 1 ƒ u wind function mj m 2 d 1 kpa 1 u2 wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and es ea vapor pressure deficit kpa eq 5 is the penman 1956 wind function which is recommended by mcmahon et al 2006 for open water evaporation estimation weather data should ideally be taken directly above the water body however due to the lack of such data we simulated daily evaporation rates using land based data acquired from 50 weather stations the evaporation volume was the product of reservoir surface area and evaporation rate 2 2 3 estimation of irrigation water requirements in south korea the primary function of agricultural reservoirs is to ensure a consistent water supply to the paddy fields the reservoirs release water according to the iwr determined by the paddy water balance as the difference between etc and effective rainfall er during the rice season april september nursery transplantation to low land paddies is the prevalent rice cultivation practice and iwr is the depth necessary to reimburse etc and percolation losses minus the contribution of p as er lee et al 2020 2017 in addition to reference evapotranspiration eto etc and percolation losses the water required during nursery preparation nursery raising and transplantation is an integral part of paddy water balance cho et al 2019 lee et al 2020 we used the paddy water balance model to estimate the daily iwr as follows 6 iwr et c dp pd lr mr er where etc crop evapotranspiration dp deep percolation pd required ponding depth lr leaching requirements mr miscellaneous requirements er effective rainfall all the entities in eq 6 are in water depth units mm the lr and mr in eq 6 were assumed zero because of their negligible field scale effects and the dp rate and pd were 5 mm d 1 and 140 mm respectively rice etc was calculated as a product of eto from the modified penman equation doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and the 10 day crop coefficients proposed by yoo et al 2008 the incident p during the rice season directly contributes to the pond that has been maintained in the field and the er equals p minus surface runoff lee et al 2020 we used the freeboard model of er estimation to simulate the pond depth and the upper and lower ponding depth thresholds were 80 mm and 20 mm respectively lee et al 2017 seung hwan et al 2013 volumetric iwr was estimated as the product of iwr depth and rice cropping area and was considered equivalent to the water supplied by the reservoirs the detailed procedure for the calculation of the volumetric iwr is provided by cho et al 2021 and also in supplementary section 1 2 of this study 2 3 trend analysis the non parametric rank based mann kendall mk test is widely used for trend detection in the hydrometeorological time series ahmad and choi 2018 serinaldi et al 2018 the underlying assumption of serially independent time series is often not met when dealing with real world data such as streamflow rainfall or temperature and most studies overlook the violation of this assumption in the case of a serially correlated time series the mk test tends to show significant trends when there are no trends in reality douglas et al 2000 farris et al 2021 serinaldi et al 2018 the presence of autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as variance inflation causing over rejection of the null hypothesis ho in the time series by reducing the effective sample size and inflating the variance of the test statistic serinaldi and kilsby 2016 to address the issue of autocorrelated time series two mainly proposed methods include 1 applying a modified mk modmk trend test while properly considering the variance inflation hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 and 2 prewhitening the time series by removing the autocorrelation and then applying the mk trend test katz 1988 von storch 1999 azam et al 2018 applied various techniques aiming at reducing the effects of autocorrelation while detecting rainfall trends in south korea at differing time scales they concluded that modmk has broader applications and is a better choice for trend detection in the rainfall time series in this study the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficients were estimated at α 95 for the annual time series of various hydrometeorological variables such as tmax tmin p etc and iwr etc figs s2 and s3 modmk trend test hamed and ramachandra rao 1998 was adopted for the sites weather stations or reservoirs showing significant lag 1autocorrelation and the corresponding trend magnitudes were estimated using sen s slope estimator at α 95 2 4 field significance another important aspect that needs consideration when simultaneously evaluating multiple ho for numerous spatial points like weather stations or reservoirs is the field significance or test multiplicity when a statistical test is applied at n sites with a significant level of α the ho may be rejected at α n sites in which case a local interpretation of test outcomes can lead to erroneously identifying statistical significant trends at α n sites guerreiro et al 2014 in such cases a global ho assumes that the local ho is true for all the locations at a significance level αglobal and the outcomes of multiple tests are interpreted globally mainly two types of methodologies that have been proposed to deal with the field significance include 1 approaches based on counting the number of ho rejections and comparing them with thresholds derived from the binomial distribution or bootstrapping methods douglas et al 2000 guerreiro et al 2014 and 2 approaches based on reducing the false discovery rate fdr farris et al 2021 wilks 2016 in this study we evaluated the field significance using the fdr test proposed by wilks 2006 which has shown superior performance and straightforward application compared with the alternative computationally extensive field significance tests wilks 2016 the fdr test rejects the local ho for the sites where corresponding p values are lower than a threshold pfdr at a level αglobal αfdr and the presence of field significance is declared furthermore at the sites where local p pfdr all the local ho are also rejected which highlighted the existence of potential spatial correlation among these sites in this study we used αfdr 0 05 and the fdr test was applied to account for the field significance at the 50 weather stations and 400 reservoirs for the annual time series of hydrometeorological variables a detailed explanation of the fdr test and its applications is provided in wilks 2016 and farris et al 2021 2 5 estimation of reliable storage capacity in south korea the reservoir design criterion is to have sufficient storage capacity to store and supply water in the event of a 10 year frequency drought cho et al 2021 2019 in this study reliable storage capacity refers to the state when the esc amwd10 and the reservoirs were categorized as safe and unsafe accordingly the gumbel frequency distribution and the chow frequency factor method were used to estimate the amwd10 as follows 7 x i max s t i 8 x 10 x mean k δ n 1 9 storage capacity safe if eff storage c apacit y x 10 unsafe if eff storage c apacity x 10 where st i reservoir storage in ith year m3 xi annual maximum water demand amwd in ith year m3 x10 amwd for a 10 year frequency drought m3 xmean average amwd m3 k frequency factor based on gumbel frequency distribution and δn 1 standard deviation of amwd 2 6 estimation of recharge and water deficit indices to assess reservoir performance as a function of climate change during the 45 year research period we derived two indices the recharge index ri masia et al 2018 and the water deficit index wdi kim et al 2019a after accounting for the iwr and re the ri indicates how quickly a reservoir can be recharged on average in a year whereas the wdi measures annual reservoir water scarcity as follows 10 recharge index ri total inflow total iwr msc 11 water deficit index wdi total inflow total iwr total iwr where total inflow ro rp total iwr iwr re and msc maximum storage capacity of the reservoir and other terms have been defined in sections 2 2 and 2 2 3 all entities are in volume units m3 the smaller or negative ri and wdi values indicate poor reservoir performance in terms of rechargeability and water availability 3 results 3 1 historic climate variability fig 3 shows the spatiotemporal trends of the annual average tmax tmin and p during 1973 2017 across the 50 weather stations after accounting for the lag 1 autocorrelation fig s2 a c and field significance the temporal trends were evaluated using the modmk test and sen s slope at α 95 it should be noted here that the use of the term nonsignificant trend in this section and henceforth does not imply that no trend is present at the respective site rather it should be treated as the possibility of detecting a trend is weak at the site serinaldi et al 2018 considering the influences of serial correlation and field significance reduce the false ho rejection and consequently comparatively less significant trends are observed azam et al 2018 farris et al 2021 during the study period tmin variability range 4 5 11 5 c was notably higher than that of tmax 16 20 c and spatially higher tmax was prevalent in the northwest coast to mid latitude central inland regions whereas a higher tmin was observed in the northeast coast to mid latitude central inland and southwest coastal regions fig 3a b most weather stations featured significant increasing trends that were markedly higher in the case of tmin compared to tmax while downward trends were mostly nonsignificant shifting climate regimes in the central and southern regions and the relatively cold northern regions were mainly attributed to significant upward tmax and tmin trends respectively fig 3d e in terms of the average absolute change across the time slices the tmax and tmin increased by 0 6 and 0 7 c and 0 4 and 0 9 c during the 1990s and 2000s respectively compared to the 1980s as shown in fig s1 the majority of small and medium sized reservoirs are concentrated in the central and southern regions where climate warming was mainly attributed to significantly increasing tmax trends fig 3d furthermore the larger reservoirs are located in the mid latitude central to upper southern regions where both tmax and tmin showed significant increasing trends during the study period the country received an annual average p of 995 1800 mm the mid latitude inland southeast and southwest coastal regions received comparatively lower annual average p of up to 1280 mm while the south coast and northern parts received the highest annual average p in the range of 1200 1800 mm fig 3c typhoon induced fluctuations and convective air mass systems generate heavy monsoon p in the southern region the annual average p followed the orography and increased from all directions towards the northern parts where the temperature decreased with altitude azam et al 2018 all the selected weather stations had nonsignificant trends with an unclear distinction between the increasing and decreasing p trends fig 3f the south coast with a higher reservoir density predominantly had downward p trends while upward p trends were mostly observed in the northern region the upward and downward p trend ranges were 3 62 mm dec and 1 43 mm dec respectively and the country received 30 and 73 mm extra p during the 1990s and 2020s respectively compared to the 1980s 3 2 crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirement the volumetric water supplies from the reservoirs depend mainly on two components the iwr depth estimated through the paddy water balance and the downstream rice cultivation area etc represents the target water depth during the rice season april september which is partially satisfied by the er and the rest is applied as irrigation we estimate etc er and iwr and their trends during the time slices and the 45 year study period 1973 2017 using eq 6 the reservoirs belonging to a specific weather station had the same etc er and iwr depths thus the spatial variability of these parameters was mapped across the 50 weather stations and the results are presented in figs 4 6 the country wise average etc of 790 mm was almost preserved during the time slices however climate warming prompted higher spatial etc variability that was notably evident during the 1990s and 2000s the 1980s etc mostly ranged between 715 and 800 mm which showed an increasing tendency in the western and eastern coastal regions during the 1990s but remained nearly unchanged during the 2000s regardless of the time slice the southeast and northeast inland and coastal regions had the highest etc values 850 mm compared to the rest of the country fig 4a d despite the clear climate warming unexpectedly dropping etc rates of 3 31 mm dec were detected at 25 weather stations out of which five showed significant trends fig 4e a significant decrease in wind speed caused the drop in etc rates which also highlights the dominance of the aerodynamic component of eto in determining etc rates at these stations a combination of climate warming and a significant increase in the vapor pressure deficit was the main cause of the positive etc trends in the range of 1 5 24 5 mm dec at the remaining weather stations of which seven showed significant trends fig 4e the er is a decisive component of paddy water balance analysis fig 5 shows the spatiotemporal variations of er during the study period the average er of 620 mm for the 50 weather stations was almost similar across the time slices based on the average data during 1973 2017 the west and east coast er range was 500 600 mm and in southwest inland and south coast regions the er range was 600 750 mm fig 5d this spatial trend was distinctly noticeable during the 1980s but gradually diminished during the 1990s and 2000s due to the strong increase in er at the south coast weather stations followed by a simultaneous decline in the southwest inland regions fig 5a c rice season receives the largest proportion of annual p during the monsoon season therefore the annual p and er exhibited similar temporal trends the er temporal trends were nonsignificant and 11 weather stations showed positive trends 1 24 5 mm dec and the remaining 39 weather stations had negative trends 1 31 mm dec the positive er trends were noted in the northern and southwest coast regions while the rest of the country experienced dropping er trends particularly in the northwest and southwest regions fig 5e generally the rice iwr is higher than the difference between etc and iwr since it also includes the additional water requirement for nursery raising and transplanting the country wise iwr average for the 50 weather stations was 805 mm 825 mm 814 mm and 800 mm during the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 1973 2017 respectively similar to the spatial distribution of etc fig 4 the highest iwr range of 800 990 mm was detected in the east coast southeastern inland and southwest coastal regions and for inland regions in the north south direction the iwr range was 700 850 mm regardless of the time slice fig 6a d the iwr trends were nonsignificant and the upward and downward trends were observed at 28 and 22 weather stations in the ranges of 1 22 mm dec and 1 36 mm dec respectively during the study period the iwr increased gradually in the south and east coast regions where the majority of reservoirs were located whereas the northern part of the country with less reservoir density and the mid latitude central region housing the large storage capacity reservoirs experienced an iwr decline which could be explained by the downwards etc trends and or upward er trends observed at these locations fig 6f and fig s1 3 3 reservoir water balance annual total iwr and total inflow were simulated using the reservoir water balance model eq 1 during the time slices and the 45 years from 1973 to 2017 and the results are shown in figs 7 8 the annual total iwr is equal to the sum of the volumetric monthly iwr in the irrigated area of each reservoir during the rice season which is from april to september and the volumetric evaporation from the reservoir surface re throughout the year similarly the total annual inflow refers to the sum of runoff ro generated in the reservoir watershed and the volume of incident p at the reservoir surface rp ro was treated as the inflow that directly enters the reservoirs and the spatiotemporal variations of individual components of the reservoir water balance such as iwr re ro and rp are provided in supplementary figs s4 s6 based on the 45 years data the average annual total iwr for approximately 87 350 out of 400 of the reservoirs was in the range of 356 7000 103 m3 and for the remaining 13 50 out of 400 reservoirs it was 7001 69 079 103 m3 fig 7d the huge disparity in the total iwr among the two groups of reservoirs was chiefly because of different irrigated areas and climate regimes the ranges of irrigated area for the first and second group of reservoirs were 437 29 698 103 m2 and 4460 83 820 103 m2 respectively the inter reservoir variations of total iwr gradually become more noticeable across the time slices particularly during the 1990s when the highest total iwr was shown fig 7 furthermore the reservoirs located in the western and southwest inland and coastal regions had a higher total iwr compared to the rest of the country for most reservoirs the modmk test did not confirm the statistical significance of the trends in total iwr during the 45 years fig 7e considering the clear evidence of climate warming nearly half of the reservoirs unexpectedly exhibited downward iwr trends and these were mostly located in the central inland and western coastal regions this apparent anomaly can be explained by the declining etc trends detected at almost half of the weather stations included in this study section 3 2 fig 4 the reservoirs with increasing trends of total iwr were located mainly on the east coast and in the southern inland and coastal regions generally the reservoirs received a substantially higher total inflow annually in comparison with the total iwr which suggests sufficient water availability since the total iwr estimates in our study only considered the water requirements during the rice season fig 8 during the past 45 years the annual average inflow entering 92 371 out of 400 and 18 29 out of 400 of the reservoirs was 758 28 000 103 m3 and 28 001 419 397 103 m3 respectively and the ranges of watershed area for the two clusters of reservoirs were 800 71 000 103 m2 and 10 400 373 600 103 m2 for all reservoirs total inflow gradually increased across time slices due to the higher annual average p during the 1990s and 2020s respectively compared to the 1980s similar to the total iwr the reservoirs located in western and southwest inland and coastal regions had a higher total inflow compared to the rest of the country the temporal trends of total inflow were in close agreement with the annual p trends section 2 1 fig 3f during 1973 2017 reservoirs showed mainly nonsignificant trends 337 reservoirs had upward trends and 63 reservoirs had downward trends of total inflow all the trends were nonsignificant and positive trends were observed for the reservoirs located in the northern regions fig 8e furthermore the magnitude of positive trends of total inflow was generally higher than those of the negative trends we also analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of the individual components of the reservoir water balance figs s4 s6 and their contribution to the total inflow and total iwr as already mentioned the average annual total inflow into the reservoirs was much higher than the respective total iwr which constituted mainly 30 75 of the total inflow the volumetric iwr solely for rice production showed a progressive increasing tendency throughout the time slices and its value mostly fluctuated in the range of 128 65 400 103 m3 during 1973 2017 fig s4 a d although the iwr trends during the last 45 years were mostly nonsignificant and spatially identical to the total iwr more reservoirs showed the increasing iwr trends than in the case of total iwr fig 7e and fig s4e re loss is also a vital component of the reservoir water budget and is primarily driven by ambient climatic conditions as expected climate warming augmented the average annual re throughout the time slices and for the majority of the reservoirs its value varied in the range of 89 1000 103 m3 during 1973 2017 fig s5 a d moreover depending on the evaporation rate and reservoir surface area the average annual re corresponded to 2 20 and 8 40 of total inflow and total iwr respectively for nearly 85 of the reservoirs during 1973 2017 results not shown here ro was the main contributor to annual total inflow which also showed a rising slope due to higher annual p during time slices and based on the 45 year data its value was from 410 to 28 000 103 m3 for most of the reservoirs fig s6 a d rp was the second component of total inflow which also exhibited similar rising patterns during the time slices for most reservoirs the average annual rp ranged from 105 to 1000 103 m3 and corresponded to 2 20 and 9 40 of total inflow and total iwr respectively for nearly 85 of reservoirs during 1973 2017 results not shown here 3 4 reservoir storage capacity reservoirs with reliable storage capacities were identified by comparing the respective esc and amwd10 which was estimated by using the gumbel frequency distribution and chow frequency factor method section 2 3 cho et al 2021 cho et al 2019 fig 9 presents safe and unsafe reservoirs categorized according to the condition when the esc amwd10 during the three time slices and the 45 year study period regardless of the time slices the amwd10 for all the reservoirs mostly showed declining trends results not shown here because of high total inflow and low total iwr and the esc for nearly 70 of the reservoirs were categorized as safe the unsafe reservoirs with insufficient escs were 119 127 126 and 127 during the 1980s 1990s 2000s and 1973 2017 respectively fig 9a d this suggests that despite the additional total inflow availability the reservoirs have become more susceptible to adverse climate change impacts the watershed irrigated area w iratio ratio was the decisive factor in determining the reliability of the reservoir storage out of the selected 400 unsafe reservoirs were characterized by a w iratio 4 5 and the associated watershed areas were nearly equal to or slightly greater than the respective irrigated areas the 22 unsafe reservoirs had a w iratio 0 which means that these reservoirs had very large irrigated areas compared to the watershed areas the irrigated area watershed area and esc of the unsafe reservoirs w iratio 4 5 were 598 31 550 103 m2 800 62 100 103 m2 and 10 020 151 980 103 m3 respectively and for the remaining safe reservoirs w iratio 4 5 these values were 437 69 170 103 m2 2000 373 600 103 m2 and 10 000 460 702 103 m3 respectively in terms of spatial distribution the unsafe reservoirs were located close to each other along the west and south coast of korea 3 5 recharge index ri is a measure of reservoir resilience that indicates how quickly a reservoir can recover from a failure or stress state masia et al 2018 for each reservoir the ri was estimated using eq 10 as a function of total inflow total iwr and fsc and its spatial variations are presented in fig 9 table s1 presents the five defining classes of reservoir resilience based on ri values which would be used for the interpretation of results in the subsequent section for nearly 82 of the reservoirs the ri was between 0 3 and 0 5 during 1973 2017 and these reservoirs fall under the categories of nonresilient to slightly resilient table s1 whereas most of the remaining reservoirs were resilient and very few were highly resilient fig 10d during the 2000s the reservoir resilience seriously deteriorated as the reservoirs with the ri value between 0 3 and 0 2 were notably higher in this duration compared to the 1980s and 1990s fig 9a c overall the northern and northeastern region reservoirs had acceptable resilience whereas the reservoirs in the western and the southwestern region showed insufficient resilience based on the ri index ri was also closely related to w iratio since for all nonresilient reservoirs ri 0 the w iratio was 1 and the esc of these reservoirs was also unsafe on the contrary highly resilient reservoirs with ri 1 generally had a w iratio 10 while reservoirs with ri values between 0 1 and 1 had a w iratio in the range of 1 10 3 6 water deficit index the wdi was derived as an indicator of total inflow shortages relative to the total iwr for all the reservoirs during the study period a lower value of wdi indicates less inflow availability and values closer to or greater than one indicate sufficient inflow availability against the iwr gondim et al 2018 kim et al 2019a eq 11 was used to derive wdi and fig 11 shows the spatial variation of wdi during the three time slices and the 45 years as explained in section 3 3 that the annual average total inflow entering the reservoirs was generally higher than the total iwr hence the wdi mostly remained 1 indicating no inflow deficit regardless of the time slices fig 11 there were only 21 reservoirs with wdi 1 and these were reservoirs with unsafe storage capacities and the lowest reliability characterized by a w iratio 1 similarly a very high wdi was noted for the reservoirs with w iratio 10 and for the remaining reservoirs 1 w iratio 10 the wdi varied in the range 1 10 fig 11a d the wdi showed spatial patterns similar to those of the ri and the reservoirs in the northern and northeast regions had the least inflow shortages 4 discussion analysis of daily weather data from 50 weather stations during the last 45 years 1973 2017 confirmed that the country is experiencing a warmer and wetter shift in the climate regime seriously detrimental climate shifts were detected in the central and southwestern major agricultural regions which are more socially and environmentally drought prone than the northern regions mun et al 2020 the observed warming of up to 0 6 c could be attributed to anthropogenic intervention however it was difficult to suggest the root cause of the increase of up to 50 mm in the average cumulative annual p the climate change trends identified in our study were well corroborated with previously published studies dealing with historical and future climate change patterns azam et al 2018 cho et al 2019 im et al 2021 kim et al 2021 these climate change trends could propagate two conflicting field scale phenomena that seriously implicate large scale water resource management for rice cultivation climate warming accelerates etc rates producing higher iwr cho et al 2021 2019 chung et al 2011 lee et al 2017 which was also evident in our study while simultaneously reducing rice growth span yield water productivity and overall iwr however more irrigations would be required during the shortened growth span seung hwan et al 2013 yoon and choi 2020 and excessive p would have a limited contribution to er while generating more runoff and pollutant load in paddy fields kim et al 2021 in our study the declining trends in etc and total iwr observed in some locations were surprising given the tangible evidence of climate warming we estimate rice etc as a function of atmospheric evaporative demands or eto which in turn depends on several governing climate variables we further examined the climate conditions at all the weather stations with negative etc trends and a significant decline in the wind speed rates was identified as the reason results not shown here which also suggested that the aerodynamic component was pivotal in dictating eto and etc rates at these stations nam et al 2015b and ghafouri azar et al 2018 also reported similar spatiotemporal eto patterns across south korea caused by a notable decline in the aerodynamic component and wind speed this suggested that apart from temperature other climatic factors can also markedly influence the eto and etc rates and or counteract the undesirable outcomes of climate change therefore considering the composite effect of all the governing climate factors would be a more realistic approach to devising mitigation strategies against the impacts of climate change although the total inflow increased because of the excessive p most reservoirs in our study showed reliable storage capacities studies have predicted that ro in the south korean watersheds would increase while amwd10 would decline simultaneously due to increases in p up to the mid 21st century and then the process would reverse nam et al 2015a seung hwan et al 2013 hence the wdi generally remained 1 implying no water deficit existed which seems to contradict the numerous studies advocating that south korea has become more drought vulnerable during recent years bae et al 2019 kim et al 2018b 2019b mun et al 2020 moreover the resilience in terms of ri also declined over time signifying that the failure recovery time of reservoirs has become longer which should not be the case given the trends of total inflow and wdi water management in south korea is driven by a typical monsoon climate characterized by a hot wet summer and dry cold winters approximately 60 70 of annual p occurs from july to september and the major proportion of annual ro is generated in these summer months azam et al 2018 kim et al 2019a during the spring and winter seasons the total inflow into the reservoirs remains substantially lower than in the summer or rice season while the maximum total iwr is observed during the early rice growth stages from april to june cho et al 2021 jo et al 2021 the excessive total inflow stored in the reservoirs is released during the early drought period of the next rice season due to the misaligned timing of total inflow generation and maximum total iwr farmers can face water shortages from april to june chung et al 2011 kim et al 2018a we analyze monthly p data in the rice season during 1973 2017 and observe nonsignificant downward p trends throughout the peak water demand period from april to june and then these trends reversed from july to september fig s8 as mentioned in section 3 3 that up to 20 of the annual total inflow could be lost as re depending on the climatic conditions and reservoir surface area and the maximum rate of re loss could also occur during the hottest months of april to june a combination of the misaligned monthly p distribution with the peak water demand period and higher re rates could be the cause of the ri decline noted in our study despite the acceptable value of wdi and total inflow trends the primary objective of this study was to perform a large scale water balance analysis that could be used to develop and implement a national scale mitigation policy against climate change threats however there were some limitations in this study because of the data availability constraints for example warming induced growth span shortening was not considered in this study according to the recent krc surveys socioeconomic development and farm mechanization has prolonged the transplanting period and the associated farmers water application patterns have been changed resulting in substantially higher iwr from april to june cho et al 2021 2019 actual water supply data covering 45 years of the study period were not available for all reservoirs therefore we treat the total iwr as the water supplied by the reservoirs but under actual field conditions much higher amounts of water are supplied compared to the total iwr based on eight years 2011 2017 of data for eight selected reservoirs cho et al 2021 concluded that actual water supplies could be 13 44 higher than the total iwr land use variations in the upstream reservoir watersheds and changes in cultivation areas of paddy and upland crops in the downstream irrigated areas during the study period were assumed constant when simulating ro and iwr despite the shortcomings this study provides valuable information on the state of reservoirs in terms of storage capacity resilience and water deficit in addition to the least reliable reservoirs that require immediate attention slightly resilient reservoirs that are most likely to fail soon in the future were also identified so that short and long term mitigation plans could be developed and implemented increasing the storage capacity of suitable reservoirs could be a viable option because more total inflow would be available in the future recently the south korean government has already completed the four major river restoration project in which 16 weirs were constructed across four major rivers and the dam height of large agricultural reservoirs was raised to provide safety against drought and flood jo et al 2021 our results suggested that simply increasing the storage capacity might not necessarily improve the reservoir performance because it would increase the reservoir surface area and hence the re losses kim et al 2019a argued that improving reservoir storage would also aggravate the sensitivity of reservoir performance to climate change we concluded that future climate warming would have more detrimental effects than p variations since additional ro would be lost more quickly to the atmosphere as re finally the southern inland and coastal regions should be the epicenter of mitigation planning and the water supply in these regions should be improved by strategically focusing on the vulnerable dry periods and by tackling the spatial variations of the reservoir water balance 5 conclusions achieving and maintaining rice self sufficiency is clinically important for the food security of south korea and the network of agricultural reservoirs that had been instrumental in providing water for rice cultivation is now threatened by climate change in this study the climate change threats to the water resource infrastructure of south korea were interpreted by conducting a comprehensive water balance analysis for 400 agricultural reservoirs during 1973 2017 1 climate warming was distinctly severe in central and southern major agricultural areas with high reservoirs density and the warming gradient featured markedly higher tmin trends compared to those of tmax 2 the cumulative annual p gradually increased throughout the study period but the exact forcing mechanism and statistical significance of the spatiotemporal p trends were unclear while the er in the rice season exhibited notable declining tendencies 3 climate warming caused an overall increase in annual total iwr particularly in reservoirs where the radiation component of eto was dominant and for nearly half of the reservoirs the decreasing wind speed trends limited the anticipated surge in etc and total iwr 4 generally the reservoir total inflows remained notably higher than the total iwr chiefly because of the p increments which augmented ro generation in the reservoir watersheds 5 the w iratio was a critical design factor and 127 reservoirs were identified on the western and southern coasts that had unsafe storage capacities out of which 22 reservoirs had the lowest reliability and maximum water deficit due to a w iratio 1 6 highly resilient reservoirs showing safe storage capacity and no water deficit had a w iratio 10 large reservoirs in the central region and medium reservoirs in the southwest regions 1 w iratio 5 should be prioritized for rehabilitation activities because these showed a high potential of inevitable failure in the future our results suggested that the reservoirs should have w iratio 5 otherwise a minor disruption in reservoir water balance under the influence of future climate change would seriously compromise the reservoir performance credit authorship contribution statement mirza junaid

8001,study region this study is developed in three catchments located in denmark france and spain covering different climate and physical conditions in europe study focus the simulation skill of hydrological models under contrasting climate conditions is evaluated using a differential split sample test dsst in each catchment three different hydrological models are given a weight based on their simulation skill according to their robustness considering the dsst results for traditional and purpose specific metrics four weighting approaches are used each including a different set of evaluation metrics the weights are applied to obtain reliable future projections of annual mean river discharge and purpose specific metrics new hydrological insights projections are found to be sensitive to model weightings in cases where the models show significantly different skills in the dsst however when the skills of the models are similar there is no significant change when applying different weighting schemes nevertheless the methodology proposed here increases the reliability of the purpose for fit hydrological projections in a climate change context keywords uncertainty climate change impacts model weighting differential split sampling test bayesian model averaging 1 introduction water related impact assessments are often included in climate services across europe soares et al 2018 and their reliability significantly depends among other factors on validated scientific methods hewitt et al 2012 methods behind the assessment of climate change impacts on hydrology and or the projected impacts in different regions have been used extensively e g rojas et al 2011 brigode et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2013 van vliet et al 2015 wagner et al 2017 teutschbein et al 2018 fonseca and santos 2019 pastén zapata et al 2020 hundecha et al 2020 and have at the same time highlighted that the contribution of hydrological models to the total uncertainty in the projected hydrological variables can be substantial hagemann et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2014 therefore it is relevant to evaluate the simulation skill of the hydrological models used for impact assessments this will eventually improve the usability of the projections by providing access to quality assured information traditionally the simulation skill of hydrological models is assessed using a split sample test sst this test divides an observation period into two non overlapping sub segments of similar length using one period to calibrate the model and the remaining to evaluate it klemeš 1986 model parameters are usually calibrated by optimizing a performance metric the objective function a model and its parameters is deemed transferable in time if it performs well in the evaluation period nevertheless in a climate change context this approach might be inadequate because it assumes stationary conditions refsgaard et al 2014 typically a model with good simulation skill in one period does not necessarily perform as well in subsequent periods where climate is changing thirel et al 2015a hence in climate change impact assessments evaluating the skill of hydrological models to simulate hydrological processes under contrasting climate conditions should be a standard approach seiller et al 2012 when models satisfy such tests the confidence in the future projection increases and their contribution to the total uncertainty decreases krysanova et al 2018 an alternative to a standard sst is the differential split sample test dsst klemeš 1986 where historical non stationary periods of contrasting climatic regimes are used to calibrate and evaluate the hydrological model during the last decade assessments of the skill of hydrological models in contrasting climates based on the dsst have been performed in many contexts on many models most of these studies concluded that in general hydrological models may lack robustness in a changing climate context e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 thirel et al 2015b the consequences of off target hydrological projections for water planning is one of the key issues of modern hydrology blöschl et al 2019 unsolved problems in hydrology n 1 20 and 21 in general hydrologists stress the need to improve hydrological process descriptions toward better plausibility and extrapolation skills e g merz et al 2011 coron et al 2014 fowler et al 2020 a few authors have proposed different versions of the dsst such as the generalised split sample test coron et al 2012 or the general differential split sample test dakhlaoui et al 2019 but they are generally based on the same idea as dsst dsst is based on observed changes however climate projections indeed suggest that in some parts of the world future changes may be completely beyond the range recorded in historical data hence the approach might underestimate model potential failures in hydrological projections stephens et al 2020 while the dsst has repeatedly been applied to hydrological models e g li et al 2012 thirel et al 2015b broderick et al 2016 simulation skills are usually evaluated using criteria such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 or the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 however such criteria might be inconclusive especially when dealing with specific water management issues such as water supply flood impacts droughts or stresses on ecosystems it may be expected that a model performing well on reproducing the main hydrological characteristics of a catchment appears more reliable compared to a model performing well only on very specific hydrological signatures while showing poor general performance from an end user point of view however when the possibility to choose from a handful of models with different simulation capabilities is present the model selection might not always be straightforward hence the inclusion of metrics specifically designed to fit end user purposes in addition to usual performance metrics could benefit both the usability and the quality of future projections besides rather than selecting one well performing hydrological model it might be preferred to use an ensemble of models weighted based on their simulation skills the advantage of using ensembles is to compensate for flaws of individual models knutti 2010 such as deficient model structures non stationarity of the parameters and biased climate inputs broderick et al 2016 seiller et al 2012 ensemble simulations also allow for uncertainty assessment of the projections however acknowledging that not all models are equally skilled weighting models is useful to increase the reliability of ensemble projections from the perspective of climate models knutti 2010 points out that weighting procedures should be used as a tool to discard unskillful models rather than to select the best model christensen et al 2010 examined different ways of aggregating performance metrics into single weights for climate models although it was shown that the choice of the aggregation method has a rather small influence on the performance of the model ensemble it was suggested that the model weighting should be considered as an additional level of uncertainty nowadays assigning different weights to climate models of an ensemble according to their simulation skills is frequently used in practice e g haughton et al 2015 knutti et al 2017 wang et al 2019 compared to climate models weighting of hydrological models in climate change impact assessments has rarely been explored najafi et al 2011 assessed for example the hydrological model uncertainty with a set of four hydrological models of different complexities in a catchment in the usa and discussed the contribution of the bayesian model averaging method for model weighting likewise broderick et al 2016 found that model averaging techniques remained consistent under temporal transferability in several irish catchments and recommended objective based weighting methods despite the numerous insights in the role of hydrological models within the uncertainty cascade in climate change impacts e g velázquez et al 2013 dams et al 2015 karlsson et al 2016 lemaitre basset et al 2021 and the long standing tradition of model comparison in the hydrological community none has investigated how weighting of the hydrological models affects the projections and their uncertainty when evaluating the model performance in contrasting climate by applying a dsst and including metrics that are specifically tailored to specific end users methods to tailor the choice of climate and hydrological model ensemble would improve the usability user acceptance and potential uptake of the projections therefore the main objectives of this study are a to assess the robustness of hydrological models by evaluating their ability to describe the impact of climate change using a dsst b to estimate weights for hydrological models based on their robustness c to compare the effect of different weighting schemes on the projection of future climate change impacts d to assess the robustness of the models to project changes in purpose specific metrics that were not used during calibration and e to quantify the uncertainty of the projections considering the different weighting schemes the study is based on three european case studies using ensembles of climate and hydrological models to evaluate the future projections for each case study three hydrological models are evaluated with different sets of metrics in a dsst experiment to identify which are more skillful to reproduce changing climate conditions the sensitivity of future projections to the different sets of weights is then assessed with a specific focus on the uncertainty 2 methodology 2 1 case studies and available data three case studies across europe are analyzed these are located in denmark france and spain fig 1 each case focuses on providing information for decision making specific to that particular site there are significant differences between the catchments the danish catchment is mostly flat whereas the french and spanish sites are topographically complex with snow processes and snowmelt timing playing important roles in addition the recent 30 year trends for the annual mean precipitation and streamflow are positive for the danish catchment and negative for the other catchments fig 2 2 1 1 denmark climate change has a significant impact in the storå catchment in western denmark fig 1 focus is given to hydrological conditions of importance for agriculture where dry and wet conditions both have negative impacts thus the target of this case study is to assess the change in the future occurrence of high and low flows in the catchment additionally we look at how the mean groundwater level is projected to change in the future such aspects are important in the study catchment as wet conditions in denmark primarily occurring in winter fig 2 lead to waterlogged agricultural fields increasing the drainage needs on the other hand dry conditions commonly in summer increase the irrigation needs additionally in recent years there have been river floods in urban areas within the catchment 2 1 2 france the hydrological cycle of the durance catchment fig 1 in the southern french alps is expected to be strongly affected by climate change among the potential impacts reduced snowpack and shifted timing of snowmelt flows may impact the serre ponçon reservoir which fits many purposes for water management in the region maughan 2015 branche 2017 in this case study we focused on the average water discharge in the reservoir in winter and spring as well as on the timing of spring peak flows 2 1 3 spain future climate scenarios suggest a reduction in snow persistence over the guadalfeo river catchment fig 1 in sierra nevada mountain range southern spain this catchment constitutes an example of alpine conditions in a semiarid area i e high evaposublimation rates herrero and polo 2016 with occurrence of several snowmelt accumulation ablation cycles within the year pimentel et al 2017b and a high variability in river discharge linked to the snow dynamics pérez palazón et al 2018 fig 2 water resources from the snowpack are key in the area where different activities compete for allocating water therefore this case study tries to assess the impact of future climate scenarios on water availability in the area thus the projected streamflow volume and the future occurrence of extreme conditions wet and dry are analyzed 2 2 hydrological modelling three different hydrological models are set up for each site to account for the hydrological model uncertainty fig 3 a the selected hydrological models are frequently employed in each of the regions to assess the impacts of climate change therefore a specific hydrological model ensemble is used for each catchment a potential benefit of the different modelling setups spanning from conceptual rainfall runoff models to distributed hydrological models at the three case studies is that a broader range of model behaviors may be observed by setting up different frameworks for the experiment doubts to the applicability of the conclusions to other contexts are partly avoided the main drawback of this approach is however a more limited understanding of the results since the different components of the setups e g regional climate characteristics model hypotheses etc cannot be easily isolated for comparison between the sites the models used in each case are described next 2 2 1 denmark the mike she model is the base model of the danish national water resources model henriksen et al 2003 højberg et al 2013 stisen et al 2019a 2019b mike she is a physically based integrated and fully distributed groundwater surface water model abbott et al 1986 graham and butts 2005 here the model is set up at a 250 m x 250 m resolution input climate data come from datasets developed by the danish meteorological institute gridded at a 20 km x 20 km resolution for temperature and potential evapotranspiration and 10 km x 10 km for precipitation scharling 2012 daily streamflow data come from national environmental monitoring programme novana from the danish ministry of environment and food dce described by stisen et al 2019a 2019b and made available by koch and schneider 2022 three different conceptualizations models of the unsaturated zone are used a richards equation with the soil profiles discretized vertically it is based on the continuity equation and darcy s law graham and butts 2005 vertical flow is a function of gravity and capillary forces the actual evapotranspiration ae is estimated as a function of the vegetation status and soil moisture kristensen and jensen 1975 b gravity flow with a vertical discretization of the soil profiles it is a simple form of the richards equation where the vertical flow depends entirely on the gravity graham and butts 2005 ae is estimated as a function of the vegetation status and soil moisture kristensen and jensen 1975 c two layer model of the unsaturated zone the unsaturated zone is divided into a root zone and a zone below the root zone water infiltrating from the upper unsaturated zone layer flows directly to the saturated zone whenever the water content in the lower unsaturated zone layer equals field capacity graham and butts 2005 ae depends on the potential evapotranspiration pe vegetation status and soil moisture content yan and smith 1994 the three versions of the mike she model do not represent three totally different models however the unsaturated zone is a central component of the model that controls water balance and a number of flow components hence it is assumed that working with the three versions of unsaturated zone of mike she is sufficient to obtain results that are significantly different the models are calibrated using a multi criteria objective function demirel et al 2018 that includes river discharge nse and kge groundwater head rmse and estimated irrigation simulated in a demand driven manner rmse automatic calibration is done using pest doherty et al 1994 2 2 2 france three lumped daily rainfall runoff models gr4j hbv0 and topmo associated with a snow module cemaneige are used to simulate the hydrology of the french catchment these models have been widely used in the country data come from the hydro safran daily data set delaigue et al 2020 daily streamflow measurements at the outlet of the catchments were retrieved from banque hydro leleu et al 2014 daily meteorological data were supplied by the safran dataset an 8 km x 8 km atmospheric reanalysis vidal et al 2010 aggregated at catchment scale potential evaporation pe was computed using the temperature and radiation based formula proposed by oudin et al 2005 a short description of the models is provided here a gr4j perrin et al 2003 is a parsimonious four parameter lumped conceptual model ae depends on pe and soil moisture content b hbv0 bergström and forsman 1973 bergstrom 1995 is a nine parameter lumped model designed for snow covered catchments here its native snow module is replaced by the cemaneige snow module ae depends on pe and soil moisture content c topmo michel et al 2003 is a seven parameter lumped adaptation of topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 where the distribution of the topographical index is approximated by a calibrated two parameter probability distribution function instead of being derived from catchment topography ae depends on pe and soil moisture content cemaneige valéry et al 2014 is a two parameter degree day snow module it divides the catchment into five altitude layers of equal area where the snow cover on each layer is represented as a conceptual reservoir filled by solid precipitation the daily amount of melted water is used as input to the rainfall runoff models in addition to liquid precipitation the parameters of cemaneige were calibrated simultaneously with the parameters of the hydrological models gr4j and cemaneige are used within the airgr r package coron et al 2017 2018 hbv0 and topmo are used within the airgrplus r package in development coron and perrin 2018 the models are automatically calibrated by optimizing the kge computed on the square root of streamflow the optimization algorithm is based on a prior global screening of the parameter space followed by a local search from the identified best parameter set see edijatno et al 1999 mathevet 2005 2 2 3 spain previous experience in the spanish case study suggests the use of process oriented semi distributed or physically based models gridded daily meteorological data 30 m x 30 m generated from in situ weather stations using specific interpolation algorithms for each meteorological variable 2010 herrero et al 2007 were used in the historical runs this information is aggregated at the catchment scale for hype and swat and used as distributed maps for wimmed the daily streamflow data come from the water authority in the region the selected models have been previously used in the area a hype hydrological prediction for the environment lindström et al 2010 is a daily timestep semi distributed process based hydrological model using hydrological response units hrus as calculation units hype uses a snow melting routine that combines three decay factors linked to air temperature radiation and fractional snow cover samuelsson et al 2011 ae is estimated using the modified hargreaves samani pe formulation hargreaves and samani 1982 whereas infiltration into three soil layers is calculated using a water table discrimination model lindström et al 2010 b swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 is a daily timestep conceptual semi distributed hydrological model in which the spatial resolution is fixed by hrus snowmelt is calculated using a degree day method and ae is estimated using the penman monteith pe formulation penman 1948 monteith et al 1964 infiltration is calculated using green and ampt 1911 in a single soil layer c wimmed watershed integrated model for mediterranean environments polo et al 2010 is a hourly timestep distributed physically based model the snow module snowmed uses a punctual mass and energy balance extended to a distributed scale using depletion curves herrero et al 2009 pimentel et al 2017a ae is calculated using the penman monteith pe formulation penman 1948 monteith et al 1964 whereas infiltration is estimated using the green and ampt 1911 approach in a two layer soil discretization calibration is done through a process oriented stepwise approach based on expert knowledge minimizing mean absolute error in daily water volumes 2 3 differential split sample test dsst 2 3 1 principles of the dsst the dsst is a scheme used to evaluate the extent at which the hydrological models are capable of skillfully simulating hydrological processes in a climate change context three different historical periods are identified the calibration control and evaluation periods the calibration and control periods are comparable although they concern different years whereas the evaluation period is defined to obtain the largest contrast in simulation results hence the method aims at reproducing a change between calibration conditions and evaluation conditions the method allows flexibility in the selection of the periods e g length and continuity or discontinuity as shown in previous studies that applied it e g broderick et al 2016 li et al 2012 seiller et al 2012 brigode et al 2013 gelfan and millionshchikova 2018 in this study the dsst results are used to rank the models based on their performance and define a weight for each model within the ensemble 2 3 2 setup of the dsst in the case studies the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of hydrological models on periods with contrasting climate conditions thus to enhance the contrast among the periods the lengths of the calibration control and evaluation periods are set to three possibly non consecutive years table 1 the climate variable used for classifying the periods is case dependent based on the needs of each case study the annual accumulated precipitation is used in the danish and spanish cases whereas the annual mean temperature is used for the french case all sites rank the annual values of the variable of interest from the maximum to the minimum using this approach the wettest and driest denmark and spain and the warmest and coldest france years are identified fig 3 b based on this rank a calibration period is defined used for adjustment of the parameters of the model along with a control period to assess the calibrated model skill under similar climate conditions but outside the calibration period and an evaluation period to assess transferability of the model to contrasting climate conditions thus for the danish and spanish sites the calibration period is set to comprise the 1st 3rd and 5th driest years the control period includes the 2nd 4th and 6th driest years and the evaluation period is composed by the 1st 3rd and 5th wettest years likewise for the french case calibration and control take place during the coldest years while the evaluation on contrasting conditions is carried out in the warmest three years fig 3 c next the entire observation period is simulated but the parameters of the models are calibrated only for the calibration period the objective functions used during calibration are those defined in section 2 2 2 3 3 evaluation metrics widely used evaluation metrics are applied to assess the simulation skill of the models in addition as the goal is to provide useful information for the end users purpose specific metrics are included in the assessment overall eight evaluation metrics are used to assess the skill of each hydrological model table 2 metric f6 involves three purpose specific metrics the aim of the proposed purpose specific metrics for the danish case table 3 is to evaluate the frequency of high f6 1 and low flows f6 2 and the importance of groundwater head for the shallow wells f6 3 in the french case the metrics focus on mean flows during the fall winter season f6 1 and during the spring summer season f6 2 and on the date at which half of the total water volume flowing during the six first months of the year is reached f6 3 finally for the spanish case total water volume f6 1 and the occurrence of drought conditions f6 2 and extreme wet conditions f6 3 are assessed 2 3 4 hydrological model ranking and assignment of weights evaluation of the climate model performance in the present climate at local scale is controversial knutti 2010 this is mainly because climate models are intended to simulate large scale climate processes instead of local climate thus climate models are not submitted to a sst calibration procedure to fine tune the models hence although different studies can be found where climate models are evaluated based on their performance and assigned weights accordingly in this study climate models are given the same probability of occurrence hydrological models however are ranked based on their simulation skill with respect to the metrics described in tables 2 and 3 fig 3d according to their relative skill for each of the metrics a score of 3 is assigned to the best performing hydrological model 2 to the model with the intermediate skill and 1 to the hydrological model with the lowest skill once the scores for each metric are defined they are combined multiplicatively in four different sets termed as final weights w1 to w4 these weights are normalized to sum 1 weight 1 w1 includes all metrics except the purpose specific metrics weight 2 w2 only includes the purpose specific metrics weight 3 w3 includes all the metrics finally weight 4 w4 represents the model democracy approach where all hydrological models have the same weight one third w4 is used as reference for comparison because it is the approach that is commonly used i e no weights are applied to the hydrological models the four weights are defined as 1 w 1 i r 1 i r 2 i r 3 i r 4 i r 5 i i w 1 i 2 w 2 i r 6 1 i r 6 2 i r 6 3 i i w 2 i 3 w 3 i r 1 i r 2 i r 3 i r 4 i r 5 i r 6 1 i r 6 2 i r 6 3 i i w 3 i 4 w 4 i 1 3 model democracy where w j i is the weight of model i 1 3 in the j th weighting scheme 1 4 after normalization and r f i is the rank of model i with the f th metric 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 6 2 or 6 3 in the following w j i will denote weights after normalization so that i w j i 1 weighted projections are obtained by combining the weights and the hydrological projections see fig 3 h 2 4 climate change impact assessment 2 4 1 climate models selection five gcm rcm combinations from the euro cordex initiative and specifically eur 11 12 km spatial resolution grid jacob et al 2014 are used see table 4 this is a subset of the eur 11 ensemble since here a climate model ensemble of opportunity ensemble based on model availability annan and hargreaves 2010 is used at each study site as driving climate for the hydrological models the combinations include two different rcms driven by three different gcms fig 3 e the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 is used to assess the projected changes rcp 8 5 represents the high emission scenario and it reproduces the current emission trend more accurately than other pathways hayhoe et al 2017 2 4 2 bias correction daily temperature and precipitation were bias corrected to match the observed climate data fig 3 f using methodologies previously tested in each region for the danish case the distribution based scaling method seaby et al 2013 is used for precipitation a double gamma distribution is used with the cutoff at the 90th percentile and a zero precipitation threshold to match the number of observed and simulated dry days similarly the distribution of the temperature simulations is fitted to a normal distribution pastén zapata et al 2019 for the french case biases were corrected with the cdf t statistical method michelangeli et al 2009 the method assumes that the cumulative distribution function cdf of a local climate variable can be derived from a translation t of the cdf of the associated gcm variable in the historical period and that this transformation is also valid in the projection period the cdf t technique has been applied for the french case study along with the singularity stochastic removal to better deal with dry days as done by vrac et al 2016 finally an empirical quantile mapping is used for bias adjustment in the spanish case i e boé et al 2007 sun et al 2011 climate model cdfs of daily precipitation and temperature for the whole reference period are matched with the observed cdfs for precipitation the cdfs are truncated to maintain the same number of dry days fixing a threshold of 1 mm hay and clark 2003 2 4 3 uncertainty of the hydrological projections hydrological projections are produced using simulations from the hydrological models that were calibrated and evaluated using the standard sst a common approach in hydrology which is described in supplementary material s1 bias corrected climate data from the five gcm rcm combinations are used as input to produce hydrological projections divided into different periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 the projected changes in the annual mean streamflow regime and purpose specific metrics are assessed considering the different weights fig 3 i a bayesian model averaging approach hoeting et al 1999 neuman 2003 is used to assess the uncertainty associated with the weighted outputs using the variance of the projection var j x for a hydrological variable x 5 var j x i 1 n hm w j i s i w j i e j x x i 2 6 e j x 1 n cm k 1 n cm i 1 n hm w j i x k i 7 x i 1 n cm k 1 n cm x k i 8 s i 1 n cm 1 k 1 n cm x k i x i 2 where w j i refers to the computed weight for the hydrological model i for the j th weighting scheme 1 4 s i is the variance of hydrological variable for the hydrological model i e j x is the mean of the ensemble of all climate and hydrological models x i is the mean of the ensemble of climate models for hydrological model i x k i is the hydrological variable value for the hydrological model i when driven by climate model k nhm is the number of hydrological models 3 ncm is number of climate models 5 the uncertainty can also be shown as the standard deviation of the projection defined as the square root of the variance bayesian model averaging has been used in previous studies to assess the uncertainty of hydrological projections e g najafi and moradkhani 2015 refsgaard et al 2012 najafi et al 2011 3 results focus in the first part of the analysis is given to the evaluation of the hydrological models using dsst and the metrics presented in section 2 3 3 fig 3d this approach provides an assessment of the overall simulation skill of each hydrological model relative to the other models included in the ensemble with emphasis on their ability to generate reliable results for periods with contrasting climate conditions 3 dry years vs 3 wet years the weights eqs 1 4 are subsequently combined with results from the projections of the three hydrological models to obtain a single future streamflow record in the beginning 2010 2039 middle 2040 2069 and end 2070 2099 of the century the results generated in these periods are compared to the results from the reference period 3 1 simulation skill of the monthly streamflow regime under contrasting conditions the simulation skill with respect to the monthly streamflow regime is important as decision making is usually done at the monthly scale for each case study for the danish case shifts in the streamflow regime affects the agricultural management e g water availability drought periods flood periods for the french and spanish cases changing snow conditions impact the monthly streamflow regime fig 4 shows the observed and simulated discharge from each case during the calibration control and evaluation periods in each period the monthly average for three years is presented in the danish case all three models simulate the monthly streamflow in the evaluation period accurately the two layer model underestimates the streamflow in late spring and summer months in contrast the winter flow is overestimated by the gravity flow and richards equation model the best performing model is the gravity flow model with the highest values for correlation coefficient 0 92 nash sutcliffe coefficient 0 76 and the kling gupta efficiency 0 76 see table s2 for the french case the three models tend to underestimate the spring peak flow resulting from snowmelt during the evaluation period in summer topmo and gr4j to a lesser extent display some problems to adequately represent low flows compared to hbv0 the overall better fit between hbv0 simulations and the observations reflects the higher skill of the model considering the f2 metric table 5 it should nonetheless be noted that the differences between the models are rather small around 5 m3 s compared to the average streamflow in the catchment 80 m3 s the models from the spanish case show large differences in the performance of the calibration control and evaluation periods biases are larger during the evaluation period where wimmed has the smallest relative biases followed by swat and finally sn hype wimmed and especially swat tend to overestimate the monthly streamflow whereas the sh hype model largely underestimates it despite this underestimation sn hype like wimmed is able to capture the timing of the flow which is not the case for swat 3 2 simulation skill for the general metrics under contrasting conditions results from the metrics indicate that no hydrological model gives the best results for all metrics table 5 nevertheless there are models that show a higher simulation skill than others or models whose simulation skill is low for most of the metrics table 5 for instance in the danish case the richards equation model has the lowest skill for half of the metrics and it is the best performing model only for one metric f6 3 the model with the best simulation skill varies between the two layer and gravity flow models indicating that the skill of these two models is similar for this set of metrics for the french case the results indicate that the hbv0 model is the best performing model for seven out of eight metrics it can also be observed that the topmo model has the worst performance for seven out of eight metrics the simulation skill of the gr4j model is intermediate in the spanish case wimmed shows the best results for seven out of the eight defined metrics sn hype has the worst results for all the metrics from the three models used in the spanish case the simulation skill of swat falls in between the other two it has the highest skill for one of the metrics but its performance is similar to the wimmed model 3 3 simulation skill for the purpose specific metrics here it is shown how the hydrological models simulate each of the purpose specific metrics in the evaluation period table 5 metric f6 s in the danish case the annual mean days with river flow equal or above the q10 f6 1 are generally simulated better during calibration table s2 for this metric biases are of similar magnitude during control and evaluation except for the two layer model that has a better skill during control all models seem to adapt well to the simulation of days with low flows f6 2 outside the calibration period as the biases during evaluation are reduced compared to the other periods the mean absolute error of the groundwater level in shallow wells f6 3 is larger during control than evaluation except for the richards equation model which has a similar skill in all periods however during calibration and control the error is significantly higher for richards equation compared to two layer with the gravity formulation in between during control the best performing model varies for each purpose specific metric all models are the best for one metric for the french case the hbv0 model generally outperforms the other models in all periods interestingly while large differences in the ability of the models to reproduce winter volumes during the calibration period are found very similar performances are observed during the evaluation period considering all periods and models the accumulated winter streamflow is overestimated whereas accumulated spring streamflow is systematically underestimated the error in the accumulated spring streamflow is lower for hbv0 during all periods whereas topmo has the highest error for all periods the biases in the winter spring center volume wscv day increase in the control and evaluation periods compared to calibration errors in timing of the three models are small all simulate peak flows approximately 3 days too early during the cold control period but display a short delay in the evaluation period for the spanish case the biases in the annual streamflow are relatively small for all models during the calibration and control but increase at least by a factor of four during the evaluation for all models because of the high variability between dry and wet conditions the model with the lowest bias varies in each of the periods while wimmed never shows the highest errors the bias in the annual mean number of days with river flow equal or below the q90 are lower for the sn hype model during the control and evaluation periods in this case swat largely overestimates the occurrence of low flows finally for the annual mean number of days with river flow equal to or above the q10 the biases are larger for the calibration and control compared to the evaluation period due to the small values of the observed streamflow during the calibration and control sn hype and wimmed always show the same signal in their biases whereas changes in swat go in the opposite direction 3 4 assigned weights based on the model simulation skill for the french and spanish cases the three weighting schemes based on the dsst results all except w4 give a clear preference to one model out of the three table 6 these models are hbv0 for the french case and wimmed for the spanish case whatever the weighting scheme these models have the highest weight and thus have the highest influence on the projection of impacts for the danish case w1 and w3 produce the same weights while w2 results in model democracy for the danish case considering w1 and w3 the weight of the two layer model is almost three times higher than the model with the second highest weight the difference in the french case is even larger considering the weighting schemes w1 w2 and w3 for w1 and w3 the topmo model has a weight lower than 0 1 in all cases the weights defined by w2 purpose specific metrics show less dispersion than the weights of w1 and w3 this is the result of the more even distribution of model rankings according to the simulation skill of purpose specific metrics and or of the lower number of metrics that are assessed therefore no model is completely discarded by this scheme 3 5 impact assessment in this section the impact on the hydrological projections obtained from climate models is quantified corresponding to fig 3 step g 3 5 1 projected changes changes in hydrological factors are based on climate model results below the impact on different quantities and metrics are described 3 5 1 1 annual mean streamflow the future streamflow is projected using the weights for each model table 6 at the beginning 2010 2039 middle 2040 2069 and end 2070 2099 of the century the results from these periods are compared to those from the reference period 1976 2005 for the danish and french cases and 1971 2000 for the spanish case fig 5 additionally the effect of the weighting method can be observed when compared to the standard model democracy approach w4 for the danish case fig 5 left panel all weighting schemes indicate a median slight increase approximately less than 5 in the annual mean streamflow during the near and mid future for the far future the projections indicate a median increase of approximately 15 in the annual mean streamflow however the difference between the weighting scheme and hence the choice of hydrological model is small in the french case fig 5 central panel annual mean streamflow is projected to increase in the near future while it is expected to decrease in the mid and far future in the far future period most of the models project a 10 decline compared to the historical period however projected values exhibit a rather large inter model uncertainty for most future periods the impact of the weighting method on the change in discharge is in some cases significant in the far future changes between 0 and 10 are found where w4 consistently yields smaller values than the other weighting schemes finally in the spanish case the annual mean streamflow is projected to decrease for all weighting methods and time horizons the median decrease ranges from about 10 in the near future to almost 20 in the mid future and between 20 and 30 in the far future by the end of the century all projections agree on the direction of the change signal for the danish case however for the french and spanish cases different change directions are projected for different models for the danish case weighting schemes w1 and w3 project a larger increase in streamflow than w2 and w4 however the change throughout the century follows a similar pattern for the french case all four weighting approaches project rather similar changes across the century although the discrepancy increases with time in the far future period the largest difference is found between w3 and w4 where the first simulates the largest future discharges whereas the second simulates the lowest future discharge for the spanish case a clear decreasing pattern in discharge is found for all weights however w2 always projects the driest scenario with a slightly higher value of change when compared to the other weights on the contrary w4 projects the lowest changes for all periods except for the mid future for the mid future w1 and w3 which always have similar patterns project a scenario that is slightly wetter 3 5 1 2 purpose specific metrics projections of the purpose specific metrics are assessed by the end of the century as the difference between the projections are larger here for the danish case all weighting methods project an increase between 119 and 122 compared to the reference period table 7 the impact of the choice of weights or hydrological model is larger for the number of days where streamflow is below or equal to the q90 f6 2 which decreases between 1 and 13 compared to the reference period the changes in the depth to groundwater f6 3 are similar for all weighting schemes overall the projections indicate a higher occurrence of wet extremes and an increase in river discharge along with a relatively small increase in groundwater levels in all cases the impact of weighting is insignificant which is no surprise considering the small differences in evaluation results being the basis for weighting for the french case the weighting schemes project very similar results apart from the change in winter average streamflow f6 1 for this metric relative changes range from 5 to 17 with the highest increases being obtained with the scheme w3 the average spring summer streamflow f6 2 is consistently projected to decrease by around 15 finally all weights project a change of 24 for the wscv day f6 3 which corresponds to a 32 day shift earlier in the year of the winter spring half flow day these results indicate a shift from spring snowmelt to winter flow the decline of spring streamflow being partially balanced by the increase in winter streamflow weighting choice of hydrological model is however relative unimportant for the projections of the purpose specific metrics in the spanish case table 7 the annual streamflow volume f6 1 is projected to decrease ranging from 18 to 21 for the different weighting methods compared to the reference period the annual mean number of days below or equal to the q90 f6 2 is projected to decrease by 35 to 43 finally the annual mean number of days above or equal to the q10 are projected to increase by 72 118 which is the largest difference between the weighting schemes for this variable summarizing the general pattern shows a decrease in streamflow volume a reduction in the number of days with low flows and a higher number of days with high values of the streamflow the choice of hydrological model weighting is significant in a few cases 3 6 projection uncertainty the computed standard deviations show how the use of the different weights impacts the uncertainty of the projection table 8 changes in standard deviation by the end of the century 2077 2099 are presented because it is the period with the largest simulation spread the impact of weights is generally relatively small with the largest response found in the spanish case for the danish site w2 and w4 give the same weights to all models therefore no differences are found on the uncertainty similarly w1 and w3 produced the same weighting scheme and therefore no differences are found among them for the projected change in the annual mean river discharge q there is no large difference between the variance of w1 and w4 compared to w4 the uncertainty of the projected occurrence of high flows increases f6 1 when the w1 weights are used in contrast when using the weights of w1 the variance of the projection decreases for the occurrence of low flows f6 2 and mean groundwater head f6 3 from the analyzed metrics the largest change in the variance is found for the projections of low flows standard deviation values show a limited sensitivity to the weighting of hydrological models for the french case study in general model democracy w4 is associated with the highest uncertainty except for the winter accumulated flow metric f6 1 discarding the topmo model and to a lesser extent the gr4j model marginally reduces the uncertainty the projected average annual flow is the metric where the impact of hydrological model weighting is largest with a decrease up to 5 from w4 to w3 in general the weighting schemes with the most significant differences between the weights w3 yields the highest reduction of the uncertainty for the spanish case the standard deviation for all analyzed variables follows a similar pattern higher values are always found for w4 followed by w2 with slightly lower values and then w1 and w3 respectively with significantly smaller variance values for the projected change in annual mean river streamflow q and f6 1 the standard deviation can vary significantly depending on the selection of the weighting scheme for instance from 0 61 to 0 81 for w2 and w3 respectively this proportion drastically increases for the number of days with low flows f6 2 in this case the w4 is more than twice the value of w3 with standard deviation of 17 65 days versus 39 33 days the ratio is lower for the number of days with high flows in this case the standard deviation ranges from 5 33 days to 6 56 days for w3 and w4 respectively therefore in the spanish case the uncertainty is clearly conditioned by the weighting scheme lower uncertainty relates to those weights with a clear preference for a specific model w1 and w3 4 discussion this study investigated the applicability of the dsst as a tool for quantifying the robustness of three hydrological models to describe the impact of climate change and to assess the impact of climate change as a function of the choice of hydrological model four weighting schemes were applied to three case studies in europe to assess the sensitivity of the metrics and the corresponding uncertainty of the projections 4 1 discussion of dsst results 4 1 1 do the hydrological models used in each case have the same transferability skills the dsst methodology highlighted different capabilities among hydrological models to describe changing climatic conditions especially in the mountainous snow dominated catchments france and spain where one of the hydrological models clearly had better transferability skills despite comparable calibration results in the spanish case the different snow modules used by the hydrological models might explain the different transferability capabilities the physically based conceptualizations of wimmed were able to capture the high variability in snow dynamics found in these catchments especially the role of evaposublimation herrero and polo 2016 that the degree day approaches were not able to reproduce additionally the higher spatiotemporal resolution used by wimmed and the other models 30 x 30 m and hourly compared to 100 km2 and daily respectively can also explain the differences in skill in the french case the better performance of the hbv0 model is most certainly explained by a better structural description of the catchment processes although snow processes dominate the hydrological regime in winter and spring and all three models have the same snow module the interactions between the snow module and the parameters of the rainfall runoff models could yield equifinality and affect model calibration for instance the parameter governing snowpack inertia in topmo was significantly different from the other models and might have caused an inappropriate scaling of the snow processes in warm conditions better representation of the catchment processes in the models might avoid undesirable compensations in calibration between hydrological model parameters and the snow module parameter and explain the better performance obtained with hbv0 in the danish case the dsst approach does not yield as straightforward results as for the other case studies the relatively small differences among the alternative versions of the mike she model might explain these smaller contrasts compared to the other cases overall the performance of the gravity flow model was found to be the best the most complex representation of the unsaturated zone richard s equation does not improve the simulation skill this might be a result of problems to estimate optimal parameters because of the highly non linear description of the soil water physics described by richard s equation retention curve unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve both presented by van genuchten 1980 additional explanations include the uncertainty related to the calibration of the required parameters or because the assessed metrics might not be sensitive to such parameters however the richard s equation was able to describe the groundwater purpose specific metric slightly better than the other models despite a relatively poor calibration result 4 1 2 which are the main benefits and drawbacks of the dsst approach for weighting hydrological models the main strength of the dsst approach is to provide a better evaluation of the sensitivity of the hydrological model to changes in forcing conditions here this advantage has been used to assess the robustness of models to cope with contrasting climate conditions and assign different weights to hydrological models relying on model performance in calibration may lead to inappropriate assessments because of parameter overfitting andréassian et al 2012 even in an sst approach there is a risk that a model s suitability for extrapolation may be overestimated because model robustness to expected climatic changes is not explicitly evaluated model rankings and weights would have been different if a traditional sst approach had been used especially in the danish and spanish cases see table s2 however the dsst approach used in this study also has limitations when focus is given to a single variable to discriminate between calibration control and evaluation periods the hydrological response might be sensitive to the choice of variable to circumvent this problem simultaneous changes in air temperature and precipitation could have been used dakhlaoui et al 2017 2019 another constraint is the limited amplitude and the differences in character of climatic changes encompassed in past historical data compared to future climate change stephens et al 2020 nevertheless possibilities to evaluate models beyond conditions measured in existing records are limited to techniques based on synthetic weather generators which may have difficulties to represent natural climate variability e g guo et al 2018 as noted by klemeš 1986 passing the dsst may not be a sufficient condition for a model to be valid yet it is a necessary condition that every model intended to be used in extrapolation should satisfy 4 1 3 does the selection of evaluation metrics have an impact on the weighted projections purpose specific metrics which were defined from an end user perspective and considering the adequacy for purpose view parker 2020 have proven to modify the ranking of hydrological models when compared with traditional metrics in two of the cases denmark and spain indeed while model rankings derived from general metrics were relatively similar across the considered metrics they appeared to vary from one purpose specific metric to another this result stresses the interest in using several performance criteria focusing each on different features of the hydrological regime to precisely inform model selection based on case requirements although it should be noted that addressing specific needs of stakeholders requires that performance criteria are defined with caution otherwise noise can be introduced in the analysis of projections weichselgartner and arheimer 2019 this fact highlights the need of a co development approach connecting user needs and models strengths photiadou et al 2021 overall the subjectivity in the selection of metrics used in this type of analyses is something that cannot be avoided and should be considered when interpreting the resulting projections christensen et al 2010 4 2 opportunities and challenges for hydrological model weighting 4 2 1 how does the weighting scheme affect the analysis interestingly when as many metrics as possible were included in the computation of the weights at least one model out of the three was discarded almost two in the spanish case this is the combined effect of the multiplicative rather than additive approach in the weight s computation as well as the choice to derive metric wise weights from model ranking the sensitivity of the adopted scheme could be reduced if weights were attributed according to performance rather than ranks however this alternative method is difficult to apply in practice indeed the variations of metric values with model skill are often non linear and thus difficult to aggregate into a single inclusive score an alternative to our method for model rankings would be to define thresholds to evaluate performance and set scores to the models e g 1 if below the threshold 2 if above however the choice of a threshold is subjective as well as context dependent since the characteristics of the observed streamflow timeseries might significantly influence model scores e g schaefli and gupta 2007 criss and winston 2008 knoben et al 2019 hence even if a usual performance threshold may apply in some catchments it may simply be unobtainable in other catchments for most of the current hydrological models hence we found that ranking models based on the ranking of their scores was more appropriate given the diversity of our case studies than defining performance thresholds similarly the multiplicative scoring of the weights used here is subjective the impact of using another type of aggregating scoring such as additive can be explored in future studies although for different experimental setups the selection of different scoring aggregation approaches has a small influence on the ensemble christensen et al 2010 further the number of metrics included in the weighting computations also influences the discrepancies between model weights in our approach since metrics are not completely independent from each other poor models may rank last for many metrics and tend to be more severely discarded by the weighting schemes with more metrics in the computation discarding the worst models can reduce ensemble uncertainty and avoid very poor models to reduce the effectiveness of the multi modelling approach najafi et al 2011 nonetheless it is recommended to include as many hydrological models as possible when implementing such methodology as pointed out by seiller et al 2012 an ensemble of models generally improves temporal and spatial transposability compared to individual models 4 2 2 approaches for the selection of hydrological and climatological models in hydrological impact analyses the selection of climate models represents an important source of uncertainty as it affects changes in precipitation which is the main driving variable of hydrological models refsgaard et al 2016 this is often the case for catchments where streamflow change is mainly driven by climate variables such as precipitation nevertheless there are instances where the hydrological model has a large impact on the uncertainty of the projection such as low flows because streamflow generation can be strongly driven by hydrological model states najafi et al 2011 thus careful selection of climate and hydrological models is important to improve the reliability of the projection her et al 2019 assigning weights to climate models in impact studies based on their performance has been suggested before for instance some studies focused on the reproduction of the present local climate e g wang et al 2019 or on the reproduction of large scale climate processes e g haughton et al 2015 knutti et al 2017 nevertheless these approaches are not entirely supported by the climate modeling community as traditionally every climate model is considered as having the same probability of occurrence and being only useful when combined with other climate models collins 2017 climate models are intended to reproduce large scale climate processes and it is not trivial to reduce this objective to streamflow metrics nevertheless it should be noted that selecting a specific ensemble of climate models without weighting is common and supported by selection methods e g pechlivanidis et al 2018 lutz et al 2016 in contrast hydrological models are commonly developed for specific catchments and undergo calibration efforts to better simulate the hydrologic processes within the catchment in addition hydrological model weighting based on simulation skill can be a mean to increase the reliability of the simulation outputs krysanova et al 2018 her et al 2019 this highlights the potential of assigning weights to hydrological models for local impact studies 4 2 3 is the uncertainty of the projections impacted by the weighting schemes our results show that weighting hydrological models affects the uncertainty of the projection for some metrics for most of the metrics in table 8 there is no reduction in uncertainty when using the weighted simulations in the danish and french cases considering that the involved purpose specific metrics in the french case are related to snow processes the choice of using the same snow module for all hydrological models leads to the apparent very low sensitivity of the uncertainty to the hydrological models in the danish case where the only difference is found on the conceptualization of the processes in the unsaturated zone the high degree of similarity in model structures could explain this result nevertheless the reduction of the uncertainty associated with the purpose specific metric focusing on low flows tables 8 f6 2 with non model democracy weighting schemes w1 and w3 shows that the contribution of hydrological model uncertainties to the total uncertainty cannot be neglected on the whole hydrological cycle in the spanish case the decrease in uncertainty is relatively larger this shows the importance of using a reliable hydrological model or weighting approach for such an area where uncertainty can be reduced to half of its initial value for most metrics our experiment demonstrates that considering the performance of the hydrological models is likely to provide more reliable simulations in impact studies however it is crucial to understand that reducing uncertainties is not a goal that justifies any means it is likely that in the presented case studies the total uncertainty is underestimated some modelling choices made in our case studies for the sake of simplicity probably lead to neglection of complexity of the represented hydrological processes therefore it should be noticed that the methodology presented in this article is focused on improving the reliability of hydrological projections and should be applied on an appropriately representative ensemble of hydrological models an appropriate weighting scheme that increases the reliability of the projection requires a careful analysis of the performance of the models the main contributor namely climate model or hydrological model to the uncertainty varies for each process to identify the main contributor it is important to understand the relevant hydrologic processes within the catchment and how these are simulated as the proposed approach focuses on hydrological model weighting it would have larger benefits for processes and variables which are more influenced by the simulation of hydrological models her et al 2019 najafi et al 2011 vidal et al 2016 5 conclusions this study aimed to assess a framework for assigning weights to hydrological models based on their robustness under changing climate conditions and evaluate the effect of weights on the uncertainty of the projected impact three case studies were selected in a north south gradient across europe capturing not only the hydrological differences between the cases but also the different water management issues to be assessed in a future climate context the main findings of this study can be summarized as the proposed methodology covers different aspects relevant to climate change impact assessments such as 1 integrating purpose specific metrics addressing relevant hydrological issues for water managers 2 assessing the robustness of the hydrological models in a climate change context and 3 model weighting based on the robustness of the hydrological models under changing climate conditions by integrating these aspects the adequacy for purpose and reliability of the projections increases model weighting can help to better understand the uncertainty of the projections and increase the reliability of their assessment particularly regarding water management metrics we recommend using this methodology with a large ensemble of climate and hydrological models to account for different conceptions and parameterizations of the climate and hydrological systems and by including different purpose specific metrics in the analysis for the purpose specific metrics our results indicate that the change in uncertainty was not much when hydrological models had similar simulation skill robust but it was impacted by the weighting scheme when the performance among the hydrological models differed significantly the use of purpose specific metrics highlights the importance of evaluating the quality of a model based on its purpose helping to prioritize hydrological models under certain hypotheses this fact gains importance for decision making where information

8001,study region this study is developed in three catchments located in denmark france and spain covering different climate and physical conditions in europe study focus the simulation skill of hydrological models under contrasting climate conditions is evaluated using a differential split sample test dsst in each catchment three different hydrological models are given a weight based on their simulation skill according to their robustness considering the dsst results for traditional and purpose specific metrics four weighting approaches are used each including a different set of evaluation metrics the weights are applied to obtain reliable future projections of annual mean river discharge and purpose specific metrics new hydrological insights projections are found to be sensitive to model weightings in cases where the models show significantly different skills in the dsst however when the skills of the models are similar there is no significant change when applying different weighting schemes nevertheless the methodology proposed here increases the reliability of the purpose for fit hydrological projections in a climate change context keywords uncertainty climate change impacts model weighting differential split sampling test bayesian model averaging 1 introduction water related impact assessments are often included in climate services across europe soares et al 2018 and their reliability significantly depends among other factors on validated scientific methods hewitt et al 2012 methods behind the assessment of climate change impacts on hydrology and or the projected impacts in different regions have been used extensively e g rojas et al 2011 brigode et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2013 van vliet et al 2015 wagner et al 2017 teutschbein et al 2018 fonseca and santos 2019 pastén zapata et al 2020 hundecha et al 2020 and have at the same time highlighted that the contribution of hydrological models to the total uncertainty in the projected hydrological variables can be substantial hagemann et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2014 therefore it is relevant to evaluate the simulation skill of the hydrological models used for impact assessments this will eventually improve the usability of the projections by providing access to quality assured information traditionally the simulation skill of hydrological models is assessed using a split sample test sst this test divides an observation period into two non overlapping sub segments of similar length using one period to calibrate the model and the remaining to evaluate it klemeš 1986 model parameters are usually calibrated by optimizing a performance metric the objective function a model and its parameters is deemed transferable in time if it performs well in the evaluation period nevertheless in a climate change context this approach might be inadequate because it assumes stationary conditions refsgaard et al 2014 typically a model with good simulation skill in one period does not necessarily perform as well in subsequent periods where climate is changing thirel et al 2015a hence in climate change impact assessments evaluating the skill of hydrological models to simulate hydrological processes under contrasting climate conditions should be a standard approach seiller et al 2012 when models satisfy such tests the confidence in the future projection increases and their contribution to the total uncertainty decreases krysanova et al 2018 an alternative to a standard sst is the differential split sample test dsst klemeš 1986 where historical non stationary periods of contrasting climatic regimes are used to calibrate and evaluate the hydrological model during the last decade assessments of the skill of hydrological models in contrasting climates based on the dsst have been performed in many contexts on many models most of these studies concluded that in general hydrological models may lack robustness in a changing climate context e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 thirel et al 2015b the consequences of off target hydrological projections for water planning is one of the key issues of modern hydrology blöschl et al 2019 unsolved problems in hydrology n 1 20 and 21 in general hydrologists stress the need to improve hydrological process descriptions toward better plausibility and extrapolation skills e g merz et al 2011 coron et al 2014 fowler et al 2020 a few authors have proposed different versions of the dsst such as the generalised split sample test coron et al 2012 or the general differential split sample test dakhlaoui et al 2019 but they are generally based on the same idea as dsst dsst is based on observed changes however climate projections indeed suggest that in some parts of the world future changes may be completely beyond the range recorded in historical data hence the approach might underestimate model potential failures in hydrological projections stephens et al 2020 while the dsst has repeatedly been applied to hydrological models e g li et al 2012 thirel et al 2015b broderick et al 2016 simulation skills are usually evaluated using criteria such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 or the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 however such criteria might be inconclusive especially when dealing with specific water management issues such as water supply flood impacts droughts or stresses on ecosystems it may be expected that a model performing well on reproducing the main hydrological characteristics of a catchment appears more reliable compared to a model performing well only on very specific hydrological signatures while showing poor general performance from an end user point of view however when the possibility to choose from a handful of models with different simulation capabilities is present the model selection might not always be straightforward hence the inclusion of metrics specifically designed to fit end user purposes in addition to usual performance metrics could benefit both the usability and the quality of future projections besides rather than selecting one well performing hydrological model it might be preferred to use an ensemble of models weighted based on their simulation skills the advantage of using ensembles is to compensate for flaws of individual models knutti 2010 such as deficient model structures non stationarity of the parameters and biased climate inputs broderick et al 2016 seiller et al 2012 ensemble simulations also allow for uncertainty assessment of the projections however acknowledging that not all models are equally skilled weighting models is useful to increase the reliability of ensemble projections from the perspective of climate models knutti 2010 points out that weighting procedures should be used as a tool to discard unskillful models rather than to select the best model christensen et al 2010 examined different ways of aggregating performance metrics into single weights for climate models although it was shown that the choice of the aggregation method has a rather small influence on the performance of the model ensemble it was suggested that the model weighting should be considered as an additional level of uncertainty nowadays assigning different weights to climate models of an ensemble according to their simulation skills is frequently used in practice e g haughton et al 2015 knutti et al 2017 wang et al 2019 compared to climate models weighting of hydrological models in climate change impact assessments has rarely been explored najafi et al 2011 assessed for example the hydrological model uncertainty with a set of four hydrological models of different complexities in a catchment in the usa and discussed the contribution of the bayesian model averaging method for model weighting likewise broderick et al 2016 found that model averaging techniques remained consistent under temporal transferability in several irish catchments and recommended objective based weighting methods despite the numerous insights in the role of hydrological models within the uncertainty cascade in climate change impacts e g velázquez et al 2013 dams et al 2015 karlsson et al 2016 lemaitre basset et al 2021 and the long standing tradition of model comparison in the hydrological community none has investigated how weighting of the hydrological models affects the projections and their uncertainty when evaluating the model performance in contrasting climate by applying a dsst and including metrics that are specifically tailored to specific end users methods to tailor the choice of climate and hydrological model ensemble would improve the usability user acceptance and potential uptake of the projections therefore the main objectives of this study are a to assess the robustness of hydrological models by evaluating their ability to describe the impact of climate change using a dsst b to estimate weights for hydrological models based on their robustness c to compare the effect of different weighting schemes on the projection of future climate change impacts d to assess the robustness of the models to project changes in purpose specific metrics that were not used during calibration and e to quantify the uncertainty of the projections considering the different weighting schemes the study is based on three european case studies using ensembles of climate and hydrological models to evaluate the future projections for each case study three hydrological models are evaluated with different sets of metrics in a dsst experiment to identify which are more skillful to reproduce changing climate conditions the sensitivity of future projections to the different sets of weights is then assessed with a specific focus on the uncertainty 2 methodology 2 1 case studies and available data three case studies across europe are analyzed these are located in denmark france and spain fig 1 each case focuses on providing information for decision making specific to that particular site there are significant differences between the catchments the danish catchment is mostly flat whereas the french and spanish sites are topographically complex with snow processes and snowmelt timing playing important roles in addition the recent 30 year trends for the annual mean precipitation and streamflow are positive for the danish catchment and negative for the other catchments fig 2 2 1 1 denmark climate change has a significant impact in the storå catchment in western denmark fig 1 focus is given to hydrological conditions of importance for agriculture where dry and wet conditions both have negative impacts thus the target of this case study is to assess the change in the future occurrence of high and low flows in the catchment additionally we look at how the mean groundwater level is projected to change in the future such aspects are important in the study catchment as wet conditions in denmark primarily occurring in winter fig 2 lead to waterlogged agricultural fields increasing the drainage needs on the other hand dry conditions commonly in summer increase the irrigation needs additionally in recent years there have been river floods in urban areas within the catchment 2 1 2 france the hydrological cycle of the durance catchment fig 1 in the southern french alps is expected to be strongly affected by climate change among the potential impacts reduced snowpack and shifted timing of snowmelt flows may impact the serre ponçon reservoir which fits many purposes for water management in the region maughan 2015 branche 2017 in this case study we focused on the average water discharge in the reservoir in winter and spring as well as on the timing of spring peak flows 2 1 3 spain future climate scenarios suggest a reduction in snow persistence over the guadalfeo river catchment fig 1 in sierra nevada mountain range southern spain this catchment constitutes an example of alpine conditions in a semiarid area i e high evaposublimation rates herrero and polo 2016 with occurrence of several snowmelt accumulation ablation cycles within the year pimentel et al 2017b and a high variability in river discharge linked to the snow dynamics pérez palazón et al 2018 fig 2 water resources from the snowpack are key in the area where different activities compete for allocating water therefore this case study tries to assess the impact of future climate scenarios on water availability in the area thus the projected streamflow volume and the future occurrence of extreme conditions wet and dry are analyzed 2 2 hydrological modelling three different hydrological models are set up for each site to account for the hydrological model uncertainty fig 3 a the selected hydrological models are frequently employed in each of the regions to assess the impacts of climate change therefore a specific hydrological model ensemble is used for each catchment a potential benefit of the different modelling setups spanning from conceptual rainfall runoff models to distributed hydrological models at the three case studies is that a broader range of model behaviors may be observed by setting up different frameworks for the experiment doubts to the applicability of the conclusions to other contexts are partly avoided the main drawback of this approach is however a more limited understanding of the results since the different components of the setups e g regional climate characteristics model hypotheses etc cannot be easily isolated for comparison between the sites the models used in each case are described next 2 2 1 denmark the mike she model is the base model of the danish national water resources model henriksen et al 2003 højberg et al 2013 stisen et al 2019a 2019b mike she is a physically based integrated and fully distributed groundwater surface water model abbott et al 1986 graham and butts 2005 here the model is set up at a 250 m x 250 m resolution input climate data come from datasets developed by the danish meteorological institute gridded at a 20 km x 20 km resolution for temperature and potential evapotranspiration and 10 km x 10 km for precipitation scharling 2012 daily streamflow data come from national environmental monitoring programme novana from the danish ministry of environment and food dce described by stisen et al 2019a 2019b and made available by koch and schneider 2022 three different conceptualizations models of the unsaturated zone are used a richards equation with the soil profiles discretized vertically it is based on the continuity equation and darcy s law graham and butts 2005 vertical flow is a function of gravity and capillary forces the actual evapotranspiration ae is estimated as a function of the vegetation status and soil moisture kristensen and jensen 1975 b gravity flow with a vertical discretization of the soil profiles it is a simple form of the richards equation where the vertical flow depends entirely on the gravity graham and butts 2005 ae is estimated as a function of the vegetation status and soil moisture kristensen and jensen 1975 c two layer model of the unsaturated zone the unsaturated zone is divided into a root zone and a zone below the root zone water infiltrating from the upper unsaturated zone layer flows directly to the saturated zone whenever the water content in the lower unsaturated zone layer equals field capacity graham and butts 2005 ae depends on the potential evapotranspiration pe vegetation status and soil moisture content yan and smith 1994 the three versions of the mike she model do not represent three totally different models however the unsaturated zone is a central component of the model that controls water balance and a number of flow components hence it is assumed that working with the three versions of unsaturated zone of mike she is sufficient to obtain results that are significantly different the models are calibrated using a multi criteria objective function demirel et al 2018 that includes river discharge nse and kge groundwater head rmse and estimated irrigation simulated in a demand driven manner rmse automatic calibration is done using pest doherty et al 1994 2 2 2 france three lumped daily rainfall runoff models gr4j hbv0 and topmo associated with a snow module cemaneige are used to simulate the hydrology of the french catchment these models have been widely used in the country data come from the hydro safran daily data set delaigue et al 2020 daily streamflow measurements at the outlet of the catchments were retrieved from banque hydro leleu et al 2014 daily meteorological data were supplied by the safran dataset an 8 km x 8 km atmospheric reanalysis vidal et al 2010 aggregated at catchment scale potential evaporation pe was computed using the temperature and radiation based formula proposed by oudin et al 2005 a short description of the models is provided here a gr4j perrin et al 2003 is a parsimonious four parameter lumped conceptual model ae depends on pe and soil moisture content b hbv0 bergström and forsman 1973 bergstrom 1995 is a nine parameter lumped model designed for snow covered catchments here its native snow module is replaced by the cemaneige snow module ae depends on pe and soil moisture content c topmo michel et al 2003 is a seven parameter lumped adaptation of topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 where the distribution of the topographical index is approximated by a calibrated two parameter probability distribution function instead of being derived from catchment topography ae depends on pe and soil moisture content cemaneige valéry et al 2014 is a two parameter degree day snow module it divides the catchment into five altitude layers of equal area where the snow cover on each layer is represented as a conceptual reservoir filled by solid precipitation the daily amount of melted water is used as input to the rainfall runoff models in addition to liquid precipitation the parameters of cemaneige were calibrated simultaneously with the parameters of the hydrological models gr4j and cemaneige are used within the airgr r package coron et al 2017 2018 hbv0 and topmo are used within the airgrplus r package in development coron and perrin 2018 the models are automatically calibrated by optimizing the kge computed on the square root of streamflow the optimization algorithm is based on a prior global screening of the parameter space followed by a local search from the identified best parameter set see edijatno et al 1999 mathevet 2005 2 2 3 spain previous experience in the spanish case study suggests the use of process oriented semi distributed or physically based models gridded daily meteorological data 30 m x 30 m generated from in situ weather stations using specific interpolation algorithms for each meteorological variable 2010 herrero et al 2007 were used in the historical runs this information is aggregated at the catchment scale for hype and swat and used as distributed maps for wimmed the daily streamflow data come from the water authority in the region the selected models have been previously used in the area a hype hydrological prediction for the environment lindström et al 2010 is a daily timestep semi distributed process based hydrological model using hydrological response units hrus as calculation units hype uses a snow melting routine that combines three decay factors linked to air temperature radiation and fractional snow cover samuelsson et al 2011 ae is estimated using the modified hargreaves samani pe formulation hargreaves and samani 1982 whereas infiltration into three soil layers is calculated using a water table discrimination model lindström et al 2010 b swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 is a daily timestep conceptual semi distributed hydrological model in which the spatial resolution is fixed by hrus snowmelt is calculated using a degree day method and ae is estimated using the penman monteith pe formulation penman 1948 monteith et al 1964 infiltration is calculated using green and ampt 1911 in a single soil layer c wimmed watershed integrated model for mediterranean environments polo et al 2010 is a hourly timestep distributed physically based model the snow module snowmed uses a punctual mass and energy balance extended to a distributed scale using depletion curves herrero et al 2009 pimentel et al 2017a ae is calculated using the penman monteith pe formulation penman 1948 monteith et al 1964 whereas infiltration is estimated using the green and ampt 1911 approach in a two layer soil discretization calibration is done through a process oriented stepwise approach based on expert knowledge minimizing mean absolute error in daily water volumes 2 3 differential split sample test dsst 2 3 1 principles of the dsst the dsst is a scheme used to evaluate the extent at which the hydrological models are capable of skillfully simulating hydrological processes in a climate change context three different historical periods are identified the calibration control and evaluation periods the calibration and control periods are comparable although they concern different years whereas the evaluation period is defined to obtain the largest contrast in simulation results hence the method aims at reproducing a change between calibration conditions and evaluation conditions the method allows flexibility in the selection of the periods e g length and continuity or discontinuity as shown in previous studies that applied it e g broderick et al 2016 li et al 2012 seiller et al 2012 brigode et al 2013 gelfan and millionshchikova 2018 in this study the dsst results are used to rank the models based on their performance and define a weight for each model within the ensemble 2 3 2 setup of the dsst in the case studies the aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of hydrological models on periods with contrasting climate conditions thus to enhance the contrast among the periods the lengths of the calibration control and evaluation periods are set to three possibly non consecutive years table 1 the climate variable used for classifying the periods is case dependent based on the needs of each case study the annual accumulated precipitation is used in the danish and spanish cases whereas the annual mean temperature is used for the french case all sites rank the annual values of the variable of interest from the maximum to the minimum using this approach the wettest and driest denmark and spain and the warmest and coldest france years are identified fig 3 b based on this rank a calibration period is defined used for adjustment of the parameters of the model along with a control period to assess the calibrated model skill under similar climate conditions but outside the calibration period and an evaluation period to assess transferability of the model to contrasting climate conditions thus for the danish and spanish sites the calibration period is set to comprise the 1st 3rd and 5th driest years the control period includes the 2nd 4th and 6th driest years and the evaluation period is composed by the 1st 3rd and 5th wettest years likewise for the french case calibration and control take place during the coldest years while the evaluation on contrasting conditions is carried out in the warmest three years fig 3 c next the entire observation period is simulated but the parameters of the models are calibrated only for the calibration period the objective functions used during calibration are those defined in section 2 2 2 3 3 evaluation metrics widely used evaluation metrics are applied to assess the simulation skill of the models in addition as the goal is to provide useful information for the end users purpose specific metrics are included in the assessment overall eight evaluation metrics are used to assess the skill of each hydrological model table 2 metric f6 involves three purpose specific metrics the aim of the proposed purpose specific metrics for the danish case table 3 is to evaluate the frequency of high f6 1 and low flows f6 2 and the importance of groundwater head for the shallow wells f6 3 in the french case the metrics focus on mean flows during the fall winter season f6 1 and during the spring summer season f6 2 and on the date at which half of the total water volume flowing during the six first months of the year is reached f6 3 finally for the spanish case total water volume f6 1 and the occurrence of drought conditions f6 2 and extreme wet conditions f6 3 are assessed 2 3 4 hydrological model ranking and assignment of weights evaluation of the climate model performance in the present climate at local scale is controversial knutti 2010 this is mainly because climate models are intended to simulate large scale climate processes instead of local climate thus climate models are not submitted to a sst calibration procedure to fine tune the models hence although different studies can be found where climate models are evaluated based on their performance and assigned weights accordingly in this study climate models are given the same probability of occurrence hydrological models however are ranked based on their simulation skill with respect to the metrics described in tables 2 and 3 fig 3d according to their relative skill for each of the metrics a score of 3 is assigned to the best performing hydrological model 2 to the model with the intermediate skill and 1 to the hydrological model with the lowest skill once the scores for each metric are defined they are combined multiplicatively in four different sets termed as final weights w1 to w4 these weights are normalized to sum 1 weight 1 w1 includes all metrics except the purpose specific metrics weight 2 w2 only includes the purpose specific metrics weight 3 w3 includes all the metrics finally weight 4 w4 represents the model democracy approach where all hydrological models have the same weight one third w4 is used as reference for comparison because it is the approach that is commonly used i e no weights are applied to the hydrological models the four weights are defined as 1 w 1 i r 1 i r 2 i r 3 i r 4 i r 5 i i w 1 i 2 w 2 i r 6 1 i r 6 2 i r 6 3 i i w 2 i 3 w 3 i r 1 i r 2 i r 3 i r 4 i r 5 i r 6 1 i r 6 2 i r 6 3 i i w 3 i 4 w 4 i 1 3 model democracy where w j i is the weight of model i 1 3 in the j th weighting scheme 1 4 after normalization and r f i is the rank of model i with the f th metric 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 6 2 or 6 3 in the following w j i will denote weights after normalization so that i w j i 1 weighted projections are obtained by combining the weights and the hydrological projections see fig 3 h 2 4 climate change impact assessment 2 4 1 climate models selection five gcm rcm combinations from the euro cordex initiative and specifically eur 11 12 km spatial resolution grid jacob et al 2014 are used see table 4 this is a subset of the eur 11 ensemble since here a climate model ensemble of opportunity ensemble based on model availability annan and hargreaves 2010 is used at each study site as driving climate for the hydrological models the combinations include two different rcms driven by three different gcms fig 3 e the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 is used to assess the projected changes rcp 8 5 represents the high emission scenario and it reproduces the current emission trend more accurately than other pathways hayhoe et al 2017 2 4 2 bias correction daily temperature and precipitation were bias corrected to match the observed climate data fig 3 f using methodologies previously tested in each region for the danish case the distribution based scaling method seaby et al 2013 is used for precipitation a double gamma distribution is used with the cutoff at the 90th percentile and a zero precipitation threshold to match the number of observed and simulated dry days similarly the distribution of the temperature simulations is fitted to a normal distribution pastén zapata et al 2019 for the french case biases were corrected with the cdf t statistical method michelangeli et al 2009 the method assumes that the cumulative distribution function cdf of a local climate variable can be derived from a translation t of the cdf of the associated gcm variable in the historical period and that this transformation is also valid in the projection period the cdf t technique has been applied for the french case study along with the singularity stochastic removal to better deal with dry days as done by vrac et al 2016 finally an empirical quantile mapping is used for bias adjustment in the spanish case i e boé et al 2007 sun et al 2011 climate model cdfs of daily precipitation and temperature for the whole reference period are matched with the observed cdfs for precipitation the cdfs are truncated to maintain the same number of dry days fixing a threshold of 1 mm hay and clark 2003 2 4 3 uncertainty of the hydrological projections hydrological projections are produced using simulations from the hydrological models that were calibrated and evaluated using the standard sst a common approach in hydrology which is described in supplementary material s1 bias corrected climate data from the five gcm rcm combinations are used as input to produce hydrological projections divided into different periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 the projected changes in the annual mean streamflow regime and purpose specific metrics are assessed considering the different weights fig 3 i a bayesian model averaging approach hoeting et al 1999 neuman 2003 is used to assess the uncertainty associated with the weighted outputs

projection defined as the square root of the variance bayesian model averaging has been used in previous studies to assess the uncertainty of hydrological projections e g najafi and moradkhani 2015 refsgaard et al 2012 najafi et al 2011 3 results focus in the first part of the analysis is given to the evaluation of the hydrological models using dsst and the metrics presented in section 2 3 3 fig 3d this approach provides an assessment of the overall simulation skill of each hydrological model relative to the other models included in the ensemble with emphasis on their ability to generate reliable results for periods with contrasting climate conditions 3 dry years vs 3 wet years the weights eqs 1 4 are subsequently combined with results from the projections of the three hydrological models to obtain a single future streamflow record in the beginning 2010 2039 middle 2040 2069 and end 2070 2099 of the century the results generated in these periods are compared to the results from the reference period 3 1 simulation skill of the monthly streamflow regime under contrasting conditions the simulation skill with respect to the monthly streamflow regime is important as decision making is usually done at the monthly scale for each case study for the danish case shifts in the streamflow regime affects the agricultural management e g water availability drought periods flood periods for the french and spanish cases changing snow conditions impact the monthly streamflow regime fig 4 shows the observed and simulated discharge from each case during the calibration control and evaluation periods in each period the monthly average for three years is presented in the danish case all three models simulate the monthly streamflow in the evaluation period accurately the two layer model underestimates the streamflow in late spring and summer months in contrast the winter flow is overestimated by the gravity flow and richards equation model the best performing model is the gravity flow model with the highest values for correlation coefficient 0 92 nash sutcliffe coefficient 0 76 and the kling gupta efficiency 0 76 see table s2 for the french case the three models tend to underestimate the spring peak flow resulting from snowmelt during the evaluation period in summer topmo and gr4j to a lesser extent display some problems to adequately represent low flows compared to hbv0 the overall better fit between hbv0 simulations and the observations reflects the higher skill of the model considering the f2 metric table 5 it should nonetheless be noted that the differences between the models are rather small around 5 m3 s compared to the average streamflow in the catchment 80 m3 s the models from the spanish case show large differences in the performance of the calibration control and evaluation periods biases are larger during the evaluation period where wimmed has the smallest relative biases followed by swat and finally sn hype wimmed and especially swat tend to overestimate the monthly streamflow whereas the sh hype model largely underestimates it despite this underestimation sn hype like wimmed is able to capture the timing of the flow which is not the case for swat 3 2 simulation skill for the general metrics under contrasting conditions results from the metrics indicate that no hydrological model gives the best results for all metrics table 5 nevertheless there are models that show a higher simulation skill than others or models whose simulation skill is low for most of the metrics table 5 for instance in the danish case the richards equation model has the lowest skill for half of the metrics and it is the best performing model only for one metric f6 3 the model with the best simulation skill varies between the two layer and gravity flow models indicating that the skill of these two models is similar for this set of metrics for the french case the results indicate that the hbv0 model is the best performing model for seven out of eight metrics it can also be observed that the topmo model has the worst performance for seven out of eight metrics the simulation skill of the gr4j model is intermediate in the spanish case wimmed shows the best results for seven out of the eight defined metrics sn hype has the worst results for all the metrics from the three models used in the spanish case the simulation skill of swat falls in between the other two it has the highest skill for one of the metrics but its performance is similar to the wimmed model 3 3 simulation skill for the purpose specific metrics here it is shown how the hydrological models simulate each of the purpose specific metrics in the evaluation period table 5 metric f6 s in the danish case the annual mean days with river flow equal or above the q10 f6 1 are generally simulated better during calibration table s2 for this metric biases are of similar magnitude during control and evaluation except for the two layer model that has a better skill during control all models seem to adapt well to the simulation of days with low flows f6 2 outside the calibration period as the biases during evaluation are reduced compared to the other periods the mean absolute error of the groundwater level in shallow wells f6 3 is larger during control than evaluation except for the richards equation model which has a similar skill in all periods however during calibration and control the error is significantly higher for richards equation compared to two layer with the gravity formulation in between during control the best performing model varies for each purpose specific metric all models are the best for one metric for the french case the hbv0 model generally outperforms the other models in all periods interestingly while large differences in the ability of the models to reproduce winter volumes during the calibration period are found very similar performances are observed during the evaluation period considering all periods and models the accumulated winter streamflow is overestimated whereas accumulated spring streamflow is systematically underestimated the error in the accumulated spring streamflow is lower for hbv0 during all periods whereas topmo has the highest error for all periods the biases in the winter spring center volume wscv day increase in the control and evaluation periods compared to calibration errors in timing of the three models are small all simulate peak flows approximately 3 days too early during the cold control period but display a short delay in the evaluation period for the spanish case the biases in the annual streamflow are relatively small for all models during the calibration and control but increase at least by a factor of four during the evaluation for all models because of the high variability between dry and wet conditions the model with the lowest bias varies in each of the periods while wimmed never shows the highest errors the bias in the annual mean number of days with river flow equal or below the q90 are lower for the sn hype model during the control and evaluation periods in this case swat largely overestimates the occurrence of low flows finally for the annual mean number of days with river flow equal to or above the q10 the biases are larger for the calibration and control compared to the evaluation period due to the small values of the observed streamflow during the calibration and control sn hype and wimmed always show the same signal in their biases whereas changes in swat go in the opposite direction 3 4 assigned weights based on the model simulation skill for the french and spanish cases the three weighting schemes based on the dsst results all except w4 give a clear preference to one model out of the three table 6 these models are hbv0 for the french case and wimmed for the spanish case whatever the weighting scheme these models have the highest weight and thus have the highest influence on the projection of impacts for the danish case w1 and w3 produce the same weights while w2 results in model democracy for the danish case considering w1 and w3 the weight of the two layer model is almost three times higher than the model with the second highest weight the difference in the french case is even larger considering the weighting schemes w1 w2 and w3 for w1 and w3 the topmo model has a weight lower than 0 1 in all cases the weights defined by w2 purpose specific metrics show less dispersion than the weights of w1 and w3 this is the result of the more even distribution of model rankings according to the simulation skill of purpose specific metrics and or of the lower number of metrics that are assessed therefore no model is completely discarded by this scheme 3 5 impact assessment in this section the impact on the hydrological projections obtained from climate models is quantified corresponding to fig 3 step g 3 5 1 projected changes changes in hydrological factors are based on climate model results below the impact on different quantities and metrics are described 3 5 1 1 annual mean streamflow the future streamflow is projected using the weights for each model table 6 at the beginning 2010 2039 middle 2040 2069 and end 2070 2099 of the century the results from these periods are compared to those from the reference period 1976 2005 for the danish and french cases and 1971 2000 for the spanish case fig 5 additionally the effect of the weighting method can be observed when compared to the standard model democracy approach w4 for the danish case fig 5 left panel all weighting schemes indicate a median slight increase approximately less than 5 in the annual mean streamflow during the near and mid future for the far future the projections indicate a median increase of approximately 15 in the annual mean streamflow however the difference between the weighting scheme and hence the choice of hydrological model is small in the french case fig 5 central panel annual mean streamflow is projected to increase in the near future while it is expected to decrease in the mid and far future in the far future period most of the models project a 10 decline compared to the historical period however projected values exhibit a rather large inter model uncertainty for most future periods the impact of the weighting method on the change in discharge is in some cases significant in the far future changes between 0 and 10 are found where w4 consistently yields smaller values than the other weighting schemes finally in the spanish case the annual mean streamflow is projected to decrease for all weighting methods and time horizons the median decrease ranges from about 10 in the near future to almost 20 in the mid future and between 20 and 30 in the far future by the end of the century all projections agree on the direction of the change signal for the danish case however for the french and spanish cases different change directions are projected for different models for the danish case weighting schemes w1 and w3 project a larger increase in streamflow than w2 and w4 however the change throughout the century follows a similar pattern for the french case all four weighting approaches project rather similar changes across the century although the discrepancy increases with time in the far future period the largest difference is found between w3 and w4 where the first simulates the largest future discharges whereas the second simulates the lowest future discharge for the spanish case a clear decreasing pattern in discharge is found for all weights however w2 always projects the driest scenario with a slightly higher value of change when compared to the other weights on the contrary w4 projects the lowest changes for all periods except for the mid future for the mid future w1 and w3 which always have similar patterns project a scenario that is slightly wetter 3 5 1 2 purpose specific metrics projections of the purpose specific metrics are assessed by the end of the century as the difference between the projections are larger here for the danish case all weighting methods project an increase between 119 and 122 compared to the reference period table 7 the impact of the choice of weights or hydrological model is larger for the number of days where streamflow is below or equal to the q90 f6 2 which decreases between 1 and 13 compared to the reference period the changes in the depth to groundwater f6 3 are similar for all weighting schemes overall the projections indicate a higher occurrence of wet extremes and an increase in river discharge along with a relatively small increase in groundwater levels in all cases the impact of weighting is insignificant which is no surprise considering the small differences in evaluation results being the basis for weighting for the french case the weighting schemes project very similar results apart from the change in winter average streamflow f6 1 for this metric relative changes range from 5 to 17 with the highest increases being obtained with the scheme w3 the average spring summer streamflow f6 2 is consistently projected to decrease by around 15 finally all weights project a change of 24 for the wscv day f6 3 which corresponds to a 32 day shift earlier in the year of the winter spring half flow day these results indicate a shift from spring snowmelt to winter flow the decline of spring streamflow being partially balanced by the increase in winter streamflow weighting choice of hydrological model is however relative unimportant for the projections of the purpose specific metrics in the spanish case table 7 the annual streamflow volume f6 1 is projected to decrease ranging from 18 to 21 for the different weighting methods compared to the reference period the annual mean number of days below or equal to the q90 f6 2 is projected to decrease by 35 to 43 finally the annual mean number of days above or equal to the q10 are projected to increase by 72 118 which is the largest difference between the weighting schemes for this variable summarizing the general pattern shows a decrease in streamflow volume a reduction in the number of days with low flows and a higher number of days with high values of the streamflow the choice of hydrological model weighting is significant in a few cases 3 6 projection uncertainty the computed standard deviations show how the use of the different weights impacts the uncertainty of the projection table 8 changes in standard deviation by the end of the century 2077 2099 are presented because it is the period with the largest simulation spread the impact of weights is generally relatively small with the largest response found in the spanish case for the danish site w2 and w4 give the same weights to all models therefore no differences are found on the uncertainty similarly w1 and w3 produced the same weighting scheme and therefore no differences are found among them for the projected change in the annual mean river discharge q there is no large difference between the variance of w1 and w4 compared to w4 the uncertainty of the projected occurrence of high flows increases f6 1 when the w1 weights are used in contrast when using the weights of w1 the variance of the projection decreases for the occurrence of low flows f6 2 and mean groundwater head f6 3 from the analyzed metrics the largest change in the variance is found for the projections of low flows standard deviation values show a limited sensitivity to the weighting of hydrological models for the french case study in general model democracy w4 is associated with the highest uncertainty except for the winter accumulated flow metric f6 1 discarding the topmo model and to a lesser extent the gr4j model marginally reduces the uncertainty the projected average annual flow is the metric where the impact of hydrological model weighting is largest with a decrease up to 5 from w4 to w3 in general the weighting schemes with the most significant differences between the weights w3 yields the highest reduction of the uncertainty for the spanish case the standard deviation for all analyzed variables follows a similar pattern higher values are always found for w4 followed by w2 with slightly lower values and then w1 and w3 respectively with significantly smaller variance values for the projected change in annual mean river streamflow q and f6 1 the standard deviation can vary significantly depending on the selection of the weighting scheme for instance from 0 61 to 0 81 for w2 and w3 respectively this proportion drastically increases for the number of days with low flows f6 2 in this case the w4 is more than twice the value of w3 with standard deviation of 17 65 days versus 39 33 days the ratio is lower for the number of days with high flows in this case the standard deviation ranges from 5 33 days to 6 56 days for w3 and w4 respectively therefore in the spanish case the uncertainty is clearly conditioned by the weighting scheme lower uncertainty relates to those weights with a clear preference for a specific model w1 and w3 4 discussion this study investigated the applicability of the dsst as a tool for quantifying the robustness of three hydrological models to describe the impact of climate change and to assess the impact of climate change as a function of the choice of hydrological model four weighting schemes were applied to three case studies in europe to assess the sensitivity of the metrics and the corresponding uncertainty of the projections 4 1 discussion of dsst results 4 1 1 do the hydrological models used in each case have the same transferability skills the dsst methodology highlighted different capabilities among hydrological models to describe changing climatic conditions especially in the mountainous snow dominated catchments france and spain where one of the hydrological models clearly had better transferability skills despite comparable calibration results in the spanish case the different snow modules used by the hydrological models might explain the different transferability capabilities the physically based conceptualizations of wimmed were able to capture the high variability in snow dynamics found in these catchments especially the role of evaposublimation herrero and polo 2016 that the degree day approaches were not able to reproduce additionally the higher spatiotemporal resolution used by wimmed and the other models 30 x 30 m and hourly compared to 100 km2 and daily respectively can also explain the differences in skill in the french case the better performance of the hbv0 model is most certainly explained by a better structural description of the catchment processes although snow processes dominate the hydrological regime in winter and spring and all three models have the same snow module the interactions between the snow module and the parameters of the rainfall runoff models could yield equifinality and affect model calibration for instance the parameter governing snowpack inertia in topmo was significantly different from the other models and might have caused an inappropriate scaling of the snow processes in warm conditions better representation of the catchment processes in the models might avoid undesirable compensations in calibration between hydrological model parameters and the snow module parameter and explain the better performance obtained with hbv0 in the danish case the dsst approach does not yield as straightforward results as for the other case studies the relatively small differences among the alternative versions of the mike she model might explain these smaller contrasts compared to the other cases overall the performance of the gravity flow model was found to be the best the most complex representation of the unsaturated zone richard s equation does not improve the simulation skill this might be a result of problems to estimate optimal parameters because of the highly non linear description of the soil water physics described by richard s equation retention curve unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve both presented by van genuchten 1980 additional explanations include the uncertainty related to the calibration of the required parameters or because the assessed metrics might not be sensitive to such parameters however the richard s equation was able to describe the groundwater purpose specific metric slightly better than the other models despite a relatively poor calibration result 4 1 2 which are the main benefits and drawbacks of the dsst approach for weighting hydrological models the main strength of the dsst approach is to provide a better evaluation of the sensitivity of the hydrological model to changes in forcing conditions here this advantage has been used to assess the robustness of models to cope with contrasting climate conditions and assign different weights to hydrological models relying on model performance in calibration may lead to inappropriate assessments because of parameter overfitting andréassian et al 2012 even in an sst approach there is a risk that a model s suitability for extrapolation may be overestimated because model robustness to expected climatic changes is not explicitly evaluated model rankings and weights would have been different if a traditional sst approach had been used especially in the danish and spanish cases see table s2 however the dsst approach used in this study also has limitations when focus is given to a single variable to discriminate between calibration control and evaluation periods the hydrological response might be sensitive to the choice of variable to circumvent this problem simultaneous changes in air temperature and precipitation could have been used dakhlaoui et al 2017 2019 another constraint is the limited amplitude and the differences in character of climatic changes encompassed in past historical data compared to future climate change stephens et al 2020 nevertheless possibilities to evaluate models beyond conditions measured in existing records are limited to techniques based on synthetic weather generators which may have difficulties to represent natural climate variability e g guo et al 2018 as noted by klemeš 1986 passing the dsst may not be a sufficient condition for a model to be valid yet it is a necessary condition that every model intended to be used in extrapolation should satisfy 4 1 3 does the selection of evaluation metrics have an impact on the weighted projections purpose specific metrics which were defined from an end user perspective and considering the adequacy for purpose view parker 2020 have proven to modify the ranking of hydrological models when compared with traditional metrics in two of the cases denmark and spain indeed while model rankings derived from general metrics were relatively similar across the considered metrics they appeared to vary from one purpose specific metric to another this result stresses the interest in using several performance criteria focusing each on different features of the hydrological regime to precisely inform model selection based on case requirements although it should be noted that addressing specific needs of stakeholders requires that performance criteria are defined with caution otherwise noise can be introduced in the analysis of projections weichselgartner and arheimer 2019 this fact highlights the need of a co development approach connecting user needs and models strengths photiadou et al 2021 overall the subjectivity in the selection of metrics used in this type of analyses is something that cannot be avoided and should be considered when interpreting the resulting projections christensen et al 2010 4 2 opportunities and challenges for hydrological model weighting 4 2 1 how does the weighting scheme affect the analysis interestingly when as many metrics as possible were included in the computation of the weights at least one model out of the three was discarded almost two in the spanish case this is the combined effect of the multiplicative rather than additive approach in the weight s computation as well as the choice to derive metric wise weights from model ranking the sensitivity of the adopted scheme could be reduced if weights were attributed according to performance rather than ranks however this alternative method is difficult to apply in practice indeed the variations of metric values with model skill are often non linear and thus difficult to aggregate into a single inclusive score an alternative to our method for model rankings would be to define thresholds to evaluate performance and set scores to the models e g 1 if below the threshold 2 if above however the choice of a threshold is subjective as well as context dependent since the characteristics of the observed streamflow timeseries might significantly influence model scores e g schaefli and gupta 2007 criss and winston 2008 knoben et al 2019 hence even if a usual performance threshold may apply in some catchments it may simply be unobtainable in other catchments for most of the current hydrological models hence we found that ranking models based on the ranking of their scores was more appropriate given the diversity of our case studies than defining performance thresholds similarly the multiplicative scoring of the weights used here is subjective the impact of using another type of aggregating scoring such as additive can be explored in future studies although for different experimental setups the selection of different scoring aggregation approaches has a small influence on the ensemble christensen et al 2010 further the number of metrics included in the weighting computations also influences the discrepancies between model weights in our approach since metrics are not completely independent from each other poor models may rank last for many metrics and tend to be more severely discarded by the weighting schemes with more metrics in the computation discarding the worst models can reduce ensemble uncertainty and avoid very poor models to reduce the effectiveness of the multi modelling approach najafi et al 2011 nonetheless it is recommended to include as many hydrological models as possible when implementing such methodology as pointed out by seiller et al 2012 an ensemble of models generally improves temporal and spatial transposability compared to individual models 4 2 2 approaches for the selection of hydrological and climatological models in hydrological impact analyses the selection of climate models represents an important source of uncertainty as it affects changes in precipitation which is the main driving variable of hydrological models refsgaard et al 2016 this is often the case for catchments where streamflow change is mainly driven by climate variables such as precipitation nevertheless there are instances where the hydrological model has a large impact on the uncertainty of the projection such as low flows because streamflow generation can be strongly driven by hydrological model states najafi et al 2011 thus careful selection of climate and hydrological models is important to improve the reliability of the projection her et al 2019 assigning weights to climate models in impact studies based on their performance has been suggested before for instance some studies focused on the reproduction of the present local climate e g wang et al 2019 or on the reproduction of large scale climate processes e g haughton et al 2015 knutti et al 2017 nevertheless these approaches are not entirely supported by the climate modeling community as traditionally every climate model is considered as having the same probability of occurrence and being only useful when combined with other climate models collins 2017 climate models are intended to reproduce large scale climate processes and it is not trivial to reduce this objective to streamflow metrics nevertheless it should be noted that selecting a specific ensemble of climate models without weighting is common and supported by selection methods e g pechlivanidis et al 2018 lutz et al 2016 in contrast hydrological models are commonly developed for specific catchments and undergo calibration efforts to better simulate the hydrologic processes within the catchment in addition hydrological model weighting based on simulation skill can be a mean to increase the reliability of the simulation outputs krysanova et al 2018 her et al 2019 this highlights the potential of assigning weights to hydrological models for local impact studies 4 2 3 is the uncertainty of the projections impacted by the weighting schemes our results show that weighting hydrological models affects the uncertainty of the projection for some metrics for most of the metrics in table 8 there is no reduction in uncertainty when using the weighted simulations in the danish and french cases considering that the involved purpose specific metrics in the french case are related to snow processes the choice of using the same snow module for all hydrological models leads to the apparent very low sensitivity of the uncertainty to the hydrological models in the danish case where the only difference is found on the conceptualization of the processes in the unsaturated zone the high degree of similarity in model structures could explain this result nevertheless the reduction of the uncertainty associated with the purpose specific metric focusing on low flows tables 8 f6 2 with non model democracy weighting schemes w1 and w3 shows that the contribution of hydrological model uncertainties to the total uncertainty cannot be neglected on the whole hydrological cycle in the spanish case the decrease in uncertainty is relatively larger this shows the importance of using a reliable hydrological model or weighting approach for such an area where uncertainty can be reduced to half of its initial value for most metrics our experiment demonstrates that considering the performance of the hydrological models is likely to provide more reliable simulations in impact studies however it is crucial to understand that reducing uncertainties is not a goal that justifies any means it is likely that in the presented case studies the total uncertainty is underestimated some modelling choices made in our case studies for the sake of simplicity probably lead to neglection of complexity of the represented hydrological processes therefore it should be noticed that the methodology presented in this article is focused on improving the reliability of hydrological projections and should be applied on an appropriately representative ensemble of hydrological models an appropriate weighting scheme that increases the reliability of the projection requires a careful analysis of the performance of the models the main contributor namely climate model or hydrological model to the uncertainty varies for each process to identify the main contributor it is important to understand the relevant hydrologic processes within the catchment and how these are simulated as the proposed approach focuses on hydrological model weighting it would have larger benefits for processes and variables which are more influenced by the simulation of hydrological models her et al 2019 najafi et al 2011 vidal et al 2016 5 conclusions this study aimed to assess a framework for assigning weights to hydrological models based on their robustness under changing climate conditions and evaluate the effect of weights on the uncertainty of the projected impact three case studies were selected in a north south gradient across europe capturing not only the hydrological differences between the cases but also the different water management issues to be assessed in a future climate context the main findings of this study can be summarized as the proposed methodology covers different aspects relevant to climate change impact assessments such as 1 integrating purpose specific metrics addressing relevant hydrological issues for water managers 2 assessing the robustness of the hydrological models in a climate change context and 3 model weighting based on the robustness of the hydrological models under changing climate conditions by integrating these aspects the adequacy for purpose and reliability of the projections increases model weighting can help to better understand the uncertainty of the projections and increase the reliability of their assessment particularly regarding water management metrics we recommend using this methodology with a large ensemble of climate and hydrological models to account for different conceptions and parameterizations of the climate and hydrological systems and by including different purpose specific metrics in the analysis for the purpose specific metrics our results indicate that the change in uncertainty was not much when hydrological models had similar simulation skill robust but it was impacted by the weighting scheme when the performance among the hydrological models differed significantly the use of purpose specific metrics highlights the importance of evaluating the quality of a model based on its purpose helping to prioritize hydrological models under certain hypotheses this fact gains importance for decision making where information

8002,study region the upper athi river basin lat 1 25 17 61 s and long 37 15 29 55 e in kenya east africa study focus the effects of land use land cover type on suspended sediment concentrations and yield were investigated in the upper athi river basin in kenya the suspended sediment concentrations and yield river discharges water levels and flow velocities were monitored in stations established at the outlets of sub basins and also at the outlet of the main basin in period 2012 2015 new hydrological insights the magnitude of river discharge in the upper athi river basin is not only a function of the magnitude of rainfall but combination of land uses land covers determined the magnitude of sediment yield in the sub basins the highest sediment yield occurred in a semi arid sub basin dominated by savannah grassland and livestock grazing the lowest occurred in the high rainfall sub basins dominated by forest with mixed farming and settlements significant sediment transport commenced at an effective river discharge of 405 m3s 1 which is a frequent discharge event resulting in significant sediment load transport in most rainy seasons and years the magnitude of suspended sediment discharge is a function of the magnitude of rainfall such that the greatest sediment transport occurs during the long rainy seasons 54 as compared to 41 during the short rainy season the total annual suspended sediment load in the basin ranged 2 11 3 77 106 tons yr 1 and sediment production rate ranged 205 366 tons km 2 year 1 graphical abstract ga1 keywords river discharge total

behind other parts of the world there is lack of information on the patterns of terrigenous sediment yield and discharge for most of the tropical river systems of africa lal 1985 vanmaercke et al 2014 several studies have been undertaken on factors influencing soil erosion in some african river basins e g roose and lelong 1976 lal 1981a 1981b lal 1983 lundgren 1980 christiansson 1981 moore et al 1979 ngatunga et al 1984 most of the studies on sediment transport and sedimentation dynamics in africa were undertaken in 1970s and 1980s see rapp 1975 ongwenyi 1978 oyebande 1981 christiansson 1981 stromquist 1981 in view of tremendous changes that have occurred in tropical river basins due to major population growth and expansion the old data cannot most accurately be used to determine the impacts of recent rapid population growth in terms of land use land cover changes in river basins without recent data on river discharges and sediment loads accurate determination of the contribution of african rivers to the global terrigenous sediment flux to the ocean is also greatly hampered meybeck and ragu 1997 walling and fang 2003 the study of sediment transport by rivers is critical in determining the land ocean flux of natural and anthropogenically derived sediment materials meybeck and ragu 1997 walling 2008 assessment of sediment loads in tropical rivers is even more urgent since most rivers are exhibiting significant changes that are attributed to land cover land use changes that are largely driven by anthropogenic activities catchment disturbances soil conservation and sediment control programmes have also resulted in significant changes in the sediment loads of many world s rivers dunne 1979 walling 2008 but the magnitude of change in terms of sediment yield and transport in basins exhibiting different combinations of land uses land covers and hydroclimatic conditions are not well established in tropical rivers the extent to which land use land cover change is altering the hydrology and patterns of sediment transport in tropical rivers under the scenario of climate change is yet to be fully determined this emphasizes the need for more recent studies to determine the contemporary rates of sediment fluxes in river basins experiencing significant effects of land use and land cover in this era of climate change see also ippc 2007 the changing rainfall patterns in river basin are altering patterns and magnitudes of river discharges which in turn affects the patterns of sediment yield and transport from tropical river basins these patterns need to be determined in order to guide formulation of appropriate land use and land cover management policies and strategies the athi river basin is the second largest river system in kenya originating from the central kenya highlands especially in the southern region of the aberdare ranges and ngong hills while at present there are no dams on the river a large multi purpose dam is being constructed at the upper middle reach of the river prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 it is expected that the dam once in operation will significantly change the patterns of discharge of both water and sediment this study therefore provides baseline data on river discharges and sediment loads that can be used to determine the impact of damming of the river as has been demonstrated in other studies conducted elsewhere cf williams and wolman 1984 snoussi et al 2007 several studies have been undertaken to determine the sediment transport processes in the sabaki estuary in malindi bay kitheka 2013 kitheka et al 2014 kitheka and mavuti 2015 2016 however there is no comprehensive study on the dynamics of suspended sediment transport and especially on the influence of highly variable rainfall and river discharge on suspended sediment concentrations and sediment loads in the sub basins of the upper athi basin exhibiting different land uses land covers and hydroclimatic conditions the fact that different sub basins behave differently in terms of sediment production and discharge provides sufficient justification to carry out this study in the upper athi river to ascertain the key patterns of sediment discharge in a typical tropical river basin experiencing highly variable flow characteristics factors influencing sediment production are not distributed uniformly in river basins leading to significant inter basin differences in terms of the relationship between river discharge and sediment discharge the objective of this study was therefore to determine the patterns of suspended sediment transport in a tropical river basin receiving river discharge and sediment contributions from sub basins with different combinations of land uses land covers and hydroclimatic conditions that are largely driven by rainfall 2 description of the study area athi river basin with the surface area of 69 930 km2 is the fourth largest in kenya the upper athi river basin lat 1 25 17 61 s and long 37 15 29 55 e which occurs in the upper region part of the larger athi river basin covers a surface area 10 276 km2 which is equivalent to 15 of the total athi basin area fig 1 the headwaters of the basin are located in the high rainfall central kenya highlands particularly in the kikuyu escarpment 1800 2250 m asl southern aberdares ranges 1800 3000 m asl and ngong hills 2200 2400 m asl memr 2012 rainfall in the basin is controlled by the altitude and the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz and orographic effects of high mountains and hills there are two rainy seasons in the basin namely the long and short rainy seasons occurring in the period march may and october december respectively cf ojany and ogendo 1986 the rest of the periods are usually dry january march and june october the total annual rainfall in the basin ranges from 481 to 1764 mm yr 1 temperature ranges between 6 c and 28 c mwangi et al 2017 the geology of the basin is characterized by presence of quaternary extrusive and intrusive rocks tertiary extrusive and intrusive rocks tertiary rocks and precambrian basement complex rocks the precambrian basement complex rocks occupy the greater part of the semi arid southern zone while the quaternary extrusives and intrusives volcanic rocks occupy the upper highland zone the middle upper zone consists of tertiary rocks and tertiary extrusives and intrusives such as the phonolites of kapiti plains and aruphibolites the tertiary extrusive intrusive rocks particularly phonolites also form a narrow yatta plateau running along the eastern margin of the basin see also nyamai et al 2003 prasol 2012 the geology of the basin is important in the sense that weathering of the rocks yields soils of varying degree of erodibility the precambrian rocks in particular yields sandy loamy soils that are highly erodible the soils in the basin are spatially non uniform in the upper zones the nitisols are more dominant on the slopes of the aberdare ranges and kikuyu plateau the sandy alluvium and red sandy soils with patches of vertisols and gravelly lateritic materials are found in the semi arid lower parts of the sub basin however in the southern zone the soils contain little organic matter and hence have low fertility and are highly erodible prasol 2012 the relatively high rainfall upper parts of the basin located in the highlands are densely populated with several large towns of which the city of nairobi and its metropolitan area with a population of nearly 4 4 million people dominates the scene in the central region of the basin the total population in the entire upper athi river basin is estimated to be 9 3 million people gok 2019 the main sub basins such as mbagathi 272 km2 stony athi 300 km2 nairobi 75 km2 ruiru 367 km2 ndarugu 230 km2 and thwake 5724 km2 exhibit different hydroclimatic conditions and land use land covers and the patterns of sediment yield that are subject of investigation in this study the main land cover types include savanna grasslands scrub bushlands woodlands and forests most of which are degraded due to extensive settlement cultivation deforestation and overgrazing previous studies have shown that agriculture and urban land uses have affected water quality in some of the sub basins particularly ruiru and ndarugu sub basins mwangi et al 2017 in the high rainfall zone land use is highly variable depending on the sub basin but in general includes small holder mixed farming large holder farming mainly tea and coffee livestock grazing nature conservation human settlements and quarrying mwangi et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 data collection and processing this study involved collection of data on rainfall including measurement of river discharges river flow velocities river water levels suspended sediment concentrations tssc and turbidity in stations established in the upper athi basin the specific methods that were used to measure these parameters are described in the following sections 3 1 1 river discharge measurement and rainfall data river discharges were measured at river gauging station rgs 3db1 located in the lower part of the basin fig 1 river discharges were also measured in stations established in mbagathi stony athi nairobi ruiru ndarugu and thwake sub basins at these stations river discharge was measured using the cross sectional area velocity method the sectional widths and depths of the river were measured and subsequently cross sectional areas were computed see also linsley et al 1988 the flow velocity for each of the sections v i was measured using a current meter the river discharges q i for each of the sections were computed by multiplying sectional depths d i and widths w i to obtain cross sectional areas a i which were subsequently multiplied with the mean flow velocity v i at the section as shown in eq 1 1 q i i 1 n w i d i v i v n n eq 1 can be summarized further into eq 2 since d i w i a i and v i v n n v i 2 q i i 1 n a i v i the total river discharge q d for the cross section was obtained by summing up the discharges measured at the sub sections q i at the river cross section as shown in eq 3 3 q d i 1 n q i regular monitoring of instantaneous river discharges was undertaken at the station rgs 3db1 once every month from january 2012 to june 2016 however in the period 2016 2022 only spot monthly sampling of river discharges tssc and turbidity were undertaken at the same station a total of 132 discharge measurements were carried out at the station in the period between 2012 and 2022 during the period of the study the whole ranges of river flow conditions were largely sampled see also tena et al 2011 monthly rainfall and temperature data for gatundu area for the period 1981 2019 was downloaded from nasapower database using power access viewer to plot the 38 year time series for rainfall and temperature in the basin fig 2 the high resolution total annual rainfall data averaged for the period 2011 2020 was obtained from climate research unit cru database this data was used to plot the spatial distribution of rainfall in the basin using arcmap fig 3 gatundu station was selected due to the good correlation between rainfall at the station and river discharge measured in the lower parts of the basin 3 1 2 suspended sediment sampling and monitoring the water sediment mixture samples were obtained at rgs 3db1 using a hand held integrated sediment sampler water samples were transferred to one 1 litre plastic bottles and transferred to the water resources authority wra water testing laboratory in nairobi for the determination of the total suspended sediment concentrations tssc at the wra laboratory tssc was determined using apha 2005 standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater tssc was obtained by filtering a known volume of water using 1 2 µm cellulose and glass fibre filters filters were dried and weighed using a sensitive electronic balance to obtain tsscs in gl 1 cf apha awwa wef 2012 turbidity was measured in situ in the sampling stations using a hand held turbidity meter 3 1 3 land use land cover data and analysis the land use land cover data for the upper athi basin was based on the analysis of landsat satellite images followed by groundtruthing the specific combination of land uses land covers in each of the sub basins was identified the suspended sediment loads measured at the outlets of the sub basins were attributed to the hydrological impact of combination of land uses land covers found in the area the data on the total annual rainfall in each of the sub basin was extracted from the map showing rainfall distribution in the upper athi basin the river discharges tssc and suspended sediment loads measured at the outlets of the sub basins were assumed to be in response to the specific combination of land uses land covers in each of the sub basin the rates of soil erosion were determined through computation of sediment production rate per unit sub basin area and expressed as tons km2 year 1 this approach also provided an indication on the possible rates of land denudation in each of the sub basins 3 2 analysis of data the monthly river discharges and monthly rainfall data and the corresponding data on total suspended sediment concentrations tssc were plotted to show the seasonal variations at rgs 3bd1 the time series plots for river discharges q d rainfall turbidity tssc and suspended sediment load data were done for the period 2012 2015 since these periods had continuous monthly data the time series plots were used to detect seasonal and inter annual variations in river discharge tssc and sediment loads during rainy season the streamflow was observed to exhibit flashy characteristics due to discharge of runoff from degraded arid and semi arid zones of the basin in this respect the flashines index fi was computed to quantity the degree of flashing according to batalla and vericat 2009 the flashiness index fi is a measure of rate of change of river discharge per unit time and is used as a proxy of the rate of energy expenditure in the river channel tena et al 2011 fi was computed using eq 4 4 fi q t where q is the increment of river discharge at time intervals h the results that were obtained were compared to the maximum fi value of 260 m3s 1hr 1 which is normally encountered during flushing flows tena et al 2011 the daily instantaneous suspended sediment load qs d was determined by multiplying the instantaneous total suspended sediment concentration c d and the corresponding instantaneous river discharges q d obtained at rgs 3db1 see also tena et al 2011 the instantaneous daily suspended sediment load qs d was therefore computed according to eq 5 5 qs d q d xc d the monthly suspended sediment loads qs m were computed by multiplying instantaneous daily suspended sediment loads qs d by the number of days in the specific month dt see also phillips et al 1999 simona et al 2015 this interpolation technique provided some reasonable estimates of monthly suspended sediment loads at the sampling station the interpolation procedure is based on the assumption that the instantaneous sample tssc c d is representative of the inter sample period dt philllips et al 1999 the annual suspended sediment load qs a was obtained by summing all the monthly suspended sediment loads qs m using eq 6 6 qs a dt i 1 n qs m the relationship was derived between values of tssc and river discharge at the time of sampling by using least squares regression and this relationship was of the form c d aq b where c d is the estimated instantaneous value of tssc q is the instantaneous discharge associated with tssc a and b are the constant and exponent of the equation respectively phillips et al 1999 the relationship was applied to the discharge record in order to generate a tssc time series which was then combined with the measured discharge series to compute the total suspended sediment load over the period of the study see also walling and webb 1981 1988 webb et al 1997 the suspended sediment rating curve for the station was plotted by relating monthly suspended sediment loads qs m to river discharges q f see also demissie et al 2004 the suspended sediment load duration curve together with river flow duration curves were also plotted to determine the frequency of occurrence of various magnitudes of suspended sediment load and river discharges the suspended sediment load rating curves were obtained by plotting monthly suspended sediment loads against river gauge height qs m h the river discharge rating curves were obtained by plotting river discharges against river water levels q d h see also simona et al 2015 these curves are presented in the results sections of the paper 4 results 4 1 rainfall river discharge and flow velocity characteristics the total annual rainfall in the upper athi basin ranges from 481 to 1764 mm yr 1 rainfall is highly variable exhibiting both seasonal and inter annual variations the examination of rainfall data for the period 1981 2019 showed significant inter annual variability with declining rainfall trend occurring at a period of increasing temperature trend emphasizing the fact that basin is already experiencing the impact of global climate change fig 3 recent studies in east africa have shown that while the increasing temperature trend is significant the decreasing rainfall trend is not significant for most places gebrechorkos et al 2019 rainfall variability in the region is directly influenced by the sea surface temperature sst variability in the indian ocean indian ocean dipole and in the pacific ocean el niño southern oscillation enso ndomeni et al 2018 the high rainfall experienced in the 1988 1989 1997 1998 and 2017 2018 occurred predominantly during the el nino enso events the 2012 2015 period experienced relatively lower rainfall as compared to 2016 2018 period when relatively higher rainfall was received rainfall in the basin is not spatially uniform as the zone located in the high altitude aberdare ranges receives more rainfall than the semi arid lower zone fig 3 the total annual rainfall in the high altitude zone above 1800 m above sea level asl drained by ruiru and ndarugu rivers ranges between 1272 mm and 1764 mm with a mean of 1 130mmyr 1 the southern and middle zones of the basin at an altitude of 1600 1700 m asl receives total annual rainfall ranging between 481 mm and 655 mm yr 1 with a mean of 568 mm per annum the mean annual rainfall amounts from the six sub basins found in the basin differs with the highest being for the sub basins draining the high altitude aberdare ranges and lowest being for the sub basins draining the semi arid zone e g stony athi river these spatial variations of rainfall have important implications on the volume of river discharges and suspended sediment load generated in the sub basins rainfall plays an important role in the generation of runoff and subsequently river discharge in the upper athi river basin the relationship between river discharge and rainfall in the basin is positive and moderately strong with the correlation coefficient r of 0 59 and coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 35 p 0 05 an increase or decrease in rainfall leads to an increase or decrease in river discharge fig 4 field observations showed that the time lag between rainfall in the upper parts of the basin and river discharge downstream at rgs 3bd1 is relatively short being of the order of 1 day indicating that the basin responds rapidly to rainfall in other words river discharge showed a significant increase at least 1 day after a rainfall storm in the upper parts of the basin the river discharges are highly variable with maximum discharges occurring during the two rainy seasons experienced in the basin during the long rainy season the peak river discharge was 791 m3s 1 while peak during the short rainy season was 200 m3s 1 the lowest discharge of 0 15 m3s 1 which represents baseflow conditions was measured during the short rainy season the mean discharge in the river using 2012 2015 data is 79 58 m3s 1 which is close to a mean discharge of 72 9 m3s 1 that was measured at the mouth of the river in the period 2001 2004 kitheka et al 2004 the flashing index fi showing the rate of increase or decrease of river discharge as a function of time yielded maximum fi value of 12 m3s 1hr 1 with mean fi of 0 63 m3s 1hr 1 indicating there is no flashing patterns in the river see also batala and vericat 2009 the patterns of river discharges are therefore in response to erratic spatially non uniform rainfall occurring in the basin the relationship between river discharge and river water level yielded a discharge rating curve shown in fig 5 showing significant relationship that exists between river discharge and river water level r2 0 79 r 0 89 p 0 05 as with river discharges the river flow velocities were found to be highly variable and were dependent on the river water level and the river discharge fig 6 the maximum flow velocities occurred during periods of high water levels and high river discharges the flow velocities ranged 0 15 2 0 ms 1 with the maximum flow velocities of the order 2 0 ms 1 occurring during the peak water level 4 7 m and peak river discharges of 791 m3s 1 the lowest flow velocities 0 20 ms 1occurred during periods of low water level of 0 1 m during low river discharge rate of the order of 0 15 m3s 1 the relationship between river discharge and flow velocities is positive and statistically significant with r² value of 0 53 and r value of 0 72 p 0 05 indicating that variations in river discharges accounts for 53 of the variations in river flow velocities fig 6 an increase in river discharge led to an increase in flow velocity but this increase was not necessarily non linear the low flows were characterized by wide variation in flow velocities ranging from 0 05 to 0 75 ms 1 on the other hand the high flows were characterized by relatively high flow velocities that were 1 0 ms 1and that reached 2 ms 1during peak flood flows although there is a tendency for the level of tssc to increase as the flow velocities increased at flow velocities ranging 0 05 0 75 ms 1 there was a tendency for the tssc to remain 0 05gl 1 during periods of low water levels showing no response to increasing flow velocities this shows that the sediment materials available in the river channel during this low water period are probably more colloidal and not related to the capacity of the river flow to erode bottom sediments but are due to the discharge of wastewater and sewage effluent into the river channel from the city of nairobi during this period the river water tended to be light gray black in color and was smelly showing signs of presence of wastewater sewage effluent the examination of flow duration curve of the upper athi river showed that the low river discharges were more frequent as compared to the high river discharges fig 7 50 of the river flow consisted of river discharges that were 50 m3s 1 the medium river discharges 400 m3s 1were equaled or exceeded in 10 of the time the extremely high river discharges 800 m3s 1such as those associated with el nino enso events of 1997 1998 karanja and mutua 2000 were equaled or exceeded in 1 of the time as will be demonstrated in the latter sections these infrequent events on long term basis are not responsible for transport of the majority of sediment load in the basin 4 2 relationship between rainfall river discharge and tssc there is a significant positive direct relationship between rainfall and tssc in the upper athi river basin r2 0 45 r 0 67 p 0 05 fig 8 the level of tssc increases significantly as rainfall in the basin increases and the vice versa is true this is largely due to the important role played by rainfall in the generation of surface runoff which is a principal mechanism through which soil eroded in the basin ends up in the river channel however rainfall accounted for 45 of the variations in tssc there is also a strong direct relationship between river discharge and tssc in the basin fig 9 periods of high river discharges were characterized by high tssc and those of low river discharges were characterized by low tssc the relationship between river discharge and tssc yielded a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 68 and correlation coefficient r value of 0 82 p 0 05 the variation of river discharges explained 68 of the variations in tssc an increase in river discharge therefore leads to a significant increase in tssc the relationship was also characterized by hysterises with three 3 clusters at the low inter mediate and high river discharges the hysterises are principally indication of different sediment sources and sediment gradation that are probably linked to rainfall and river discharge variations see also armijos et al 2020 these different sources are explained in the discussion section of the paper it is however important to note that tssc increased rapidly to 1 97gl 1as river discharge increased to 200 m3s 1 above the river discharge of 200 m3s 1 the increase in tssc was moderate which could be attributed to reduction in sediment supply via surface runoff tssc 0 50gl 1which are associated with relatively low river discharges were more common in the upper athi river as compared to relatively infrequent tssc 0 5gl 1 which are associated with moderate and high river discharges the maximum tssc values taking into account data for the period 2021 2022 and 2012 2015 ranged between 1 97 and 2 3 gl 1 the maximum tssc of2 3 gl 1 occurred during periods of high river discharges in the 2021 2022 period the maximum ssc during the 2012 2015 period was relatively lower reaching 1 97gl 1 the maximum tsscs measured in the upper athi river basin are relatively higher than those measured in north west upper tana basin in kenya which ranges between 0 8 and 1 43 gl 1 njogu et al 2018 the results of the study showed that variations in tssc are also related to the variations in river water level r 2 0 41 r 0 64 p 0 05 and river flow velocities r² 0 42 r 0 65 p 0 05 tssc increased significantly when flow velocities were above 0 75 ms 1 fig 7 below the flow velocities of 0 75 ms 1 the water was relatively clear with very low tssc of the order 0 05gl 1 fig 10 as with the river discharges the relationship between river flow velocities and tssc was characterized by hysteresis that are due to different sediment materials originating from different sources these results show the sediment materials remain in suspension at relatively low flow velocities of the order 0 05 ms 1 implying presence of colloidal and fine materials in the river channel during periods of low river discharges these materials are transported downstream leaving behind relatively coarse sediment particles such as sand the relatively low tssc values 0 1gl 1 for flow velocities ranging between 0 05 and 0 75 ms 1can also be attributed to lack of sufficient fine cohesive sediment materials for resuspension during the early part of the rising stage of the river the low flow during the dry periods progressively removes most of the fine cohesive materials so that at the beginning of the flood period even as flow velocities increases there are no sufficient fine sediment materials for resuspension as the velocities increases from 0 05 to 0 75 ms 1 the observation of the river channel during this low flow period showed that the river channel bed consisted mainly of sand and was largely devoid of fine cohesive clay sediments the fine clay sediments were observed on the river terraces but not in the main channel 4 3 relationship between tssc and turbidity there is strong and direct positive relationship between tssc and water turbidity in the upper athi river as the relationship yielded a r² value of 0 82 and r value of 0 91 p 0 05 the equation representing the relationship is a power regression equation of the form tssc 0 001q1 09 the fact that turbidity explained 82 of the variations in tssc indicates that the above equation can be used to predict the values of tssc when turbidity measurements are the only data that is available however it was noted that the equation tended to yield relatively lower tssc values as compared to those that were measured at the rgs 3bd1 see fig 9 fig 11 4 4 seasonal and inter annual variations of tssc the results of the study show that there are significant seasonal and inter annual variations in tssc in the upper athi river fig 12 the relatively highest tsscs occurred during the long rainy seasons in the period between march and may in normal rainfall years during this period the peak tssc ranged between 1 7 and 2 3gl 1 in periods when the peak river discharges and flow velocities ranged 350 500 m3s 1and 1 5 2 2 ms 1 respectively the exception was in 2014 period when the highest river discharge and tssc occurred during the short rainy season in the period between october and january during the short rainy season the peak tssc were however relatively lower being of the order 0 9gl 1 at maximum river discharges of the order 150 m3s 1 the year 2014 was a la nina year in which the seasonal rainfall during the long rainy season that normally occurs in the period between march and may were significantly lower than average leading to exceptionally low river discharges the maximum river discharge in the march may 2014 period was of the order 100 m3s 1which is relatively lower as compared to the maximum discharges of the order 350 500 m3s 1 that were experienced in the long rainy seasons of 2012 2013 and 2015 therefore the magnitude of rainfall and river discharges in the basin determines the magnitude of tssc in the river 4 5 relationship between river discharge and sediment load there is a significant direct positive relationship between river discharge and suspended sediment load in the upper athi river basin as the relationship yielded r² value is 0 95 and r value is 0 97 p 0 05 fig 13 the variations of river discharges accounted for 95 of the variations in suspended sediment load this relationship was best represented by a power function equation qs 1 523q1 704 which can be used to estimate the suspended sediment load in the basin when only measurements of river discharges are available the high correlation coefficient r is due to the cross correlation between river discharge and suspended sediment load since the latter is computed as a product of river discharge and tssc however despite this fact it is evident that the variations of river discharges plays a major role in determining the variations of suspended sediment load in any given rainfall period 4 6 seasonal variability of sediment load the suspended sediment load in the upper athi river showed significant seasonal variations that were related to the variations in river discharges and tssc table 1 shows the mean maximum and minimum suspended sediment loads and table 2 shows the annual sediment load for the period 2012 2015 the highest suspended sediment load occurred during the long rainy season in the period between march and june during the long rainy seasons of the years 2012 2013 and 2015 the suspended sediment loads ranged 0 29 2 6 106 tons month 1respectively the exception was during the long rainy season of the 2014 when suspended sediment load was relatively lower due to relatively low rainfall and subsequently low river discharges that were experienced during this period during the short rainy seasons in the period between october and december of 2012 2015 the suspended sediment loads were relatively lower being 0 40 106tons month 1 the sediment loads during the long rainy seasons were therefore much higher since these are periods associated with relatively high magnitude rainfall and river discharges the transport of suspended sediments during the rainy seasons contributes equivalent to 95 3 of the total annual suspended sediment load transported by the river in the upper athi basin the suspended sediment load during the long rainy seasons is equivalent to 54 of the total annual sediment load while the sediment load discharged during the short rainy season is equivalent to 41 of the total annual suspended sediment load the volume of suspended sediment load transported by the river during the dry season when the river discharges are very low is equivalent to only 4 7 of the total annual sediment load 4 7 sediment load transport deficit and surplus the main athi river channel experiences periods when supply of suspended sediment load is above or below the mean value computed for the period 2012 2015 the results of the study showed that in the period between 2012 and 2015 there were four periods of major surplus suspended sediment load transport in the upper athi river these occurred mainly during the long rainy season in the period between march and may of 2012 2014 during this period the surplus sediment load ranged 0 38 0 75 106 tons month 1 in the same period there were two 2 period of minor surplus suspended sediment loads during the short rainy season in the period between november and december of 2012 2015 in which the surplus sediment load was relatively lower being of the order 0 025 106 tons month 1 the only exception was in 2015 short rains when the surplus sediment load increased significantly to 0 40 106 tons month 1 as compared to other previous short rainy seasons when surplus 0 025 106 tons month 1 the main river channel experienced deficit sediment load transport that occurred during the dry season months of june october and january march fig 12 during these dry periods lack of rainfall coupled with low tsscs low water levels and river discharges led to the deficit sediment load transport of the order 0 10 106tons month 1 these results indicate that during the dry seasons there is very little net transport of suspended sediment load in the upper athi river basin majority of net sediment transport occurs during the rainy seasons and especially during the long rainy season 4 8 analysis of the effects of land use land cover on sediment fluxes the main sub basins found in the upper athi river basin exhibits different combinations of hydroclimatic conditions land uses and land covers tables 3 and 4 attempt was made to determine the extent to which spatial variations in rainfall and combinations of land use land covers influences the magnitude of river discharges and suspended sediment yield in the sub basins the suspended sediment loads computed for the sub basins were based on the surveys that were conducted in 2012 as a results of differences in hydroclimatic conditions and land use land cover the suspended sediment loads of sub basins are highly spatially non uniform ranging from 10 944 to 248 015 tons month 1 sediment production rate is also spatially non uniform ranging from 358 to 12 517 tons km2 yr 1 the highest suspended sediment loads were measured in the sub basin draining arid and semi zone mbagathi and stony athi that is characterized by relatively low mean annual rainfall 568 964 mm degraded savannah grasslands and intensive livestock grazing the lowest suspended sediment load were measured in the high altitude high rainfall 1210 mm sub basins ruiru characterized by dense forest cover mixed farming and settlements in terms of sediment production per unit area the stony athi and mbagathi sub basins draining semi arid zone with grasslands and livestock grazing yielded the highest soil erosion rates of 7 858 and 10 942 and tons km2 yr 1 respectively the relatively high suspended sediment load and high sediment production rate in the nairobi sub basin was attributed to anthropogenic activities such as disposal of solid waste and discharge of sewage effluent and wastewater in the river channel which are common in the informal settlements found within the city of nairobi the degraded lands within the nairobi metropolitan area are also major contributor to high sediment production in the nairobi sub basin the denudation rates in the upper athi basin ranged from 0 24 to 8 34 mm yr 1depending on the land use land cover and hydroclimatic conditions the high altitude rainfall highly forested sub basin ruiru experienced the lowest denudation rate of 0 24 mm yr 1 while the heavily urbanised sub basin nairobi experienced the highest denudation rate of 8 34 mm yr 1 the semi arid heavily grazed sub basins stony athi and mbagathi also experienced relatively high denudation rates of 5 24 and 7 29 mm yr 1 respectively the overall denudation rate for the entire upper athi river basin is 0 24 mm yr 1 which tends to under represent the denudation happening within the specific sub basins the total annual suspended sediment load of the sub basins draining into the main river in the upper athi river basin was estimated to be 3 76 106 tons year 1 this is higher than the total annual sediment load of the upper athi river at rgs 3bd1 which is 2 95 106 tons year 1 the differences were attributed to the trapping of a large portion of the sediment load within the river channel upstream the trapped sediment load is only remobilized during the subsequent rainy season when river discharge increases to about 400 m3s 1 5 discussion 5 1 rainfall river discharge interactions and variability of tssc river discharge plays an important role in the variability of tssc in the upper athi river basin an increase in river discharge leads to increase in tssc which is expected in view of the fact that the sediment transport capacity of the river increases as the magnitude of river discharge increases however this is contrary to recent finding reported in some south american tropical rivers where the relationship between tssc and discharge was found to be inverse such that as the river discharge increases tssc decreases this rather unique scenario was attributed to the depletion of sediment supply during high flood river discharge conditions orfeo 2006 a factor that does not seem to be applicable in the upper athi basin while sediment supply may not be a limiting factor in the upper athi basin different sources of sediments leads to hysteresis in the relationship between river discharge and tssc and also between river flow velocities and tssc these hysteresis are characterized by three main clusters at low inter mediate and high river discharge conditions which are indication of different sources of sediment materials supplied into the river at different discharge stages see also batalla and vericat 2009 the hysteresis at low water levels are due to the discharge of wastewater sewage effluent and those at high water level are due to the discharge of sediments derived from land via surface runoff the intermediate hysteresis is attributed to the remobilization of sediment deposited in previous floods in the river channel the degree of scattering of tssc when it is related to river discharges and flow velocities was relatively higher for low and intermediate water levels and the degree of scatter was much lower for high river discharges the latter would seem to also contract the findings of orfeo 2006 who noted that high discharges have a tendency of exhibiting greater scatter in the tssc for some tropical rivers in south america the greater degree of scattering of tssc for low river discharges in our case was attributed to the presence of sediment materials derived from different sources in the basin and also resuspension of the fine colloidal sediments as the river water level increases the resuspension of bottom sediment appeared to be important for river discharges of the order 200 m3s 1and flow velocities of the order 0 75 ms 1which once attained triggered a rapid increase in tssc to levels of the order 2gl 1 this pattern can to a certain extent be attributed to high availability of sediment materials for transport during periods of high river discharges the magnitude of rainfall in the upper athi river basin determines the volume of surface runoff that is generated on land and this subsequently determines the volume of river discharge the variability of river discharge in turn induces variability of tssc such that periods of high rainfall and high river discharges are characterized by high tssc and the vice versa is also true this explains the differences in the values of tssc measured in the period 2021 2022 which were relatively higher as compared to those of 2012 2015 the period 2012 2015 yielded relatively lower tssc values that could be attributed to the fact the river discharges that were experienced during this period were moderate with no extreme flood flows such as those which are usually experienced during typical el nino enso years munyao 2001 comparison of the magnitude of tssc levels measured in the upper athi river with those measured in other tropical river systems showed that the river is characterized by relatively higher tssc levels than those measured in the upper tana basin results reported for a tropical south america river bermejito yielded tssc values ranging between 0 05 and 0 70gl 1 orfeo 2006 which are relatively lower than those reported for the upper athi basin the differences between upper athi river tssc levels and those of other rivers are attributed to the differences in land use land cover and hydroclimatic conditions as discussed in other sections of this paper the relatively more drier and degraded sub basins of the upper athi basin seems to favors conditions for rapid generation of surface runoff and high rates of soil erosion rates explaining relatively high peak tssc levels of the order 1 97 2 3 gl 1 reported in the basin 5 2 seasonal and inter annual variations of tssc and sediment loads the significant seasonal and inter annual variations in tssc in the upper athi river basin can be explained by the seasonal variability of rainfall which consequently causes seasonal variation of river discharges periods associated with high rainfall leads to high surface runoff and high soil erosion rates leading to an increase in tssc in the river the dry seasons in which the river discharges are dominated by baseflows were characterized by relatively low tssc because of absence of sediment input via surface runoff the baseflows were characterized by low flow velocities with limited capability for resuspending and entraining sediments therefore the highest tsscs occurred during the long rainy seasons in the period between march and may in the period 2012 2013 and 2015 because this is the period that is characterized by high magnitude rainfall fig 9 tssc levels during the short rainy season tended to be relatively lower due to relatively low magnitude of rainfall and river discharges that are experienced during this period the maximum tssc of 2 0 gl 1during the 2012 long rainy season was relatively lower than maximum tssc of 4 0 gl 1 that was measured at the mouth of the river near malindi in the period 2002 2003 kitheka 2003 kitheka et al 2004 the maximum tssc in 2002 2003 period was therefore 50 higher than that which was measured in 2012 2013 period however much lower tssc values ranging 1 0 1 45 g l 1 have been reported for upper parts of the basin during relatively dry years with low river discharge of the order of 33 m3s 1 kithiia 2008 tssc variability also exhibits significant inter annual variations that are related to the inter annual variation of rainfall and river discharge fig 9 the years 2012 and 2015 received relatively higher rainfall as compared to 2013 and 2014 periods of higher rainfall such as those associated with el nino enso events usually exhibits relatively higher river discharges and higher tssc extremely high peak tssc value of 16 4 gl 1 has been reported for the period 1997 1999 during the el nino event munyao 2001 it is however important to note that the rather high peak tssc value experienced during el nino enso events has moderately high frequency of occurrence in view of increased frequency of extreme events in the basin the extreme events on long term basis leads to relatively smaller quantity of net sediment load transport as compared to the frequent moderate and smaller flows that on long term basis are responsible for transportation of largest quantity of suspended sediment load to the ocean thus the moderate and smaller flows are critical in shaping fluvial geomorphic processes of tropical rivers such as the athi river while some previous studies have indicated that the sediment load should decline progressively as the rainy season progresses due to seasonal improvement of vegetation cover and hence presumed reduction of soil erosion rates in a basin this may not be the case in the upper athi river since our results shows that throughout the rainy seasons tssc levels were usually high with no indication of a decline that can be attributed to change in soil erosion rates the subsequent decline in tssc can only be attributed to the decline in river discharges due to cessation of rainfall at the end of the season the high tssc occurring during period of declining river discharges could be attributed to the resuspension of the channel bed sediment because the flow velocities during this period are above the critical level for resuspension of sediments thus erosion and resuspension of channel bed sediments causes relatively high tssc in the river in periods when sediment input into the river via surface runoff has ceased the reduction of tssc and turbidity at the end of the rainy season can thus be attributed to the cessation of the input of surface runoff into the river and also reduction of flow velocities below critical level for sediment erosion it was noted that the flow velocities required to keep cohesive sediments in suspension are quite low 0 05 ms 1 in the upper athi basin explaining the significant water turbidity even during low flow conditions the effective discharge is the discharge in which majority of the sediment load is transported by a river the volume of suspended sediment load transported by the athi river is highly variable and significant volume of transport occurs at a river discharge rate of 405 m3s 1 this discharge rate is close to the effective discharge of 450 m3s 1 reported for the lower ebro river tena et al 2011 the effective discharge for the athi river is considered to be a frequent discharge since it is exceeded or equaled in 10 of the time this discharge rate is associated with more frequent discharges that are experienced in basically most of the seasons of the years implying that in most years the discharge in the upper athi river is capable of transporting suspended sediment load downstream in the ebro river the effective discharge was also found to be very frequent and was equaled or exceeded 20 of the time tena et al 2011 our results emphasizes the fact that the most common moderate river discharges transports most of the suspended sediment load in the upper athi river basin which is expected in view of their relatively high frequency of occurrence as compared to the extreme flood events which tends to be rare this is consistent with the observations made in previous studies undertaken elsewhere that have shown that the most frequent moderate magnitude river discharges tend to be responsible for the greatest amount of sediment movement over the long term biedenharn and thorne 1994 it must also be pointed out that for many rivers functional relationship between sediment discharge and river discharge is complicated because sediment discharge is controlled more by the supply of sediment materials from the catchment area than by the capacity of river to transport them in other words where the supply of sediment from the catchment area is limited there will be low sediment transport in the river even though the river discharge could be high and possess sufficient capacity to transport sediments in the upper athi river basin the results showed that there is a significant and positive relationship between river discharge and sediment load which is consistent with the results of other studies undertaken in other river basins see orfeo 2006 the fact that suspended sediment transport is significant throughout the rainy season indicates that there is no limited sediment supply in the upper athi river during periods of high river discharges since the increase in sediment load as river discharge increases seems to be exponential the major determinant of the quantity of sediment load reaching the upper athi river at any given time is therefore surface runoff generated on land during the rainy season which in turn is a function of rainfall amount and intensity and land use land cover in the basin resuspension of the channel bed sediment is only significant when supply of sediment into the river via surface runoff has ceased studies conducted in the upper athi river basin have reported different magnitudes of sediment loads for instance in the period 1980 1981 odo 2005 estimated sediment load in the upper athi catchment to be 1 05 106 tons year 1 this study found the sediment load in the upper athi river to be 2 95 106 tons year 1 these differences could be attributed to changes in land use land cover in the basin which have consequently changed the rates of soil loss the role of land use land cover in influencing the hydrology and sediment yield in the sub basins is dealt with in the later sections the suspended sediment load in the upper athi basin is much lower than suspended sediment load of 7 1 106 tons year 1 reported for the north west upper tana basin njogu 2018 comparison of the annual sediment load in the upper athi river with that measured at the mouth of the river at the coast showed that the upper athi river contributes 52 of the total annual sediment load however odo 2005 provided an estimate of 12 5 which was based on very limited spot sampling data that did not cover the entire range of suspended sediment loads experienced in the basin the fact that rainfall is the main determinant of one of the most important agent of sediment transport river discharge may lead one to conclude that the rates of soil erosion in the basin will reduce over time due to reduction in river discharges however this may not be the case in view of increased variability of rainfall in the region see ndomeni et al 2018 gebrechorkos 2019 that is subsequently leading to increased variability of river discharges with increased occurrence of extremely high river discharge events that have greater capability for transport of high sediment loads the extreme variability of rainfall would also lead to extreme variability of land cover in the basin making the already degraded land more vulnerable to erosion after extreme dry seasons preceding high rainfall events this coupled with increased land use activities due to human population pressure and increased livestock grazing is therefore expected to lead to a continued increased in suspended sediment load transport in the basin 5 3 sediment load transport deficit and surplus in the upper athi river suspended sediment load transport in the upper athi river is not uniformly distributed throughout the year the significant amounts of sediment loads are transported during periods when sediment supply to the basin is not limited in the period 2012 2015 there were four 4 periods of major surplus suspended sediment load transport in the upper athi river fig 12 these occurred mainly during the long rainy season in the period between march and may of 2012 2014 examination of the patterns of sediment load transport in the entire duration of the study showed that the periods of deficit sediment load transport are more dominant as compared to the periods of surplus sediment load transport in the period between 2012 and 2015 a total of 28 months exhibited deficit suspended sediment load transport as compared to 9 months that exhibited major surplus suspended sediment load transport and 2 months that experienced minor surplus sediment transport thus the river experienced surplus sediment load transport in only 28 of the time 11months out of 39 months the deficit sediment transport load was experienced in 72 of the time 28 months out 39 months these results shows that the upper athi river experiences deficit sediment load transport in most periods of the year and surplus sediment load transport is a relatively occasional event occurring in periods ofhigh river discharges 400 m3s 1 the dominant season in terms of surplus sediment load transport is the long rainy season that occurs in the period between the months of march and may this is the period that is also characterized by high river discharges with greater capacity for transporting sediments downstream the dominance of deficit sediment load transport is thus attributed to the high frequency of occurrence of low discharges as compared to the low frequency of occurrence of high discharges during the period of deficit sediment load transport the tssc values are usually very low since there is very little if any supply of sediments from the catchment areas upstream the very low sediment load 25 000 tons month 1 that is transported during this period emanates from within the river channel and may be associated with sediment resuspension and local disturbances of the channel bed sediments during the period of deficit sediment load there is a tendency for most of the sediment to be retained within the river channel field observations showed that the deposited sediment includes clay silt and sand these materials are usually available for transport as washload during the next period of flood flows when the sediment transport capacity of the river increases significantly 5 4 sub basins hydrology sediment yield and impacts of land uses land covers the sediment yield and river discharges in the sub basins draining the upper athi river basin are spatially non uniform emphasizing the important role played by land use activities in all the sub basins there was a combination of several land uses land covers making it difficult to attribute the measured magnitudes of river discharges and sediment load to the specific land use land cover in the sub basin despite these difficulties key patterns emerged the two sub basins draining the high altitude aberdare ranges and which experience relatively high rainfall 655 1764 mm per annum and dense forest cover tended to exhibit relatively low suspended sediment loads 10 944 and 67 989 tons month 1 but the river discharges were relatively low due to intense river water abstraction for agriculture in the two sub basins the relatively higher suspended sediment load in the ndarugu sub basin as compared to ruiru sub basin was attributed to the presence of quarrying activities that leads to land degradation the highly forested upper parts of these two basins coupled with tea plantations favours high infiltration of rainwater and subsequently low rates of hortonian overland flow and soil erosion the sub basins draining the semi arid zone characterized by relatively moderate rainfall 655 1272 mm per annum with degraded forests and grasslands that are used for livestock grazing cultivation and settlements exhibited very high sediment loads of 248 015 tons month 1 the semi arid sub basin receiving between 481 and 655 mm of rainfall and which is dominated mainly by grasslands and livestock grazing also exhibited relatively high sediment loads of 196 455 tons month 1 the semi arid river basin with forests grasslands livestock grazing and cultivation yielded 21 more sediments as compared to the semi arid sub basin with forests grasslands and livestock grazing and 42 more sediments as compared to the sub basins with forest and cultivation it also yielded 67 more sediments than the sub basin with forest and urban settlements the semi arid sub basins yielded 73 94 more sediments than the high rainfall sub basins dominated by forest and cultivation therefore incorporation of livestock grazing in a semi arid sub basin seems to favour high sediment production rate this is largely due to livestock overgrazing which tends to reduce water infiltration rates into the soil leading to high generation of overland flow that subsequently leads to high rates of soil erosion these results emphasize the need to control livestock population and implement soil erosion control measures in cultivated catchment areas the sediment production rates in the sub basins are relatively high ranging between 358 and 12 517 tons km2 year 1 however considering the suspended sediment load discharged at the outlet of the upper athi basin the sediment production rate was found to range between 205 and 366 tons km 2 year 1 with a mean value of 287 tons km 2 year 1 this is relatively higher than sediment production rate reported in some previous studies that have been undertaken in the upper athi river basin sediment production rates of 188 tons km 2 year 1have been reported by odo 2005 in the thwake sub basin sediment production of 1366 tons km2 year 1 based on the 1957 1979 data have been reported thomas and edwards 1979 which are much higher than the rate of 459 tons km2 year 1 reported in this study the differences could be due to improvement of land cover in the basin occasioned by successful soil erosion control measures in cultivated lands forest conservation and reforestation programme implemented in the basin since 1979 in the upper tana basin in kenya relatively higher sediment production rate of 715 tons km2 yr 1 has been reported njogu et al 2018 in other parts of tropical africa relatively higher sediment production rates ranging between 483 and 1804 tons km 2 year 1 have also been reported see oyebande 1981 balek 1977 vanmaercke et al 2014 the denudation rates ranging from 0 24 to 8 34 mm yr 1 established for the basin emphasizes the fact that soil erosion in the upper tana basin is not spatial uniform however it is important to note that basin denudation rates and sediment production rates in the upper athi river basin is relatively high when compared to rates reported for other catchments in africa the inter catchment differences in these rates have been explained in previous studies undertaken elsewhere to be due to the differences in land cover land use patterns vanmaercke et al 2014 it must however be emphasized that sediment production rate in the upper athi river basin are relatively much lower as compared to those reported in other tropical river basin in south america where for instance in the madeira river basin rates of 3000 tons km 2 year 1 have been reported vauchel et al 2017 the total annual sediment load of 3 76 106 tons year 1at the outlet of the main sub basins in the upper athi river basin is higher than the total annual sediment load of the upper athi river at rgs 3bd1 which is 2 95 106 tons year 1 this shows that 18 of the sediment load transported by the tributary rivers does not reach the lower course of main upper athi river most of this sediment load is trapped in the upper course of the river or is removed from the river channel due to various anthropogenic activities such as sand mining water diversion the results also show that sediment delivery ratio of the tributary sub basins is high which can be explained by the nature of most of the stream channels which tends to be relatively steep and rocky allowing generation of strong flow velocities the rate of sediment trapping of 18 for the upper athi river is relatively lower as compared to 33 for madeira river basin in south america vauchel et al 2017 comparison of the total annual sediment load in the upper athi river basin was made with that measured at the mouth of the river near malindi the results showed that the upper athi river contributes 52 of the total sediment load of the athi river the remaining 48 of the sediment load is probably contributed by other rivers draining in the middle and lower parts of the basin the relatively high contribution of the upper athi river basin was attributed to the fact that this part of the basin receives relatively higher annual total rainfall and has relatively better land use land cover as compared to the more semi arid southern part of the basin where rainfall is less than 600 mm in terms of the magnitude of sediment supply to the main upper athi river the largest contributors are mbagathi stony athi nairobi and ndarugu rivers tables 3 and 4 sediment transport by the athi river has important implications of the thwake multipurpose dam which is being constructed downstream at the confluence of athi river and thwake river at a cost of usd 576 million the results showed that using the mean total annual suspended sediment load of 2 95 106 tons year 1measured in the upper athi river in the period 2012 2015 it would take 381 years for thwake dam reservoir to be filled completely with sediments because the sediment trap efficiency of the dam is expected to be moderate the lifespan of the dam could be slightly higher than what we have calculated here it is however important to note that trapping of sediments in the thwake dam reservoir will significantly reduce the volume of sediment load supplied downstream to the coast this would in future trigger massive erosion of the river channel downstream of the dam leading to deepening there will also enhanced erosion of the shoreline and or beaches at malindi bay to compensate for the reduction in sediment supply to the coast see kitheka 2003 kitheka 2013 with the potential to affect socio economic activities including tourism at malindi the impact of dams on sediment loads of rivers has been a subject of a number of studies undertaken elsewhere these studies have clearly demonstrated that significant downstream impacts occurs following damming of rivers see kitheka 2003 snoussi et al 2007 simona et al 2015 berkun et al 2015 therefore thwake dam will be no exception 6 conclusions the study has demonstrated that in a typical tropical river basin such as the upper athi river basin the dynamics of suspended sediment are complicated by the interaction between rainfall and river discharge and influences of land use land cover the variability of river discharges water levels and river flow velocities influences the patterns of variability of tssc and suspended sediment load the relationships between these hydrologic parameters and tssc are characterized by hysteresis due to sediment originating from different sources in the basin depending on the stage of river discharge the study also notes that the magnitude of rainfall is an important determinant of the magnitude of river discharges which in turn determines the magnitude of sediment load this is however also dependent on the land use land cover type in the sub basins the non uniformity of rainfall and land use land cover in the sub basins induces spatial differences in sediment production rates and suspended sediment loads in the sub basins the semi arid sub basins that are characterized by relatively low mean annual rainfall and livestock overgrazing tends to yield relatively higher sediment load on the other hand the sub basins draining the high rainfall zone with forest and mixed farming tend to yield relatively low sediment loads the significant seasonal and inter annual variability of rainfall causes significant seasonal and inter annual variations in river discharges tssc and suspended sediment loads in the basin the sediment load in the upper athi river basin is relatively lower than suspended sediment load measured at the outlet of the river due to significant trapping of sediments upstream in sub basins and also within the main channel the sediment production rate in the upper athi river basin is relatively high and spatially non uniform depending on land use land cover type and rainfall amount the total annual sediment load of the main streams draining into the upper athi river basin was estimated to be 3 76 106 tons yr 1 which is higher than the total annual sediment load of 2 95 106 tons yr 1 of the upper athi river in view of increased anthropogenic impacts on land use land cover the suspended sediment load in the basin will continue to increase due to increased variability of extreme rainfall events the trapping of sediments in thwake dam has potential to cause significant downstream impacts including channel erosion and beach erosion at the coast

yield were investigated in the upper athi river basin in kenya the suspended sediment concentrations and yield river discharges water levels and flow velocities were monitored in stations established at the outlets of sub basins and also at the outlet of the main basin in period 2012 2015 new hydrological insights the magnitude of river discharge in the upper athi river basin is not only a function of the magnitude of rainfall but combination of land uses land covers determined the magnitude of sediment yield in the sub basins the highest sediment yield occurred in a semi arid sub basin dominated by savannah grassland and livestock grazing the lowest occurred in the high rainfall sub basins dominated by forest with mixed farming and settlements significant sediment transport commenced at an effective river discharge of 405 m3s 1 which is a frequent discharge event resulting in significant sediment load transport in most rainy seasons and years the magnitude of suspended sediment discharge is a function of the magnitude of rainfall such that the greatest sediment transport occurs during the long rainy seasons 54 as compared to 41 during the short rainy season the

impacts of recent rapid population growth in terms of land use land cover changes in river basins without recent data on river discharges and sediment loads accurate determination of the contribution of african rivers to the global terrigenous sediment flux to the ocean is also greatly hampered meybeck and ragu 1997 walling and fang 2003 the study of sediment transport by rivers is critical in determining the land ocean flux of natural and anthropogenically derived sediment materials meybeck and ragu 1997 walling 2008 assessment of sediment loads in tropical rivers is even more urgent since most rivers are exhibiting significant changes that are attributed to land cover land use changes that are largely driven by anthropogenic activities catchment disturbances soil conservation and sediment control programmes have also resulted in significant changes in the sediment loads of many world s rivers dunne 1979 walling 2008 but the magnitude of change in terms of sediment yield and transport in basins exhibiting different combinations of land uses land covers and hydroclimatic conditions are not well established in tropical rivers the extent to which land use land cover change is altering the hydrology and patterns of sediment transport in tropical rivers under the scenario of climate change is yet to be fully determined this emphasizes the need for more recent studies to determine the contemporary rates of sediment fluxes in river basins experiencing significant effects of land use and land cover in this era of climate change see also ippc 2007 the changing rainfall patterns in river basin are altering patterns and magnitudes of river discharges which in turn affects the patterns of sediment yield and transport from tropical river basins these patterns need to be determined in order to guide formulation of appropriate land use and land cover management policies and strategies the athi river basin is the second largest river system in kenya originating from the central kenya highlands especially in the southern region of the aberdare ranges and ngong hills while at present there are no dams on the river a large multi purpose dam is being constructed at the upper middle reach of the river prasol training and consulting ltd 2012 it is expected that the dam once in operation will significantly change the patterns of discharge of both water and sediment this study therefore provides baseline data on river discharges and sediment loads that can be used to determine the impact of damming of the river as has been demonstrated in other studies conducted elsewhere cf williams and wolman 1984 snoussi et al 2007 several studies have been undertaken to determine the sediment transport processes in the sabaki estuary in malindi bay kitheka 2013 kitheka et al 2014 kitheka and mavuti 2015 2016 however there is no comprehensive study on the dynamics of suspended sediment transport and especially on the influence of highly variable rainfall and river discharge on suspended sediment concentrations and sediment loads in the sub basins of the upper athi basin exhibiting different land uses land covers and hydroclimatic conditions the fact that different sub basins behave differently in terms of sediment production and discharge provides sufficient justification to carry out this study in the upper athi river to ascertain the key patterns of sediment discharge in a typical tropical river basin experiencing highly variable flow characteristics factors influencing sediment production are not distributed uniformly in river basins leading to significant inter basin differences in terms of the relationship between river discharge and sediment discharge the objective of this study was therefore to determine the patterns of suspended sediment transport in a tropical river basin receiving river discharge and sediment contributions from sub basins with different combinations of land uses land covers and hydroclimatic conditions that are largely driven by rainfall 2 description of the study area athi river basin with the surface area of 69 930 km2 is the fourth largest in kenya the upper athi river basin lat 1 25 17 61 s and long 37 15 29 55 e which occurs in the upper region part of the larger athi river basin covers a surface area 10 276 km2 which is equivalent to 15 of the total athi basin area fig 1 the headwaters of the basin are located in the high rainfall central kenya highlands particularly in the kikuyu escarpment 1800 2250 m asl southern aberdares ranges 1800 3000 m asl and ngong hills 2200 2400 m asl memr 2012 rainfall in the basin is controlled by the altitude and the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz and orographic effects of high mountains and hills there are two rainy seasons in the basin namely the long and short rainy seasons occurring in the period march may and october december respectively cf ojany and ogendo 1986 the rest of the periods are usually dry january march and june october the total annual rainfall in the basin ranges from 481 to 1764 mm yr 1 temperature ranges between 6 c and 28 c mwangi et al 2017 the geology of the basin is characterized by presence of quaternary extrusive and intrusive rocks tertiary extrusive and intrusive rocks tertiary rocks and precambrian basement complex rocks the precambrian basement complex rocks occupy the greater part of the semi arid southern zone while the quaternary extrusives and intrusives volcanic rocks occupy the upper highland zone the middle upper zone consists of tertiary rocks and tertiary extrusives and intrusives such as the phonolites of kapiti plains and aruphibolites the tertiary extrusive intrusive rocks particularly phonolites also form a narrow yatta plateau running along the eastern margin of the basin see also nyamai et al 2003 prasol 2012 the geology of the basin is important in the sense that weathering of the rocks yields soils of varying degree of erodibility the precambrian rocks in particular yields sandy loamy soils that are highly erodible the soils in the basin are spatially non uniform in the upper zones the nitisols are more dominant on the slopes of the aberdare ranges and kikuyu plateau the sandy alluvium and red sandy soils with patches of vertisols and gravelly lateritic materials are found in the semi arid lower parts of the sub basin however in the southern zone the soils contain little organic matter and hence have low fertility and are highly erodible prasol 2012 the relatively high rainfall upper parts of the basin located in the highlands are densely populated with several large towns of which the city of nairobi and its metropolitan area with a population of nearly 4 4 million people dominates the scene in the central region of the basin the total population in the entire upper athi river basin is estimated to be 9 3 million people gok 2019 the main sub basins such as mbagathi 272 km2 stony athi 300 km2 nairobi 75 km2 ruiru 367 km2 ndarugu 230 km2 and thwake 5724 km2 exhibit different hydroclimatic conditions and land use land covers and the patterns of sediment yield that are subject of investigation in this study the main land cover types include savanna grasslands scrub bushlands woodlands and forests most of which are degraded due to extensive settlement cultivation deforestation and overgrazing previous studies have shown that agriculture and urban land uses have affected water quality in some of the sub basins particularly ruiru and ndarugu sub basins mwangi et al 2017 in the high rainfall zone land use is highly variable depending on the sub basin but in general includes small holder mixed farming large holder farming mainly tea and coffee livestock grazing nature conservation human settlements and quarrying mwangi et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 data collection and processing this study involved collection of data on rainfall including measurement of river discharges river flow velocities river water levels suspended sediment concentrations tssc and turbidity in stations established in the upper athi basin the specific methods that were used to measure these parameters are described in the following sections 3 1 1 river discharge measurement and rainfall data river discharges were measured at river gauging station rgs 3db1 located in the lower part of the basin fig 1 river discharges were also measured in stations established in mbagathi stony athi nairobi ruiru ndarugu and thwake sub basins at these stations river discharge was measured using the cross sectional area velocity method the sectional widths and depths of the river were measured and subsequently cross sectional areas were computed see also linsley et al 1988 the flow velocity for each of the sections v i was measured using a current meter the river discharges q i for each of the sections were computed by multiplying sectional depths d i and widths w i to obtain cross sectional areas a i which were subsequently multiplied with the mean flow velocity v i at the section as shown in eq 1 1 q i i 1 n w i d i v i v n n eq 1 can be summarized further into eq 2 since d i w i a i and v i v n n v i 2 q i i 1 n a i v i the total river discharge q d for the cross section was obtained by summing up the discharges measured at the sub sections q i at the river cross section as shown in eq 3 3 q d i 1 n q i regular monitoring of instantaneous river discharges was undertaken at the station rgs 3db1 once every month from january 2012 to june 2016 however in the period 2016 2022 only spot monthly sampling of river discharges tssc and turbidity were undertaken at the same station a total of 132 discharge measurements were carried out at the station in the period between 2012 and 2022 during the period of the study the whole ranges of river flow conditions were largely sampled see also tena et al 2011 monthly rainfall and temperature data for gatundu area for the period 1981 2019 was downloaded from nasapower database using power access viewer to plot the 38 year time series for rainfall and temperature in the basin fig 2 the high resolution total annual rainfall data averaged for the period 2011 2020 was obtained from climate research unit cru database this data was used to plot the spatial distribution of rainfall in the basin using arcmap fig 3 gatundu station was selected due to the good correlation between rainfall at the station and river discharge measured in the lower parts of the basin 3 1 2 suspended sediment sampling and monitoring the water sediment mixture samples were obtained at rgs 3db1 using a hand held integrated sediment sampler water samples were transferred to one 1 litre plastic bottles and transferred to the water resources authority wra water testing laboratory in nairobi for the determination of the total suspended sediment concentrations tssc at the wra laboratory tssc was determined using apha 2005 standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater tssc was obtained by filtering a known volume of water using 1 2 µm cellulose and glass fibre filters filters were dried and weighed using a sensitive electronic balance to obtain tsscs in gl 1 cf apha awwa wef 2012 turbidity was measured in situ in the sampling stations using a hand held turbidity meter 3 1 3 land use land cover data and analysis the land use land cover data for the upper athi basin was based on the analysis of landsat satellite images followed by groundtruthing the specific combination of land uses land covers in each of the sub basins was identified the suspended sediment loads measured at the outlets of the sub basins were attributed to the hydrological impact of combination of land uses land covers found in the area the data on the total annual rainfall in each of the sub basin was extracted from the map showing rainfall distribution in the upper athi basin the river discharges tssc and suspended sediment loads measured at the outlets of the sub basins were assumed to be in response to the specific combination of land uses land covers in each of the sub basin the rates of soil erosion were determined through computation of sediment production rate per unit sub basin area and expressed as tons km2 year 1 this approach also provided an indication on the possible rates of land denudation in each of the sub basins 3 2 analysis of data the monthly river discharges and monthly rainfall data and the corresponding data on total suspended sediment concentrations tssc were plotted to show the seasonal variations at rgs 3bd1 the time series plots for river discharges q d rainfall turbidity tssc and suspended sediment load data were done for the period 2012 2015 since these periods had continuous monthly data the time series plots were used to detect seasonal and inter annual variations in river discharge tssc and sediment loads during rainy season the streamflow was observed to exhibit flashy characteristics due to discharge of runoff from degraded arid and semi arid zones of the basin in this respect the flashines index fi was computed to quantity the degree of flashing according to batalla and vericat 2009 the flashiness index fi is a measure of rate of change of river discharge per unit time and is used as a proxy of the rate of energy expenditure in the river channel tena et al 2011 fi was computed using eq 4 4 fi q t where q is the increment of river discharge at time intervals h the results that were obtained were compared to the maximum fi value of 260 m3s 1hr 1 which is normally encountered during flushing flows tena et al 2011 the daily instantaneous suspended sediment load qs d was determined by multiplying the instantaneous total suspended sediment concentration c d and the corresponding instantaneous river discharges q d obtained at rgs 3db1 see also tena et al 2011 the instantaneous daily suspended sediment load qs d was therefore computed according to eq 5 5 qs d q d xc d the monthly suspended sediment loads qs m were computed by multiplying instantaneous daily suspended sediment loads qs d by the number of days in the specific month dt see also phillips et al 1999 simona et al 2015 this interpolation technique provided some reasonable estimates of monthly suspended sediment loads at the sampling station the interpolation procedure is based on the assumption that the instantaneous sample tssc c d is representative of the inter sample period dt philllips et al 1999 the annual suspended sediment load qs a was obtained by summing all the monthly suspended sediment loads qs m using eq 6 6 qs a dt i 1 n qs m the relationship was derived between values of tssc and river discharge at the time of sampling by using least squares regression and this relationship was of the form c d aq b where c d is the estimated instantaneous value of tssc q is the instantaneous discharge associated with tssc a and b are the constant and exponent of the equation respectively phillips et al 1999 the relationship was applied to the discharge record in order to generate a tssc time series which was then combined with the measured discharge series to compute the total suspended sediment load over the period of the study see also walling and webb 1981 1988 webb et al 1997 the suspended sediment rating curve for the station was plotted by relating monthly suspended sediment loads qs m to river discharges q f see also demissie et al 2004 the suspended sediment load duration curve together with river flow duration curves were also plotted to determine the frequency of occurrence of various magnitudes of suspended sediment load and river discharges the suspended sediment load rating curves were obtained by plotting monthly suspended sediment loads against river gauge height qs m h the river discharge rating curves were obtained by plotting river discharges against river water levels q d h see also simona et al 2015 these curves are presented in the results sections of the paper 4 results 4 1 rainfall river discharge and flow velocity characteristics the total annual rainfall in the upper athi basin ranges from 481 to 1764 mm yr 1 rainfall is highly variable exhibiting both seasonal and inter annual variations the examination of rainfall data for the period 1981 2019 showed significant inter annual variability with declining rainfall trend occurring at a period of increasing temperature trend emphasizing the fact that basin is already experiencing the impact of global climate change fig 3 recent studies in east africa have shown that while the increasing temperature trend is significant the decreasing rainfall trend is not significant for most places gebrechorkos et al 2019 rainfall variability in the region is directly influenced by the sea surface temperature sst variability in the indian ocean indian ocean dipole and in the pacific ocean el niño southern oscillation enso ndomeni et al 2018 the high rainfall experienced in the 1988 1989 1997 1998 and 2017 2018 occurred predominantly during the el nino enso events the 2012 2015 period experienced relatively lower rainfall as compared to 2016 2018 period when relatively higher rainfall was received rainfall in the basin is not spatially uniform as the zone located in the high altitude aberdare ranges receives more rainfall than the semi arid lower zone fig 3 the total annual rainfall in the high altitude zone above 1800 m above sea level asl drained by ruiru and ndarugu rivers ranges between 1272 mm and 1764 mm with a mean of 1 130mmyr 1 the southern and middle zones of the basin at an altitude of 1600 1700 m asl receives total annual rainfall ranging between 481 mm and 655 mm yr 1 with a mean of 568 mm per annum the mean annual rainfall amounts from the six sub basins found in the basin differs with the highest being for the sub basins draining the high altitude aberdare ranges and lowest being for the sub basins draining the semi arid zone e g stony athi river these spatial variations of rainfall have important implications on the volume of river discharges and suspended sediment load generated in the sub basins rainfall plays an important role in the generation of runoff and subsequently river discharge in the upper athi river basin the relationship between river discharge and rainfall in the basin is positive and moderately strong with the correlation coefficient r of 0 59 and coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 35 p 0 05 an increase or decrease in rainfall leads to an increase or decrease in river discharge fig 4 field observations showed that the time lag between rainfall in the upper parts of the basin and river discharge downstream at rgs 3bd1 is relatively short being of the order of 1 day indicating that the basin responds rapidly to rainfall in other words river discharge showed a significant increase at least 1 day after a rainfall storm in the upper parts of the basin the river discharges are highly variable with maximum discharges occurring during the two rainy seasons experienced in the basin during the long rainy season the peak river discharge was 791 m3s 1 while peak during the short rainy season was 200 m3s 1 the lowest discharge of 0 15 m3s 1 which represents baseflow conditions was measured during the short rainy season the mean discharge in the river using 2012 2015 data is 79 58 m3s 1 which is close to a mean discharge of 72 9 m3s 1 that was measured at the mouth of the river in the period 2001 2004 kitheka et al 2004 the flashing index fi showing the rate of increase or decrease of river discharge as a function of time yielded maximum fi value of 12 m3s 1hr 1 with mean fi of 0 63 m3s 1hr 1 indicating there is no flashing patterns in the river see also batala and vericat 2009 the patterns of river discharges are therefore in response to erratic spatially non uniform rainfall occurring in the basin the relationship between river discharge and river water level yielded a discharge rating curve shown in fig 5 showing significant relationship that exists between river discharge and river water level r2 0 79 r 0 89 p 0 05 as with river discharges the river flow velocities were found to be highly variable and were dependent on the river water level and the river discharge fig 6 the maximum flow velocities occurred during periods of high water levels and high river discharges the flow velocities ranged 0 15 2 0 ms 1 with the maximum flow velocities of the order 2 0 ms 1 occurring during the peak water level 4 7 m and peak river discharges of 791 m3s 1 the lowest flow velocities 0 20 ms 1occurred during periods of low water level of 0 1 m during low river discharge rate of the order of 0 15 m3s 1 the relationship between river discharge and flow velocities is positive and statistically significant with r² value of 0 53 and r value of 0 72 p 0 05 indicating that variations in river discharges accounts for 53 of the variations in river flow velocities fig 6 an increase in river discharge led to an increase in flow velocity but this increase was not necessarily non linear the low flows were characterized by wide variation in flow velocities ranging from 0 05 to 0 75 ms 1 on the other hand the high flows were characterized by relatively high flow velocities that were 1 0 ms 1and that reached 2 ms 1during peak flood flows although there is a tendency for the level of tssc to increase as the flow velocities increased at flow velocities ranging 0 05 0 75 ms 1 there was a tendency for the tssc to remain 0 05gl 1 during periods of low water levels showing no response to increasing flow velocities this shows that the sediment materials available in the river channel during this low water period are probably more colloidal and not related to the capacity of the river flow to erode bottom sediments but are due to the discharge of wastewater and sewage effluent into the river channel from the city of nairobi during this period the river water tended to be light gray black in color and was smelly showing signs of presence of wastewater sewage effluent the examination of flow duration curve of the upper athi river showed that the low river discharges were more frequent as compared to the high river discharges fig 7 50 of the river flow consisted of river discharges that were 50 m3s 1 the medium river discharges 400 m3s 1were equaled or exceeded in 10 of the time the extremely high river discharges 800 m3s 1such as those associated with el nino enso events of 1997 1998 karanja and mutua 2000 were equaled or exceeded in 1 of the time as will be demonstrated in the latter sections these infrequent events on long term basis are not responsible for transport of the majority of sediment load in the basin 4 2 relationship between rainfall river discharge and tssc there is a significant positive direct relationship between rainfall and tssc in the upper athi river basin r2 0 45 r 0 67 p 0 05 fig 8 the level of tssc increases significantly as rainfall in the basin increases and the vice versa is true this is largely due to the important role played by rainfall in the generation of surface runoff which is a principal mechanism through which soil eroded in the basin ends up in the river channel however rainfall accounted for 45 of the variations in tssc there is also a strong direct relationship between river discharge and tssc in the basin fig 9 periods of high river discharges were characterized by high tssc and those of low river discharges were characterized by low tssc the relationship between river discharge and tssc yielded a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 68 and correlation coefficient r value of 0 82 p 0 05 the variation of river discharges explained 68 of the variations in tssc an increase in river discharge therefore leads to a significant increase in tssc the relationship was also characterized by hysterises with three 3 clusters at the low inter mediate and high river discharges the hysterises are principally indication of different sediment sources and sediment gradation that are probably linked to rainfall and river discharge variations see also armijos et al 2020 these different sources are explained in the discussion section of the paper it is however important to note that tssc increased rapidly to 1 97gl 1as river discharge increased to 200 m3s 1 above the river discharge of 200 m3s 1 the increase in tssc was moderate which could be attributed to reduction in sediment supply via surface runoff tssc 0 50gl 1which are associated with relatively low river discharges were more common in the upper athi river as compared to relatively infrequent tssc 0 5gl 1 which are associated with moderate and high river discharges the maximum tssc values taking into account data for the period 2021 2022 and 2012 2015 ranged between 1 97 and 2 3 gl 1 the maximum tssc of2 3 gl 1 occurred during periods of high river discharges in the 2021 2022 period the maximum ssc during the 2012 2015 period was relatively lower reaching 1 97gl 1 the maximum tsscs measured in the upper athi river basin are relatively higher than those measured in north west upper tana basin in kenya which ranges between 0 8 and 1 43 gl 1 njogu et al 2018 the results of the study showed that variations in tssc are also related to the variations in river water level r 2 0 41 r 0 64 p 0 05 and river flow velocities r² 0 42 r 0 65 p 0 05 tssc increased significantly when flow velocities were above 0 75 ms 1 fig 7 below the flow velocities of 0 75 ms 1 the water was relatively clear with very low tssc of the order 0 05gl 1 fig 10 as with the river discharges the relationship between river flow velocities and tssc was characterized by hysteresis that are due to different sediment materials originating from different sources these results show the sediment materials remain in suspension at relatively low flow velocities of the order 0 05 ms 1 implying presence of colloidal and fine materials in the river channel during periods of low river discharges these materials are transported downstream leaving behind relatively coarse sediment particles such as sand the relatively low tssc values 0 1gl 1 for flow velocities ranging between 0 05 and 0 75 ms 1can also be attributed to lack of sufficient fine cohesive sediment materials for resuspension during the early part of the rising stage of the river the low flow during the dry periods progressively removes most of the fine cohesive materials so that at the beginning of the flood period even as flow velocities increases there are no sufficient fine sediment materials for resuspension as the velocities increases from 0 05 to 0 75 ms 1 the observation of the river channel during this low flow period showed that the river channel bed consisted mainly of sand and was largely devoid of fine cohesive clay sediments the fine clay sediments were observed on the river terraces but not in the main channel 4 3 relationship between tssc and turbidity there is strong and direct positive relationship between tssc and water turbidity in the upper athi river as the relationship yielded a r² value of 0 82 and r value of 0 91 p 0 05 the equation representing the relationship is a power regression equation of the form tssc 0 001q1 09 the fact that turbidity explained 82 of the variations in tssc indicates that the above equation can be used to predict the values of tssc when turbidity measurements are the only data that is available however it was noted that the equation tended to yield relatively lower tssc values as compared to those that were measured at the rgs 3bd1 see fig 9 fig 11 4 4 seasonal and inter annual variations of tssc the results of the study show that there are significant seasonal and inter annual variations in tssc in the upper athi river fig 12 the relatively highest tsscs occurred during the long rainy seasons in the period between march and may in normal rainfall years during this period the peak tssc ranged between 1 7 and 2 3gl 1 in periods when the peak river discharges and flow velocities ranged 350 500 m3s 1and 1 5 2 2 ms 1 respectively the exception was in 2014 period when the highest river discharge and tssc occurred during the short rainy season in the period between october and january during the short rainy season the peak tssc were however relatively lower being of the order 0 9gl 1 at maximum river discharges of the order 150 m3s 1 the year 2014 was a la nina year in which the seasonal rainfall during the long rainy season that normally occurs in the period between march and may were significantly lower than average leading to exceptionally low river discharges the maximum river discharge in the march may 2014 period was of the order 100 m3s 1which is relatively lower as compared to the maximum discharges of the order 350 500 m3s 1 that were experienced in the long rainy seasons of 2012 2013 and 2015 therefore the magnitude of rainfall and river discharges in the basin determines the magnitude of tssc in the river 4 5 relationship between river discharge and sediment load there is a significant direct positive relationship between river discharge and suspended sediment load in the upper athi river basin as the relationship yielded r² value is 0 95 and r value is 0 97 p 0 05 fig 13 the variations of river discharges accounted for 95 of the variations in suspended sediment load this relationship was best represented by a power function equation qs 1 523q1 704 which can be used to estimate the suspended sediment load in the basin when only measurements of river discharges are available the high correlation coefficient r is due to the cross correlation between river discharge and suspended sediment load since the latter is computed as a product of river discharge and tssc however despite this fact it is evident that the variations of river discharges plays a major role in determining the variations of suspended sediment load in any given rainfall period 4 6 seasonal variability of sediment load the suspended sediment load in the upper athi river showed significant seasonal variations that were related to the variations in river discharges and tssc table 1 shows the mean maximum and minimum suspended sediment loads and table 2 shows the annual sediment load for the period 2012 2015 the highest suspended sediment load occurred during the long rainy season in the period between march and june during the long rainy seasons of the years 2012 2013 and 2015 the suspended sediment loads ranged 0 29 2 6 106 tons month 1respectively the exception was during the long rainy season of the 2014 when suspended sediment load was relatively lower due to relatively low rainfall and subsequently low river discharges that were experienced during this period during the short rainy seasons in the period between october and december of 2012 2015 the suspended sediment loads were relatively lower being 0 40 106tons month 1 the sediment loads during the long rainy seasons were therefore much higher since these are periods associated with relatively high magnitude rainfall and river discharges the transport of suspended sediments during the rainy seasons contributes equivalent to 95 3 of the total annual suspended sediment load transported by the river in the upper athi basin the suspended sediment load during the long rainy seasons is equivalent to 54 of the total annual sediment load while the sediment load discharged during the short rainy season is equivalent to 41 of the total annual suspended sediment load the volume of suspended sediment load transported by the river during the dry season when the river discharges are very low is equivalent to only 4 7 of the total annual sediment load 4 7 sediment load transport deficit and surplus the main athi river channel experiences periods when supply of suspended sediment load is above or below the mean value computed for the period 2012 2015 the results of the study showed that in the period between 2012 and 2015 there were four periods of major surplus suspended sediment load transport in the upper athi river these occurred mainly during the long rainy season in the period between march and may of 2012 2014 during this period the surplus sediment load ranged 0 38 0 75 106 tons month 1 in the same period there were two 2 period of minor surplus suspended sediment loads during the short rainy season in the period between november and december of 2012 2015 in which the surplus sediment load was relatively lower being of the order 0 025 106 tons month 1 the only exception was in 2015 short rains when the surplus sediment load increased significantly to 0 40 106 tons month 1 as compared to other previous short rainy seasons when surplus 0 025 106 tons month 1 the main river channel experienced deficit sediment load transport that occurred during the dry season months of june october and january march fig 12 during these dry periods lack of rainfall coupled with low tsscs low water levels and river discharges led to the deficit sediment load transport of the order 0 10 106tons month 1 these results indicate that during the dry seasons there is very little net transport of suspended sediment load in the upper athi river basin majority of net sediment transport occurs during the rainy seasons and especially during the long rainy season 4 8 analysis of the effects of land use land cover on sediment fluxes the main sub basins found in the upper athi river basin exhibits different combinations of hydroclimatic conditions land uses and land covers tables 3 and 4 attempt was made to determine the extent to which spatial variations in rainfall and combinations of land use land covers influences the magnitude of river discharges and suspended sediment yield in the sub basins the suspended sediment loads computed for the sub basins were based on the surveys that were conducted in 2012 as a results of differences in hydroclimatic conditions and land use land cover the suspended sediment loads of sub basins are highly spatially non uniform ranging from 10 944 to 248 015 tons month 1 sediment production rate is also spatially non uniform ranging from 358 to 12 517 tons km2 yr 1 the highest suspended sediment loads were measured in the sub basin draining arid and semi zone mbagathi and stony athi that is characterized by relatively low mean annual rainfall 568 964 mm degraded savannah grasslands and intensive livestock grazing the lowest suspended sediment load were measured in the high altitude high rainfall 1210 mm sub basins ruiru characterized by dense forest cover mixed farming and settlements in terms of sediment production per unit area the stony athi and mbagathi sub basins draining semi arid zone with grasslands and livestock grazing yielded the highest soil erosion rates of 7 858 and 10 942 and tons km2 yr 1 respectively the relatively high suspended sediment load and high sediment production rate in the nairobi sub basin was attributed to anthropogenic activities such as disposal of solid waste and discharge of sewage effluent and wastewater in the river channel which are common in the informal settlements found within the city of nairobi the degraded lands within the nairobi metropolitan area are also major contributor to high sediment production in the nairobi sub basin the denudation rates in the upper athi basin ranged from 0 24 to 8 34 mm yr 1depending on the land use land cover and hydroclimatic conditions the high altitude rainfall highly forested sub basin ruiru experienced the lowest denudation rate of 0 24 mm yr 1 while the heavily urbanised sub basin nairobi experienced the highest denudation rate of 8 34 mm yr 1 the semi arid heavily grazed sub basins stony athi and mbagathi also experienced relatively high denudation rates of 5 24 and 7 29 mm yr 1 respectively the overall denudation rate for the entire upper athi river basin is 0 24 mm yr 1 which tends to under represent the denudation happening within the specific sub basins the total annual suspended sediment load of the sub basins draining into the main river in the upper athi river basin was estimated to be 3 76 106 tons year 1 this is higher than the total annual sediment load of the upper athi river at rgs 3bd1 which is 2 95 106 tons year 1 the differences were attributed to the trapping of a large portion of the sediment load within the river channel upstream the trapped sediment load is only remobilized during the subsequent rainy season when river discharge increases to about 400 m3s 1 5 discussion 5 1 rainfall river discharge interactions and variability of tssc river discharge plays an important role in the variability of tssc in the upper athi river basin an increase in river discharge leads to increase in tssc which is expected in view of the fact that the sediment transport capacity of the river increases as the magnitude of river discharge increases however this is contrary to recent finding reported in some south american tropical rivers where the relationship between tssc and discharge was found to be inverse such that as the river discharge increases tssc decreases this rather unique scenario was attributed to the depletion of sediment supply during high flood river discharge conditions orfeo 2006 a factor that does not seem to be applicable in the upper athi basin while sediment supply may not be a limiting factor in the upper athi basin different sources of sediments leads to hysteresis in the relationship between river discharge and tssc and also between river flow velocities and tssc these hysteresis are characterized by three main clusters at low inter mediate and high river discharge conditions which are indication of different sources of sediment materials supplied into the river at different discharge stages see also batalla and vericat 2009 the hysteresis at low water levels are due to the discharge of wastewater sewage effluent and those at high water level are due to the discharge of sediments derived from land via surface runoff the intermediate hysteresis is attributed to the remobilization of sediment deposited in previous floods in the river channel the degree of scattering of tssc when it is related to river discharges and flow velocities was relatively higher for low and intermediate water levels and the degree of scatter was much lower for high river discharges the latter would seem to also contract the findings of orfeo 2006 who noted that high discharges have a tendency of exhibiting greater scatter in the tssc for some tropical rivers in south america the greater degree of scattering of tssc for low river discharges in our case was attributed to the presence of sediment materials derived from different sources in the basin and also resuspension of the fine colloidal sediments as the river water level increases the resuspension of bottom sediment appeared to be important for river discharges of the order 200 m3s 1and flow velocities of the order 0 75 ms 1which once attained triggered a rapid increase in tssc to levels of the order 2gl 1 this pattern can to a certain extent be attributed to high availability of sediment materials for transport during periods of high river discharges the magnitude of rainfall in the upper athi river basin determines the volume of surface runoff that is generated on land and this subsequently determines the volume of river discharge the variability of river discharge in turn induces variability of tssc such that periods of high rainfall and high river discharges are characterized by high tssc and the vice versa is also true this explains the differences in the values of tssc measured in the period 2021 2022 which were relatively higher as compared to those of 2012 2015 the period 2012 2015 yielded relatively lower tssc values that could be attributed to the fact the river discharges that were experienced during this period were moderate with no extreme flood flows such as those which are usually experienced during typical el nino enso years munyao 2001 comparison of the magnitude of tssc levels measured in the upper athi river with those measured in other tropical river systems showed that the river is characterized by relatively higher tssc levels than those measured in the upper tana basin results reported for a tropical south america river bermejito yielded tssc values ranging between 0 05 and 0 70gl 1 orfeo 2006 which are relatively lower than those reported for the upper athi basin the differences between upper athi river tssc levels and those of other rivers are attributed to the differences in land use land cover and hydroclimatic conditions as discussed in other sections of this paper the relatively more drier and degraded sub basins of the upper athi basin seems to favors conditions for rapid generation of surface runoff and high rates of soil erosion rates explaining relatively high peak tssc levels of the order 1 97 2 3 gl 1 reported in the basin 5 2 seasonal and inter annual variations of tssc and sediment loads the significant seasonal and inter annual variations in tssc in the upper athi river basin can be explained by the seasonal variability of rainfall which consequently causes seasonal variation of river discharges periods associated with high rainfall leads to high surface runoff and high soil erosion rates leading to an increase in tssc in the river the dry seasons in which the river discharges are dominated by baseflows were characterized by relatively low tssc because of absence of sediment input via surface runoff the baseflows were characterized by low flow velocities with limited capability for resuspending and entraining sediments therefore the highest tsscs occurred during the long rainy seasons in the period between march and may in the period 2012 2013 and 2015 because this is the period that is characterized by high magnitude rainfall fig 9 tssc levels during the short rainy season tended to be relatively lower due to relatively low magnitude of rainfall and river discharges that are experienced during this period the maximum tssc of 2 0 gl 1during the 2012 long rainy season was relatively lower than maximum tssc of 4 0 gl 1 that was measured at the mouth of the river near malindi in the period 2002 2003 kitheka 2003 kitheka et al 2004 the maximum tssc in 2002 2003 period was therefore 50 higher than that which was measured in 2012 2013 period however much lower tssc values ranging 1 0 1 45 g l 1 have been reported for upper parts of the basin during relatively dry years with low river discharge of the order of 33 m3s 1 kithiia 2008 tssc variability also exhibits significant inter annual variations that are related to the inter annual variation of rainfall and river discharge fig 9 the years 2012 and 2015 received relatively higher rainfall as compared to 2013 and 2014 periods of higher rainfall such as those associated with el nino enso events usually exhibits relatively higher river discharges and higher tssc extremely high peak tssc value of 16 4 gl 1 has been reported for the period 1997 1999 during the el nino event munyao 2001 it is however important to note that the rather high peak tssc value experienced during el nino enso events has moderately high frequency of occurrence in view of increased frequency of extreme events in the basin the extreme events on long term basis leads to relatively smaller quantity of net sediment load transport as compared to the frequent moderate and smaller flows that on long term basis are responsible for transportation of largest quantity of suspended sediment load to the ocean thus the moderate and smaller flows are critical in shaping fluvial geomorphic processes of tropical rivers such as the athi river while some previous studies have indicated that the sediment load should decline progressively as the rainy season progresses due to seasonal improvement of vegetation cover and hence presumed reduction of soil erosion rates in a basin this may not be the case in the upper athi river since our results shows that throughout the rainy seasons tssc levels were usually high with no indication of a decline that can be attributed to change in soil erosion rates the subsequent decline in tssc can only be attributed to the decline in river discharges due to cessation of rainfall at the end of the season the high tssc occurring during period of declining river discharges could be attributed to the resuspension of the channel bed sediment because the flow velocities during this period are above the critical level for resuspension of sediments thus erosion and resuspension of channel bed sediments causes relatively high tssc in the river in periods when sediment input into the river via surface runoff has ceased the reduction of tssc and turbidity at the end of the rainy season can thus be attributed to the cessation of the input of surface runoff into the river and also reduction of flow velocities below critical level for sediment erosion it was noted that the flow velocities required to keep cohesive sediments in suspension are quite low 0 05 ms 1 in the upper athi basin explaining the significant water turbidity even during low flow conditions the effective discharge is the discharge in which majority of the sediment load is transported by a river the volume of suspended sediment load transported by the athi river is highly variable and significant volume of transport occurs at a river discharge rate of 405 m3s 1 this discharge rate is close to the effective discharge of 450 m3s 1 reported for the lower ebro river tena et al 2011 the effective discharge for the athi river is considered to be a frequent discharge since it is exceeded or equaled in 10 of the time this discharge rate is associated with more frequent discharges that are experienced in basically most of the seasons of the years implying that in most years the discharge in the upper athi river is capable of transporting suspended sediment load downstream in the ebro river the effective discharge was also found to be very frequent and was equaled or exceeded 20 of the time tena et al 2011 our results emphasizes the fact that the most common moderate river discharges transports most of the suspended sediment load in the upper athi river basin which is expected in view of their relatively high frequency of occurrence as compared to the extreme flood events which tends to be rare this is consistent with the observations made in previous studies undertaken elsewhere that have shown that the most frequent moderate magnitude river discharges tend to be responsible for the greatest amount of sediment movement over the long term biedenharn and thorne 1994 it must also be pointed out that for many rivers functional relationship between sediment discharge and river discharge is complicated because sediment discharge is controlled more by the supply of sediment materials from the catchment area than by the capacity of river to transport them in other words where the supply of sediment from the catchment area is limited there will be low sediment transport in the river even though the river discharge could be high and possess sufficient capacity to transport sediments in the upper athi river basin the results showed that there is a significant and positive relationship between river discharge and sediment load which is consistent with the results of other studies undertaken in other river basins see orfeo 2006 the fact that suspended sediment transport is significant throughout the rainy season indicates that there is no limited sediment supply in the upper athi river during periods of high river discharges since the increase in sediment load as river discharge increases seems to be exponential the major determinant of the quantity of sediment load reaching the upper athi river at any given time is therefore surface runoff generated on land during the rainy season which in turn is a function of rainfall amount and intensity and land use land cover in the basin resuspension of the channel bed sediment is only significant when supply of sediment into the river via surface runoff has ceased studies conducted in the upper athi river basin have reported different magnitudes of sediment loads for instance in the period 1980 1981 odo 2005 estimated sediment load in the upper athi catchment to be 1 05 106 tons year 1 this study found the sediment load in the upper athi river to be 2 95 106 tons year 1 these differences could be attributed to changes in land use land cover in the basin which have consequently changed the rates of soil loss the role of land use land cover in influencing the hydrology and sediment yield in the sub basins is dealt with in the later sections the suspended sediment load in the upper athi basin is much lower than suspended sediment load of 7 1 106 tons year 1 reported for the north west upper tana basin njogu 2018 comparison of the annual sediment load in the upper athi river with that measured at the mouth of the river at the coast showed that the upper athi river contributes 52 of the total annual sediment load however odo 2005 provided an estimate of 12 5 which was based on very limited spot sampling data that did not cover the entire range of suspended sediment loads experienced in the basin the fact that rainfall is the main determinant of one of the most important agent of sediment transport river discharge may lead one to conclude that the rates of soil erosion in the basin will reduce over time due to reduction in river discharges however this may not be the case in view of increased variability of rainfall in the region see ndomeni et al 2018 gebrechorkos 2019 that is subsequently leading to increased variability of river discharges with increased occurrence of extremely high river discharge events that have greater capability for transport of high sediment loads the extreme variability of rainfall would also lead to extreme variability of land cover in the basin making the already degraded land more vulnerable to erosion after extreme dry seasons preceding high rainfall events this coupled with increased land use activities due to human population pressure and increased livestock grazing is therefore expected to lead to a continued increased in suspended sediment load transport in the basin 5 3 sediment load transport deficit and surplus in the upper athi river suspended sediment load transport in the upper athi river is not uniformly distributed throughout the year the significant amounts of sediment loads are transported during periods when sediment supply to the basin is not limited in the period 2012 2015 there were four 4 periods of major surplus suspended sediment load transport in the upper athi river fig 12 these occurred mainly during the long rainy season in the period between march and may of 2012 2014 examination of the patterns of sediment load transport in the entire duration of the study showed that the periods of deficit sediment load transport are more dominant as compared to the periods of surplus sediment load transport in the period between 2012 and 2015 a total of 28 months exhibited deficit suspended sediment load transport as compared to 9 months that exhibited major surplus suspended sediment load transport and 2 months that experienced minor surplus sediment transport thus the river experienced surplus sediment load transport in only 28 of the time 11months out of 39 months the deficit sediment transport load was experienced in 72 of the time 28 months out 39 months these results shows that the upper athi river experiences deficit sediment load transport in most periods of the year and surplus sediment load transport is a relatively occasional event occurring in periods ofhigh river discharges 400 m3s 1 the dominant season in terms of surplus sediment load transport is the long rainy season that occurs in the period between the months of march and may this is the period that is also characterized by high river discharges with greater capacity for transporting sediments downstream the dominance of deficit sediment load transport is thus attributed to the high frequency of occurrence of low discharges as compared to the low frequency of occurrence of high discharges during the period of deficit sediment load transport the tssc values are usually very low since there is very little if any supply of sediments from the catchment areas upstream the very low sediment load 25 000 tons month 1 that is transported during this period emanates from within the river channel and may be associated with sediment resuspension and local disturbances of the channel bed sediments during the period of deficit sediment load there is a tendency for most of the sediment to be retained within the river channel field observations showed that the deposited sediment includes clay silt and sand these materials are usually available for transport as washload during the next period of flood flows when the sediment transport capacity of the river increases significantly 5 4 sub basins hydrology sediment yield and impacts of land uses land covers the sediment yield and river discharges in the sub basins draining the upper athi river basin are spatially non uniform emphasizing the important role played by land use activities in all the sub basins there was a combination of several land uses land covers making it difficult to attribute the measured magnitudes of river discharges and sediment load to the specific land use land cover in the sub basin despite these difficulties key patterns emerged the two sub basins draining the high altitude aberdare ranges and which experience relatively high rainfall 655 1764 mm per annum and dense forest cover tended to exhibit relatively low suspended sediment loads 10 944 and 67 989 tons month 1 but the river discharges were relatively low due to intense river water abstraction for agriculture in the two sub basins the relatively higher suspended sediment load in the ndarugu sub basin as compared to ruiru sub basin was attributed to the presence of quarrying activities that leads to land degradation the highly forested upper parts of these two basins coupled with tea plantations favours high infiltration of rainwater and subsequently low rates of hortonian overland flow and soil erosion the sub basins draining the semi arid zone characterized by relatively moderate rainfall 655 1272 mm per annum with degraded forests and grasslands that are used for livestock grazing cultivation and settlements exhibited very high sediment loads of 248 015 tons month 1 the semi arid sub basin receiving between 481 and 655 mm of rainfall and which is dominated mainly by grasslands and livestock grazing also exhibited relatively high sediment loads of 196 455 tons month 1 the semi arid river basin with forests grasslands livestock grazing and cultivation yielded 21 more sediments as compared to the semi arid sub basin with forests grasslands and livestock grazing and 42 more sediments as compared to the sub basins with forest and cultivation it also yielded 67 more sediments than the sub basin with forest and urban settlements the semi arid sub basins yielded 73 94 more sediments than the high rainfall sub basins dominated by forest and cultivation therefore incorporation of livestock grazing in a semi arid sub basin seems to favour high sediment production rate this is largely due to livestock overgrazing which tends to reduce water infiltration rates into the soil leading to high generation of overland flow that subsequently leads to high rates of soil erosion these results emphasize the need to control livestock population and implement soil erosion control measures in cultivated catchment areas the sediment production rates in the sub basins are relatively high ranging between 358 and 12 517 tons km2 year 1 however considering the suspended sediment load discharged at the outlet of the upper athi basin the sediment production rate was found to range between 205 and 366 tons km 2 year 1 with a mean value of 287 tons km 2 year 1 this is relatively higher than sediment production rate reported in some previous studies that have been undertaken in the upper athi river basin sediment production rates of 188 tons km 2 year 1have been reported by odo 2005 in the thwake sub basin sediment production of 1366 tons km2 year 1 based on the 1957 1979 data have been reported thomas and edwards 1979 which are much higher than the rate of 459 tons km2 year 1 reported in this study the differences could be due to improvement of land cover in the basin occasioned by successful soil erosion control measures in cultivated lands forest conservation and reforestation programme implemented in the basin since 1979 in the upper tana basin in kenya relatively higher sediment production rate of 715 tons km2 yr 1 has been reported njogu et al 2018 in other parts of tropical africa relatively higher sediment production rates ranging between 483 and 1804 tons km 2 year 1 have also been reported see oyebande 1981 balek 1977 vanmaercke et al 2014 the denudation rates ranging from 0 24 to 8 34 mm yr 1 established for the basin emphasizes the fact that soil erosion in the upper tana basin is not spatial uniform however it is important to note that basin denudation rates and sediment production rates in the upper athi river basin is relatively high when compared to rates reported for other catchments in africa the inter catchment differences in these rates have been explained in previous studies undertaken elsewhere to be due to the differences in land cover land use patterns vanmaercke et al 2014 it must however be emphasized that sediment production rate in the upper athi river basin are relatively much lower as compared to those reported in other tropical river basin in south america where for instance in the madeira river basin rates of 3000 tons km 2 year 1 have been reported vauchel et al 2017 the total annual sediment load of 3 76 106 tons year 1at the outlet of the main sub basins in the upper athi river basin is higher than the total annual sediment load of the upper athi river at rgs 3bd1 which is 2 95 106 tons year 1 this shows that 18 of the sediment load transported by the tributary rivers does not reach the lower course of main upper athi river most of this sediment load is trapped in the upper course of the river or is removed from the river channel due to various anthropogenic activities such as sand mining water diversion the results also show that sediment delivery ratio of the tributary sub basins is high which can be explained by the nature of most of the stream channels which tends to be relatively steep and rocky allowing generation of strong flow velocities the rate of sediment trapping of 18 for the upper athi river is relatively lower as compared to 33 for madeira river basin in south america vauchel et al 2017 comparison of the total annual sediment load in the upper athi river basin was made with that measured at the mouth of the river near malindi the results showed that the upper athi river contributes 52 of the total sediment load of the athi river the remaining 48 of the sediment load is probably contributed by other rivers draining in the middle and lower parts of the basin the relatively high contribution of the upper athi river basin was attributed to the fact that this part of the basin receives relatively higher annual total rainfall and has relatively better land use land cover as compared to the more semi arid southern part of the basin where rainfall is less than 600 mm in terms of the magnitude of sediment supply to the main upper athi river the largest contributors are mbagathi stony athi nairobi and ndarugu rivers tables 3 and 4 sediment transport by the athi river has important implications of the thwake multipurpose dam which is being constructed downstream at the confluence of athi river and thwake river at a cost of usd 576 million the results showed that using the mean total annual suspended sediment load of 2 95 106 tons year 1measured in the upper athi river in the period 2012 2015 it would take 381 years for thwake dam reservoir to be filled completely with sediments because the sediment trap efficiency of the dam is expected to be moderate the lifespan of the dam could be slightly higher than what we have calculated here it is however important to note that trapping of sediments in the thwake dam reservoir will significantly reduce the volume of sediment load supplied downstream to the coast this would in future trigger massive erosion of the river channel downstream of the dam leading to deepening there will also enhanced erosion of the shoreline and or beaches at malindi bay to compensate for the reduction in sediment supply to the coast see kitheka 2003 kitheka 2013 with the potential to affect socio economic activities including tourism at malindi the impact of dams on sediment loads of rivers has been a subject of a number of studies undertaken elsewhere these studies have clearly demonstrated that significant downstream impacts occurs following damming of rivers see kitheka 2003 snoussi et al 2007 simona et al 2015 berkun et al 2015 therefore thwake dam will be no exception 6 conclusions the study has demonstrated that in a typical tropical river basin such as the upper athi river basin the dynamics of suspended sediment are complicated by the interaction between rainfall and river discharge and influences of land use land cover the variability of river discharges water levels and river flow velocities influences the patterns of variability of tssc and suspended sediment load the relationships between these hydrologic parameters and tssc are characterized by hysteresis due to sediment originating from different sources in the basin depending on the stage of river discharge the study also notes that the magnitude of rainfall is an important determinant of the magnitude of river discharges which in turn determines the magnitude of sediment load this is however also dependent on the land use land cover type in the sub basins the non uniformity of rainfall and land use land cover in the sub basins induces spatial differences in sediment production rates and suspended sediment loads in the sub basins the semi arid sub basins that are characterized by relatively low mean annual rainfall and livestock overgrazing tends to yield relatively higher sediment load on the other hand the sub basins draining the high rainfall zone with forest and mixed farming tend to yield relatively low sediment loads the significant seasonal and inter annual variability of rainfall causes significant seasonal and inter annual variations in river discharges tssc and suspended sediment loads in the basin the sediment load in the upper athi river basin is relatively lower than suspended sediment load measured at the outlet of the river due to significant trapping of sediments upstream in sub basins and also within the main channel the sediment production rate in the upper athi river basin is relatively high and spatially non uniform depending on land use land cover type and rainfall amount the total annual sediment load of the main streams draining into the upper athi river basin was estimated to be 3 76 106 tons yr 1 which is higher than the total annual sediment load of 2 95 106 tons yr 1 of the upper athi river in view of increased anthropogenic impacts on land use land cover the suspended sediment load in the basin will continue to increase due to increased variability of extreme rainfall events the trapping of sediments in thwake dam has potential to cause significant downstream impacts including channel erosion and beach erosion at the coast

sources which include surface water and groundwater adam and appiah adjei 2019 nonetheless owing to great geographical and temporal variability connected to rainfall in the basin surface water sources are vulnerable to large evaporative losses rendering them unpredictable readily contaminated by sediments insufficient and hence unable to fulfill the increasing demand needs anim gyampo et al 2019a

accounts for a bigger share of the overall population since its utilization is critical for socio economic transformation groundwater is mostly used for household drinking water supplies small scale agricultural irrigation and the watering of livestock adam and appiah adjei 2019 approximately 80 of the people in the basin urban and rural population depends on groundwater for their primary use also 60 of the population uses irrigated agriculture in the basin which has the potential to expand productivity though the characteristics of the basin physically are appropriate for irrigated and mechanized agriculture these systems are undertaken in some small locations akpoti et al 2022 dovie and kasei 2018 an increasing population rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion have produced a supply demand gap resulting in high consumption and low availability unmet demand unmet demands are associated with water related diseases in the basin since the people sometimes resort to unsafe sources untreated water from open reservoirs for their source of domestic water needs agricultural practices in the wvrb have often relied on rain fed as well as surface and shallow wells for dry season irrigation nonetheless to ensure food security and in meeting the sustainable development goals sdg 1 and 2 a transition to groundwater based irrigation is essential groundwater use in the basin has seen a substantial increase over the past three decades due to borehole drilling and mechanization of small towns rural water supply systems and rural areas using the resource for domestic water supply obuobie et al 2012a 2012b also the adoption of dry season irrigation farming by primarily the youth as a means to improve their livelihoods has led to increasing pressure on the resource in most communities especially the basin s northeastern section it is critical that practitioners and policymakers have a better understanding of projected quantities of groundwater resource from drivers of population growth socio economic scenarios expansion in irrigated agriculture climate change and land use change which leads to an increase in the exploitation of groundwater resource for domestic use at a lower cost and with greater flexibility gorelick and zheng 2015 the white volta basin s relatively low irrigation delivery 6 3 of farmed land underscores the basin s essential

challenges of a transition from subsistence farming to a more intensive groundwater based irrigation so as to address the needs of the rapid population increase economic growth and climate change adaptation for the basin s wvrb agriculture to become more climate resilient and less susceptible to variations in rainfall and temperature groundwater based irrigated agriculture is critical in fulfilling the needs of the population and the country at large wiggins and lankford 2019 however the inability to efficiently model the projected demand base on the aforementioned socioeconomic

sustainable groundwater management helps to achieve the sdgs on poverty reduction food security access to water and urban growth hence the effective development of groundwater to augment resource

directed towards surface water which is also very susceptible to the influences of climate change socioeconomic growth along with climatic change have combined to create a scenario in which demand exceeds supply at the beginning of the century for an enhanced understanding of past and future groundwater demands in ghana s white volta river basin comprising approximately 92 of the country s

tropical convergent zone itcz dickson and benneh 1995 temperatures in the range of 18 c and 42 c with an approximate mean value of 30 c are prominent in the dry seasons except during the harmattan seasons november february at what time these can fall as low as 20 c or even lower thru the wet rainy season relative humidity ranges from 40 and 70 and declines to about 15 during the rest of the year carrier et al 2008 there is an upsurge in potential and actual evapotranspiration rates in the basin due to the observed low humidity and high temperatures obuobie et al 2012a 2012b potential evapotranspiration rates range between 650 mm year and 1300 mm year kwei 1997 nevertheless van der sommen and geirnaert 1998 projected rather extreme rates of evapotranspiration ranging between 1776

global digital soil map fao 2003 depicts the geographical heterogeneity of plant and soil features the various data sources and their spatial resolution used are as shown in table 1 as indicated multiple types of datasets were employed in the creation of the weap model for the research area the digital elevation model dem for the white volta river basin https earthexplorer usgs gov was used to delineate the sub basins and the thiessen polygon method was used to locate sub catchments with no meteorological stations and stations closer the nature and proportion of land cover in a sub

conductivity were captured using the swat global soil database https swat tamu edu docs 3 overview of methodology 3 1 model description the weap model sieber 2006 https weap21 org is renowned for its comprehensive approach for modeling water systems as well as policy alignment sieber and purkey 2015 it is used extensively in analyzing the allocation of water resources by determining the correlation associated with basin water supply and demand using the supply and demand balance theory weap analyses water resource allocation challenges using basic linear programming at each time step for integrated water resource planning yates et al 2005 in weap there are three regular scenario modeling efforts considered which are the model base year known as the current account the establishment from the current accounts generates a reference scenario to simulate without interventions the probable developments and what if scenarios crafted to change the reference scenario for the evaluation of the impacts of any alterations in demand policies climate change and or technologies to attain a reliable and efficient model for the water demands the 2000 2019 range of data was sought for in modeling the current accounts a range of options are evaluated by designing several scenarios and long term water requirements are forecast for the provision of limited resources the weap software package was utilized to assess ghana s white volta river basin s long term groundwater demand and long term water resource management the following phases are typically included in the weap applications the problem s definition which comprises the time period the geographic boundary the system s components and the system s configuration the introduction of current accounts which offers a picture of the system s actual water demand and availability the construction of scenarios founded on distinctive sets of long term trends hinged on policies developments in the basin and other variables that impact on the hydrology and the scenarios evaluation with respect to standards of water resources adequacies costs benefits and the impacts of the environment there are two primary functions associated with the weap model the modeling of natural hydrological processes makes it easier to assess the amount of water available in a basin and the allocation of water resources stimulated by the modeling of anthropogenic activities for an effective assessment of domestic water use modeling the water demand for a basin assists to evaluate multiple scenarios for water resource management to address and control the various challenges in demand associated with the present and long time periods in this paper the weap an integrated water resource management model is used to illustrate present circumstances including water needs hydrology climate and policy the long term forecast data incorporates climatic change precipitation temperature humidity and evapotranspiration water needs regulatory considerations priority of water users and social factors population growth rates alternative policies for adaptation are built as scenarios of the water quantity available is unable to meet the water demands for the long term period moreover catchment processes are simulated using five methods however the study employed the soil moisture method as classification of land use and types of soil impacts are allowed yates et al 2005 the processes of soil moisture are a one dimensional 2 bucket water accounting concept focused on analytical processes used to describe the hydrology of the basin i e deep percolation evapotranspiration surface runoff and basin or sub basin interflow fig 2 3 2 water demand estimation 3 2 1 domestic and industrial water demand the estimation of the domestic demand involved the per capita water consumption in the sub basins by administering a household survey questionnaire three 3 towns communities were selected from each sub basin for this survey based on population and water supply schemes three 3 sections were captured in the survey questionnaire and were captioned as personal information of the respondent household characteristics and existing sources usage and water management from the 500 samples 28 were removed owing to lack of information leaving 472 for analysis the analysis of the data was carried out both quantitatively and qualitatively using microsoft excel minitab version 19 various statistical analyses such as descriptive statistics analysis of variance and correlation were performed on the data in order to extract all relevant data for further analysis 3 2 2 water source and consumption pattern 92 of the households 434 n 472 have reliable water sources either from a public stand post 48 or house connection 44 only 5 24 n 372 rely on the water supplied from dams as the main water source a household s daily water use ranged from 236 l to 1467 l around 56 264 n 472 of households use less than 60 l each day whereas 44 use 1000 l or more 20 94 n 472 of homes use less than 500 l each day the per capita water usage ranged from 50 to 100 l day it was also discovered in some households that a person consumes less than 50 l per day which is who s recommended minimum water consumption per capita cwsa 2010 un 2012 in 56 of the households analyzed each person consumes approximately 100 l day and 15 consumes approximately 120 l day or less only three of the investigated households utilize 200 l day per person one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate for statistically significant variance across the chosen communities in terms of overall water use and per capita consumption average daily household water use f 4 381 0 877 p 0 490 and per capita consumption f 4 381 0 061 p 0 980 showed no statistically significant differences thus it is possible to prove that daily average water uses and consumption per capita are not statistically different thus water supply in the basin has no major impact on household water usage and average per capita consumption is estimated at 50 l day and expected to rise to 120 l day by 2050 due to urbanization and climate change okyereh et al 2019 the population for the various sub basins and their per capita water consumption used for the weap model is as shown in table a1 3 3 irrigation and livestock agricultural water demands 3 3 1 irrigation water demand the abstraction of groundwater currently is exclusively for household and livestock watering except in the atankwidi sub basin within the kpasenkpe sub catchment where shallow wells are used for dry season irrigation of vegetables anim gyampo et al 2019a 2019b all standpipes of community water supply systems and boreholes in the basin are constructed with troughs 10 m further apart with soak away where livestock feed with water spilled from these systems small and large reservoirs and streams also serve as main sources of water for livestock these water sources also run dry during the dry season due to extreme climate conditions in the basin so they depend on the spills for their water supply the livestock rearing activities in the basin will be upscaled since the people are engaged in animal rearing for the estimation of long term water demand therefore livestock water demand shall be separated from agricultural irrigation water demand to estimate for the modeling crops that are cultivated mainly under irrigation from shallow wells include rice pepper tomato and other vegetables thus to compute the required quantity of water needed climate data from the stations fig 1 were used for the crop water requirement estimations the penman monteith method eqs 1 and 2 allen et al 1998 was employed to determine the reference evapotranspiration et with the support of the cropwat software for the calculation of the et 0 based on fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 1 λ et r n g p a c p e s e a r a γ 1 r s r

giwr 3 3 2 crop data land preparation begins in late november and planting begins in december which is the beginning of the dry season the crops cultivated mainly within the basin during the period include rice tomatoes onions cabbage pepper and other vegetables the kc values recorded table a2 and a3 and were obtained from the food and agricultural organization fao manual 56 allen et al 1998 the details that were used as inputs included the rooting depth yield response factor and length of plant growth the kc values may vary because to shorter growth periods for tomato owusu sekyere et al 2012 found kc values of 0 62 1 61 1 23 and 0 92 for the initial developing mid season and late season stages 3 4 land suitability for groundwater irrigation to develop the groundwater based irrigation potential for the wvrb four parameters dem lulc soil map and slope maps were employed the basins land use map was overlaid on the land suitability map for irrigation in the arcgis environment for the determination of potentially irrigable land performing a weighted overlay operation in an arcgis using the suitable sites for irrigation and land use maps as inputs resulted in the identification of sites that could be brought under irrigated agriculture groundwater for all the sub basins in the wvrb ghansah et al 2018 the land suitability map for irrigation and the land use map for each sub basin were first reclassified the reclassified maps were then weighted and then combined using the raster calculator in arcgis which provided good results of available suitable land for crop cultivation per sub basin fig 3 is a flow chart of the procedure used to estimate and map out the irrigation potential the available sites suitable for irrigation maps represent the potential sites that can be brought under groundwater based irrigated agriculture table a4 shows the potential land for irrigation for the various sub catchments in the white volta river basin 3 4 1 groundwater potential for irrigation two variables were used to assess the appropriateness of groundwater depth to groundwater table and aquifer productivity the withdrawal cost is determined by the depth to groundwater table amjath babu et al 2016 while groundwater production is a significant component in assessing groundwater suitability akpoti et al 2022 for the white volta basin spatiotemporal predictions of groundwater depth were acquired from fan et al 2013 borehole data on yields of borehole in l s and groundwater depth in m from the groundwater database of the british geological survey bgs macdonald et al 2012 was extracted from the national borehole database of 2018 and the aquifer productivity calculated through the inverse distance weighted approach in arcgis geospatial analyst tool these data were used for the identification of potentially suitable lands in the sub basins to be irrigated by groundwater using water lifting technologies that included diesel or solar powered pumps assefa et al 2018 martin and van de giesen 2005 ofosu 2012 the estimated groundwater depth in ghana averages between 14 and 50 m maximum from the surface and aquifer productivity ranges between 0 1 and 20 l s of borehole potential yield most parts of the basin have potential aquifer yields ranging from 1 and 5 l s a superimposition was carried out of the most suitable land for crop cultivation over the aquifer productivity and the groundwater depth map to determine the potential of groundwater for irrigation the suitable land has groundwater ranging between 1 and 50 m and an average depth of 12 m borehole yields vary from 0 6 to 1 7 m3 h in the sub catchments 3 4 2 livestock water demand the main livestock activities in the basin include cattle goat sheep and poultry chicken and guinea fowl the growth rate and per capita water demand of the main livestock are as shown in table a5 the population projection and forecasting were calculated using the geometric increase formula method recommended by the fao as shown in eq 1 the choice of this method is due to the young and rapid development or growth of livestock activities in the basin that notwithstanding the agro ecology climatic conditions and availability of land are suitable for upscaling livestock farming in the basin 6 p n p o 1 r n 7 r r 1 r 2 r 3 r n t where pn is the projected population po is the known population r is the assumed growth rate and n is number of years 3 5 weap model setup weap layout area described as schematic employs an interface of geographic information system gis the process began with the digitization of the nine sub catchments as vector files incorporating the rivers and streams in the basin to create the backdrop they were imported as vector layers in weap fig 4 shows the complete flowchart and data inputs for developing the weap model the rivers groundwater sources gauging stations demand nodes transmission and return flow links were later created for each of the catchments fig 5 the model was developed for the white volta river basin of ghana and encapsulates the following the main white volta river basin and nine streams and their tributaries gambaga kpasenkpe kulpawn lower white volta middle white volta mole nabogo nasia and sisilli nine catchment nodes nine domestic water and industrial water demand sites gambaga kpasenkpe kulpawn lower white

with pest the weap model was calibrated and validated using hydrological streamflow data from the wvb s various gauges data from 2006 to 2012 was utilized for calibration whereas data from 2014 to 2019 was used for validation fig 6 the model s integrated parameter estimation tool pest https pesthomepage org was used crop coefficient kc soil water capacity sw root zone conductivity ks runoff resistance factor rrf and preferred flow direction f of the land cover types based on the location of the sub basins were used as key hydrology assumptions and their respected values selected from the soil water assessment swat and fao database to simulate streamflow in the weap model 3 7 scenario development 3 7 1 bias correction of future precipitation and temperature data from cmip5 models due to the differences between climate simulations from the gcm rcms and the observed data bias correction methods are applied before results can be used for impact studies siabi et al 2021 yeboah et al 2021 in this paper quantile empirical mapping approach was considered the approach is used to correct the distribution function of rcm simulated climate values to closely mimic the observed distribution function andrade et al 2021 tian et al 2020 this can be done by creating a transfer function to shift the occurrence distributions of precipitation and temperature piani et al 2010 the gamma distribution thom 1958 with shape parameter α and scale parameter β eq 8 is often assumed to be suitable for distributions of precipitation events and has proven to be the effective for the analysis of precipitation data 8 f γ x α β x α 1 1 β α γ α e x β x 0 α β 0 where γ is the gamma function and α and β are the form and scale parameters respectively for temperature time series the gaussian distribution with location parameter µ and scale parameter σ eq 9 is usually assumed to fit best lima et al 2021 9 f n x μ σ 2 x α 1 1 σ 2 π e x μ 2 2 σ 2 χ ℜ where the scale parameter σ determines the standard deviation and the location parameter µ directly controls the mean and therefore the location of the distribution detailed information about the gamma and gaussian distribution can be accessed here teutschbein and seibert 2012 table 2 3 7 2 daily climate data precipitation and temperature minimum and maximum data for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 from fifteen cimp5 general circulation models gcms see table 3 data at available at http ccafs climate org navarro racines et al 2020 were used as inputs for the weap model the selection of the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 is based on the length of the study period rcp4 5 is a stabilization scenario based on its own reference or no climate policy scenario whereas rcp8 5 is a baseline or high emission scenario that does not contain any climate mitigation objective the rcp4 5 scenario predicts a pathway stabilization by 2100 not exceeding 4 5 w m2 650 ppm co2 while the rcp8 5 lends to intensifying radiative pathway clarke et al 2007 the rcp8 5 scenario corresponded to the rising radiative forcing pathway heading towards 8 5 w m2 1370 ppm co2 by 2100 riahi et al 2007 the rcp8 5 scenario relates to business as usual bau not linked to any climate policies and high greenhouse gases emissions 3 7 3 socioeconomic scenario population and living standards as well as agriculture could rise as a result of socio economic variations hence domestic water demand will predictably rise as the world s population grows and this trend will quicken as with a corresponding increase in urbanization the model implementation adopted the socio economic changes based on a selection of shared socioeconomic pathways ssps o neill et al 2017 ssp2 middle of the road ssp3 fragmentation and ssp5 conventional development were specifically selected to represent conditions in the wvrb jones and o neill 2016 the continuation of socio economic developments is represented in ssp2 with reducing resource utilization and increasing energy intensity in ssp3 mitigation and adaptation to climate change are difficult due to extreme poverty and a rapidly growing population environmental degradation is severe and the energy industry is undergoing a slow technological transformation as a result of a lack of regional cooperation and an enhancement in local energy resources usage momblanch et al 2019 robust economic growth makes it easy to adapt in ssp5 but the impacts of climate change are difficult to mitigate because of the domination of the use of fossil fuels in the energy sector technological progress in the agricultural sector and agro ecosystems are strong and highly managed management of land use is resource intensive including water systems management a framework consistent with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios were chosen using these ssps to compensate for the many uncertainties related to the potential growth of economic and social trends a combination of probable prospects is explored and covers low to medium challenges for climate change adaptation and low to high challenges for mitigation in this scenario o neill et al 2014 the ssps do not incorporate any climate policies and all assume the business as usual bau ghg emission scenario kriegler et al 2012 as shown table sm1 scenario matrix of ssps and rcps the emission scenarios utilized in ssp1 5 generally correlate to rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 the exclusion of ssp1 sustainability and ssp4 inequality is due to their relevance to extreme climate change scenarios and not representative at the catchment scale respectively hanasaki et al 2013 ssps are modeled in weap by modifying significant factors that characterize water demand like high population growth hpg rate medium population growth mpg rate low population growth lpg rate and the higher living standards hls based on rapid urbanization in the basin which will culminate into an increase in per capita water demand table 4 national data on population and population growth rates evolution per ssp were acquired from the iiasa database table sm2 riahi et al 2007 ssp s global model findings for municipal water demand are used to estimate per capita water consumption hanasaki et al 2013 the weap variables are evaluated in light of changes in social and economic conditions table sm2 3 7 4 scenario analysis the study developed nine 9 scenarios table 4 with the integration of climate change scenarios rcps and the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps scenarios population and water consumption pathways to estimate potential water demands with the model the consistency of the rcps and ssps as well as the matrix were used to pair them table sm1 ssp3 and ssp5 scenarios envision a future dependent on fossil fuels they were matched with a higher emission scenario like rcp8 5 while ssp2 is paired with the middle of the road emission scenario thus rcp4 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation results the evaluation of the performance of the modeled streamflow was carried out using observed streamflow data from daboya and nawuni on the middle white volta mwv sub catchment yapei on the lower white volta lwv sub catchmment nasia on the nasia sub catchment nabogo on the nabogo sub catchment and the pwalugu on the kpasenkpe sub catchment as compared to modeled streamflow values from 2006 to 2019 the assessment of the accuracy of the calibration was carried out using visual hydrographs comparisons whiles statistical calibration measurements included the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the root mean square error rmse which quantifies the agreement among both observed and simulated streamflow r2 has a number from 0 to 1 with a greater number implying reduced standard deviation the closer the value is to one the better the model s performance and the lower the error variance liew et al 2003 santhi et al 2001 nse values vary from to 1 with 1 being the best value nash and sutcliffe 1970 pbias levels of 25 should be considered acceptable however 0 is the best pbias value vrugt et al 2003 the coefficient of determination table 2 varied between 0 69 and 0 99 averaging 0 89 whereas the nash sutcliffe parameter varied between 0 63 and 0 99 averaging 0 88 nash sutcliffe efficiency index values vary between and 1 a perfect match between expected and observed discharge values amounts to an efficiency of 1 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the weap model accurately predicts the hydrology of the wvrb based on the values of these parameters this ensures that future streamflow predictions can be made based on future scenarios 4 2 climate change and groundwater flow and storage streamflow s are substantially hindered in the dry months of november to april which is interrelated to groundwater flow correlating with a high demand for water to fulfill agriculture demands groundwater recharge are between june and september and start to decline from october to april the following year depicting the rainfall pattern in all the sub basins under the reference scenario fig 7 the mole sub catchment has the highest average flow to gw of 1 36 108 m3 in october followed by the kulpawn sub catchment with an average flow of 1 14 108 m3 in september this can be attributed to the landcover of these basins being dominant in forest cover the mole game reserve stretches along these two sub catchment hence low evaporative losses the lowest flow to gw is experienced in the nabogo sub catchment with 0 53 108 m3 in march which is also the peak of the dry season it is noticed that all the catchments have their lowest flow in march annual total flow to gw is highest for the mole catchment in 2070 at 7 798 108 m3 nonetheless for the kulpawn sub catchment the same year will be lowest at 1 649 108 m3 the nabogo highest flow is in the 2040 s at 1 774 108 m3 under the rcp4 5 scenario flow to gw rises between june to september and starts to decline from october to march in all the sub catchments the highest under the rcp4 5 is the kulpawn sub catchment with 1 27 108 m3 in september and the lowest is the nabogo catchment in march at 0 32 106 m3 followed by the gambaga with 0 46 106 m3 annual gw flow for the gambaga sub catchment will be highest in 2050 with 1 797 108 m3 the gambaga sub catchment will experience its highest flow under the rcp4 5 scenario in 2050 with 3 87 108 m3 and the lowest in 2020 under the same scenario meanwhile surface runoff in 2050 will be highest in the same catchment in 2050 at 8 69 108 m3 suggesting a strong correlation between surface runoff and gw flow for rcp 8 5 the gambaga kpasenkpe and the nabogo sub catchments fig 7 the disparity between recharge and discharge supply during periods ranging from days to years is known as groundwater storage sieber 2006 changes in groundwater and surface water levels may influence the interconnection between them as well as the correlation between environmental and domestic water supply and demand hanson et al 2012 it is also influenced by the aquifer s inherent features storage capacity transmission capacity which are determined by its size and type climate change has an impact on storage contingent on whether the groundwater is renewable or not or if it is a fossil resource precipitation and temperature are the two major variables that affect surface runoff and evapotranspiration in any basin and both variations have an impact on gw storage akpoti et al 2016 obahoundje et al 2017 to ascertain gw storage fluctuations in response to changes in both variables climate change rcp scenarios an analysis of the storage in each of the sub catchments to reveal its sensitivity to supply was carried out the hydrologic evaluation placed a premium on the quantity of water available in each catchment in the white volta basin the related demand from different stakeholders and the magnitude of climate change s effects the rainfall groundwater recharge correlation in the basin is documented by for example martin and van de giesen 2005 who predicted recharge to be 5 of rainfall throughout the white volta river basin the gambaga kpasenkpe nabogo and nasia sub catchments will experience gw storage shortages from march to may under all the scenarios fig 8 aridity has been shown to have an influence on groundwater in terms of lower recharge particularly for subsurface storage systems that exchange heat directly with the soil surface aslam et al 2018a 2018b 2018c kløve et al 2014 4 3 socioeconomic scenario population which is a significant element in determining water demand is predicted to vary consistently throughout all sub catchments according to the ssps from the iiasa database fig 9 the ssp3 scenario is predicted to have the largest population growth of the three shared socioeconomic pathways with growth continuing in all catchments until 2070 in all the three socioeconomic scenarios ssp2 ssp3 and ssp5 the population would continue to increase steadily at a lower growth rate up to 2070 for all catchments the highest population was predicted in kulpawn sub catchment followed by gambaga kpasenkpe nasia nabogo middle white volta mwv mole sissilli and lower white volta lwv sub catchments respectively however in terms of population density the highest is predicted in gambaga sub catchment followed by kpasenkpe nasia kulpawn and the nabogo the mole and sissilli sub catchments have almost the same population density and the lowest is the lwv the annual domestic per capita water withdrawal for the basin under the reference scenario is approximately 22 m3 cwsa 2010 this demand is projected to rise to 45 m3 and 59 m3 annual per capita under ssp2 and ssp5 respectively due to urbanization and technological advancement nonetheless ssp3 is expected to have the same annual per capita water demand as the reference scenario in all the catchments also due to low urbanization hanasaki et al 2013 industrial water withdrawals in the basin are negligible in comparison to household and agricultural water withdrawals fao 2011 agricultural expansion is required to feed an ever increasing population hence sustainable groundwater resource management is critical for food security various fruit crops vegetables and cereals are cultivated in two cropping seasons in the wvrb rain fed agricultural june october and dry season groundwater based irrigation december may the total cultivable area in the nine sub catchments is 1692 42 km2 but under ssp5 this area will expand to 1866 86 km2 increasing agricultural water demand from table a 4 the nasia sub catchment has the most tillable agricultural land followed by mwv kulpawn and nabogo while the mole sub catchment has the least agricultural land expansion may significantly enhance food security in the basin and the nation as a whole if there is adequate water to meet crop water needs 4 4 sub catchments water demand the weap model predicted the sub catchment under the reference and the socioeconomic scenarios groundwater based irrigation is currently practiced under a small scale which is considered under the reference scenario in the basin the domestic demand was considered with the industrial water demand because the basin has a small industry as such minimal industrial water demand which is approximately 0 52 because agricultural demand fluctuates throughout the year water demand fluctuates with the seasons resulting in seasonal fluctuation fig 9 shows the water demand projections for the wvrb of ghana the reference scenario is based on the population growth rates of the 2010 census the total water under the reference bau is 2 39 109 m3 by 2020 and 2 42 109 m3 by 2030 2 59 109 m3 by 2050 and 2 867 109 m3 by 2070 the highest domestic water demand under ssp5 is due to its high technological development and improved living conditions hence the need for higher water demand domestic water demand will increase steadily under all the scenarios from 2020 to 2070 under the reference scenario the total domestic will be 102 106 m3 by 2040 1 303 108 m3 by 2050 and 2 093 108 m3 by 2070 the lowest domestic water demand will be experienced under ssp3 due to medium urbanization high population growth rate and water demand the demand under this scenario will be 1 402 108 m3 by 2070 ssp5 will have total basin domestic water demand of 1 923 108 m3 by 2030 2 173 108 m3 by 2050 and 2 265 108 m3 by 2070 gross domestic water demand by the end of 2070 will be 7 523 108 m3 1081 106 m3 610 75 106 m3 and 1235 13 106 m3 for the reference bau ssp2 3 and 5 respectively agriculture water demand in the basin will also be 13 83 109 m3 15 08 109 m3 14 38 109 m3 and 15 56 109 m3 for the reference bau ssp2 ssp3 and ssp5 respectively by 2070 the gambaga sub catchment has a total domestic demand of 2 9 108 m3 by 2070 under the reference 3 1 108 m3 2 8 108 m3 and 3 2 108 m3 for the ssp2 3 and 5 respectively the sub catchment with the highest water demand is the nasia due to its large agricultural irrigable land with water demand of 6 3 108 m3 6 7 108 m3 6 3 108 m3 and 6 8 108 m3 by 2070 under bau ssp2 3 and 5 respectively the mole is the basin with the least water demand though approximately the size of the nasia as shown in table a4 due to its low potential for dry season groundwater irrigation the mole sub catchment under the reference scenario will have a water demand of 0 87 108 m3 0 97 108 m3 and 1 38 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively under ssp5 the basin will have a water demand of 1 00 108 m3 1 09 108 m3 and 1 47 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively fig 10 4 5 sub catchments unmet water demand climate and socioeconomic scenarios are used to predict the water supply and demand difference umd for each sub catchment fig 10 the unmet water demand is very low under the reference bau scenario with 4 40 108 m3 4 10 108 m3 and 4 60 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively for the various climatic scenarios it was revealed that ssp2 and ssp3 had relatively high umds high population growth in these pathways the total highest unmet water demand is seen in ssp2 rcp8 5 followed by ssp3 rcp8 5 under the ssp2 rcp4 5 scenario the unmet demand will be 4 8 108 m3 6 5 108 m3 and 8 3 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively the combined socioeconomic and climate change induce a high unmet water demand in four catchments of the basin under all nine 9 scenarios among the four 4 catchments with unmet water demand the nasia sub catchment was identified as the most water stressed followed by nabogo and kpasenkpe as the intermediate and least water stressed catchments respectively the nasia sub catchment under the ssp2 rcp4 5 will have an unmet water demand of 2 640 108 m3 3 168 108 m3 and 3 778 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively besides under the ssp3 rcp8 5 the nasia sub catchment is projected to have 2 636 108 m3 2 874 108 m3 3 268 108 m3 and 3 191 108 m3 by 2030 2050 2060 and 2070 respectively the kpasenkpe sub catchment being the least water deficient under ssp2 rcp4 5 is projected to have 0 22 108 m3 0 88 108 m3 and 1 25 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively and 0 173 108 m3 0 45 108 m3 1 126 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively under ssp5 rcp8 5 in contrast it also discovered that five 5 sub catchments will be water surplus and include the sissilli kulpawn mole lower white volta lwv and the middle white volta mwv sub catchments fig 11 a study of umds in the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors in these three catchments revealed that agricultural has the greatest umd and these areas will experience umds to varying degrees it is generally expected that umds will increase over the various scenarios but would be higher in nasia and the nabogo sub catchments the impact of large suitable agricultural land in nasia and nabogo culminated the increasing unmet water demand these data support the claim made by dovie and kasei 2018 that the kpasenkpe nabogo and nasia sub catchments will experience enhanced dryness by 2050 resulting in a water shortage this shows that future development strategies should prioritize the two catchments since their unmet water demand is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate affecting about 0 4 million people focusing on the domestic and industrial umds fig 8 nasia is an excellent example of this trend groundwater resources are being stressed as a consequence of the significant effects of climate change and related socioeconomic variables such as changing consumption patterns aslam et al 2018a 2018b 2018c green et al 2011 4 6 factors influencing unmet water demand the total unmet water demand uwd which is calculated as the total water variation in m3 for every catchment is used to evaluate the anticipated consequences of climate change on water supply and demand this research examines how the uwd evolves in response to numerous climatic variables which impact not just the basin s groundwater supply but also water demands most prominently agricultural water demands this happens as a dry season phenomenon when groundwater storage falls below demand in some selected catchments as a consequence climatic conditions are more critical during the dry season than during the rainy season notably this part concentrated only on the sub catchments of nasia nabogo gambaga and the kpasenkpe all of which are expected to face significant water shortages the scenario with the greatest uwd in the nasia sub catchment fig 11 is ssp2 rcp4 5 for 2040 2050 and 2070 at 3 53 108 m3 3 16 108 m3 and 3 77 108 m3 respectively under this scenario the sub catchments agricultural uwd is roughly 95 9 by 2070 it is worth noting however that this is aided by the abundance of agricultural land and the limited groundwater storage capacity in the same situation in comparison uwd is discernible in the nabogo sub catchment between ssp5 and ssp2 rcp4 5 while uwd is high in 2030 2050 and 2060 with ssp5 it is also high in 2040 and 2070 under ssp2 rcp4 5 at 1 79 108 m3 agricultural uwd is likewise around 95 8 by 2070 gw storage is lowest during peak demand months april and may and is greatest during low demand seasons october december when groundwater irrigation has not yet begun in the gambaga and kpasenkpe sub catchments the rainy or dry season phenomenon has little effect on gw flow thus umds in these catchments will be influenced more by non climatic variables such as population and agricultural expansion since their changes follow a similar trend to the population with ssp2 rcp4 5 having the greatest value fig 8 according to obuobie et al 2012a 2012b the amount of groundwater recharge in the wvrb is sufficient to ensure irrigation during the dry season however they did not include climate change scenarios or shared socioeconomic pathways ssps in their analysis as the increasingly complicated dynamics of land management could result in a significant change in water demand notably gambaga and kpasenkpe get roughly 600 700 mm and 150 200 mm of precipitation annually respectively zhou et al 2019 reiterated land atmosphere coupling is prevalent globally and diminishing streamflow as a result of unusually low precipitation might result in a temperature rise and decreased groundwater flow and storage because all umds are increasingly akin to irrigation they will decrease in situations with increased emissions fig 12 population growth will be greatest in ssp3 catchments increasing water needs however this escalation in water demand will be met through enhanced groundwater storage and decreased agricultural activity in sub catchments such as the kulpawn lwv mole mwv and sisilli demonstrating umds are strongly influenced by climatic variables specifically precipitation precipitation would increase the frequency of rainy days so affecting evapotranspiration hence rising temperatures would result in decreased streamflow obuobie et al 2012a 2012b showed significant seasonal variability in groundwater levels in the basin which they hypothesized was due to variability in evapotranspiration within the basin and thus it was claimed that socioeconomic changes constituted a greater danger to groundwater sustainability than climatic change august had the largest monthly rainfall in the basin while september november had the highest groundwater storage in spite of the fact that the rainy season starts in may june groundwater levels don t rise until july august when about 40 of the year s rainfall has happened obuobie et al 2012a 2012b from the line graphs in fig 12 the two to four month january may latency between the start of the rainy season and the commencement of groundwater level increase may be thought of as a time of soil replenishment caused by the moisture deficit left by the previous dry season for the sub catchments with unmet water demand gambaga kpasenkpe nabogo and nasia the lag indicates that threshold effects exist and that the link between precipitation and gw storage is not linear for these sub catchments furthermore the lag indicates that the majority of wells recharge slowly as a consequence of the aforementioned findings it can be inferred that the reactions of each of the water scarce sub catchments to climate change are distinct in nasia the annual umd will be impacted heavily by socioeconomic variables and climatic change but in nabogo it will be driven more by socioeconomic development this indicates that any framework relating to the development and management of groundwater resources in the area should take climate change and socioeconomic growth into account 5 conclusions groundwater demand and availability were evaluated under the influence of climate change socioeconomic pathways and their combined scenarios within the wvrb of ghana and identified vulnerable catchments an ensemble of fifteen 15 cmip5 general circulation models gcms from the princeton observation dataset under the emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were bias corrected using quantile empirical mapping approach due to its capability of correction of the downscaled variable s statistical distribution over the entire statistical distribution future climatic socioeconomic and various combinations were generated including those with low to moderate emissions and low to moderate scenarios ssp2 rcp4 5 and those with high emissions and severe scenarios ssp3 rcp8 5 ssp5 rcp8 5 the experimental parameterized soil moisture model for the rainfall runoff processes within the weap model was used to evaluate the current and predict the future groundwater demand using nine scenarios resulting in the identification of four sub catchments gambaga kpasenkpe nabogo and nasia as water deficit due to large arable land and population density the kulpawn lwv mole mwv and the sisilli do not show current and future unmet groundwater demand domestic water supply and irrigation activities are threatened by rising demands during relatively dry years of precipitation nonetheless this multi scenario approach e g moderate to high scenarios might provide policymakers with a wider perspective when formulating adaptation measures to enhance living standards and reduce poverty through groundwater irrigated agriculture in the basin since the wvb accounts for approximately 20 of ghana s entire landmass although the findings of the groundwater flow and recharge might be analyzed using a variety of physical hydrological models e g modflow swat the calibration and validation results demonstrate that the present modeling technique is capable of accurately projecting future groundwater demand the research demonstrates a correlation between climatic change socioeconomic expansion and groundwater supply in the wvb the primary issue is identifying sub catchments with severe water shortage the research may help establish future water policies that take into consideration needs of different sectors levels of water scarcity and regional climatic and socioeconomic changes this is because the expected low flows and storage caused by insufficient rainfall may be exacerbated by natural and human factors such as population expansion changes in land use and cover and increased water demand in the future it will be required to survey and analyze groundwater resources as well as invest in enhancing the resilience of this critical resource in ghana s white volta river basin credit authorship contribution statement jacob kofi mensah

8003,study region white volta river basin ghana study focus groundwater sustainability is becoming a major concern in the face of population growth land use land cover lulc and climate changes the water evaluation and planning weap model is used in this study to analyse the current and future groundwater demands for the period of 2015 2070 two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios from statistically downscaled fifteen cmip5 models were combined three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps 2 3 and 5 scenarios in the nine sub catchments of the white volta river basin new hydrological insights for the study region the weap model was calibrated 2006 2012 and validated 2013 2020 using streamflow data from six gauges in five sub catchments the findings show that climatic change and socio economic development will result in a disparity between groundwater supply and demand in sub catchments with greater socioeconomic growth especially those with higher population density and arable agricultural land among the basin s nine sub catchments four will experience water scarcity under all future scenarios while the groundwater flow and recharge data may be evaluated using several physical hydrological models the calibration and validation results suggest that the current modeling approach is capable of reliably predicting future groundwater demand with associated uncertainties the study establishes a link between climate change socio economic growth and groundwater availability in the white volta river basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords water evaluation and planning climate change shared socioeconomic pathway statistical downscaling groundwater modeling white volta river basin 1 introduction freshwater significance is intensifying owing to the world s population growth and the associated rise in the demand for the resource globally despite the increasing demand there is an uneven and limited distribution of the quantity of available freshwater on earth it is estimated that the rising population growth industrial development climate change and upscaling agriculture through irrigation in the next decades will culminate in the demand for water resources to levels weighty for the provision of adequate supplies for human survival because of data paucity and insufficient commitment climate change effects on groundwater resources are now beginning to be understood throughout the world aslam et al 2018a 2018b 2018c kahsay et al 2018 nkhonjera and dinka 2017 water supply in the white volta basin has come from major sources which include surface water and groundwater adam and appiah adjei 2019 nonetheless owing to great geographical and temporal variability connected to rainfall in the basin surface water sources are vulnerable to large evaporative losses rendering them unpredictable readily contaminated by sediments insufficient and hence unable to fulfill the increasing demand needs anim gyampo et al 2019a 2019b dzikunoo et al 2019 obuobie et al 2012a 2012b groundwater supplies in the white volta river basin wvrb are best suited to supply the scattered demand of the rising rural population which now accounts for a bigger share of the overall population since its utilization is critical for socio economic transformation groundwater is mostly used for household drinking water supplies small scale agricultural irrigation and the watering of livestock adam and appiah adjei 2019 approximately 80 of the people in the basin urban and rural population depends on groundwater for their primary use also 60 of the population uses irrigated agriculture in the basin which has the potential to expand productivity though the characteristics of the basin physically are appropriate for irrigated and mechanized agriculture these systems are undertaken in some small locations akpoti et al 2022 dovie and kasei 2018 an increasing population rapid urbanization and agricultural expansion have produced a supply demand gap resulting in high consumption and low availability unmet demand unmet demands are associated with water related diseases in the basin since the people sometimes resort to unsafe sources untreated water from open reservoirs for their source of domestic water needs agricultural practices in the wvrb have often relied on rain fed as well as surface and shallow wells for dry season irrigation nonetheless to ensure food security and in meeting the sustainable development goals sdg 1 and 2 a transition to groundwater based irrigation is essential groundwater use in the basin has seen a substantial increase over the past three decades due to borehole drilling and mechanization of small towns rural water supply systems and rural areas using the resource for domestic water supply obuobie et al 2012a 2012b also the adoption of dry season irrigation farming by primarily the youth as a means to improve their livelihoods has led to increasing pressure on the resource in most communities especially the basin s northeastern section it is critical that practitioners and policymakers have a better understanding of projected quantities of groundwater resource from drivers of population growth socio economic scenarios expansion in irrigated agriculture climate change and land use change which leads to an increase in the exploitation of groundwater resource for domestic use at a lower cost and with greater flexibility gorelick and zheng 2015 the white volta basin s relatively low irrigation delivery 6 3 of farmed land underscores the basin s essential features and the subsistence nature of farming fao 2008 the intensification of agricultural schemes that are to help meet the difficulties of satisfying the growing population s livelihood needs and food security are to be done with principles of sustainability and resilience wiggins and lankford 2019 environmentally and socially sustainable agriculture is a critical issue in resolving the challenges of a transition from subsistence farming to a more intensive groundwater based irrigation so as to address the needs of the rapid population increase economic growth and climate change adaptation for the basin s wvrb agriculture to become more climate resilient and less susceptible to variations in rainfall and temperature groundwater based irrigated agriculture is critical in fulfilling the needs of the population and the country at large wiggins and lankford 2019 however the inability to efficiently model the projected demand base on the aforementioned socioeconomic scenarios and climate change will lead to groundwater resources over use which will also negatively impact the availability of drinking water by maintaining a climate resilient availability of water sustainable groundwater management helps to achieve the sdgs on poverty reduction food security access to water and urban growth hence the effective development of groundwater to augment resource consumption in any catchment requires assessment of demand and abstraction a few investigations have revealed a lack of policy on sustainable groundwater management in the white volta river basin of ghana bessah et al 2020 carrier et al 2008 ofosu 2012 from a demand side management perspective information on consumption and management of household water usage viewpoints is significant besides such data would be critical for proactive resource management and sustainability in recent years the water evaluation and planning weap sieber 2006 modeling techniques for water resources management has become widespread alamanos et al 2020 amin et al 2018 dovie and kasei 2018 haro monteagudo et al 2020 mehboob and kim 2021 ougougdal et al 2020 the weap model has been prevalent for water demand evaluation amongst the prevailing models attributable to its combination capability of significant developments impacting the biogenic and anthropogenic systems of the resource management in a river basin singh 2018 the weap model takes into account all water sources for environmental sustainability in a basin under study including water demand planning and management several authors have used it to estimate water supply and demand for various basins across the globe to simulate water allocation and demand for irrigation with shallow seasonal wells ssws and livestock dovie and kasei 2018 used the weap model in the wvb however the authors did not include climate change scenarios rcps and shared socioeconomic pathways ssps in their analysis of the various water allocations and groundwater recharge haro monteagudo et al 2020 investigated the influence of climate change on water supply and utilization using 21 global climate models gcms and two rcps of 4 5 and 8 5 with the weap model furthermore the authors observed that both climate change and socioeconomic development would increase water availability uncertainty the weap model was used by amin et al 2018 to predict potential water needs under various climate and socioeconomic scenarios using hadcm3 for cmip5 dau et al 2021 deployed the weap to evaluate possible water availability in the huon basin in vietnam under the impact of population growth and climate change using the weap model ougougdal et al 2020 assess the influence of climate change and socioeconomic activity on water availability and demand under a2 and b2 emission scenarios alamanos et al 2020 assessed urban water demand assessment for sustainable water resources management under climate change and socioeconomic changes in greece using the weap however all these studies failed to incorporate shared socioeconomic pathways ssps except the study of mehboob and kim 2021 in the upper indus basin of pakistan besides all these studies were also directed towards surface water which is also very susceptible to the influences of climate change socioeconomic growth along with climatic change have combined to create a scenario in which demand exceeds supply at the beginning of the century for an enhanced understanding of past and future groundwater demands in ghana s white volta river basin comprising approximately 92 of the country s northern part several climate and socioeconomic pathways must be explored therefore this paper is intended to model current and future groundwater demand under shared socioeconomic scenarios and climate change in the white volta river basin of ghana using the weap 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the white volta river basin wvrb of ghana stretches out within latitudes 8 50 n and 11 05 n and longitudes 0 06 e and 2 50 w as its boundaries an area of approximately 49 000 km2 constitutes 20 of the total landmass of ghana and 44 of the coverage of the larger volta river basin barry

catchments made up of gambaga kpasenkpe kulpawn lower white volta middle white volta nabogo nasia and the sisilli as shown in fig 1 the 2010 population and housing census give a total of 2 4 million inhabitants with varying annual growth rates ranging from 2 6 in the northern and savannah regions to 2 1 in the country s upper west region ghana statistical service gss 2014 the current projected population for 2020 is 3 2 million people the settlement is mainly dispersed and rural the basin is characterized by relatively low altitudes on the north and east with few regions of high elevation its lowest elevation is about 8 m and it rises to slightly beyond 350 m wri 2003 the climate comes under the overlap of two air masses the tropical continental and tropical maritime which is the inter tropical convergent zone itcz dickson and benneh 1995 temperatures in the range of 18 c and 42 c with an approximate mean value of 30 c are prominent in the dry seasons except during the harmattan seasons november february at what time these can fall as low as 20 c or even lower thru the wet rainy season relative humidity ranges from 40 and 70 and declines to about 15 during the rest of the year carrier et al 2008 there is an upsurge in potential and actual evapotranspiration rates in the basin due to the observed low humidity and high temperatures obuobie et al 2012a 2012b potential evapotranspiration rates range between 650 mm year and 1300 mm year kwei 1997 nevertheless van der sommen and geirnaert 1998 projected rather extreme rates of evapotranspiration ranging between 1776 mm year and 2112 mm year the annual mean of rainfall values also ranges from between 800 mm year to 1140 mm year gyau boakye and tumbulto 2006 shahin 2013 however rainfall is unevenly distributed geographically and seasonally rainfall nevertheless is distributed unevenly across the country both spatially and seasonally worqlul et al 2019 the relative humidity means differs from 80 in september during the rainy season to 20 in january the monitoring of groundwater levels in the basin revealed increases and reductions in the water table which corresponded to the rainy and dry seasons

comprehensive approach for modeling water systems as well as policy alignment sieber and purkey 2015 it is used extensively in analyzing the allocation of water resources by determining the correlation associated with basin water supply and demand using the supply and demand balance theory weap analyses water resource allocation challenges using basic linear programming at each time step for integrated water resource planning yates et al 2005 in weap there are three regular scenario modeling efforts considered which are the model base year known as the current account the establishment from the current accounts generates a reference scenario to simulate without interventions the probable developments and what if scenarios crafted to change the reference scenario for the evaluation of the impacts of any alterations in demand policies climate change and or technologies to attain a reliable and efficient model for the water demands the 2000 2019 range of data was sought for in modeling the current accounts a range of options are evaluated by designing several scenarios and long term water requirements are forecast for the provision of limited resources the weap software package was utilized to assess ghana s white volta river basin s long term groundwater demand and long term water resource management the following phases are typically included in the weap applications the problem s definition which comprises the time period the geographic boundary the system s components and the system s configuration the introduction of current accounts which offers a picture of the system s actual water demand and availability the construction of scenarios founded on distinctive sets of long term trends hinged on policies developments in the basin and other variables that impact on the hydrology and the scenarios evaluation with respect to standards of water resources adequacies costs benefits and the impacts of the environment there are two primary functions associated with the weap model the modeling of natural hydrological processes makes it easier to assess the amount of water available in a basin and the allocation of water resources stimulated by the modeling of anthropogenic activities for an effective assessment of domestic water use modeling the water demand for a basin assists to evaluate multiple scenarios for water resource management to address and control the various challenges in demand associated with the present and long time periods in this paper the weap an integrated water resource management model is used to illustrate present circumstances including water needs hydrology climate and policy the long term forecast data incorporates climatic change precipitation temperature humidity and evapotranspiration water needs regulatory considerations priority of water users and social factors population growth rates alternative policies for adaptation are built as scenarios of the water quantity available is

hydrology of the basin i e deep percolation evapotranspiration surface runoff and basin or sub basin interflow fig 2 3 2 water demand estimation 3 2 1 domestic and industrial water demand the estimation of the domestic demand involved the per capita water consumption in the sub basins by administering a household survey questionnaire three 3 towns communities were selected from each sub basin for this survey based on population and water supply schemes three 3 sections were captured in the survey questionnaire and were captioned as personal information of the respondent household characteristics and existing sources usage and water management from the 500 samples 28 were removed owing to lack of information leaving 472 for analysis the analysis of the data was carried out both quantitatively and qualitatively using microsoft excel minitab version 19 various statistical analyses such as descriptive statistics analysis of variance and correlation were performed on the data in order to extract all relevant data for further analysis 3 2 2 water source and consumption pattern 92 of the households 434 n 472 have reliable water sources either from a public stand post 48 or house connection 44 only 5 24 n 372 rely on the water supplied from dams as the main water source a household s daily water use ranged from 236 l to 1467 l around 56 264 n 472 of households use less than 60 l each day whereas 44 use 1000 l or more 20 94 n 472 of homes use less than 500 l each day the per capita water usage ranged from 50 to 100 l day it was also discovered in some households that a person consumes less than 50 l per day which is who s recommended minimum water consumption per capita cwsa 2010 un 2012 in 56 of the households analyzed each person consumes approximately 100 l day and 15 consumes approximately 120 l day or less only three of the investigated households utilize 200 l day per person one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate for statistically significant variance across the chosen communities in terms of overall water use and per capita consumption average daily household water use f 4 381 0 877 p 0 490 and per capita consumption f 4 381 0 061 p 0 980 showed no statistically significant differences thus it is possible to prove that daily average water uses and consumption per capita are not statistically different thus water supply in the basin has no major impact on household water usage and average per capita consumption is estimated at 50 l day and expected to rise to 120 l day by 2050 due to urbanization and climate change okyereh et al 2019 the population for the various sub basins and their per capita water consumption used for the weap model is as shown in table a1 3 3 irrigation and livestock agricultural water demands 3 3 1 irrigation water demand the abstraction of groundwater currently is exclusively for household and livestock watering except in the atankwidi sub basin within the kpasenkpe sub catchment where shallow wells are used for dry season irrigation of vegetables anim gyampo et al 2019a 2019b all standpipes of community water supply systems and boreholes in the basin are constructed with troughs 10 m further apart with soak away where livestock feed with water spilled from these systems small and large reservoirs and streams also serve as main sources of water for livestock these water sources also run dry during the dry season due to extreme climate conditions in the basin so they depend on the spills for their water supply the livestock rearing activities in the basin will be upscaled since the people are engaged in animal rearing for the estimation of long term water demand therefore livestock water demand shall be separated from agricultural irrigation water demand to estimate for the modeling crops that are cultivated mainly under irrigation from shallow wells include rice pepper tomato and other vegetables thus to compute the required quantity of water needed climate data from the stations fig 1 were used for the crop water requirement estimations the penman monteith method eqs 1 and 2 allen et al 1998 was employed to determine the reference

2012 found kc values of 0 62 1 61 1 23 and 0 92 for the initial developing mid season and late season stages 3 4 land suitability for groundwater irrigation to develop the groundwater based irrigation potential for the wvrb four parameters dem lulc soil map and slope maps were employed the basins land use map was overlaid on the land suitability map for irrigation in the arcgis environment for the determination of potentially irrigable land performing a weighted overlay operation in an arcgis using the suitable sites for irrigation and land use maps as inputs resulted in the identification of sites that could be brought under irrigated agriculture groundwater for all the sub basins in the wvrb ghansah et al 2018 the land suitability map for irrigation and the land use map for each sub basin were first reclassified the reclassified maps were then weighted and then combined using the raster calculator in arcgis which provided good results of available suitable land for crop cultivation per sub basin fig 3 is a flow chart of the procedure used to estimate and map out the irrigation potential the available sites suitable for irrigation maps represent the potential sites that can be brought under groundwater based irrigated agriculture table a4 shows the potential land for irrigation for the various sub catchments in the white volta river basin 3 4 1 groundwater potential for irrigation two variables were used to assess the appropriateness of groundwater depth to groundwater table and aquifer productivity the withdrawal cost is determined by the depth to groundwater table amjath babu et al 2016 while groundwater production is a significant component in assessing groundwater suitability akpoti et al 2022 for the white volta basin spatiotemporal predictions of groundwater depth were acquired from fan et al 2013 borehole data on yields of borehole in l s and groundwater depth in m from the groundwater database of the british geological survey bgs macdonald et al 2012 was extracted from the national borehole database of 2018 and the aquifer productivity calculated through the inverse distance weighted approach in arcgis geospatial analyst tool these data were used for the identification of potentially suitable lands in the sub basins to be irrigated by groundwater using water lifting technologies that included diesel or solar powered pumps assefa et al 2018 martin and van de giesen 2005 ofosu 2012 the estimated groundwater depth in ghana averages between 14 and 50 m maximum from the surface and aquifer productivity ranges between 0 1 and 20 l s of borehole potential yield most parts of the basin have potential aquifer yields ranging from 1 and 5 l s a superimposition was carried out of the most suitable land for crop cultivation over the aquifer productivity and the groundwater depth map to determine the potential of groundwater for irrigation the suitable land has groundwater ranging between 1 and 50 m and an average depth of 12 m borehole yields vary from 0 6 to 1 7 m3 h in the sub catchments 3 4 2 livestock water demand the main livestock activities in the basin include cattle goat sheep and poultry chicken and guinea fowl the growth rate and per capita water demand of the main livestock are as shown in table a5 the population projection and forecasting were calculated using the geometric increase formula method recommended by the fao as shown in eq 1 the choice of this method is due to the young and rapid development or growth of livestock activities in the basin that notwithstanding the agro ecology climatic conditions and availability of land are suitable for upscaling livestock farming in the basin 6 p n p o 1 r n 7 r r 1 r 2 r 3 r n t where pn is the projected population po is the known population r is the assumed growth rate and n is number of years 3 5 weap model setup weap layout area described as schematic employs an interface of geographic information system gis the process began with the digitization of the nine sub catchments as vector files incorporating the rivers and streams in the basin to create the backdrop they were imported as vector layers in weap fig 4 shows the complete flowchart and data inputs for developing the weap model the rivers groundwater sources gauging stations demand nodes transmission and return flow links were later created for each of the catchments fig 5 the model was developed for the white volta river basin of ghana and encapsulates the following the main white volta river basin and nine streams and their tributaries gambaga

with pest the weap model was calibrated and validated using hydrological streamflow data from the wvb s various gauges data from 2006 to 2012 was utilized for calibration whereas data from 2014 to 2019 was used for validation fig 6 the model s integrated parameter estimation tool pest https pesthomepage org was used crop coefficient kc soil water capacity sw root zone conductivity ks runoff resistance factor rrf and preferred flow direction f of the land cover types based on the location of the sub basins were used as key hydrology assumptions and their respected values selected from the soil water assessment swat and fao database to simulate streamflow in the weap model 3 7 scenario development 3 7 1 bias correction of future precipitation and temperature data from cmip5 models due to the differences between climate simulations from the gcm rcms and the observed data bias correction methods are applied before results can be used for impact studies siabi et al 2021 yeboah et al 2021 in this paper quantile empirical mapping approach was considered the approach is used to correct the distribution function of rcm simulated climate values to closely mimic the observed distribution function andrade et al 2021 tian et al 2020 this can be done by creating a transfer function to shift the occurrence distributions of precipitation and temperature piani et al 2010 the gamma distribution thom 1958 with shape parameter α and scale parameter β eq 8 is often assumed to be suitable for distributions of precipitation events and has proven to be the effective for the analysis of precipitation data 8 f γ x α β x α 1 1 β α γ α e x β x 0 α β 0 where γ is the gamma function and α and β are the form and scale parameters respectively for temperature time series the gaussian distribution with location parameter µ and scale parameter σ eq 9 is usually assumed to fit best lima et al 2021 9 f n x μ σ 2 x α 1 1 σ 2 π e x μ 2 2 σ 2 χ ℜ where the scale parameter σ determines the standard deviation and the location parameter µ directly controls the mean and therefore the location of the distribution detailed information about the gamma and gaussian distribution

models gcms see table 3 data at available at http ccafs climate org navarro racines et al 2020 were used as inputs for the weap model the selection of the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 is based on the length of the study period rcp4 5 is a stabilization scenario based on its own reference or no climate policy scenario whereas rcp8 5 is a baseline or high emission scenario that does not contain any climate mitigation objective the rcp4 5 scenario predicts a pathway stabilization by 2100 not exceeding 4 5 w m2 650 ppm co2 while the rcp8 5 lends to intensifying radiative pathway clarke et al 2007 the rcp8 5 scenario corresponded to the rising radiative forcing pathway heading towards 8 5 w m2 1370 ppm co2 by 2100 riahi et al 2007 the rcp8 5 scenario relates to business as usual bau not linked to any climate policies and high greenhouse gases emissions 3 7 3 socioeconomic scenario population and living standards as well as agriculture could rise as a result of socio economic variations hence domestic water demand will predictably rise as the world s population grows and this trend will quicken as with a corresponding increase in urbanization the model implementation adopted the socio economic changes based on a selection of shared socioeconomic pathways ssps o neill et al 2017 ssp2 middle of the road ssp3 fragmentation and ssp5 conventional development were specifically selected to represent conditions in the wvrb jones and o neill 2016 the continuation of socio economic developments is represented in ssp2 with reducing resource utilization and increasing energy intensity in ssp3 mitigation and adaptation to climate change are difficult due to extreme poverty and a rapidly growing population environmental degradation is severe and the energy industry is undergoing a slow technological transformation as a result of a lack of regional cooperation and an enhancement in local energy resources usage momblanch et al 2019 robust economic growth makes it easy to adapt in ssp5 but the impacts of climate change are difficult to mitigate because of the domination of the use of fossil fuels in the energy sector technological progress in the agricultural sector and agro ecosystems are strong and highly managed management of land use is resource intensive including water systems management a framework consistent with rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios were chosen using these ssps to compensate for the many uncertainties related to the potential growth of economic and social trends a combination of probable prospects is explored and covers low to medium challenges for climate change adaptation and low to high challenges for mitigation in this scenario o neill et al 2014 the ssps do not incorporate any climate policies and all assume the business as usual bau ghg emission scenario kriegler et al 2012 as shown table sm1 scenario matrix of ssps and rcps the emission scenarios utilized in ssp1 5 generally correlate to rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 the exclusion of ssp1 sustainability and ssp4 inequality is due to their relevance to extreme climate change scenarios and not representative at the catchment scale respectively hanasaki et al 2013 ssps are modeled in weap by modifying significant factors that characterize water demand like high population growth hpg rate medium population growth mpg rate low population growth lpg rate and the higher living standards hls based on rapid urbanization in the basin which will culminate into an increase in per capita water demand table 4 national data on population and population growth rates evolution per ssp were acquired from the iiasa database table sm2 riahi et al 2007 ssp s global model findings for municipal water demand are used to estimate per capita water consumption hanasaki et al 2013 the weap variables are evaluated in light of changes in social and economic conditions table sm2 3 7 4 scenario analysis the study developed nine 9 scenarios table 4 with the integration of climate change scenarios rcps and the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps scenarios population and water consumption pathways to estimate potential water demands with the model the consistency of the rcps and ssps as well as the matrix were used to pair them table sm1 ssp3 and ssp5 scenarios envision a future dependent on fossil fuels they were matched with a higher emission scenario like rcp8 5 while ssp2 is paired with the middle of the road emission scenario thus rcp4 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation results the evaluation of the performance of the modeled streamflow was carried out using observed streamflow data from daboya and nawuni on the middle white volta mwv sub catchment yapei on the lower white volta lwv sub catchmment nasia on the nasia sub catchment nabogo on the nabogo sub catchment and the pwalugu on the kpasenkpe sub catchment as compared to modeled streamflow values from 2006 to 2019 the assessment of the accuracy of the calibration was carried out using visual hydrographs comparisons whiles statistical calibration measurements included the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and the root mean square error rmse which quantifies the agreement among both observed and simulated streamflow r2 has a number from 0 to 1 with a greater number implying reduced standard deviation the closer the value is to one the better the model s performance and the lower the error variance liew et al 2003 santhi et al 2001 nse values vary from to 1 with 1 being the best value nash and sutcliffe 1970 pbias levels of 25 should be considered acceptable however 0 is the best pbias value vrugt et al 2003 the coefficient of determination table 2 varied between 0 69 and 0 99 averaging 0 89 whereas the nash sutcliffe parameter varied between 0 63 and 0 99 averaging 0 88 nash sutcliffe efficiency index values vary between and 1 a perfect match between expected and observed discharge values amounts to an efficiency of 1 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the weap model accurately predicts the hydrology of the wvrb based on the values of these parameters this ensures that future streamflow predictions can be made based on future scenarios 4 2 climate change and groundwater flow and storage streamflow s are substantially hindered in the dry months of november to april which is interrelated to groundwater flow correlating with a high demand for water to fulfill agriculture demands groundwater recharge are between june and september and start to decline from october to april the following year depicting the rainfall pattern in all the sub basins under the reference scenario fig 7 the mole sub catchment has the highest average flow to gw of 1 36 108 m3 in october followed by the kulpawn sub catchment with an average flow of 1 14 108 m3 in september this can be attributed to the landcover of these basins being dominant in forest cover the mole game reserve stretches along these two sub catchment hence low evaporative losses the lowest flow to gw is experienced in the nabogo sub catchment with 0 53 108 m3 in march which is also the peak of the dry season it is noticed that all the catchments have their lowest flow in march annual total flow to gw is highest for the mole catchment in 2070 at 7 798 108 m3 nonetheless for the kulpawn sub catchment the same year will be lowest at 1 649 108 m3 the nabogo highest flow is in the 2040 s at 1 774 108 m3 under the rcp4 5 scenario flow to gw rises between june to september and starts to decline from october to march in all the sub catchments the highest under the rcp4 5 is the kulpawn sub catchment with 1 27 108 m3 in september and the lowest is the nabogo catchment in march at 0 32 106 m3 followed by the gambaga with 0 46 106 m3 annual gw flow for the gambaga sub catchment will be highest in 2050 with 1 797 108 m3 the gambaga sub catchment will experience its highest flow under the rcp4 5 scenario in 2050 with 3 87 108 m3 and the lowest in 2020 under the same scenario meanwhile surface runoff in 2050 will be highest in the same catchment in 2050 at 8 69 108 m3 suggesting a strong correlation between surface runoff and gw flow for rcp 8 5 the gambaga kpasenkpe and the nabogo sub catchments fig 7 the disparity between recharge and discharge supply during periods ranging from days to years is known as groundwater storage sieber 2006 changes in groundwater and surface water levels may influence the interconnection between them as well as the correlation between environmental and domestic water supply and demand hanson et al 2012 it is also influenced by the aquifer s inherent features storage capacity transmission capacity which are determined by its size and type climate change has an impact on storage contingent on whether the groundwater is renewable or not or if it is a fossil resource precipitation and temperature are the two major variables that affect surface runoff and evapotranspiration in any basin and both variations have an impact on gw storage akpoti et al 2016 obahoundje et al 2017 to ascertain gw storage fluctuations in response to changes in both variables climate change rcp scenarios an analysis of the storage in each of the sub catchments to reveal its sensitivity to supply was carried out the hydrologic evaluation placed a premium on the quantity of water available in each catchment in the white volta basin the related demand from different stakeholders and the magnitude of climate change s effects the rainfall groundwater recharge correlation in the basin is documented by for example martin and van de giesen 2005 who predicted recharge to be 5 of rainfall throughout the white volta river basin the gambaga kpasenkpe nabogo and nasia sub catchments will experience gw storage shortages from march to may under all the scenarios fig 8 aridity has been shown to have an influence on groundwater in terms of lower recharge particularly for subsurface storage systems that exchange heat directly with the soil surface aslam et al 2018a 2018b 2018c kløve et al 2014 4 3 socioeconomic scenario population which is a significant element in determining water demand is predicted to vary consistently throughout all sub catchments according to the ssps from the iiasa database fig 9 the ssp3 scenario is predicted to have the largest population growth of the three shared socioeconomic pathways with growth continuing in all catchments until 2070 in all the three socioeconomic scenarios ssp2 ssp3 and ssp5 the population would continue to increase steadily at a lower growth rate up to 2070 for all catchments the highest population was predicted in kulpawn sub catchment followed by gambaga kpasenkpe nasia nabogo middle white volta mwv mole sissilli and lower white volta lwv sub catchments respectively however in terms of population density the highest is predicted in gambaga sub catchment followed by kpasenkpe nasia kulpawn and the nabogo the mole and sissilli sub catchments have almost the same population density and the lowest is the lwv the annual domestic per capita water withdrawal for the basin under the reference scenario is approximately 22 m3 cwsa 2010 this demand is projected to rise to 45 m3 and 59 m3 annual per capita under ssp2 and ssp5 respectively due to urbanization and technological advancement nonetheless ssp3 is expected to have the same annual per capita water demand as the reference scenario in all the catchments also due to low urbanization hanasaki et al 2013 industrial water withdrawals in the basin are negligible in comparison to household and agricultural water withdrawals fao 2011 agricultural expansion is required to feed an ever increasing population hence sustainable groundwater resource management is critical for food security various fruit crops vegetables and cereals are cultivated in two cropping seasons in the wvrb rain fed agricultural june october and dry season groundwater based irrigation december may the total cultivable area in the nine sub catchments is 1692 42 km2 but under ssp5 this area will expand to 1866 86 km2 increasing agricultural water demand from table a 4 the nasia sub catchment has the most tillable agricultural land followed by mwv kulpawn and nabogo while the mole sub catchment has the least agricultural land expansion may significantly enhance food security in the basin and the nation as a whole if there is adequate water to meet crop water needs 4 4 sub catchments water demand the weap model predicted the sub catchment under the reference and the socioeconomic scenarios groundwater based irrigation is currently practiced under a small scale which is considered under the reference scenario in the basin the domestic demand was considered with the industrial water demand because the basin has a small industry as such minimal industrial water demand which is approximately 0 52 because agricultural demand fluctuates throughout the year water demand fluctuates with the seasons resulting in seasonal fluctuation fig 9 shows the water demand projections for the wvrb of ghana the reference scenario is based on the population growth rates of the 2010 census the total water under the reference bau is 2 39 109 m3 by 2020 and 2 42 109 m3 by 2030 2 59 109 m3 by 2050 and 2 867 109 m3 by 2070 the highest domestic water demand under ssp5 is due to its high technological development and improved living conditions hence the need for higher water demand domestic water demand will increase steadily under all the scenarios from 2020 to 2070 under the reference scenario the total domestic will be 102 106 m3 by 2040 1 303 108 m3 by 2050 and 2 093 108 m3 by 2070 the lowest domestic water demand will be experienced under ssp3 due to medium urbanization high population growth rate and water demand the demand under this scenario will be 1 402 108 m3 by 2070 ssp5 will have total basin domestic water demand of 1 923 108 m3 by 2030 2 173 108 m3 by 2050 and 2 265 108 m3 by 2070 gross domestic water demand by the end of 2070 will be 7 523 108 m3 1081 106 m3 610 75 106 m3 and 1235 13 106 m3 for the reference bau ssp2 3 and 5 respectively agriculture water demand in the basin will also be 13 83 109 m3 15 08 109 m3 14 38 109 m3 and 15 56 109 m3 for the reference bau ssp2 ssp3 and ssp5 respectively by 2070 the gambaga sub catchment has a total domestic demand of 2 9 108 m3 by 2070 under the reference 3 1 108 m3 2 8 108 m3 and 3 2 108 m3 for the ssp2 3 and 5 respectively the sub catchment with the highest water demand is the nasia due to its large agricultural irrigable land with water demand of 6 3 108 m3 6 7 108 m3 6 3 108 m3 and 6 8 108 m3 by 2070 under bau ssp2 3 and 5 respectively the mole is the basin with the least water demand though approximately the size of the nasia as shown in table a4 due to its low potential for dry season groundwater irrigation the mole sub catchment under the reference scenario will have a water demand of 0 87 108 m3 0 97 108 m3 and 1 38 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively under ssp5 the basin will have a water demand of 1 00 108 m3 1 09 108 m3 and 1 47 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively fig 10 4 5 sub catchments unmet water demand climate and socioeconomic scenarios are used to predict the water supply and demand difference umd for each sub catchment fig 10 the unmet water demand is very low under the reference bau scenario with 4 40 108 m3 4 10 108 m3 and 4 60 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively for the various climatic scenarios it was revealed that ssp2 and ssp3 had relatively high umds high population growth in these pathways the total highest unmet water demand is seen in ssp2 rcp8 5 followed by ssp3 rcp8 5 under the ssp2 rcp4 5 scenario the unmet demand will be 4 8 108 m3 6 5 108 m3 and 8 3 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively the combined socioeconomic and climate change induce a high unmet water demand in four catchments of the basin under all nine 9 scenarios among the four 4 catchments with unmet water demand the nasia sub catchment was identified as the most water stressed followed by nabogo and kpasenkpe as the intermediate and least water stressed catchments respectively the nasia sub catchment under the ssp2 rcp4 5 will have an unmet water demand of 2 640 108 m3 3 168 108 m3 and 3 778 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively besides under the ssp3 rcp8 5 the nasia sub catchment is projected to have 2 636 108 m3 2 874 108 m3 3 268 108 m3 and 3 191 108 m3 by 2030 2050 2060 and 2070 respectively the kpasenkpe sub catchment being the least water deficient under ssp2 rcp4 5 is projected to have 0 22 108 m3 0 88 108 m3 and 1 25 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively and 0 173 108 m3 0 45 108 m3 1 126 108 m3 by 2030 2050 and 2070 respectively under ssp5 rcp8 5 in contrast it also discovered that five 5 sub catchments will be water surplus and include the sissilli kulpawn mole lower white volta lwv and the middle white volta mwv sub catchments fig 11 a study of umds in the domestic industrial and agricultural sectors in these three catchments revealed that agricultural has the greatest umd and these areas will experience umds to varying degrees it is generally expected that umds will increase over the various scenarios but would be higher in nasia and the nabogo sub catchments the impact of large suitable agricultural land in nasia and nabogo culminated the increasing unmet water demand these data support the claim made by dovie and kasei 2018 that the kpasenkpe nabogo and nasia sub catchments will experience enhanced dryness by 2050 resulting in a water shortage this shows that future development strategies should prioritize the two catchments since their unmet water demand is anticipated to grow at the fastest rate affecting about 0 4 million people focusing on the domestic and industrial umds fig 8 nasia is an excellent example of this trend groundwater resources are being stressed as a consequence of the significant effects of climate change and related socioeconomic variables such as changing consumption patterns aslam et al 2018a 2018b 2018c green et al 2011 4 6 factors influencing unmet water demand the total unmet water demand uwd which is calculated as the total water variation in m3 for every catchment is used to evaluate the anticipated consequences of climate change on water supply and demand this research examines how the uwd evolves in response to numerous climatic variables which impact not just the basin s groundwater supply but also water demands most prominently agricultural water demands this happens as a dry season phenomenon when groundwater storage falls below demand in some selected catchments as a consequence climatic conditions are more critical during the dry season than during the rainy season notably this part concentrated only on the sub catchments of nasia nabogo gambaga and the kpasenkpe all of which are expected to face significant water shortages the scenario with the greatest uwd in the nasia sub catchment fig 11 is ssp2 rcp4 5 for 2040 2050 and 2070 at 3 53 108 m3 3 16 108 m3 and 3 77 108 m3 respectively under this scenario the sub catchments agricultural uwd is roughly 95 9 by 2070 it is worth noting however that this is aided by the abundance of agricultural land and the limited groundwater storage capacity in the same situation in comparison uwd is discernible in the nabogo sub catchment between ssp5 and ssp2 rcp4 5 while uwd is high in 2030 2050 and 2060 with ssp5 it is also high in 2040 and 2070 under ssp2 rcp4 5 at 1 79 108 m3 agricultural uwd is likewise around 95 8 by 2070 gw storage is lowest during peak demand months april and may and is greatest during low demand seasons october december when groundwater irrigation has not yet begun in the gambaga and kpasenkpe sub catchments the rainy or dry season phenomenon has little effect on gw flow thus umds in these catchments will be influenced more by non climatic variables such as population and agricultural expansion since their changes follow a similar trend to the population with ssp2 rcp4 5 having the greatest value fig 8 according to obuobie et al 2012a 2012b the amount of groundwater recharge in the wvrb is sufficient to ensure irrigation during the dry season however they did not include climate change scenarios or shared socioeconomic pathways ssps in their analysis as the increasingly complicated dynamics of land management could result in a significant change in water demand notably gambaga and kpasenkpe get roughly 600 700 mm and 150 200 mm of precipitation annually respectively zhou et al 2019 reiterated land atmosphere coupling is prevalent globally and diminishing streamflow as a result of unusually low precipitation might result in a temperature rise and decreased groundwater flow and storage because all umds are increasingly akin to irrigation they will decrease in situations with increased emissions fig 12 population growth will be greatest in ssp3 catchments increasing water needs however this escalation in water demand will be met through enhanced groundwater storage and decreased agricultural activity in sub catchments such as the kulpawn lwv mole mwv and sisilli demonstrating umds are strongly influenced by climatic variables specifically precipitation precipitation would increase the frequency of rainy days so affecting evapotranspiration hence rising temperatures would result in decreased streamflow obuobie et al 2012a 2012b showed significant seasonal variability in groundwater levels in the basin which they hypothesized was due to variability in evapotranspiration within the basin and thus it was claimed that socioeconomic changes constituted a greater danger to groundwater sustainability than climatic change august had the largest monthly rainfall in the basin while september november had the highest groundwater storage in spite of the fact that the rainy season starts in may june groundwater levels don t rise until july august when about 40 of the year s rainfall has happened obuobie et al 2012a 2012b from the line graphs in fig 12 the two to four month january may latency between the start of the rainy season and the commencement of groundwater level increase may be thought of as a time of soil replenishment caused by the moisture deficit left by the previous dry season for the sub catchments with unmet water demand gambaga kpasenkpe nabogo and nasia the lag indicates that threshold effects exist and that the link between precipitation and gw storage is not linear for these sub catchments furthermore the lag indicates that the majority of wells recharge slowly as a consequence of the aforementioned findings it can be inferred that the reactions of each of the water scarce sub catchments to climate change are distinct in nasia the annual umd will be impacted heavily by socioeconomic variables and climatic change but in nabogo it will be driven more by socioeconomic development this indicates that any framework relating to the development and management of groundwater resources in the area should take climate change and socioeconomic growth into account 5 conclusions groundwater demand and availability were evaluated under the influence of climate change socioeconomic pathways and their combined scenarios within the wvrb of ghana and identified vulnerable catchments an ensemble of fifteen 15 cmip5 general circulation models gcms from the princeton observation dataset under the emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were bias corrected using quantile empirical mapping approach due to its capability of correction of the downscaled variable s statistical distribution over the entire statistical distribution future climatic socioeconomic and various combinations were generated including those with low to moderate emissions and low to moderate scenarios ssp2 rcp4 5 and those with high emissions and severe scenarios ssp3 rcp8 5 ssp5 rcp8 5 the experimental parameterized soil moisture model for the rainfall runoff processes within the weap model was used to evaluate the current and predict the future groundwater demand using nine scenarios resulting in the identification of four sub catchments gambaga kpasenkpe nabogo and nasia as water deficit due to large arable land and population density the kulpawn lwv mole mwv and the sisilli do not show current and future unmet groundwater demand domestic water supply and irrigation activities are threatened by rising demands during relatively dry years of precipitation nonetheless this multi scenario approach e g moderate to high scenarios might provide policymakers with a wider perspective when formulating adaptation measures to enhance living standards and reduce poverty through groundwater irrigated agriculture in the basin since the wvb accounts for approximately 20 of ghana s entire landmass although the findings of the groundwater flow and recharge might be analyzed using a variety of physical hydrological models e g modflow swat the calibration and validation results demonstrate that the present modeling technique is capable of accurately projecting future groundwater demand the research demonstrates a correlation between climatic change socioeconomic expansion and groundwater supply in the wvb the primary issue is identifying sub catchments with severe water shortage the research may help establish future water policies that take into consideration needs of different sectors levels of water scarcity and regional climatic and socioeconomic changes this is because the expected low flows and storage caused by insufficient rainfall may be exacerbated by natural and human factors such as population expansion changes in land use and cover and increased water demand in the future it will be required to survey and analyze groundwater resources as well as invest in enhancing the resilience of this critical resource in ghana s white volta river basin credit authorship contribution statement jacob kofi mensah

8004,study region laguna watershed of the upper blue nile basin which is representative of drought prone tropical sub humid watersheds of ethiopia the river of the watershed drains into lake tana one of the largest lakes in ethiopia study focus this study evaluated the impacts of five alternative land capability based land use and management options in reducing runoff and sediment loss by integrating observed plot and watershed scale data with the soil and water assessment tool new hydrological insights we modified flow and sediment sensitive model parameters based on six best performing plot scale land management practices to simulate the runoff and sediment loss of the watershed under five alternative options the results revealed that alternative land use options could reduce runoff and sediment loss by about 21 30 from 740 to 517 mm and 32 83 from 101 to 18 t ha respectively compared to the baseline data the simulations of best alternative land management options also decreased runoff by 10 41 and sediment loss by 40 89 runoff and sediment loss reductions were estimated to be as high as 72 from 740 to 210 mm and 95 from 101 to 5 t ha respectively when land use and land management options are combined these results indicate that implementing suitable land use and management practices has the potential to rehabilitate degraded watersheds in the sub humid

erosion is induced by population pressure land use land cover change climate variability and poor land management practices it is a major cause of land degradation and remains a serious challenge to achieving sustainable development goals around the world borrelli et al 2017 the severity of soil erosion is worst in sub saharan africa particularly in ethiopia where a greater portion of agricultural areas are susceptible to soil erosion by water fenta et al 2020a 2021 soil erosion driven by erosive rainfall may increase surface runoff and soil nutrient loss which leads to a decline in land productivity and ecosystem service values abebe et al 2020 berihun et al 2021 fenta et al 2016 2017a 2017b 2020b haregeweyn et al 2015 2016 2017 mulualem et al 2021a obalum et al 2012 in the

osman and sauerborn 2001 and the main emphasis has been on the northern highlands e g berihun et al 2020 fenta et al 2021 haregeweyn et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 the effectiveness of several land management practices physical biological and agronomic in reducing runoff and sediment loss at the plot and watershed scales have been evaluated in different climatic regions of the country e g berihun et al 2020 ebabu et al 2019 gebrernichael et al 2005 kebede et al 2021 melaku et al 2018 mihertie et al 2021 mulualem et al 2021b nyssen et al 2008 2010 sultan et al 2018a 2018b temesgen et al 2012 in contrast of other findings the implementation of land management practices has increased the runoff response by 13 from 1983 to 1992 30 43 in a humid hulet wenz watershed at andit tid research station hurni et al 2005 teferi et al 2020 this mixed result most likely due to the variation of baseflow influenced by the geologic formation of the watersheds teferi et al 2020 given the effectiveness of land management practices in reducing runoff and sediment loss their short and long term impacts on runoff and sediment dynamics at the watershed scale have not been sufficiently evaluated haregeweyn et al 2015 osman and sauerborn 2001 this is mainly a result of fragmented and limited observational data as well as the lack of a robust methodology to evaluate their potential impacts haregeweyn et al 2019 the impacts of land management practices on the dynamics of runoff and sediment loss at the watershed scale can be evaluated by two approaches e g berihun et al 2020 1 comparing flow or sediment yield data from watersheds or plots with and without land management practices e g berihun et al 2020 ebabu et al 2018 king et al 2008 sultan et al 2018a and 2 comparing a single watershed before and after land management intervention through historical data measurement or by developing possible land management implementation options by integrating experimental plot findings literature reviews and model simulations e g berihun et al 2020 betrie et al 2011 khelifa et al 2017 lemma et al 2019 ricci et al 2020 although the second approach is more appropriate for evaluating land management impacts on runoff and sediment dynamics at the watershed scale berihun et al 2020 ricci et al 2020 it has been rarely applied in the ethiopian highlands mainly because of the lack of measured hydro meteorological data betrie et al 2011 lemma et al 2019 in this study therefore we evaluated the potential impacts of land use and management practices in reducing runoff and sediment loss by integrating plot and watershed scale measurements with modeling techniques using the soil and water assessment tool swat a biophysical process based model arnold et al 1998 2012

analysis study is vital for better land use planning and land resource management to control land degradation in the sub humid areas of ethiopian highlands e g fenta et al 2021 haregeweyn et al 2016 the study findings are also important tools for decision makers land planners and local communities to formulate appropriate land management policies and strategies in the area and beyond swat has been applied to evaluate the impacts of land use and management options on runoff and sediment loss with some degree of success in the ethiopian highlands e g betrie et al 2011 dile et al 2016 lemma et al 2019 mekonnen et al 2018 worku et al 2017 more specifically berihun et al 2020 corroborated the best performance and applicability of the swat model for the study area laguna watershed to evaluate the impacts of land use change and management practices on runoff and sediment yield therefore we conducted our study in the laguna watershed which is located in the upper blue nile basin and is representative of drought prone tropical sub humid highlands of ethiopia the specific objectives were to 1 evaluate the dynamics of runoff and sediment yield rates and 2 model the spatial distribution of sediment loss under different alternative land use and management options by integrating swat with plot and watershed scale measurements the swat model was calibrated and validated using observed hydro meteorological and land management data from the laguna watershed there land degradation is severe because of intensive human activities among other factors thus there is an urgent need to develop test and implement alternative land use and management options to support land productivity in the area 2 research methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the laguna watershed of the upper blue nile basin fig 1 which is representative of drought prone tropical sub humid highlands of ethiopia berihun et al 2020 the watershed has area of 341 ha and the river drains into lake tana one of the largest lakes in ethiopia meteorological data were obtained from the nearby bahir dar station for the period 1982 2018 the mean annual rainfall during the study period was about 1343 mm more than 80 of which occurred during the rainy seasons june to october berihun et al 2019b 2020 the average monthly temperature ranged from 17 to 23 c with the minimum and maximum values observed in december and april respectively fig 2 we generated a topographic map elevation and slope of the watershed using a high resolution 0 5 0 5 m digital elevation model dem purchased from the advanced land observing satellite 2 alos 2 operated by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa http en alos pasco com the elevation of the watershed ranges from 1946 to 2253 m above sea level slope steepness was classified into five categories fig 3 flat 5 gentle 5 10 sloping 10 20 steep 20 30 and very steep 30 the study watershed is predominantly characterized by very steep slopes i e about 164 ha or 49 of the area areas with flat and gentle slopes were predominantly used for crop production and residences but only account for 10 of the total area cambisols leptosols and regosols in the fao classification system were identified as the major soil types in the study watershed mekonnen 2018 fig 3b the farming system in the study watershed is characterized by subsistence rain fed and mixed crop livestock production abeje et al 2019 cereal crops such as finger millet eleusine coracana maize zea mays barley and tef are the major crops and cattle bos primigenius donkey equus africanus sheep ovis aries and goat capra hircus are the dominant livestock 2 2 flow and sediment yield measurements flow depth was measured manually three times a day at 07 00 13 00 and 18 00 h and during rainfall events using a manual staff gauge and continuously at 10 minute intervals using an automatic pressure transducer td diver van essen instruments delft the netherlands installed at the outlet of the watershed linear regression equations developed from manual and automatic flow depth measurements for different seasons were used to correct the automated continuous flow depth data also the stage discharge relationship rating curve was developed from flow velocity and corresponding discharge data observed at the outlet of the watershed using the velocity area method to estimate the corrected instantaneous discharge depth integrated suspended sediment concentrations ssc g l were measured from samples collected at the same time as the manual flow depth measurements i e at 07 00 13 00 and 18 00 and during rainfall events from 2015 to 2018 as clearly described in the previous study of berihun et al 2020 twelve discharge sediment q ssc rating curves three in one rainy season were then developed on the basis of the soil erosion pattern in the rainy season and used to calculate the daily sediment yield sy at the watershed scale as 1 sy n 1 n q i ssc i 600 1 000 where n is the number of observations at 10 minute intervals in a day and q i and ssc i are the equivalent discharge m3 s and suspended sediment concentration g l for observation i monthly sy and area specific sy t ha were also calculated by summing the daily values in the month and by dividing the total sy by the area of the study watershed respectively a detailed procedure for the flow and sy estimation can be found in berihun et al 2020 2 3 features of the swat model the swat model was developed in the early 1990s by the u s department of agricultural research service and has been continuously modified and upgraded arnold et al 1998 2012 srinivasan et al 1998 the model was developed to quantify environmental factors such as the impacts of climate change land use and land management practices on flow sy water quality and nutrient flux in small to large complex watersheds e g arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 lemann et al 2016 lemma et al 2019 neitsch et al 2011 in swat a watershed is divided into multiple sub watersheds and further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus that are unique combinations of land use land cover lulc soil and slope the model estimates biophysical processes such as flow and sy for each hru arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 which are then aggregated at the sub watershed level the estimated flow sy and nutrients are routed to the stream channels the water balance equation was used in swat to estimate the hydrological components at the soil layer neitsch et al 2011 the soil conservation service soil conservation service scs 1972 curve number method was used to estimate daily surface runoff and the flow was routed into channels using muskingum routing techniques cunge 1969 the widely used penman monteith method was also used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration in the study watershed sy was estimated by the modified universal soil loss equation a detailed description of the model equations is given in the swat theoretical documentation by neitsch et al 2011 2 4 model input data spatially explicit datasets required by the swat model include dem lulc soil properties and daily climate data a high resolution dem was used to delineate the watershed and sub watersheds create channel networks and generate topographic information such as terrain slope channel slope and reach length the lulc map of the watershed for 2016 fig 3a was adapted from berihun et al 2019a the map comprises five lulc classes bushland 47 56 ha cropland 67 09 ha grassland 16 57 ha forest 36 93 ha and khat cultivation 11 17 ha the soil map of the watershed fig 3b was adapted from the soil survey carried out by mekonnen et al 2018 the sampled soil profiles have two to three different layers over depths of 0 150 cm table 1 daily climate data for the period 2000 2018 were collected from the bahir dar meteorology station 15 km from the study watershed in addition rainfall data from 2015 to 2018 were obtained from a rain gauge installed in the watershed and used to validate the long term rainfall data collected from the bahir dar meteorology station a weather generator developed by anon 1990 was prepared using the long term daily climate data from nearby meteorological stations to complete missing daily weather data except for temperature and rainfall schuol and abbaspour 2007 2 5 model setup calibration and validation to set up the swat model watershed delineation was conducted using a 3 ha threshold area required to form the origin of the streams this process resulted in the identification of 50 sub watersheds fig 3d the sub watersheds were divided into 4329 hrus created based on land use soil and slope classes to help model and investigate the detailed hydrological processes and land management scenarios neitsch et al 2011 the swat model simulation was run for 19 years 2000 2018 using 15 years 2000 2014 for the model warm up period and four years for the model evaluation period 2015 2018 the evaluation period was divided into calibration 2015 2017 and validation 2018 periods following arnold et al 2012 nineteen parameters related to flow and sy tables 2 3 were selected for calibration based on a previous study in the same watershed berihun et al 2020 some of the selected parameters such as cn2 and usle p factor were first fine tuned manually arnold et al 2012 berihun et al 2020 feyereisen et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 based on the results from a plot experiment table ts1 under conventional land use and land management practices control and then calibrated in swat cup using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 program abbaspour 2015 flow and sy model calibrations were conducted using monthly runoff and sy data aggregated from daily data collected at the outlet of the laguna watershed from 2015 to 2017 since laguna is an untreated watershed the cn2 values for each lulc class were adjusted in swat cup based on the standard deviations i e the lower and upper limits of the calculated cn2 values from the control experimental plots table ts1 we also used statistical model evaluation techniques to compare simulated results with observed values the performance of the model was statistically evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r 2 of the linear regression curve moriasi et al 2007 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 as recommended by previous studies moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2007 daily flow and sy data for the year 2018 were used to validate the calibrated model results in the watershed 2 6 development of different land use change and management options the study watershed has been more severely threatened by soil erosion than the adjacent watershed kecha which was previously treated with sustainable land management slm practices berihun et al 2020 thus developing appropriate land use and management strategies is crucial the land use change options were developed based on a land capability classification approach which is a simplified method of land use planning developed by the usda and adapted to the ethiopian context fdre ministry of agriculture moa 2020 this land classification method also used for land evaluation techniques fao 1975 in this study the land capability classification fig ts1 was developed based on the watershed s major landform characteristics mainly soil erosion and slope lulc and soil physical properties with the aim of increasing watershed productivity by reducing runoff and sediment loss hence the watershed was classified into seven land capability classes fig ts1 that are clearly described in fdre moa 2020 and summarized in table ts2 we superimposed the land capability class map on the existing lulc map to check the suitability of the land capability units for the existing land use when a unit was suitable for the existing land use we looked for appropriate land management practices and other suitable land use options otherwise we explored other suitable land uses for the land unit the land use change options were then developed for the laguna watershed based on the land capability classifications suitability analysis and plot based improved forages fig 4 land management options were formulated based on best performing results from about 25 experimental runoff plots established in different land use cropland grassland and bushland and slope gradient of the study site the detail setup and establishment of these experimental plots can be found in the previous studies of the study site ebabu et al 2019 kebede et al 2020 2021 mihertie et al 2021 mulualem et al 2021b the aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of land management practices physical biophysical agronomic and soil amendments in reducing runoff and sediment loss berihun et al 2019b 2020 ebabu et al 2019 kebede et al 2020 2021 sultan et al 2018b and improving land productivity mihertie et al 2021 mulualem et al 2021b only the best land management practices were selected to formulate the land management options in the watershed table 4 soil bund grass ebabu et al 2019 sultan et al 2018b and polyacrylamide pam lime kebede et al 2021 mulualem et al 2021b reduced tillage and row planting mihertie et al 2021 for cropland exclosure for grassland exclosure trench for bushland ebabu et al 2019 sultan et al 2018b and napier desmodium for improved forage grass and khat cultivation the combination of the four best land management practices was considered for cropland because it was found to be more effective in reducing runoff and sediment loss than any of the individual practices used alone in general six alternative land use and land management options were developed as defined below and described in detail in fig 4 and table ts3 in addition to the previously discussed land capability classifications for alternative land use options and best performing land management practices at the plot scale systematic expert reviews were conducted to select these alternative land use and management options baseline bl current lulc map and existing conventional farmers practices option i op i current lulc map plus land management practices option ii op ii no crop cultivation on steep slopes 30 plus land management practices option iii op iii khat plantation on suitable areas plus land management practices option iv op iv forage production on suitable areas plus land management practices option v op v reforestation on communal lands and on hilly croplands plus land management practices the developed land use and management options have a different effect on flow and sediment output hence they have to be represented in the swat model by modifying one or more factors the most sensitive and influential factors e g cn2 and the usle p and c factors table 4 and their impact on changes in runoff and sy were considered in the swat model simulations the values of each factor for the different land management practices were adopted from the plot experiments comparing the runoff and sy reduction results as compared to those of the control plot table 4 the results of the baseline option which represented the calibrated model results under existing land use and management practices were used as a reference to evaluate alternative land use change and management options in reducing runoff and sediment loss in the watershed the impact of land use on runoff and sediment loss between the baseline and op i was not analyzed because the land use was similar in these options the impact evaluation was conducted on a monthly basis at the sub watershed scale for the period 2015 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 model efficiency for flow simulation sensitive parameters for flow simulation table 2 were calibrated and validated at monthly time steps for the study watershed table 5 figs 5a 6a the observed mean monthly flow was 0 21 m3 s which was almost equal to the simulated flow during the calibration 0 20 m3 s and validation 0 22 m3 s periods according to the statistical model evaluation results the model performed well with respective r 2 nse and pbias values of 0 93 0 91 and 0 90 during the calibration period and 0 95 0 93 and 1 67 during the validation period fig 5a good agreement was also found between observed and simulated streamflow in the hydrographs of larger rainfall events fig 6a however the simulation slightly underestimated the streamflow during the calibration and validation periods based on the goodness of fit and graphical evaluations we concluded that the swat model can be used to predict streamflow in the study watershed for additional impact assessments compared to results from previous studies in the upper blue nile basin e g betrie et al 2011 lemma et al 2019 melaku et al 2018 setegn et al 2010 worku et al 2017 this study had better calibration and validation results for streamflow simulations 3 2 model efficiency for sediment simulation the mean monthly observed sy values of the watershed were 10 93 and 12 13 t ha for the calibration and validation periods respectively table 5 the sy simulation performances were rated very good r 2 nse and pbias were 0 82 0 80 and 7 54 respectively during the calibration period fig 5b likewise according to the recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 and saleh et al 2000 the goodness of fit indices indicated that the sy simulation performance was very good during the validation period fig 5b as was the case for streamflow simulated sy values were less than the observed values mainly for peak rainfall flow events in both the calibration and validation periods fig 6b this difference might be attributable to the presence of active gullies in the watershed yibeltal et al 2019a 2019b which can contribute a greater amount of sediment and increase sy at the outlet of the watershed during peak rainfall events the modeled sy calibration and validation results of this study are better than those of previous studies in the ethiopian highlands e g lemann et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 setegn et al 2010 worku et al 2017 this improvement is mainly attributable to the use of seasonal discharge sediment rating curves which better capture the temporal dynamics of sediment availability and transport berihun et al 2020 ebabu et al 2019 compared to the use of a single rating curve for the entire study year e g see lemma et al 2019 melaku et al 2018 3 3 impacts of alternative land use change and management options on runoff the change in runoff of the watershed was compared for the baseline case and the five land use management options fig 7a b it is important to note that the baseline and sc i options have similar lulc classes so the impact of land use change between these options is zero the baseline option had the highest runoff both in terms of maximum and median values whereas the change of land use in op ii i e from cropland to improved forage grass and from grassland to forest table ts3 resulted in a substantial decrease in the median runoff from 742 to 589 mm fig 7a op iv showed the greatest impact in reducing runoff from 742 to 494 mm fig 7a mainly because this option included the conversion of the most damaging land use classes cropland bushland grazing land and khat cultivation to sustainable land use classes development of improved forage and forest table ts3 the implementation of different land management practices alongside the land use change options reduced the median runoff value from 648 mm in op i to 201 mm in op iv fig 7b however the median runoff value of op v was more than twice that of op iv fig 7b the land use options reduced runoff by 22 30 from 740 to 517 mm table 6 implying op iv was the most effective option followed by op iii the implementation of different land management practices physical biophysical agronomic and soil amendments could further reduce runoff as compared to the baseline case the proposed land management options reduced runoff by 10 in op ii to 41 in op iv the combined impacts of the two best land use and management options in reducing runoff was found to be between 52 op iii and 72 op iv table 6 this improvement can be explained mainly by the conversion of cropland and bushland use classes to improved forage grass and forest cover classes table ts3 our results are consistent with previous studies in the upper blue nile basin and elsewhere that reported substantial decreases in watershed runoff resulting from the conversion of land use classes e g berihun et al 2019b mango et al 2011 worku et al 2017 yang et al 2017 yang and lu 2018 here runoff in the laguna watershed decreased by 22 30 due to land use change mainly through the conversion of cropland to improved forage grass and forest similarly worku et al 2017 reported that a change in land use expansion of forest and adoption of improved grass between 2000 and 2009 decreased runoff by 28 in the beressa watershed of the upper blue nile basin based on a scenario analysis in the mara river basin kenya mango et al 2011 reported that runoff decreased by 20 as a result of converting 36 of the cropland in the basin to grassland other studies have also shown a decrease in surface runoff as a result of land use change especially in cases where forests grasslands and shrublands were expanded at the expense of cropland and barren land yang and lu 2018 yang et al 2017 plot scale studies in different agro ecological environments of the upper blue nile basin have also reported that the runoff estimated from grassland and bushland was 20 50 less than that from cropland ebabu et al 2019 sultan et al 2018b in contrast the expansion of cropland at the expense of vegetation cover caused increased runoff by 10 37 in the upper blue nile basin and elsewhere e g berihun et al 2019b gessesse et al 2015 khelifa et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2018 the separate impact of land management options in reducing runoff ranged from 3 in op ii to 42 in op iv corroborating our findings studies at the plot e g ebabu et al 2019 kebede et al 2021 sultan et al 2018b and watershed e g berihun et al 2020 melaku et al 2018 sultan et al 2018b scales reported that land management practices could reduce runoff in the ethiopian highlands by 35 68 in addition kebede et al 2021 found that different soil amendment land management practices pam gypsum biochar lime and pam lime at the plot scale reduced runoff by 12 39 elsewhere khelifa et al 2017 reported that land management practices soil bunds and terraces reduced runoff by 4 78 in the sbaihia watershed northeastern tunisia it is important to note that such wide variability in the reduction of runoff among different studies is expected because of variations in watershed characteristics and other important factors 3 4 impacts of alternative land use and management options on sediment loss as expected the highest maximum 215 t ha and median 100 t ha sediment loss were observed in the baseline case fig 7c d the greatest reductions in median sediment loss for the land use options alone were for op iv to 16 t ha and op v to 17 t ha 25th percentile value for both options are nearly equal fig 7c as was the case with runoff reduction a substantial reduction in sediment loss was also observed due to the impact of the different land management implementation options fig 7d our results showed that the reductions in median sediment loss from the individual land management practices ranged from 7 to 72 t ha as compared to the baseline the combined impact of the land use and land management options reduced the median sediment loss values for all options with the greatest decrease in op iv to 5 t ha followed by op v to 10 t ha fig 7d the alternative land use change and management options decreased sediment loss by 32 83 and by 40 89 respectively table 6 prohibiting crop cultivation on steep slopes 30 i e by replacing 42 ha of cropland with improved forage grass and forest reduced sediment loss from 34 to 19 t ha tables ts3 6 further reduction in sediment loss to about 11 t ha in op iii and 5 t ha in op iv could be achieved by appropriate khat cultivation and forage production on suitable areas respectively tables ts3 6 the combined impact of land use and management options in reducing sediment loss ranged from 66 from 101 to 34 t ha in op i to 95 from 101 to 5 t ha in op iv table 6 this reduction can mainly be attributed to the use of improved forage grass 54 ha and forest 36 ha and the implementation of best practice land management in suitable areas i e in op iv table ts3 the impacts of different land use and management options on sediment loss are evident in the sediment loss rate severity classes at the sub watershed level fig 8 the mean sediment loss rate of all sub watersheds in op iv was less than 15 t ha only two sediment loss severity classes were identified much better than the other options and comparable to a generally accepted tolerable annual sediment loss rate 16 t ha for the study region hurni 1993 berihun et al 2020 op i and op ii could not be good options for reducing sediment loss the sediment loss rates of the sub watersheds for these options were greater than 30 t ha fig 8 we note that the land use change options alone did not show promising results on the basis of a tolerable sediment loss rate on sediment reduction compared to the alternative land management options the sediment loss rates for all land use options were greater than 30 t ha except for a few sub watersheds in op iv and op v fig 8 this strongly indicates that a combination of appropriate land use and land management is crucial to reduce sediment loss and achieve rehabilitation of areas degraded by soil erosion in the study watershed and similar environments elsewhere these results also revealed that alternative land use and land management options have greater impacts on sediment loss than on runoff in the study region the relative impacts of alternative land use and management options on sediment loss obtained herein are within the range of values reported for the ethiopian highlands and similar agro ecological regions e g betrie et al 2011 ebabu et al 2019 gebrernichael et al 2005 herweg and ludi 1999 khelifa et al 2017 lemma et al 2019 molla and sisheber 2017 mango et al 2011 in particular the substantial reduction in the rate of sediment loss 32 83 with an average of 54 resulting from the conversion from other land uses to improved forage grass and forest is in good agreement with previous results e g betrie et al 2011 ebabu et al 2019 lemann et al 2016 lemma et al 2019 for example lemma et al 2019 and betrie et al 2011 reported that reforesting hillsides

berihun et al 2020 bieger et al 2015 gessesse et al 2015 worku et al 2017 supporting the results of this study reductions in sediment loss rates resulting from the implementation of alternative land

practices reduced the sediment loss rate by 11 68 ebabu et al 2019 likewise land management practices such as the construction of stone bunds reduced sediment loss rates by 27 100 in different watersheds in ethiopia and eritrea gebrernichael et al 2005 herweg and ludi 1999 kebede et al 2021 and mihertie et al 2021 reported that different land management practices tested on cropland soil amendments and agronomic practices reduced the sediment loss rate by 13 53 previous studies in humid areas of the upper blue nile basin e g berihun et al 2020 betrie et al 2011 melaku et al 2018 lemma et al 2019 demonstrated that cross slope land management practices stone soil bunds grass contour strips have reduced sediment loss by 25 60 by creating retention areas and reducing slope length such practices were reported to be even more effective 56 76 reductions in semi arid watersheds of northern ethiopia e g gebrernichael et al 2005 in the sbaihia watershed tunisia land management practices reduced sediment loss rates by an average of 22 khelifa et al 2017 a similar study by ricci et al 2020 found that the combined application of contour farming and reforestation practices reduced sediment loss by 20 38 in the carapelle watershed italy similar impacts of alternative land use and management practices have also been reported in other regions of the world for example bagagiolo et al 2018 italy mango et al 2011 kenya and wang et al 2007 china reported that land management practices reduced sediment loss rates by 4 86 this study also revealed that compared to the use of individual land use and management options the combined impacts of alternative land use and management practice options resulted in greater reductions in the sediment loss rate in the study watershed therefore our results imply that implementing appropriate land use and management options could substantially reduce sediment loss and related consequences hence the spatial estimates of sediment loss rates fig 8 should help to prioritize areas for the implementation of effective land use and management practices in the study watershed it is worth to mention that development of different land use options by land capability classification approach would not indicate the best land use and management option in terms of productivities or profitability for maximizing livelihood of the community thus to minimize this type of limitations future research in the study area should evaluate the impact of these alternative land use and management options on the socio economic dimensions hence selection of best land use and management options should consider the impact these options on socio economic aspects beyond the hydrological dynamics for future decision making and land use management policies 4 conclusions we evaluated the impacts of alternative land use and management options in reducing runoff and sediment loss by integrating field measurements at the watershed and plot scales with model simulations in the laguna watershed a sub humid watershed of the upper blue nile basin ethiopia in doing so five land use and management options were developed based on watershed land capability and best land management practices the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate and evaluate the individual and combined impacts of alternative land use and land management options on runoff and sediment loss rates in the laguna watershed our results revealed that the individual impacts of different alternative land use and land management options could reduce runoff by 10 41 and sediment loss by 32 89 compared to current practices i e the baseline case furthermore the combined impacts of the best alternative land use change and land management options i e conversion of croplands to improved forage grass and forest combined with the implementation of best land management practices further reduce both runoff and sediment loss overall our results suggest that the implementation of different land management practices integrated with improved forage grass and forest plantation on suitable areas and vulnerable areas for land degradation has the potential to rehabilitate degraded watersheds in the ethiopian highlands and similar environments elsewhere the implementation of such management options should consider the existing farming practices of the area moreover our results could provide suitable insights for researchers land managers and decision makers as they develop land and water resource conservation planning frameworks additional research should also be conducted on the other impacts of land use and management practices such as the impact on socioeconomic related issues for any future selection and recommendation credit authorship

8004,study region laguna watershed of the upper blue nile basin which is representative of drought prone tropical sub humid watersheds of ethiopia the river of the watershed drains into lake tana one of the largest lakes in ethiopia study focus this study evaluated the impacts of five alternative land capability based land use and management options in reducing runoff and sediment loss by integrating observed plot and watershed scale data with the soil and water assessment tool new hydrological insights we modified flow and sediment sensitive model parameters based on six best performing plot scale land management practices to simulate the runoff and sediment loss of the watershed under five alternative options the results revealed that alternative land use options could reduce runoff and sediment loss by about 21 30 from 740 to 517 mm and 32 83 from 101 to 18 t ha respectively compared to the baseline data the simulations of best alternative land management options also decreased runoff by 10 41 and sediment loss by 40 89 runoff and sediment loss reductions were estimated to be as high as 72 from 740 to 210 mm and 95 from 101 to 5 t ha respectively when land use and land management options are combined these results indicate that implementing suitable land use and management practices has the potential to rehabilitate degraded watersheds in the sub humid

agricultural areas are susceptible to soil erosion by water fenta et al 2020a 2021 soil erosion driven by erosive rainfall may increase surface runoff and soil nutrient loss which leads to a decline

station hurni et al 2005 teferi et al 2020 this mixed result most likely due to the variation of baseflow influenced by the geologic formation of the watersheds teferi et al 2020 given the effectiveness of land management practices in reducing runoff and sediment loss their short and long term impacts on runoff and sediment dynamics at the watershed scale have not been sufficiently evaluated haregeweyn et al 2015 osman and sauerborn 2001 this is mainly a result of fragmented and limited observational data as well as the lack of a robust methodology to evaluate their potential impacts haregeweyn et al 2019 the impacts of land management practices on the dynamics of runoff and sediment loss at the watershed scale can be evaluated by two approaches e g berihun et al 2020 1 comparing flow or sediment yield data from watersheds or plots with and without land management practices e g berihun et al 2020 ebabu et al 2018 king et al 2008 sultan et al 2018a and 2 comparing a

findings literature reviews and model simulations e g berihun et al 2020 betrie et al 2011 khelifa et al 2017 lemma et al 2019 ricci et al 2020 although the second approach is more appropriate for evaluating land management impacts on runoff and sediment dynamics at the watershed scale berihun et al 2020 ricci et al 2020 it has been rarely applied in the ethiopian highlands mainly because of the lack of measured hydro meteorological data betrie et al 2011 lemma et al 2019 in this study therefore we evaluated the potential impacts of land use and management practices in reducing runoff and sediment loss by integrating plot and watershed scale measurements with modeling techniques using the soil and water assessment tool swat a biophysical process based model arnold et al 1998 2012

the study findings are also important tools for decision makers land planners and local communities to formulate appropriate land management policies and strategies in the area and beyond swat has

et al 2019 mekonnen et al 2018 worku et al 2017 more specifically berihun et al 2020 corroborated the best performance and applicability of the swat model for the study area laguna watershed to evaluate the impacts of land use change and management practices on runoff and sediment yield therefore we conducted our study in the laguna watershed which is located in the upper blue nile basin and is representative of drought prone tropical sub humid highlands of ethiopia the specific objectives were to 1 evaluate the dynamics of runoff and sediment yield rates and 2 model the spatial distribution of sediment loss under different alternative land use and management options by integrating swat with plot and watershed scale measurements the swat model was calibrated and validated using observed hydro meteorological and land management data from the laguna watershed there land degradation is severe because of intensive human activities among other factors thus there is an urgent need to develop test and implement alternative land use and management options to support land productivity in the area 2 research methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the laguna watershed of the upper blue nile basin fig 1 which is representative of drought prone tropical sub humid highlands of ethiopia berihun et al 2020 the watershed has area of 341 ha and the river drains into lake tana one of the largest lakes in ethiopia meteorological data were obtained from the nearby bahir dar station for the period 1982 2018 the mean annual rainfall during the study period was about 1343 mm more than 80 of which occurred during the rainy seasons june to october berihun et al 2019b 2020 the average monthly temperature ranged from 17 to 23 c with the minimum and maximum values observed in december and april respectively fig 2 we generated a topographic map elevation and slope of the watershed using a high resolution 0 5 0 5 m digital elevation model dem purchased from the advanced land observing satellite 2 alos 2 operated by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa http en alos pasco com the elevation of the watershed ranges from 1946 to 2253 m above sea level slope steepness was classified into five categories fig 3 flat 5 gentle 5 10 sloping 10 20 steep 20 30 and very steep 30 the study watershed is predominantly characterized by very steep slopes i e about 164 ha or 49 of the area areas with flat and gentle slopes were predominantly used for crop production and residences but only account for 10 of the total area cambisols leptosols and regosols in the fao classification system were identified as the major soil types in the study watershed mekonnen 2018 fig 3b the farming system in the study watershed is characterized by subsistence rain fed and mixed crop livestock production abeje et al 2019 cereal crops such as finger millet eleusine coracana maize zea mays barley and tef are the major crops and cattle bos primigenius donkey equus africanus sheep ovis aries and goat capra hircus are the dominant livestock 2 2 flow and sediment yield measurements flow depth was measured manually three times a day at 07 00 13 00 and 18 00 h and during rainfall events using a manual staff gauge and continuously at 10 minute intervals using an automatic pressure transducer td diver van essen instruments delft the netherlands installed at the outlet of the watershed linear regression equations developed from manual and automatic flow depth measurements for different seasons were used to correct the automated continuous flow depth data also the stage discharge relationship rating curve was developed from flow velocity and corresponding discharge data observed at the outlet of the watershed using the velocity area method to estimate the corrected instantaneous discharge depth integrated suspended sediment concentrations ssc g l were measured from samples collected at the same time as the manual flow depth measurements i e at 07 00 13 00 and 18 00 and during rainfall events from 2015 to 2018 as clearly described in the previous study of berihun et al 2020 twelve discharge sediment q ssc rating curves three in one rainy season were then developed on the basis of the soil erosion pattern in the rainy season and used to calculate the daily sediment yield sy at the watershed scale as 1 sy n 1 n q i ssc i 600 1 000 where n is the number of observations at 10 minute intervals in a day and q i and ssc i are the equivalent discharge m3 s and suspended sediment concentration g l for observation i monthly sy and area specific sy t ha were also calculated by summing the daily values in the month and by dividing the total sy by the area of the study watershed respectively a detailed procedure for the flow and sy estimation can be found in berihun et al 2020 2 3 features of the swat model the swat model was developed in the early 1990s by the u s department of agricultural research service and has been continuously modified and upgraded arnold et al 1998 2012 srinivasan et al 1998 the model was developed to quantify environmental factors such as the impacts of climate change land use and land management practices on flow sy water quality and nutrient flux in small to large complex watersheds e g arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 lemann et al 2016 lemma et al 2019 neitsch et al 2011 in swat a watershed is divided into multiple sub watersheds and further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus that are unique combinations of land use land cover lulc soil and slope the model estimates biophysical processes such as flow and sy for each hru arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 which are then aggregated at the sub watershed level the estimated flow sy and nutrients are routed to the stream channels the water balance equation was used in swat to estimate the hydrological components at the soil layer neitsch et al 2011 the soil conservation service soil conservation service scs 1972 curve number method was used to estimate daily surface runoff and the flow was routed into channels using muskingum routing techniques cunge 1969 the widely used penman monteith method was also used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration in the study watershed sy was estimated by the modified universal soil loss equation a detailed description of the model equations is given in the swat theoretical documentation by neitsch et al 2011 2 4 model input data spatially explicit datasets required by the swat model include dem lulc soil properties and daily climate data a high resolution dem was used to delineate the watershed and sub watersheds create channel networks and generate topographic information such as terrain slope channel slope and reach length the lulc map of the watershed for 2016 fig 3a was adapted from berihun et al 2019a the map comprises five lulc classes bushland 47 56 ha cropland 67 09 ha grassland 16 57 ha forest 36 93 ha and khat cultivation 11 17 ha the soil map of the watershed fig 3b was adapted from the soil survey carried out by mekonnen et al 2018 the sampled soil profiles have two to three different layers over depths of 0 150 cm table 1 daily climate data for the period 2000 2018 were collected from the bahir dar meteorology station 15 km from the study watershed in addition rainfall data from 2015 to 2018 were obtained from a rain gauge installed in the watershed and used to validate the long term rainfall data collected from the bahir dar meteorology station a weather generator developed by anon 1990 was prepared using the long term daily climate data from nearby meteorological stations to complete missing daily weather data except for temperature and rainfall schuol and abbaspour 2007 2 5 model setup calibration and validation to set up the swat model watershed delineation was conducted using a 3 ha threshold area required to form the origin of the streams this process resulted in the identification of 50 sub watersheds fig 3d the sub watersheds were divided into 4329 hrus created based on land use soil and slope classes to help model and investigate the detailed hydrological processes and land management scenarios neitsch et al 2011 the swat model simulation was run for 19 years 2000 2018 using 15 years 2000 2014 for the model warm up period and four years for the model evaluation period 2015 2018 the evaluation period was divided into calibration 2015 2017 and validation 2018 periods following arnold et al 2012 nineteen parameters related to flow and sy tables 2 3 were selected for calibration based on a previous study in the same watershed berihun et al 2020 some of the selected parameters such as cn2 and usle p factor were first fine tuned manually arnold et al 2012 berihun et al 2020 feyereisen et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 based on the results from a plot experiment table ts1 under conventional land use and land management practices control and then calibrated in swat cup using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 program abbaspour 2015 flow and sy model calibrations were conducted using monthly runoff and sy data aggregated from daily data collected at the outlet of the laguna watershed from 2015 to 2017 since laguna is an untreated watershed the cn2 values for each lulc class were adjusted in swat cup based on the standard deviations i e the lower and upper limits of the calculated cn2 values from the control experimental plots table ts1 we also used statistical model evaluation techniques to compare simulated results with observed values the performance of the model was statistically evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r 2 of the linear regression curve moriasi et al 2007 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 as recommended by previous studies moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 van liew et al 2007 daily flow and sy data for the year 2018 were used to validate the calibrated model results in the watershed 2 6 development of different land use change and management options the study watershed has been more severely threatened by soil erosion than the adjacent watershed kecha which was previously treated with sustainable land management slm practices berihun et al 2020 thus developing appropriate land use and management strategies is crucial the land use change options were developed based on a land capability classification approach which is a simplified method of land use planning developed by the usda and adapted to the ethiopian context fdre ministry of agriculture moa 2020 this land classification method also used for land evaluation techniques fao 1975 in this study the land capability classification fig ts1 was developed based on the watershed s major landform characteristics mainly soil erosion and slope lulc and soil physical properties with the aim of increasing watershed productivity by reducing runoff and sediment loss hence the watershed was classified into seven land capability classes fig ts1 that are clearly described in fdre moa 2020 and summarized in table ts2 we superimposed the land capability class map on the existing lulc map to check the suitability of the land capability units for the existing land use when a unit was suitable for the existing land use we looked for appropriate land management practices and other suitable land use options otherwise we explored other suitable land uses for the land unit the land use change options were then developed for the laguna watershed based on the land capability classifications suitability analysis and plot based improved forages fig 4 land management options were formulated based on best performing results from about 25 experimental runoff plots established in different land use cropland grassland and bushland and slope gradient of the study site the detail setup and establishment of these experimental plots can be found in the previous studies of the study site ebabu et al 2019 kebede et al 2020 2021 mihertie et al 2021 mulualem et al 2021b the aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of land management practices physical biophysical agronomic and soil amendments in reducing runoff and sediment loss berihun et al 2019b 2020 ebabu et al 2019 kebede et al 2020 2021 sultan et al 2018b and improving land productivity mihertie et al 2021 mulualem et al 2021b only the best land management practices were selected to formulate the land management options in the watershed table 4 soil bund grass ebabu et al 2019 sultan et al 2018b and polyacrylamide pam lime kebede et al 2021 mulualem et al 2021b reduced tillage and row planting mihertie et al 2021 for cropland exclosure for grassland exclosure trench for bushland ebabu et al 2019 sultan et al 2018b and napier desmodium for improved forage grass and khat cultivation the combination of the four best land management practices was considered for cropland because it was found to be more effective in reducing runoff and sediment loss than any of the individual practices used alone in general six alternative land use and land management options were developed as defined below and described in detail in fig 4 and table ts3 in addition to the previously discussed land capability classifications for alternative land use options and best performing land management practices at the plot scale systematic expert reviews were conducted to select these alternative land use and management options baseline bl current lulc map and existing conventional farmers practices option i op i current lulc map plus land management practices option ii op ii no crop cultivation on steep slopes 30 plus land management practices option iii op iii khat plantation on suitable areas plus land management practices option iv op iv forage production on suitable areas plus land management practices option v op v reforestation on communal lands and on hilly croplands plus land management practices the developed land use and management options have a different effect on flow and sediment output hence they have to be represented in the swat model by modifying one or more factors the most sensitive and influential factors e g cn2 and the usle p and c factors table 4 and their impact on changes in runoff and sy were considered in the swat model simulations the values of each factor for the different land management practices were adopted from the plot experiments comparing the runoff and sy reduction results as compared to those of the control plot table 4 the results of the baseline option which represented the calibrated model results under existing land use and management practices were used as a reference to evaluate alternative land use change and management options in reducing runoff and sediment loss in the watershed the impact of land use on runoff and sediment loss between the baseline and op i was not analyzed because the land use was similar in these options the impact evaluation was conducted on a monthly basis at the sub watershed scale for the period 2015 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 model efficiency for flow simulation sensitive parameters for flow simulation table 2 were calibrated and validated at monthly time steps for the study watershed table 5 figs 5a 6a the observed mean monthly flow was 0 21 m3 s which was almost equal to the simulated flow during the calibration 0 20 m3 s and validation 0 22 m3 s periods according to the statistical model evaluation results the model performed well with respective r 2 nse and pbias values of 0 93 0 91 and 0 90 during the calibration period and 0 95 0 93 and 1 67 during the validation period fig 5a good agreement was also found between observed and simulated streamflow in the hydrographs of larger rainfall events fig 6a however the simulation slightly underestimated the streamflow during the calibration and validation periods based on the goodness of fit and graphical evaluations we concluded that the swat model can be used to predict streamflow in the study watershed for additional impact assessments compared to results from previous studies in the upper blue nile basin e g betrie et al 2011 lemma et al 2019 melaku et al 2018 setegn et al 2010 worku et al 2017 this study had better calibration and validation results for streamflow simulations 3 2 model efficiency for sediment simulation the mean monthly observed sy values of the watershed were 10 93 and 12 13 t ha for the calibration and validation periods respectively table 5 the sy simulation performances were rated very good r 2 nse and pbias were 0 82 0 80 and 7 54 respectively during the calibration period fig 5b likewise according to the recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 and saleh et al 2000 the goodness of fit indices indicated that the sy simulation performance was very good during the validation period fig 5b as was the case for streamflow simulated sy values were less than the observed values mainly for peak rainfall flow events in both the calibration and validation periods fig 6b this difference might be attributable to the presence of active gullies in the watershed yibeltal et al 2019a 2019b which can contribute a greater amount of sediment and increase sy at the outlet of the watershed during peak rainfall events the modeled sy calibration and validation results of this study are better than those of previous studies in the ethiopian highlands e g lemann et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 setegn et al 2010 worku et al 2017 this improvement is mainly attributable to the use of seasonal discharge sediment rating curves which better capture the temporal dynamics of sediment availability and transport berihun et al 2020 ebabu et al 2019 compared to the use of a single rating curve for the entire study year e g see lemma et al 2019 melaku et al 2018 3 3 impacts of alternative land use change and management options on runoff the change in runoff of the watershed was compared for the baseline case and the five land use management options fig 7a b it is important to note that the baseline and sc i options have similar lulc classes so the impact of land use change between these options is zero the baseline option had the highest runoff both in terms of maximum and median values whereas the change of land use in op ii i e from cropland to improved forage grass and from grassland to forest table ts3 resulted in a substantial decrease in the median runoff from 742 to 589 mm fig 7a op iv showed the greatest impact in reducing runoff from 742 to 494 mm fig 7a mainly because this option included the conversion of the most damaging land use classes cropland bushland grazing land and khat cultivation to sustainable land use classes development of improved forage and forest table ts3 the implementation of different land management practices alongside the land use change options reduced the median runoff value from 648 mm in op i to 201 mm in op iv fig 7b however the median runoff value of op v was more than twice that of op iv fig 7b the land use options reduced runoff by 22 30 from 740 to 517 mm table 6 implying op iv was the most effective option followed by op iii the implementation of different land management practices physical biophysical agronomic and soil amendments could further reduce runoff as compared to the baseline case the proposed land management options reduced runoff by 10 in op ii to 41 in op iv the combined impacts of the two best land use and management options in reducing runoff was found to be between 52 op iii and 72 op iv table 6 this improvement can be explained mainly by the conversion of cropland and bushland use classes to improved forage grass and forest cover classes table ts3 our results are consistent with previous studies in the upper blue nile basin and elsewhere that reported substantial decreases in watershed runoff resulting from the conversion of land use classes e g berihun et al 2019b mango et al 2011 worku et al 2017 yang et al 2017 yang and lu 2018 here runoff in the laguna watershed decreased by 22 30 due to land use change mainly through the conversion of cropland to improved forage grass and forest similarly worku et al 2017 reported that a change in land use expansion of forest and adoption of improved grass between 2000 and 2009 decreased runoff by 28 in the beressa watershed of the upper blue nile basin based on a scenario analysis in the mara river basin kenya mango et al 2011 reported that runoff decreased by 20 as a result of converting 36 of the cropland in the basin to grassland other studies have also shown a decrease in surface runoff as a result of land use change especially in cases where forests grasslands and shrublands were expanded at the expense of cropland and barren land yang and lu 2018 yang et al 2017 plot scale studies in different agro ecological environments of the upper blue nile basin have also reported that the runoff estimated from grassland and bushland was 20 50 less than that from cropland ebabu et al 2019 sultan et al 2018b in contrast the expansion of cropland at the expense of vegetation cover caused increased runoff by 10 37 in the upper blue nile basin and elsewhere e g berihun et al 2019b gessesse et al 2015 khelifa et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2018 the separate impact of land management options in reducing runoff ranged from 3 in op ii to 42 in op iv corroborating our findings studies at the plot e g ebabu et al 2019 kebede et al 2021 sultan et al 2018b and watershed e g berihun et al 2020 melaku et al 2018 sultan et al 2018b scales reported that land management practices could reduce runoff in the ethiopian highlands by 35 68 in addition kebede et al 2021 found that different soil amendment land management practices pam gypsum biochar lime and pam lime at the plot scale reduced runoff by 12 39 elsewhere khelifa et al 2017 reported that land management practices soil bunds and terraces reduced runoff by 4 78 in the sbaihia watershed northeastern tunisia it is important to note that such wide variability in the reduction of runoff among different studies is expected because of variations in watershed characteristics and other important factors 3 4 impacts of alternative land use and management options on sediment loss as expected the highest maximum 215 t ha and median 100 t ha sediment loss were observed in the baseline case fig 7c d the greatest reductions in median sediment loss for the land use options alone were for op iv to 16 t ha and op v to 17 t ha 25th percentile value for both options are nearly equal fig 7c as was the case with runoff reduction a substantial reduction in sediment loss was also observed due to the impact of the different land management implementation options fig 7d our results showed that the reductions in median sediment loss from the individual land management practices ranged from 7 to 72 t ha as compared to the baseline the combined impact of the land use and land management options reduced the median sediment loss values for all options with the greatest decrease in op iv to 5 t ha followed by op v to 10 t ha fig 7d the alternative land use change and management options decreased sediment loss by 32 83 and by 40 89 respectively table 6 prohibiting crop cultivation on steep slopes 30 i e by replacing 42 ha of cropland with improved forage grass and forest reduced sediment loss from 34 to 19 t ha tables ts3 6 further reduction in sediment loss to about 11 t ha in op iii and 5 t ha in op iv could be achieved by appropriate khat cultivation and forage production on suitable areas respectively tables ts3 6 the combined impact of land use and management options in reducing sediment loss ranged from 66 from 101 to 34 t ha in op i to 95 from 101 to 5 t ha in op iv table 6 this reduction can mainly be attributed to the use of improved forage grass 54 ha and forest 36 ha and the implementation of best practice land management in suitable areas i e in op iv table ts3 the impacts of different land use and management options on sediment loss are evident in the sediment loss rate severity classes at the sub watershed level fig 8 the mean sediment loss rate of all sub watersheds in op iv was less than 15 t ha only two sediment loss severity classes were identified much better than the other options and comparable to a generally accepted tolerable annual sediment loss rate 16 t ha for the study region hurni 1993 berihun et al 2020 op i and op ii could not be good options for reducing sediment loss the sediment loss rates of the sub watersheds for these options were greater than 30 t ha fig 8 we note that the land use change options alone did not show promising results on the basis of a tolerable sediment loss rate on sediment reduction compared to the alternative land management options the sediment loss rates for all land use options were greater than 30 t ha except for a few sub watersheds in op iv and op v fig 8 this strongly indicates that a combination of appropriate land use and land management is crucial to reduce sediment loss and achieve rehabilitation of areas degraded by soil erosion in the study watershed and similar environments elsewhere these results also revealed that alternative land use and land management options have greater impacts on sediment loss than on runoff in the study region the relative impacts of alternative land use and management options on sediment loss obtained herein are within the range of values reported for the ethiopian highlands and similar agro ecological regions e g betrie et al 2011 ebabu et al 2019 gebrernichael et al 2005 herweg and ludi 1999 khelifa et al 2017 lemma et al 2019 molla and sisheber 2017 mango et al 2011 in particular the substantial reduction in the rate of sediment loss 32 83 with an average of 54 resulting from the conversion from other land uses to improved forage grass and forest is in good agreement with previous results e g betrie et al 2011 ebabu et al 2019 lemann et al 2016 lemma et al 2019 for example lemma et al 2019 and betrie et al 2011 reported that reforesting hillsides with grass and plants reduces the sediment loss rate by 46 77 in the upper blue nile basin in contrast the expansion of croplands causes increased sediment loss rates in the ethiopian highlands berihun et al 2020 bieger et al 2015 gessesse et al 2015 worku et al 2017 supporting the results of this study reductions in sediment loss rates resulting from the implementation of alternative land management options have been reported at the plot e g ebabu et al 2019 gebrernichael et al 2005 herweg and ludi 1999 kebede et al 2021 and watershed scales e g berihun et al 2020 betrie et al 2011 khelifa et al 2017 melaku et al 2018 nyssen et al 2010 wang et al 2007 a plot scale study conducted in different agro ecological environments of the upper blue nile basin showed that land management practices reduced the sediment loss rate by 11 68 ebabu et al 2019 likewise land management practices such as the construction of stone bunds reduced sediment loss rates by 27 100 in different watersheds in ethiopia and eritrea gebrernichael et al 2005 herweg and ludi 1999 kebede et al 2021 and mihertie et al 2021 reported that different land management practices tested on cropland soil amendments and agronomic practices reduced the sediment loss rate by 13 53 previous studies in humid areas of the upper blue nile basin e g berihun et al 2020 betrie et al 2011 melaku et al 2018 lemma et al 2019 demonstrated that cross slope land management practices stone soil bunds grass contour strips have reduced sediment loss by 25 60 by creating retention areas and reducing slope length such practices were reported to be even more effective 56 76 reductions in semi arid watersheds of northern ethiopia e g gebrernichael et al 2005 in the sbaihia watershed tunisia land management practices reduced sediment loss rates by an average of 22 khelifa et al 2017 a similar study by ricci et al 2020 found that the combined application of contour farming and reforestation practices reduced sediment loss by 20 38 in the carapelle watershed italy similar impacts of alternative land use and management practices have also been reported in other regions of the world for example bagagiolo et al 2018 italy mango et al 2011 kenya and wang et al 2007 china reported that land management practices reduced sediment loss rates by 4 86 this study also revealed that compared to the use of individual land use and management options the combined impacts of alternative land use and management practice options resulted in greater reductions in the sediment loss rate in the study watershed therefore our results imply that implementing appropriate land use and management options could substantially reduce sediment loss and related consequences hence the spatial estimates of sediment loss rates fig 8 should help to prioritize areas for the implementation of effective land use and management practices in the study watershed it is worth to mention that development of different land use options by land capability classification approach would not indicate the best land use and management option in terms of productivities or profitability for maximizing livelihood of the community thus to minimize this type of limitations future research in the study area should evaluate the impact of these alternative land use and management options on the socio economic dimensions hence selection of best land use and management options should consider the impact these options on socio economic aspects beyond the hydrological dynamics for future decision making and land use management policies 4 conclusions we evaluated the impacts of alternative land use and management options in reducing runoff and sediment loss by integrating field measurements at the watershed and plot scales with model simulations in the laguna watershed a sub humid watershed of the upper blue nile basin ethiopia in doing so five land use and management options were developed based on watershed land capability and best land management practices the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate and evaluate the individual and combined impacts of alternative land use and land management options on runoff and sediment loss rates in the laguna watershed our results revealed that the individual impacts of different alternative land use and land management options could reduce runoff by 10 41 and sediment loss by 32 89 compared to current practices i e the baseline case furthermore the combined impacts of the best alternative land use change and land management options i e conversion of croplands to improved forage grass and forest combined with the implementation of best land management practices further reduce both runoff and sediment loss overall our results suggest that the implementation of different land management practices integrated with improved forage grass and forest plantation on suitable areas and vulnerable areas for land degradation has the potential to rehabilitate degraded watersheds in the ethiopian highlands and similar environments elsewhere the implementation of such management options should consider the existing farming practices of the area moreover our results could provide suitable insights for researchers land managers and decision makers as they develop land and water resource conservation planning frameworks additional research should also be conducted on the other impacts of land use and management practices such as the impact on socioeconomic related issues for any future selection and recommendation credit authorship
