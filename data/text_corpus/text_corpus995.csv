4975,monitoring the changes in glaciers and their impact on melt runoff is significant to assess the availability of water resources in the himalayan basins in this study the spatial processes in hydrology sphy model has been incorporated with variable degree day factors coupled with temperature index model in the baspa river basin a major tributary of satluj river located in western himalaya the temporal glacier maps derived from the landsat satellite sensors and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived snow covered area sca maps have been used to compute the snow and glacier melt runoff separately the sca maps generated through the model were found comparable to the modis derived sca maps for the years 2010 and 2018 model simulation results showed that sphy based computed flow at the outlet i e sangla gauge was found satisfactory when compared to the observed flow and r2 computed 0 7 the contribution from glacier melt has been found to be reduced from 18 to 12 while snow melt contribution increased from 58 to 64 from 2000 to 2018 on the basis of analysis of the 17 watersheds i e dominated by snow and glaciers out of 30 watersheds created in the basin the flow from glacier melt in glacier dominated watersheds is increasing while in other watersheds it is reducing due to reduced glacier cover on an average glacier melt has decreased 14 and 44 snow melt increased 24 and 42 and rain flow rainfall induced runoff 31 and 40 for the year 2011 to 2018 with respect to the year 2003 from these 17 watersheds as per sphy corresponding to glacier map of the year 2000 the glacier ice volume has been computed around 13 41 km3 while for the glacier map of 2018 it has been reduced around 10 99 km3 keywords sphy gridded model snowmelt runoff glacier melt runoff snow cover degree day factor baspa river himalayan basin 1 introduction snow and glaciers covered area and runoff generated due to melt is having an important role in the hydrology of glaciated basin the himalaya plays a prominent role in the precipitation and spatial temporal distribution of runoff through their orographic effect and water storage in the form of seasonal snow and glacier systems as well as ground water systems immerzeel et al 2009 contrary to glaciers seasonal snow accumulates and discharges water mainly within one annual cycle the himalaya has vast resources of snow and glaciers and provides water to the population living in the indus ganges and brahmaputra basins kumar et al 2018 kulkarni 2012 xu et al 2009 singh and jain 2002 in comparison to the ganga and the brahmaputra the indus basin is more dependent on upstream water resources because of its very arid downstream climate westerly influenced precipitation regimes and large glacier systems lutz et al 2014 immerzeel and bierkens 2012 schaner et al 2012 snow glacier resources are changing with climate change over the years regional hydrologic studies suggest a decrease in snow and ice extent over the coming century and this will be most detrimental in the indus and brahmaputra watersheds because glacier runoff plays a significant role in these basins lutz et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2014 thayyen and gergan 2010 kulkarni et al 2007 singh et al 2006 over the last decades glaciers are depleting at varying rates immerzeel et al 2014 most glaciers on earth have retreated due to global atmospheric warming during the 20th century zemp et al 2019 for example in the himalaya farinotti et al 2015 bolch et al 2012 the alps rabatel et al 2018 the andes kozhikkodan and de souza 2017 and the rocky mountains clarke et al 2015 demuth et al 2014 the changes in glacier cover in himalaya have been studied extensively by many investigators kulkarni and karyakarte 2014 bolch et al 2012 some of the studies have linked the significant changes in the streamflows of the himalayan rivers to the accelerated shrinking of glaciers romshoo et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2010 in the past 5 years a few studies have attempted to quantify snowmelt and or glacier melt runoff for the himalayan regions using glacio hydrological models and a variety of gridded climate data products lutz et al 2014 bliss et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2010 it has been projected that 30 88 of the present glacier ice volume could vanish in the himalaya indicating a major threat to water resources by 2100 engelhardt et al 2017 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 immerzeel et al 2010 the changes in glacier areas are also likely to influence the runoff trends in the 21st century i e runoff could increase in the initial decades and then decrease or cease due to substantial decrease in glacier area bliss et al 2014 lutzet al 2014 bolch et al 2012 in the himalayan region the retreat of glaciers will have a large impact as glaciers play an important role in river runoff huss and hock 2018 time series analysis of observational records burger et al 2018 is a useful tool to establish general data trends but is of limited use when observations are scarce in space and time and cannot provide insights into which processes drive observed changes additionally while satellite based glacier inventories barcaza et al 2017 malmros et al 2016 falaschi et al 2013 aided the establishment of baseline areal changes they do not generally assess mass balance or volumes change and cannot be used to explain the causes of observed changes therefore there is a need for an integrated approach to understand the midterm and long term changes in glaciers and glacier runoff in the high elevation catchments of the himalayan region keeping in view the above concern our main aims are to estimate the corresponding glacier contribution to total flow and impact assessment of snow glacier change on flow or runoff in the recent past these aims are addressed through application of a physically oriented and fully distributed glacio hydrological model in situ data and glacier change estimates for a basin located in western himalaya therefore in this study sphy model has been simulated in two times i 2003 2010 and ii 2011 2018 utilizing variable degree day factors to highlight the effect of snow and glacier changes on runoff 2 the study area and data sources in the present study baspa basin has been selected to carry out the snow glacier melt runoff study baspa river is a major tributary of the great river satluj which originates from tibet in great himalayan mountain range at an elevation of more than 5141 m above mean sea level a few km downstream of the indo china border satluj river meets its biggest tributary the spiti river joining satluj from a north westerly direction and having its source close to kunjamla after the confluence with spiti river satluj river takes some 70 km run through kinnar in a south westerly direction until its confluence with its second major tributary baspa river which joins it from south eastern direction baspa river is a major tributary of satluj river which originates in the western himalayan region baspa river basin corresponds with the moderate around 1790 m to extreme high elevation around 6442 m based topography and therefore the climate of the baspa river basin is truly diverse in the upper portion of the basin the westerly weather disturbances are dominated and produce enormous amount of the precipitation mir et al 2017 fig 1 the geographical extent of the baspa river basin lies between 31 05 to 31 30 n latitudes and 78 00 to 78 50 e longitudes baspa river basically originates from arsomang and baspa bamak glaciers and after traveling around 75 km it discharges into satluj river at karcham the basin area is calculated around 1100 km2 out of which 18 of the area of the basin is highly glaciated there are four main glaciers such as baspa bamak shaune garang jorya garang and karu present in the basin the streamflow is mainly generated from snow cover and glacier melt the mean annual rainfall of the basin computes around 800 mm to 1400 mm and the average min and maximum temperature of the basin corresponded as 11 and 32 3 meteorological data in this study to setup the sphy model various thematic data layers such as landuse landcover lulc

properties hihydrosoil version 1 2 2016 based soil map has been utilized http soilgrids1km isric org the details about the soil map and their parameters are given by de boer 2016 for dem shuttle radar topographic mission srtm based dem with 30 m spatial resolution has been utilized for the extraction of topographic parameters https earthexplorer usgs gov for the meteorological datasets indian meteorological department imd gridded datasets 0 25 0 25 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with site data chirps available at 0 05 resolution scale have been utilized gupta et al 2020 prakash 2019 both the datasets have been interpolated at the same scale 0 05 0 05 and then the quantile regression based on cumulative density function cdf a bias correction method has been applied to correct the chirp precipitation with reference to imd precipitation datasets as per previous studies the quantile mapping method has been found the best method for the bias correction of the precipitation datasets singh and xiaosheng 2019 cannon et al 2015 the reliability of chips precipitation data has already been evaluated by few researchers across india and they resulted that chirps performed superior among other global precipitation datasets especially in capturing precipitation extremes gupta et al 2020 prakash 2019 total 15 precipitation grids have been found closer to the study area and hence utilized for re gridding and bias correction python programming based xarray and numpy modules have been utilized byers et al 2017 daily minimum maximum and average temperature data was obtained from imd has been utilized for the analysis for model calibration the observed discharge 2003 2018 available at sangla gauge has been utilized for the preparation of glacier maps landsat mss tm etm tm and landsat 8 satellite sensors based dataset have been utilized fortunately for the year 2006 the selected study area was in the center of etm scene almost not affected by scan line errors sle mir et al 2017 for snow covers extraction modis mod10a2 having 500 m spatial resolution datasets from 2003 to 2018 were downloaded https nsidc org data mod10a2 and processed to extract snow covered area by adopting the methodology as previously used by shukla et al 2017 the snow covered area sca evaluation has been done on the monthly scale and therefore modis 8 daily scenes were processed and then aggregated at the monthly scale hall and riggs 2016 the details of the satellite datasets have been provided in table 1 4 methodology 4 1 snow covered areas and glacier mapping for snow mapping modis mod10a2 8 daily satellite derived snow cover areas have been utilized for the year 2003 2018 the mod10a2 snow cover data products contain data fields for maximum snow cover extent over an eight day compositing period the modis mod10a2 consists of 1200 km by 1200 km tiles that employs a normalized difference snow index ndsi and other criteria tests shukla et al 2017 to highlight the elevation wise similarities in the distribution of snow covers the fractional snow cover corresponding to multiple elevation zones were computed on the monthly scale for both sphy derived snow covers and modis derived snow covers shukla et al 2017 carried out a study for satluj basin in which all the maps were generated the snow cover areas maps for baspa basin has been extracted from these maps therefore the 8 daily scenes of modis snow cover were aggregated at monthly scales to compare with the sphy derived snow covers as per the study of mir et al 2017 number of glaciers were mapped in the baspa basin for years 1966 1999 2000 and 2000 in this study landsat data series based satellite scenes have been utilized for the year 2018 for the landsat 8 etm and tm data images the glaciers were delimited using band ratios of near infrared and shortwave infrared bands singh and goyal 2018 shukla et al 2010 the debris free glacier or clean ice glacier mask was generated in the binary image utilizing threshold values between 2 2 and 2 5 several misclassified glacier areas were eliminated by post processing of the data finally the glacier images were converted from binary to vector data layers the detail glacier mapping methodology has been employed previously by mir et al 2017 to find out the glacier changes corresponding to each elevation zone the spatial analyst module of arcgis was utilized to find out the correlation between glacier changes and corresponding elevation the variation in glaciers was highlighted with respect to elevation in the progressive manner from 2000 to 2018 the changes in glaciers with respect to elevation have been analyzed to highlight the elevation dependent warming and its impact on glacier mass changes 4 2 snowmelt and glacier melt hydrology of sphy model sphy is a spatially distributed and can be applied on a grid by grid basis terink et al 2015 sphy works in a python based environment using pc raster and its source codes are freely available http www sphy nl in sphy each grid value is represented average over the grid in sphy model for glaciers a sub grid variability exists and a grid can be defined as glacier free completely covered by glacier or partially covered by glacier the glacier free grid fraction of grid can be defined as snow covered or snow free the grid area which is free from snow can be defined by vegetation open water and bare soil terink et al 2015 the soil column structure of sphy model is quite similar to vic model terink et al 2015 including two upper oil and third groundwater storages the three drainage components surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow can be defined in sphy model sphy computes i e each grid precipitation in the form of snow or rain depending on the defined critical temperature value precipitation that falls on the ground can be intercepted by vegetation and some amount or whole can be evaporated in spyhy the snow storage is updated with snow accumulation and or snowmelt surface runoff is a part of liquid precipitation whereas the rest infiltrates into the soil in sphy the resulting soil moisture is subject to evapotranspiration et which is depended on the soil properties and fractional vegetation cover whereas the rest contributes to streamflow or discharge by means of the baseflow resulting from the groundwater zone and lateral flow from the first soil layer in sphy the modified hargreaves equation that is a function of temperature only has been used for the et computation terink et al 2015 as per the earlier studies it was observed that hargreaves method performed well over himalaya while in the absence of large amount of the datasets singh and goyal 2017 arnold et al 2012 the grid specific runoff that is available for routing can be contributed by surface runoff lateral flow baseflow snowmelt and glacier melt sphy model requires physical thematic data inputs such as digital elevation model dem landuse lancdcover lulc map glacier map highlighting clean ice glaciers and debris glaciers soil parameters such as root depth maximum capillary rise seepage groundwater parameters such as baseflow groundwater depth aquifer yield the meteorological datasets such as temperature precipitation radiation is minimally required to setup the model the snow covered area sca can be utilized for the validation of sphy generated snow cover the sphy model provides all watershed components such as total runoff snowmelt runoff baseflow et groundwater runoff groundwater level glacier melt runoff and rainfall runoff in daily monthly and annual basis terink et al 2015 this study mainly explores the snow and glacier melt runoff characteristics of the selected baspa river himalayan basin and therefore the focus of this study has been given to the processes and parameters relevant to the snow and glacier hydrology the equations of the other components and processes are previously discussed in detailed terink et al 2009 the snow glacier melt runoff hydrology has been described below in further sections 4 2 1 snowfall and rainfall in sphy the dynamic snowfall mass balancing can be performed at a daily time step using a temperature threshold the falling precipitation can be defined as a snowfall solid form and rain liquid form the snow accumulation or snowpack or snowfall can be calculated as eq 1 1 p s t p et i f t avg t t crit 0 i f t avg t t crit where p s t mm is the snowfall on the day t pe t mm can be defined as the effective precipitation on day t t avg t c is the mean air temperature on day t and t crit is a calibrated temperature threshold for precipitation to fall as snow whereas the precipitation falls as liquid precipitation can be computed as eq 2 2 p l t l i q u i d p r e c i p i t a t i o n p et i f t avg t t crit 0 i f t avg t t crit 4 2 2 snowmelt storage and runoff sphy model uses a degree day approach using temperature index model for the calculation of snowmelt terink et al 2015 the application of degree day models is widespread in cryospheric models that is based on an empirical relationship between melt rate and air temperature terink et al 2015 based on the degree day approach the potential snowmelt can be calculated as eq 3 3 a pot t t avg t ddf s if t avg t 0 0 if t avg t 0 with a pot t mm is defined as the potential snowmelt on day t and ddfs mm c 1 day 1 is denoted as a calibrated degree day factor for snow the actual snowmelt can be limited by the snow storage at the end of the previous day and is computed as eq 4 4 a act t m i n a pot t ss t 1 here a act t mm is defined as the actual snowmelt on day t and ss t 1 mm is denoted as the snow storage on day t 1 after that the snow storage from day t 1 is updated to the present day t utilizing the actual snowmelt a act t and the solid precipitation ps t when temperature falls below the melting point then the meltwater that is frozen in the snowpack during time t 1 will be added to the snow storage as eq 5 5 ss t ss t 1 p s t ssw t 1 i f t avg t 0 ss t 1 p s t a act t i f t avg t 0 here ss t is defined as the snow storage on day t ss t 1 is described as the snow storage on day t 1 p s t is the solid precipitation on day t a act t is the actual snowmelt on day t and ssw t 1 is the amount of frozen meltwater on day t 1 the units for all terms are mm the maximum of meltwater that can freeze sswmax mm is thus limited by the thickness of the snow storage terink et al 2015 the total snow storage sst mm consists of the snow storage and the freeze meltwater can be calculated as eq 6 6 ss t t ss t ssw t 1 g l a c f where 1 g l a c f is defined as the fractional grid that is not covered by glaciers in sphy model snow melt and snow accumulation can only be calculated when grid fraction determined as the land surface in sphy the runoff from snow sro mm can be calculated when the air temperature reaches above the melting point terink et al 2015 the change in meltwater stored in the snow can be accounted as eq 7 7 δ s s w ssw t ssw t 1 4 2 3 glacier process and runoff in sphy glaciers are considered melting surfaces which can partly or completely cover the grid cell glacier melt is also calculated by the degree day approach and the melt rates of debris covered and debris free glaciers vary terink et al 2015 the melt from the debris free glaciers can be computed as eq 8 8 a ci t t avg t ddf ci f ci if t avg t 0 0 if t avg t 0 where ddf ci mm c 1 day 1 is a degree day factor for debris free glaciers and can be calibrated for the given area grid f ci is the fraction of debris free glaciers within a grid the daily melt from the debris covered glaciers can be calculated as eq 9 9 a dc t t avg t ddf dc f dc if t avg t 0 0 if t avg t 0 where ddf dc mm c 1 day 1 is a degree day factor for debris covered glaciers and can be calibrated for the given area grid f dc is the fraction of debris covered glaciers within a grid the total glacier melt a glac t i e summing the melt water from debris free and debris covered glaciers can be accounted as eq 10 10 a glac t a ci t a dc t g l a c f from the total melt from glaciers a fraction of the glacier melt percolates to the groundwater and the remaining fractions run off finally the generated runoff gro mm from glacier melt is defined as eq 11 11 gr ot a glac t 1 g l a c r o f 4 2 4 surface runoff total runoff and routing in sphy soil water processes can be determined by the three soil layers such as root zone sub zone and groundwater layer the equations related to soil processes are previously described by terink et al 2009 and therefore not discussed in detail sphy is a water balance model and therefore the sphy only accounts for stresses regarding water shortage and water excess sphy uses an et reduction parameter etredwet that has 0 value in soil saturated condition and otherwise 1 terink et al 2015 sphy uses the saturation excess overland flow process i e hewlettian runoff to compute the surface runoff ro terink et al 2015 as eq 12 12 ro sw 1 sw 1 s a t if sw 1 sw 1 s a t 0 if sw 1 sw 1 s a t here sw 1 mm is the water content in the first soil layer and sw 1 s a t mm is defined as the saturated water content of the first soil layer in sphy the exceeded water from the field capacity has been used for lateral flow terink et al 2015 sphy assumes the lateral flow travel time to be dependent on the field capacity saturated conductivity and saturated content terink et al 2015 in sphy water can percolate from the first soil layer to the second soil layer and from the second to the third soil layer in sphy water only percolates when the water content will exceed the field capacity of that layer terink et al 2016 sphy utilizes exponential decay weighting function terink et al 2015 in the precipitation groundwater response model similar to swat model arnold et al 2012 for baseflow computation sphy uses steady state response of groundwater flow and water table fluctuations which can be resulted by the non steady response of the groundwater flow arnold et al 2012 in this model baseflow can only be occurred when the amount of water stored in the third soil layer exceeds a certain threshold for runoff routing sphy computes for each grid the accumulated amount of water that flows out of the grid into its neighbouring downstream grid through the accuflux pcraster built in function which computes runoff at each grid from its upstream grids and also adding the runoff amount that is generated within the grid itself terink et al 2015 4 3 model calibration in sphy both manual and auto calibration can be performed in this study mostly real time observed and measured datasets and other parameters coefficients have been used to get the practical parametric response the manual calibration based on trial and error basis was preferred sometimes it has been seen that the auto calibration does not give the reliable estimates of modeling parameters when large numbers of parameters are involved terink et al 2015 during modeling the best fitted value of the parameter has been calculated as per trial and error method the observed daily flow m3 s is available from 2003 to 2018 and thus utilized for the present study for manual calibration parameters such as temperature threshold to fall as snow tcrit degree day factor for snow ddfs glacier fraction of grid cell glacf degree day factor for debris free glaciers ddfci degree day factor for debris covered glaciers ddfdc and threshold for baseflow to occur bfthres have been taken into consideration modis based snow cover area have been extracted to compare the sphy derived snow cover on the monthly scale for the year 2010 and 2018 so that snow parameters required to run the model which can be accurately defined in the model and modeling accuracy can be improved in this study the real time digitized glacier maps characterizing by debris free glaciers and debris covered glaciers were used to define the glacier properties over the basin other parameters e g related to soil and lulc values are set based on the literature survey terink et al 2015 and standard global values suggested by sphy model terink et al 2015 which have been developed specifically for the himalayan conditions utilizing large number of datasets and parameters as an input to the sphy model the model has been setup for the two time durations i e 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 to understand the snow melt and glacier melt induced flow or runoff variations the sphy model was simulated at the daily time step at 250 m spatial resolution scale and sphy re gridded all data inputs at the same scale terink et al 2015 however the modeling variables can be computed on a daily monthly and yearly scales as per the user s choice the modeling outcomes have been evaluated at the outlet and site scale 4 4 snowmelt glacier melt and glacier area changes for analyzing the changes in snow melt and glacier melt flow or runoff the whole time series 2003 2018 was divided in two time series ts sets i ts1 2003 2010 and ii ts2 2011 2018 the main purpose of the dividing time series sets in two durations was to analyze the effect varying climate conditions such as temperature and precipitation variations along with observed glacier mass changes on the resultant glacier melt runoff as per the comparison of both period glacier maps i e 2000 and 2011 a significant mass reduction was observed therefore while setup the sphy for the ts1 i e 2003 2010 the glacier map prepared for the year 2000 was utilized whereas during ts2 setup in sphy the glacier map prepared for the year 2011 was utilized the changes in glacier mass is compared to the corresponding elevations to find out the elevation dependent warming and their impacts on glacier and glacier melt runoff changes a very few studies highlighted that temperature and precipitation is highly varying over himalaya and showed the elevation dependent warming especially in last 20 years they recorded the maximum variations sharma and goyal 2020 ren et al 2017 singh and goyal 2016 the main water balance components such as simulated flow sim flow rainfall induced runoff rain flow snow melt runoff snow melt and glacier melt runoff glacier melt have been computed at the outlet i e sangla gauge small watersheds considering 30 sites shown in fig 1 on the main stream and tributaries were created out of 30 sites 17 independent sites located on the tributaries were chosen dominated by snow and glaciers which have been used to explore the snow melt and glacier melt runoff variation glaciers are situated at the extreme high elevation zones whereas non glaciated areas covered by snow situated at the moderate elevation zones these snow melt and glacier melt changes have been analyzed on the monthly seasonal and annual basis during both durations e g 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 in addition to glacier maps of 2000 and 2011 used for the period of ts1 and ts2 2018 glacier map has also been used for ts2 5 results and discussion 5 1 snow and glacier mapping on the basis of glacier maps a significant reduction has been computed in the glacier areas from 2000 to 2018 fig 2 a significant variation in snow covered areas scas fig 3 also observed by previous studies shukla et al 2017 mir et al 2017 have identified in different portions of the basin therefore to highlight the effect of these snow and glacier areas variations different glacier maps e g 2000 2006 2011 and 2018 were used so the effect of glacier areas reduction can be easily incorporated in the modeling outcomes the accuracy of sphy derived snow covers has been tested with reference to the modis derived snow covers for the year 2010 and 2018 figs 3 5 the visual comparison of sphy and modis derived snow covered areas sca can be seen in fig 3 in fig 3 based on the monthly plots one can see that most of months have shown similar pattern of sca when compared to sphy and modis scas for both time series durations however during may and june months some inconsistency in sca can be seen when compared both datasets fig 3 the regression plots between sphy and modis derived scas have been drawn and the corresponding r2 values have shown in fig 4 as per the regression plots fig 4 around 78 correlation existed during 2010 and 92 correlation existed during 2018 which is found quite satisfactory especially over the himalayan basin in fig 4a and 4b except june to august months where sphy derived scas show slightly overestimated otherwise most of months showed a good match between sphy and modis derived scas several articles already discussed about the inconsistency existed in the modis mod10a2 snow cover data products zhao et al 2019 weidinger et al 2018 due to the presence of clouds the fractional snow covers based on the 10 elevation zones have been derived for the year 2010 to compare the sphy derived fractional snow covered area with the modis derived snow covered areas fig 5 snow cover variations with respect to elevation zones have also been compared elevation zones 10 nos have computed from dem fig 1 which highlight the variations in the snow covered areas with respect to 10 elevation zones ez through box plots as per fig 1 ez1 to ez3 corresponded to lower elevations 1800 3000 m ez4 to ez6 3001 4500 m corresponded with moderate elevation areas and ez7 to ez10 4500 m corresponded to extreme high elevation areas fig 5 a j illustrates the monthly comparison of sca distribution between sphy and modis based on the year 2010 in fig 6 it can be observed that as per the increasing ezs the distribution of sca increases in lower ezs such as ez1 to ez4 only small amount of sca can be observed only for january february and december months whereas moderate to extreme high ezs ez4 most of months show a significant amount of distribution of sca except ablation period i e may to august fig 5 when compared the ez wise distribution of sca between modis and sphy a good correlation has been observed around 80 except few ezs where 5 to 10 differences in scas has been recorded overall both datasets have shown a good agreement between sphy and modis derived scas based on the above observations this elevation zone wise comparison of sphy derived snow covers with modis data showed a good match with the real time modis derived snow cover datasets and observed discharge data the derivation of fractional snow covers also helped to optimize the fractional snow parameter in sphy which is an important parameter in accounting snow melt runoff volume 5 2 assessment of water balance components the model parameters have manually adjusted and modeling fitted parameter values detail have been given in the table 2 the calibration strength of the modeling framework has been tested using coefficient of determination r2 singh and goyal 2017 the scatter plots between observed and simulated flow after parameters adjustment at sangla gauge are shown in fig 6b and 6d the time series plots fig 6a and 6c show that simulated discharge at the outlet of the catchment significantly captured high and low flow values as per the observed values the r2 values are computed as 0 62 and 0 86 for ts1 i e 2003 2010 and ts2 i e 2011 2018 respectively the computed r2 values on a daily scale are found satisfactory as compared to the previous studies singh and goyal 2017 jain et al 2010 the modeling accuracy of snow glacier areas will majorly depend on how snow and glacier parameters are accurately input to the model abbaspour et al 2015 the water balance components such as simulated flow sim flow rain flow rainfall induced flow or runoff snow melt glacier melt and base flow have been computed at the outlet i e sangla gauge fig 7 which shows an average annual distribution of each component during the years 2003 to 2018 in two time series sets i e ts1 2003 2010 and ts2 2011 2018 total 16 years in figs 7a 7b it is clearly seen that snowmelt contribution varies from around 50 52 is more than glacier melt varies from around 12 14 against the total flow the contribution of runoff from baseflow is also found significant during may to september months 15 5 3 changes in snow melt glacier melt and rainfall runoff fig 8 shows distribution of the five main water balance components such as sim flow snow melt glacier melt rain flow and base flow on an annual basis which highlight the timing of each component throughout the year as per the annual plots the potential snow melting starts from april and it continues till october fig 8 however the amount of snow melt varies from year to year the maximum snow melt was computed between late may to july fig 8 the annual total maximum one day flow recorded around 200 m3 s especially during monsoon season whereas other components such as snow melt glacier melt rain flow and base flow vary one day maximum up to 120 m3 s 40 m3 s 70 m3 s 20 m3 s respectively to find out changes in the four main water balance components e g sim flow rain flow snow melt and glacier melt the averaged of the water balance components of both ts has been computed and then compared through the box plots fig 9 as per the sim flow scenarios a slight increase has been observed from 2003 to 2010 to 2011 2018 however in case of ts2 i e 2011 2018 the extreme cases were increased and can be seen in box plots fig 9 in case of glacier melt both time series have shown almost same median 12 m3 s but in case of ts2 a slight decrease is recorded in upper quantiles fig 9 as per snow melt observation fig 9 ts1 have shown higher values in upper quantile ranges than ts2 but median is recorded almost similar for both ts durations in case of rain flow fig 9 except upper quantiles no significant variability was detected based on the above observation no significant conclusion can be made however an enormous variability in upper quantile among all the water balance components can be observed fig 10 displays the year wise monthly averaged variation in sim flow snow melt glacier melt and rain flow grouped into two ts durations i e 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 computed at the outlet of the basin i e sangla gauge these plots highlight a year to year variability in monthly averaged components in case of sim flow fig 10a to 10b the highest variability has been recorded from june to september months mainly in the monsoon months the variability in the flow during monsoon i e from june to september months revealed the existed variability in precipitation and temperature observed in recent past year rao et al 2018 singh and goyal 2017 similar observations can be notified for snow melt during mar to may for example as per figs 10e to 10f during 2011 2014 the maximum snow melt 120 m3 s was recorded for the year 2014 while other years recorded maximum snow melt between 60 m3 s to 100 m3 s in case of glacier melt fig 10c and 10d no significant variability has been recorded however the month wise change can be observed in the glacier amount in case of rain flow fig 10g to 10 h the maximum variability e g extreme high and low peaks during monsoon months can be clearly observed as discussed above it was observed that there are changes in water balance components because of changes in precipitation and temperatures as per the studies carried out earlier in himalaya region average temperature has been increased over the himalaya 1 dimri et al 2018 sanjay et al 2017 and the precipitation significantly varied over western himalaya especially in recent past years sharma and goyal 2020 shafiq et al 2016 singh and goyal 2016 therefore a detail analysis of change has been performed by doing the monthly assessment of the main four water balance components i e sim flow snow melt rain flow and glacier melt to find out the changes during both the ts durations i e 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 among all four water balance components the monthly scenarios have been generated and a comparative assessment has been done between ts1 i e 2003 2010 and ts2 2011 2018 these results have shown in the supplementary file as supplementary figs 1 and 2 sf1 and sf2 as per sim flow fig sf1a it is found highly variable throughout the year as per december to march july and july trends fig sf1a sim flow is increased during both ts during april may august september and october fig sf1b sim flow is slightly decreased in october and september sim flow scenarios from 2003 to 2010 showed an increase while 2011 2018 based scenarios showed a decrease fig sf1a in case of rain flow as per ts2 observations a decrease has been observed in case of ts2 january to march an increase has been observed fig sf1a similarly during october to march as per ts1 rain flow has been decreased while in ts2 february and march showed an increase in rain flow but as per ts2 during january february march august and september it has been increased fig sf1a overall majority of plots showed that rain flow has been slightly increase during 2003 to 2018 as per plots fig sf1b during october to december a slight decrease in glacier melt has been reported during 2011 2018 while an increase is reported as per 2003 2010 however from january to september most of the plots showed an increase in glacier melt in both ts except april in case of both ts fig sf1b and september in case of ts2 only where glacier melt was slightly decreased fig sf1 snow melt is found highly variable in both ts i e 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 from october to september snow melt trends showed that it is decreased during october november march and april in case of both ts durations whereas it is significantly increased in december january february may june and july mostly in case of ts2 i e 2011 2018 figs sf1b during april to september fig sf1b it is decreased in most of months especially in case of ts1 i e 2003 2011 overall plots clarified that with respect to ts1 i e 2003 2010 the contribution of snow melt in total flow has been increased during 2011 to 2018 based on the above observation the three most conclusive observations can be made i rain flow is found highly variable during 2003 2018 because the most of months during 2003 2010 have shown a decrease in rain flow and during ts2 i e 2011 2018 with respect to ts1 it is increased during january february march august and september months ii overall the snow melt was increased while comparing ts1 vs ts2 table 3 however because of an increasing temperature over the himalaya as reported in previous studies shafiq et al 2016 singh and goyal 2016 the ratio of precipitation to snow and rain is changing therefore due to less amount of precipitation in form of snowfall the melt contribution from snow has been decreased in some months mostly in non glaciated areas and therefore rain flow was increased during january february and march due to the increasing temperature and reduction in the glacier mass over himalaya the contribution from glacier melt was decreased during ts2 as compared to the ts1 table 3 table 3 showed the observations from 17 stations which are found glacier dominated 5 4 effect of glacier area reduction in glacier melt runoff for effective monitoring the changes in snow and glacier melt flow or runoff around 30 watersheds were drawn in the basin taking out of this 17 sites dominated with glaciers and snow covered areas as shown in fig 1 and then the annual time series trends were estimated during 2003 2018 fig sf2 in this analysis one more glacier map of 2018 was used in addition to 2011 for the duration ts2 the glacier melt contribution at the outlet during 2003 2010 computed as 15 as per glacier map of 2000 it computed 13 during 2011 2018 as per glacier map of 2011 and it recorded around 10 during 2011 2018 as per glacier map of 2018 due to reduction in glacier mass similarly the snow melt contribution was found to be 50 52 and 56 and rain flow 19 21 and 22 and base flow contribution 16 14 and 12 corresponding to the maps of 2000 2011 and 2018 this base flow is delayed flow which comes through recharge from rain snow and glacier melt if it is distributed in same proportion then flow comes out to be 18 15 12 due to glacier melt 58 61 64 due to snow melt for the years 2000 2011 and 2018 and rain flow 24 for all the years all the watersheds are having different snow glacier therefore the total contribution of melt water from snow covered areas and glacier areas varies at each site level the contribution from each watershed has shown in supplementary file sf2 and given in table 3 the glacier melt varies from around 200 mm corresponded to site 9 to 1500 mm corresponded to site 26 across all stations similar plots have been made for snow melt i e snow q which varies from around 40 mm corresponded to sites 8 and 9 to 350 mm corresponded to site 26 as per the observations sf2 among 17 sites mostly dominated with glaciers most of sites showed an increase in snow melt during 2003 to 2018 from table 3 it can be seen that glacier melt runoff has increased in case of watersheds 2 and 3 while decreased for other watersheds the reason behind this that the watersheds 2 and 3 are heavily glaciated and also not much change in glacier cover have been found in these watersheds the watershed such as 8 9 and 12 located on northern side in high altitude areas have lost much glaciers as compared to watersheds located on southern side therefore more reduction in runoff in watersheds of northern side was observed the watersheds 21 23 24 25 and 26 located on lower altitudes have lost much glacier area and therefore contribution in these watersheds have been found to be much less in the year 2018 however contribution of change of sca and rainfall also have been studied the snow melt runoff from all the watersheds have increased fig 11 shows the month wise comparison of glacier melt changes and snow melt between ts1 i e 2003 2010 and ts2 i e 2011 2018 for 17 sites dominated by snow covered areas and glaciers the computation of monthly distribution of amount of snow melt and glacier melt at site level has been found helpful to understand the behavior of total flow while analysing the variability of glacier melt and snow melt in total runoff in baspa basin the glacier melting mostly starts from may and the majority of contribution from glacier melt is recorded till november 10 mm similarly in case of snow melt the major contribution is recorded from late april to october 10 mm therefore the box plots have shown the monthly scenarios of glacier melt and snow melt from may to october months only the box plots highlighted the statistical behaviour of different grouped periods as per fig 11 in case of glacier melt it can be seen that maximum amount is recorded during july to september when compared to ts1 vs ts2 a shift in glacier melt can be observed in most of the stations a slight reduction in the amount of glacier melt was observed during 2011 2018 against 2003 2010 as per the glacier maps of different time periods it can be seen that the small size glaciers were found more sensitive in reducing their mass this explores the monthly fluctuations on the yearly basis in snow melt and glacier melt and also provides the ideas about the snow melt dominant season and glacier melt dominant season throughout the year fig 11 also displays the changes in monthly snow melt during 2003 2018 for 17 sites dominated with snow and glaciers as per the comparison of grouped time series sets i e ts1 and ts2 most of months found highly variable in case of snow melt overall most months showed increase in snow melt during 2011 2018 with respect to ts2 i e 2003 2010 fig 11 and table 3 the increase in snow melt over glaciated areas can be directly correlated with the reduction of snowfall over the basin due to increasing rate of temperature over himalayan glaciers as temperature increases snowfall contribution decreases and rainfall contribution increases in fig 12 a to d a significant amount of glacier area reduction has been computed fig 12e shows the hypsometry of glaciers in different temporal times here hypsometry of glaciers has been calculated to determine the cumulative percentage of glacier area between the elevation zones total six elevation zones at 500 m interval have been calculated the hypsometry of all glacier maps clearly shows that a significant reduction in the lower to extreme elevation areas when compared to glacier map of 2000 with 2006 a very slight reduction in the glacier areas can only be observed especially between 6000 and 6500 m ranges however there is a large gap can be observed at lower to moderate elevation zones e g 4500 5000 m in the glacier maps of 2011 and 2018 vis a vis glacier map of 2000 these changes could be a sign of elevation dependent warming as also discussed previously in some himalayan based studies dimri et al 2018 singh and goyal 2016 this analysis gives an insight about the sensitivity of glacier areas changes with respect to elevation the glacier ice volume has been computed to verify the reduction in the glaciers ice volume as per the changes in glacier maps with respect to time to compare the reduction in glacier ice volume due to melting sphy based glacier ice volume compared with the glacier ice volume computed based on the power equation suggested by prasad et al 2019 prasad et al 2019 developed a volume area relationship considering 298 glaciers which are mostly corresponded to satluj river basin the glacier ice volume has been computed for the four different temporal glacier maps i e 2000 2006 2011 and 2018 using above two methods and given in table 4 in 2000 the total glacier ice volume was recorded around 13 09 13 41 km3 while in 2018 it was significantly reduced recorded as 13 47 10 99 km3 as per the comparison sphy has found comparable in the calculation of glacier ice volume with respect to the glacier ice volume computed through the volume area equation 6 conclusions in the present study snow glacier melt contribution and its variation over the years with changes in snow and glaciers in upper himalayan basin has been analysed snow cover area was simulated using the sphy model and it was found in good agreement with the area obtained using modis data the glacier maps of 2000 2011 and 2018 have been used to compute the flow or runoff contribution due to glacier melt snow melt and rain flow the flow from glacier melt found to be 18 15 12 from snow melt runoff 58 61 64 corresponding to glacier maps of 2000 2011 and 2018 while rain flow 24 for all the years thus total contribution from snow and glacier melt flow at the outlet comes out to be 76 the analysis was also carried out for each month and it was found that there is an increase in total runoff during pre monsoon and post monsoon months as per the overall comparative assessment between two time series durations total flow has been slightly increased across the basin on the basis of analysis of total 17 watersheds i e dominated with snow and glaciers out of 30 watersheds created on tributaries at the d s of snow and glacier cover area it was found that due to glacier recession in the glacier dominated watersheds glacier melt is reducing it was found that the watersheds at the lower altitude are reducing glacier cover and thereby runoff have also decreased in upper part of the basin the glaciers in the watersheds located on the northern side are reducing more as compared to the watersheds located on southern side therefore the flow from watersheds located on northern side are reducing while it is increasing from the watersheds of the southern side average contribution from these 17 watershed glacier melt has decreased 14 and 44 snow melt increased 24 and 42 and rain flow 31 and 40 for the year 20 011 to 2018 with respect to the year 2003 the contributions from rain flow have increased over the years indicating change in precipitation from snow to rain while flow from snowmelt has increased due to more melting as per sphy corresponding to glacier map of the year 2000 the glacier ice volume has been computed around 13 41 km3 while for the glacier map of 2018 it has been reduced around 10 99 km3 author statement all authors have equally contributed for the article like writing data analysis and writing conclusion

4975,monitoring the changes in glaciers and their impact on melt runoff is significant to assess the availability of water resources in the himalayan basins in this study the spatial processes in hydrology sphy model has been incorporated with variable degree day factors coupled with temperature index model in the baspa river basin a major tributary of satluj river located in western himalaya the temporal glacier maps derived from the landsat satellite sensors and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived snow covered area sca maps have been used to compute the snow and glacier melt runoff separately the sca maps generated through the model were found comparable to the modis derived sca maps for the years 2010 and 2018 model simulation results showed that sphy based computed flow at the outlet i e sangla gauge was found satisfactory when compared to the observed flow and r2 computed 0 7 the contribution from glacier melt has been found to be reduced from 18 to 12 while snow melt contribution increased from 58 to 64 from 2000 to 2018 on the basis of analysis of the 17 watersheds i e dominated by snow and glaciers out of 30 watersheds created in the basin the flow from glacier melt in glacier dominated watersheds is increasing while in other watersheds it is reducing due to reduced glacier cover on an average glacier melt has decreased 14 and 44 snow melt increased 24 and 42 and rain flow rainfall induced runoff 31 and 40 for the year 2011 to 2018 with respect to the year 2003 from these 17 watersheds as per sphy corresponding to glacier map of the year 2000 the glacier ice volume has been computed around 13 41 km3 while for the glacier map of 2018 it has been reduced around 10 99 km3 keywords sphy gridded model snowmelt runoff glacier melt runoff snow cover degree day factor baspa river himalayan basin 1 introduction snow and glaciers covered area and runoff generated due to melt is having an important role in the hydrology of glaciated basin the himalaya plays a prominent role in the precipitation and spatial temporal distribution of runoff through their orographic effect and water storage in the form of seasonal snow and glacier systems as well as ground water systems immerzeel et al 2009 contrary to glaciers seasonal snow accumulates and discharges water mainly within one annual cycle the himalaya has vast resources of snow and glaciers and provides water to the population living in the indus ganges and brahmaputra basins kumar et al 2018 kulkarni 2012 xu et al 2009 singh and jain 2002 in comparison to the ganga and the brahmaputra the indus basin is more dependent on upstream water resources because of its very arid downstream climate westerly influenced precipitation regimes and large glacier systems lutz et al 2014 immerzeel and bierkens 2012 schaner et al 2012 snow glacier resources are changing with climate change over the years regional hydrologic studies suggest a decrease in snow and ice extent over the coming century and this will be most detrimental in the indus and brahmaputra watersheds because glacier runoff plays a significant role in these basins lutz et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2014 thayyen and gergan 2010 kulkarni et al 2007 singh et al 2006 over the last decades glaciers are depleting at varying rates immerzeel et al 2014 most glaciers on earth have retreated due to global atmospheric warming during the 20th century zemp et al 2019 for example in the himalaya farinotti et al 2015 bolch et al 2012 the alps rabatel et al 2018 the andes kozhikkodan and de souza 2017 and the rocky mountains clarke et al 2015 demuth et al 2014 the changes in glacier cover in himalaya have been studied extensively by many investigators kulkarni and karyakarte 2014 bolch et al 2012 some of the studies have linked the significant changes in the streamflows of the himalayan rivers to the accelerated shrinking of glaciers romshoo et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2010 in the past 5 years a few studies have attempted to quantify snowmelt and or glacier melt runoff for the himalayan regions using glacio hydrological models and a variety of gridded climate data products lutz et al 2014 bliss et al 2014 immerzeel et al 2010 it has been projected that 30 88 of the present glacier ice volume could vanish in the himalaya indicating a major threat to water resources by 2100 engelhardt et al 2017 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 immerzeel et al 2010 the changes in glacier areas are also likely to influence the runoff trends in the 21st century i e runoff could increase in the initial decades and then decrease or cease due to substantial decrease in glacier area bliss et al 2014 lutzet al 2014 bolch et al 2012 in the himalayan region the retreat of glaciers will have a large impact as glaciers play an important role in river runoff huss and hock 2018 time series analysis of observational records burger et al 2018 is a useful tool to establish general data trends but is of limited use when observations are scarce in space and time and cannot provide insights into which processes drive observed changes additionally while satellite based glacier inventories barcaza et al 2017 malmros et al 2016 falaschi et al 2013 aided the establishment of baseline areal changes they do not generally assess mass balance or volumes change and cannot be used to explain the causes of observed changes therefore there is a need for an integrated approach to understand the midterm and long term changes in glaciers and glacier runoff in the high elevation catchments of the himalayan region keeping in view the above concern our main aims are to estimate the corresponding glacier contribution to total flow and impact assessment of snow glacier change on flow or runoff in the recent past these aims are addressed through application of a physically oriented and fully distributed glacio hydrological model in situ data and glacier change estimates for a basin located in western himalaya therefore in this study sphy model has been simulated in two times i 2003 2010 and ii 2011 2018 utilizing variable degree day factors to highlight the effect of snow and glacier changes on runoff 2 the study area and data sources in the present study baspa basin has been selected to carry out the snow glacier melt runoff study baspa river is a major tributary of the great river satluj which originates from tibet in great himalayan mountain range at an elevation of more than 5141 m above mean sea level a few km downstream of the indo china border satluj river meets its biggest tributary the spiti river joining satluj from a north westerly direction and having its source close to kunjamla after the confluence with spiti river satluj river takes some 70 km run through kinnar in a south westerly direction until its confluence with its second major tributary baspa river which joins it from south eastern direction baspa river is a major tributary of satluj river which originates in the western himalayan region baspa river basin corresponds with the moderate around 1790 m to extreme high elevation around 6442 m based topography and therefore the climate of the baspa river basin is truly diverse in the upper portion of the basin the westerly weather disturbances are dominated and produce enormous amount of the precipitation mir et al 2017 fig 1 the geographical extent of the baspa river basin lies between 31 05 to 31 30 n latitudes and 78 00 to 78 50 e longitudes baspa river basically originates from arsomang and baspa bamak glaciers and after traveling around 75 km it discharges into satluj river at karcham the basin area is calculated around 1100 km2 out of which 18 of the area of the basin is highly glaciated there are four main glaciers such as baspa bamak shaune garang jorya garang and karu present in the basin the streamflow is mainly generated from snow cover and glacier melt the mean annual rainfall of the basin computes around 800 mm to 1400 mm and the average min and maximum temperature of the basin corresponded as 11 and 32 3 meteorological data in this study to setup the sphy model various thematic data layers such as landuse landcover lulc

meteorological department imd gridded datasets 0 25 0 25 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with site data chirps available at 0 05 resolution scale have been utilized gupta et al 2020 prakash 2019 both the datasets have been interpolated at the same scale 0 05 0 05 and then the quantile regression based on cumulative density function cdf a bias correction method has been applied to correct the chirp precipitation with reference to imd precipitation datasets as per previous studies the quantile mapping method has been found the best method for the bias correction of the precipitation datasets singh and xiaosheng 2019 cannon et al 2015 the reliability of chips precipitation data has already been evaluated by few researchers across india and they resulted that chirps performed superior among other global precipitation datasets especially in capturing precipitation extremes gupta et al 2020 prakash 2019 total 15 precipitation grids have been found closer to the

landsat mss tm etm tm and landsat 8 satellite sensors based dataset have been utilized fortunately for the year 2006 the selected study area was in the center of etm scene almost not affected by scan line errors sle mir et al 2017 for snow covers extraction modis mod10a2 having 500 m spatial resolution datasets from 2003 to 2018 were downloaded https nsidc org data mod10a2 and processed to extract snow covered area by adopting the methodology as previously used by shukla et al 2017 the snow covered area sca evaluation has been done on the monthly scale and therefore modis 8 daily scenes were processed and then aggregated at the monthly scale hall and riggs 2016 the details of the satellite datasets have been provided in table 1 4 methodology 4 1 snow covered areas and glacier mapping for snow mapping modis mod10a2 8 daily satellite derived snow cover areas have been utilized for the year 2003 2018 the mod10a2 snow cover data products contain data fields for maximum snow cover extent over an eight day compositing period the modis mod10a2 consists of 1200 km by 1200 km tiles that employs a normalized difference snow index ndsi and other criteria tests shukla et al 2017 to highlight the elevation wise similarities in the distribution of snow covers the fractional snow cover corresponding to multiple elevation zones were computed on the monthly scale for both sphy derived snow covers and modis derived snow covers shukla et al 2017 carried out a study for satluj basin in which all the maps were generated the snow cover areas maps for baspa basin has been extracted from these maps therefore the 8 daily scenes of modis snow cover were aggregated at monthly scales to compare with the sphy derived snow covers as per the study of mir et al 2017 number of glaciers were mapped in the baspa basin for years 1966 1999 2000 and 2000 in this study landsat data series based satellite scenes have been utilized for the year 2018 for the landsat 8 etm and tm data images the glaciers were delimited using band ratios of near infrared and shortwave infrared bands singh and goyal 2018 shukla et al 2010 the debris free glacier or clean ice glacier mask was generated in the binary image utilizing threshold values between 2 2 and 2 5 several misclassified glacier areas were eliminated by post processing of the data finally the glacier images were converted from binary to vector data layers the detail glacier mapping methodology has been employed previously by mir et al 2017 to find out the glacier changes corresponding to each elevation zone the spatial analyst module of arcgis was utilized to find out the correlation between glacier changes and corresponding elevation the variation in glaciers was highlighted with respect to elevation in the progressive manner from 2000 to 2018 the changes in glaciers with respect to elevation have been analyzed to highlight the elevation dependent warming and its impact on glacier mass changes 4 2 snowmelt and glacier melt hydrology of sphy model sphy is a spatially distributed and can be applied on a grid by grid basis terink et al 2015 sphy works in a python based environment using pc raster and its source codes are freely available http www sphy nl in sphy each grid value is represented average over the grid in sphy model for glaciers a sub grid variability exists and a grid can be defined as glacier free completely covered by glacier or partially covered by glacier the glacier free grid fraction of grid can be defined as snow covered or snow free the grid area which is free from snow can be defined by vegetation open water and bare soil terink et al 2015 the soil column structure of sphy model is quite similar to vic model terink et al 2015 including two upper oil and third groundwater storages the three drainage components surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow can be defined in sphy model sphy computes i e each grid precipitation in the form of snow or rain depending on the defined critical temperature value precipitation that falls on the ground can be intercepted by vegetation and some amount or whole can be evaporated in spyhy the snow storage is updated with snow accumulation and or snowmelt surface runoff is a part of liquid precipitation whereas the rest infiltrates into the soil in sphy the resulting soil moisture is subject to evapotranspiration et which is depended on the soil properties and fractional vegetation cover whereas the rest contributes to streamflow or discharge by means of the baseflow resulting from the groundwater zone and lateral flow from the first soil layer in sphy the modified hargreaves equation that is a function of temperature only has been used for the et computation terink et al 2015 as per the earlier studies it was observed that hargreaves method performed well over himalaya while in the absence of large amount of the datasets singh and goyal 2017 arnold et al 2012 the grid specific runoff that is available for routing can be contributed by surface runoff lateral flow baseflow snowmelt and glacier melt sphy model requires physical thematic data inputs such as digital elevation model dem landuse lancdcover lulc map glacier map highlighting clean ice glaciers and debris glaciers soil parameters such as root depth maximum capillary rise seepage groundwater parameters such as baseflow groundwater depth aquifer yield the meteorological datasets such as temperature precipitation radiation is minimally required to setup the model the snow covered area sca can be utilized for the validation of sphy generated snow cover the sphy model provides all watershed components such as total runoff snowmelt runoff baseflow et groundwater runoff groundwater level glacier melt runoff and rainfall runoff in daily monthly and annual basis terink et al 2015 this study mainly explores the snow and glacier melt runoff characteristics of the selected baspa river himalayan basin and therefore the focus of this study has been given to the processes and parameters relevant to the snow and glacier hydrology the equations of the other components and processes are previously discussed in detailed terink et al 2009 the snow glacier melt runoff hydrology has been described below in further sections 4 2 1 snowfall and rainfall in sphy the dynamic snowfall mass balancing can be performed at a daily time step using a temperature threshold the falling precipitation can be defined as a snowfall solid form and rain liquid form the snow accumulation or snowpack or snowfall can be calculated as eq 1 1 p s t p et i f t avg t t crit 0 i f t avg t t crit where p s t mm is the snowfall on the day t pe t mm can be defined as the effective precipitation on day t t avg t c is the mean air temperature on day t and t crit is a calibrated temperature threshold for precipitation to fall as snow whereas the precipitation falls as liquid precipitation can be computed as eq 2 2 p l t l i q u i d p r e c i p i t a t i o n p et i f t avg t t crit 0 i f t avg t t crit 4 2 2 snowmelt storage and runoff sphy model uses a degree day approach using temperature index model for the calculation of snowmelt terink et al 2015 the application of degree day models is widespread in cryospheric models that is based on an empirical relationship between melt rate and air temperature terink et al 2015 based on the degree day approach the potential snowmelt can be calculated as eq 3 3 a pot t t avg t ddf s if t avg t 0 0 if t avg t 0 with a pot t mm is defined as the potential snowmelt on day t and ddfs mm c 1 day 1 is denoted as a calibrated degree day factor for snow the actual snowmelt can be limited by the snow storage at the end of the previous day and is computed as eq 4 4 a act t m i n a pot t ss t 1 here a act t mm is defined as the actual snowmelt on day t and ss t 1 mm is denoted as the snow storage on day t 1 after that the snow storage from day t 1 is updated to the present day t utilizing the actual snowmelt a act t and the solid precipitation ps t when temperature falls below the melting point then the meltwater that is frozen in the snowpack during time t 1 will be added to the snow storage as eq 5 5 ss t

precipitation on day t a act t is the actual snowmelt on day t and ssw t 1 is the amount of frozen meltwater on day t 1 the units for all terms are mm the maximum of meltwater that can freeze sswmax mm is thus limited by the thickness of the snow storage terink et al 2015 the total snow storage sst mm consists of the snow storage and the freeze meltwater can be calculated as eq 6 6 ss t t ss t ssw t 1 g l a c f where 1 g l a c f is defined as the fractional grid that is not covered by glaciers in sphy model snow melt and snow accumulation can only be calculated when grid fraction determined as the land surface in sphy the runoff from snow sro mm can be calculated when the air temperature reaches above the melting point terink et al 2015 the change in meltwater stored in the snow can be accounted as eq 7 7 δ s s w ssw t ssw t 1 4 2 3 glacier process and runoff in sphy glaciers are considered melting surfaces which can partly or completely cover the grid cell glacier melt is also calculated by the degree day approach and the melt rates of debris covered and debris free glaciers vary terink et al 2015 the melt from the debris free glaciers can be computed as eq 8 8 a ci t t avg

water from debris free and debris covered glaciers can be accounted as eq 10 10 a glac t a ci t a dc t g l a c f from the total melt from glaciers a fraction of the glacier melt percolates to the groundwater and the remaining fractions run off finally the generated runoff gro mm from glacier melt is defined as eq 11 11 gr ot a glac t 1 g l a c r o f 4 2 4 surface runoff total runoff and routing in sphy soil water processes can be determined by the three soil layers such as root zone sub zone and groundwater layer the equations related to soil processes are previously described by terink et al 2009 and therefore not discussed in detail sphy is a water balance model and therefore the sphy only accounts for stresses regarding water shortage and water excess sphy uses an et reduction parameter etredwet that has 0 value in soil saturated condition and otherwise 1 terink et al 2015 sphy uses the saturation excess overland flow process i e hewlettian runoff to compute the surface runoff ro terink et al 2015 as eq 12 12 ro sw 1 sw 1 s a t if sw 1 sw 1 s a t 0 if sw 1 sw 1 s a t here sw 1 mm is the water content in the first soil layer and sw 1 s a t mm is defined as the saturated water content of the first soil layer in sphy the exceeded water from the field capacity has been used for lateral flow terink et al 2015 sphy assumes the lateral flow travel time to be dependent on the field capacity saturated conductivity and saturated content terink et al 2015 in sphy water can percolate from the first soil layer to the second soil layer and from the second to the third soil layer in sphy water only percolates when the water content will exceed the field capacity of that layer terink et al 2016 sphy utilizes exponential decay weighting function terink et al 2015 in the precipitation groundwater response model similar to swat model arnold et al 2012 for baseflow computation sphy uses steady state response of groundwater flow and water table fluctuations which can be resulted by the non steady response of the groundwater flow arnold et al 2012 in this model baseflow can only be occurred when the amount of water stored in the third soil layer exceeds a certain threshold for runoff routing sphy computes for each grid the accumulated amount of water that flows out of the grid into its neighbouring downstream grid through the accuflux pcraster built in function which computes runoff at each grid from its upstream grids and also adding the runoff amount that is generated within the grid itself terink et al 2015 4 3 model calibration in sphy both manual and auto calibration can be performed in this study mostly real time observed and measured datasets and other parameters coefficients have been used to get the practical parametric response the manual calibration based on trial and error basis was preferred sometimes it has been seen that the auto calibration does not give the reliable estimates of modeling parameters when large numbers of parameters are involved terink et al 2015 during modeling the best fitted value of the parameter has been calculated as per trial and error method the observed daily flow m3 s is available from 2003 to 2018 and thus utilized for the present study for manual calibration parameters such as temperature threshold to fall as snow tcrit degree day factor for snow ddfs glacier fraction of grid cell glacf degree day factor for debris free glaciers ddfci degree day factor for debris covered glaciers ddfdc and threshold for baseflow to occur bfthres have been taken into consideration modis based snow cover area have been extracted to compare the sphy derived snow cover on the monthly scale for the year 2010 and 2018 so that snow parameters required to run the model which can be accurately defined in the model and modeling accuracy can be improved in this study the real time digitized glacier maps characterizing by debris free glaciers and debris covered glaciers were used to define the glacier properties over the basin other parameters e g related to soil and lulc values are set based on the literature survey terink et al 2015 and standard global values suggested by sphy model terink et al 2015 which have been developed specifically for the himalayan conditions utilizing large number of datasets and parameters as an input to the sphy model the model has been setup for the two time durations i e 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 to understand the snow melt and glacier melt induced flow or runoff variations the sphy model was simulated at the daily time step at 250 m spatial resolution scale and sphy re gridded all data inputs at the same scale terink et al 2015 however the modeling variables can be computed on a daily monthly and yearly scales as per the user s choice the modeling outcomes have been evaluated at the outlet and site scale 4 4 snowmelt glacier melt and glacier area changes for analyzing the changes in snow melt and glacier melt flow or runoff the whole time series 2003 2018 was divided in two time series ts sets i ts1 2003 2010 and ii ts2 2011 2018 the main purpose of the dividing time series sets in two durations was to analyze the effect varying climate conditions such as temperature and precipitation variations along with observed glacier mass changes on the resultant glacier melt runoff as per the comparison of both period glacier maps i e 2000 and 2011 a significant mass reduction was observed therefore while setup the sphy for the ts1 i e 2003 2010 the glacier map prepared for the year 2000 was utilized whereas during ts2 setup in sphy the glacier map prepared for the year 2011 was utilized the changes in glacier mass is compared to the corresponding elevations to find out the elevation dependent warming and their impacts on glacier and glacier melt runoff changes a very few studies highlighted that temperature and precipitation is highly varying over himalaya and showed the elevation dependent warming especially in last 20 years they recorded the maximum variations sharma and goyal 2020 ren et al 2017 singh and goyal 2016 the main water balance components such as simulated flow sim flow rainfall induced runoff rain flow snow melt runoff snow melt and glacier melt runoff glacier melt have been computed at the outlet i e sangla gauge small watersheds considering 30 sites shown in fig 1 on the main stream and tributaries were created out of 30 sites 17 independent sites located on the tributaries were chosen dominated by snow and glaciers which have been used to explore the snow melt and glacier melt runoff variation glaciers are situated at the extreme high elevation zones whereas non glaciated areas covered by snow situated at the moderate elevation zones these snow melt and glacier melt changes have been analyzed on the monthly seasonal and annual basis during both durations e g 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 in addition to glacier maps of 2000 and 2011 used for the period of ts1 and ts2 2018 glacier map has also been used for ts2 5 results and discussion 5 1 snow and glacier mapping on the basis of glacier maps a significant reduction has been computed in the glacier areas from 2000 to 2018 fig 2 a significant variation in snow covered areas scas fig 3 also observed by previous studies shukla et al 2017 mir et al 2017 have identified in different portions of the basin therefore to highlight the effect of these snow and glacier areas variations different glacier maps e g 2000 2006 2011 and 2018 were used so the effect of glacier areas reduction can be easily incorporated in the modeling outcomes the accuracy of sphy derived snow covers has been tested with reference to the modis derived snow covers for the year 2010 and 2018 figs 3 5 the visual comparison of sphy and modis derived snow covered areas sca can be seen in fig 3 in fig 3 based on the monthly plots one can see that most of months have shown similar pattern of sca when compared to sphy and modis scas for both time series durations however during may and june months some inconsistency in sca can be seen when compared both datasets fig 3 the regression plots between sphy and modis derived scas have been drawn and the corresponding r2 values have shown in fig 4 as per the regression plots fig 4 around 78 correlation existed during 2010 and 92 correlation existed during 2018 which is found quite satisfactory especially over the himalayan basin in fig 4a and 4b except june to august months where sphy derived scas show slightly overestimated otherwise most of months showed a good match between sphy and modis derived scas several articles already discussed about the inconsistency existed in the modis mod10a2 snow cover data products zhao et al 2019 weidinger et al 2018 due to the presence of clouds the fractional snow covers based on the 10 elevation zones have been derived for the year 2010 to compare the sphy derived fractional snow covered area with the modis derived snow covered areas fig 5 snow cover variations with respect to elevation zones have also been compared elevation zones 10 nos have computed from dem fig 1 which highlight the variations in the snow covered areas with respect to 10 elevation zones ez through box plots as per fig 1 ez1 to ez3 corresponded to lower elevations 1800 3000 m ez4 to ez6 3001 4500 m corresponded with moderate elevation areas and ez7 to ez10 4500 m corresponded to extreme high elevation areas fig 5 a j illustrates the monthly comparison of sca distribution between sphy and modis based on the year 2010 in fig 6 it can be observed that as per the increasing ezs the distribution of sca increases in lower ezs such as ez1 to ez4 only small amount of sca can be observed only for january february and december months whereas moderate to extreme high ezs ez4 most of months show a significant amount of distribution of sca except ablation period i e may to august fig 5 when compared the ez wise distribution of sca between modis and sphy a good correlation has been observed around 80 except few ezs where 5 to 10 differences in scas has been recorded overall both datasets have shown a good agreement between sphy and modis derived scas based on the above observations this elevation zone wise comparison of sphy derived snow covers with modis data showed a good match with the real time modis derived snow cover datasets and observed discharge data the derivation of fractional snow covers also helped to optimize the fractional snow parameter in sphy which is an important parameter in accounting snow melt runoff volume 5 2 assessment of water balance components the model parameters have manually adjusted and modeling fitted parameter values detail have been given in the table 2 the calibration strength of the modeling framework has been tested using coefficient of determination r2 singh and goyal 2017 the scatter plots between observed and simulated flow after parameters adjustment at sangla gauge are shown in fig 6b and 6d the time series plots fig 6a and 6c show that simulated discharge at the outlet of the catchment significantly captured high and low flow values as per the observed values the r2 values are computed as 0 62 and 0 86 for ts1 i e 2003 2010 and ts2 i e 2011 2018 respectively the computed r2 values on a daily scale are found satisfactory as compared to the previous studies singh and goyal 2017 jain et al 2010 the modeling accuracy of snow glacier areas will majorly depend on how snow and glacier parameters are accurately input to the model abbaspour et al 2015 the water balance components such as simulated flow sim flow rain flow rainfall induced flow or runoff snow melt glacier melt and base flow have been computed at the outlet i e sangla gauge fig 7 which shows an average annual distribution of each component during the years 2003 to 2018 in two time series sets i e ts1 2003 2010 and ts2 2011 2018 total 16 years in figs 7a 7b it is clearly seen that snowmelt contribution varies from around 50 52 is more than glacier melt varies from around 12 14 against the total flow the contribution of runoff from baseflow is also found significant during may to september months 15 5 3 changes in snow melt glacier melt and rainfall runoff fig 8 shows distribution of the five main water balance components such as sim flow snow melt glacier melt rain flow and base flow on an annual basis which highlight the timing of each component throughout the year as per the annual plots the potential snow melting starts from april and it continues till october fig 8 however the amount of snow melt varies from year to year the maximum snow melt was computed between late may to july fig 8 the annual total maximum one day flow recorded around 200 m3 s especially during monsoon season whereas other components such as snow melt glacier melt rain flow and base flow vary one day maximum up to 120 m3 s 40 m3 s 70 m3 s 20 m3 s respectively to find out changes in the four main water balance components e g sim flow rain flow snow melt and glacier melt the averaged of the water balance components of both ts has been computed and then compared through the box plots fig 9 as per the sim flow scenarios a slight increase has been observed from 2003 to 2010 to 2011 2018 however in case of ts2 i e 2011 2018 the extreme cases were increased and can be seen in box plots fig 9 in case of glacier melt both time series have shown almost same median 12 m3 s but in case of ts2 a slight decrease is recorded in upper quantiles fig 9 as per snow melt observation fig 9 ts1 have shown higher values in upper quantile ranges than ts2 but median is recorded almost similar for both ts durations in case of rain flow fig 9 except upper quantiles no significant variability was detected based on the above observation no significant conclusion can be made however an enormous variability in upper quantile among all the water balance components can be observed fig 10 displays the year wise monthly averaged variation in sim flow snow melt glacier melt and rain flow grouped into two ts durations i e 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 computed at the outlet of the basin i e sangla gauge these plots highlight a year to year variability in monthly averaged components in case of sim flow fig 10a to 10b the highest variability has been recorded from june to september months mainly in the monsoon months the variability in the flow during monsoon i e from june to september months revealed the existed variability in precipitation and temperature observed in recent past year rao et al 2018 singh and goyal 2017 similar observations can be notified for snow melt during mar to may for example as per figs 10e to 10f during 2011 2014 the maximum snow melt 120 m3 s was recorded for the year 2014 while other years recorded maximum snow melt between 60 m3 s to 100 m3 s in case of glacier melt fig 10c and 10d no significant variability has been recorded however the month wise change can be observed in the glacier amount in case of rain flow fig 10g to 10 h the maximum variability e g extreme high and low peaks during monsoon months can be clearly observed as discussed above it was observed that there are changes in water balance components because of changes in precipitation and temperatures as per the studies carried out earlier in himalaya region average temperature has been increased over the himalaya 1 dimri et al 2018 sanjay et al 2017 and the precipitation significantly varied over western himalaya especially in recent past years sharma and goyal 2020 shafiq et al 2016 singh and goyal 2016 therefore a detail analysis of change has been performed by doing the monthly assessment of the main four water balance components i e sim flow snow melt rain flow and glacier melt to find out the changes during both the ts durations i e 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 among all four water balance components the monthly scenarios have been generated and a comparative assessment has been done between ts1 i e 2003 2010 and ts2 2011 2018 these results have shown in the supplementary file as supplementary figs 1 and 2 sf1 and sf2 as per sim flow fig sf1a it is found highly variable throughout the year as per december to march july and july trends fig sf1a sim flow is increased during both ts during april may august september and october fig sf1b sim flow is slightly decreased in october and september sim flow scenarios from 2003 to 2010 showed an increase while 2011 2018 based scenarios showed a decrease fig sf1a in case of rain flow as per ts2 observations a decrease has been observed in case of ts2 january to march an increase has been observed fig sf1a similarly during october to march as per ts1 rain flow has been decreased while in ts2 february and march showed an increase in rain flow but as per ts2 during january february march august and september it has been increased fig sf1a overall majority of plots showed that rain flow has been slightly increase during 2003 to 2018 as per plots fig sf1b during october to december a slight decrease in glacier melt has been reported during 2011 2018 while an increase is reported as per 2003 2010 however from january to september most of the plots showed an increase in glacier melt in both ts except april in case of both ts fig sf1b and september in case of ts2 only where glacier melt was slightly decreased fig sf1 snow melt is found highly variable in both ts i e 2003 2010 and 2011 2018 from october to september snow melt trends showed that it is decreased during october november march and april in case of both ts durations whereas it is significantly increased in december january february may june and july mostly in case of ts2 i e 2011 2018 figs sf1b during april to september fig sf1b it is decreased in most of months especially in case of ts1 i e 2003 2011 overall plots clarified that with respect to ts1 i e 2003 2010 the contribution of snow melt in total flow has been increased during 2011 to 2018 based on the above observation the three most conclusive observations can be made i rain flow is found highly variable during 2003 2018 because the most of months during 2003 2010 have shown a decrease in rain flow and during ts2 i e 2011 2018 with respect to ts1 it is increased during january february march august and september months ii overall the snow melt was increased while comparing ts1 vs ts2 table 3 however because of an increasing temperature over the himalaya as reported in previous studies shafiq et al 2016 singh and goyal 2016 the ratio of precipitation to snow and rain is changing therefore due to less amount of precipitation in form of snowfall the melt contribution from snow has been decreased in some months mostly in non glaciated areas and therefore rain flow was increased during january february and march due to the increasing temperature and reduction in the glacier mass over himalaya the contribution from glacier melt was decreased during ts2 as compared to the ts1 table 3 table 3 showed the observations from 17 stations which are found glacier dominated 5 4 effect of glacier area reduction in glacier melt runoff for effective monitoring the changes in snow and glacier melt flow or runoff around 30 watersheds were drawn in the basin taking out of this 17 sites dominated with glaciers and snow covered areas as shown in fig 1 and then the annual time series trends were estimated during 2003 2018 fig sf2 in this analysis one more glacier map of 2018 was used in addition to 2011 for the duration ts2 the glacier melt contribution at the outlet during 2003 2010 computed as 15 as per glacier map of 2000 it computed 13 during 2011 2018 as per glacier map of 2011 and it recorded around 10 during 2011 2018 as per glacier map of 2018 due to reduction in glacier mass similarly the snow melt contribution was found to be 50 52 and 56 and rain flow 19 21 and 22 and base flow contribution 16 14 and 12 corresponding to the maps of 2000 2011 and 2018 this base flow is delayed flow which comes through recharge from rain snow and glacier melt if it is distributed in same proportion then flow comes out to be 18 15 12 due to glacier melt 58 61 64 due to snow melt for the years 2000 2011 and 2018 and rain flow 24 for all the years all the watersheds are having different snow glacier therefore the total contribution of melt water from snow covered areas and glacier areas varies at each site level the contribution from each watershed has shown in supplementary file sf2 and given in table 3 the glacier melt varies from around 200 mm corresponded to site 9 to 1500 mm corresponded to site 26 across all stations similar plots have been made for snow melt i e snow q which varies from around 40 mm corresponded to sites 8 and 9 to 350 mm corresponded to site 26 as per the observations sf2 among 17 sites mostly dominated with glaciers most of sites showed an increase in snow melt during 2003 to 2018 from table 3 it can be seen that glacier melt runoff has increased in case of watersheds 2 and 3 while decreased for other watersheds the reason behind this that the watersheds 2 and 3 are heavily glaciated and also not much change in glacier cover have been found in these watersheds the watershed such as 8 9 and 12 located on northern side in high altitude areas have lost much glaciers as compared to watersheds located on southern side therefore more reduction in runoff in watersheds of northern side was observed the watersheds 21 23 24 25 and 26 located on lower altitudes have lost much glacier area and therefore contribution in these watersheds have been found to be much less in the year 2018 however contribution of change of sca and rainfall also have been studied the snow melt runoff from all the watersheds have increased fig 11 shows the month wise comparison of glacier melt changes and snow melt between ts1 i e 2003 2010 and ts2 i e 2011 2018 for 17 sites dominated by snow covered areas and glaciers the computation of monthly distribution of amount of snow melt and glacier melt at site level has been found helpful to understand the behavior of total flow while analysing the variability of glacier melt and snow melt in total runoff in baspa basin the glacier melting mostly starts from may and the majority of contribution from glacier melt is recorded till november 10 mm similarly in case of snow melt the major contribution is recorded from late april to october 10 mm therefore the box plots have shown the monthly scenarios of glacier melt and snow melt from may to october months only the box plots highlighted the statistical behaviour of different grouped periods as per fig 11 in case of glacier melt it can be seen that maximum amount is recorded during july to september when compared to ts1 vs ts2 a shift in glacier melt can be observed in most of the stations a slight reduction in the amount of glacier melt was observed during 2011 2018 against 2003 2010 as per the glacier maps of different time periods it can be seen that the small size glaciers were found more sensitive in reducing their mass this explores the monthly fluctuations on the yearly basis in snow melt and glacier melt and also provides the ideas about the snow melt dominant season and glacier melt dominant season throughout the year fig 11 also displays the changes in monthly snow melt during 2003 2018 for 17 sites dominated with snow and glaciers as per the comparison of grouped time series sets i e ts1 and ts2 most of months found highly variable in case of snow melt overall most months showed increase in snow melt during 2011 2018 with respect to ts2 i e 2003 2010 fig 11 and table 3 the increase in snow melt over glaciated areas can be directly correlated with the reduction of snowfall over the basin due to increasing rate of temperature over himalayan glaciers as temperature increases snowfall contribution decreases and rainfall contribution increases in fig 12 a to d a significant amount of glacier area reduction has been computed fig 12e shows the hypsometry of glaciers in different temporal times here hypsometry of glaciers has been calculated to determine the cumulative percentage of glacier area between the elevation zones total six elevation zones at 500 m interval have been calculated the hypsometry of all glacier maps clearly shows that a significant reduction in the lower to extreme elevation areas when compared to glacier map of 2000 with 2006 a very slight reduction in the glacier areas can only be observed especially between 6000 and 6500 m ranges however there is a large gap can be observed at lower to moderate elevation zones e g 4500 5000 m in the glacier maps of 2011 and 2018 vis a vis glacier map of 2000 these changes could be a sign of elevation dependent warming as also discussed previously in some himalayan based studies dimri et al 2018 singh and goyal 2016 this analysis gives an insight about the sensitivity of glacier areas changes with respect to elevation the glacier ice volume has been computed to verify the reduction in the glaciers ice volume as per the changes in glacier maps with respect to time to compare the reduction in glacier ice volume due to melting sphy based glacier ice volume compared with the glacier ice volume computed based on the power equation suggested by prasad et al 2019 prasad et al 2019 developed a volume area relationship considering 298 glaciers which are mostly corresponded to satluj river basin the glacier ice volume has been computed for the four different temporal glacier maps i e 2000 2006 2011 and 2018 using above two methods and given in table 4 in 2000 the total glacier ice volume was recorded around 13 09 13 41 km3 while in 2018 it was significantly reduced recorded as 13 47 10 99 km3 as per the comparison sphy has found comparable in the calculation of glacier ice volume with respect to the glacier ice volume computed through the volume area equation 6 conclusions in the present study snow glacier melt contribution and its variation over the years with changes in snow and glaciers in upper himalayan basin has been analysed snow cover area was simulated using the sphy model and it was found in good agreement with the area obtained using modis data the glacier maps of 2000 2011 and 2018 have been used to compute the flow or runoff contribution due to glacier melt snow melt and rain flow the flow from glacier melt found to be 18 15 12 from snow melt runoff 58 61 64 corresponding to glacier maps of 2000 2011 and 2018 while rain flow 24 for all the years thus total contribution from snow and glacier melt flow at the outlet comes out to be 76 the analysis was also carried out for each month and it was found that there is an increase in total runoff during pre monsoon and post monsoon months as per the overall comparative assessment between two time series durations total flow has been slightly increased across the basin on the basis of analysis of total 17 watersheds i e dominated with snow and glaciers out of 30 watersheds created on tributaries at the d s of snow and glacier cover area it was found that due to glacier recession in the glacier dominated watersheds glacier melt is reducing it was found that the watersheds at the lower altitude are reducing glacier cover and thereby runoff have also decreased in upper part of the basin the glaciers in the watersheds located on the northern side are reducing more as compared to the watersheds located on southern side therefore the flow from watersheds located on northern side are reducing while it is increasing from the watersheds of the southern side average contribution from these 17 watershed glacier melt has decreased 14 and 44 snow melt increased 24 and 42 and rain flow 31 and 40 for the year 20 011 to 2018 with respect to the year 2003 the contributions from rain flow have increased over the years indicating change in precipitation from snow to rain while flow from snowmelt has increased due to more melting as per sphy corresponding to glacier map of the year 2000 the glacier ice volume has been computed around 13 41 km3 while for the glacier map of 2018 it has been reduced around 10 99 km3 author statement all authors have equally contributed for the article like writing data analysis and writing conclusion

4976,water diversion has been increasingly applied to accelerate lake water exchange and alleviate urgent water crisis however effects of water diversion on water exchange and water quality for eutrophic lakes remain controversial in this study a three dimensional hydrodynamic water quality sediment diagenesis model has been developed to assess effects of water diversion on hydrodynamics and water quality in eutrophic shallow lake wanghu results suggested that water diversion could dramatically promote water exchange and reduce residence time in most lake regions but its influence on water quality was diverse a water transferring flow rate of 20 30 m3 s could reduce water age to 40 58 days during regular water diversion operation whereas a high transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s was the best for emergency operation in late spring before the wet season moreover nutrients and chlorophyll a exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity in improvement efficiency nutrients level in the donating system was a prerequisite to the relationship among water transport time scales nutrients and algal biomass in this eutrophic lake during a clean water diversion nutrients and algal biomass were positively associated with water age however when the donating system contained high level of nutrients accumulated nutrients in the lake may still trigger algal bloom after a temporary relief due to flushing effect therefore these water diversion strategies could be applied to guide a sustainable management of eutrophic lake wanghu in terms of transferring flow rate wind fields water quality in the donating system transferring operation and water diversion route keywords water diversion nutrients efdc water age lake management 1 introduction water quality deterioration is a ubiquitous issue caused by inappropriate anthropogenic activities and climate changes in freshwater bodies ho et al 2019 sinha et al 2017 smith and schindler 2009 currently water diversion project has been increasingly applied to accelerate water exchange and mitigate urgent water crisis hu et al 2008 yu et al 2018 theoretically this technique could shorten renewal time and push nutrients out of the lakes to abate water pollution in fact it has been successfully applied to contain algal bloom amid a short term in lake taihu and lake chaohu china hu et al 2010 xie et al 2009 moses and green lakes in washinton usa hilt et al 2011 welch 1981 lake tega and lake barato in japan amano et al 2010 shinohara et al 2008 etc nevertheless this application is still controversial because it may not address nutrients over enrichment and water quality degradation in lakes in the long run and even some detrimental effects have been reported in previous case studies khorasani et al 2018 qin et al 2019 yao et al 2018 in general the role of water diversion project in the improvement of water quality can be determined by multiple factors such as quantity and quality of water sources receiving water conditions transferring routes and operation regulations gao et al 2018 nutrients in the transferred water may be even higher than those in the receiving waterbodies which is caused by their own sources of pollution and self purification capacity despite the shortened residence time and enhanced water exchanging rate through water diversion the extra nutrients will be another critical concern due to an increased nutrients loading of 5 10 the water diversion from yangtze river failed to curb algal blooms in lake taihu qin et al 2019 on the other hand although high flushing rate may relieve the bloom issue in confined lake regions to some extent li et al 2013 liu et al 2014 zhai et al 2010 the entire efficiency of water diversion in small lakes was found to be much higher than that in large size lakes with greater spatial heterogeneity hu et al 2010 zeng et al 2015 furthermore except the most vigorous flushing condition a short residence time in major lake regions could not sufficiently impede the algal bloom because the growth rate of cyanobacteria can be doubled just within one day under appropriate conditions in order to evaluate the impact of water diversion project on hydrodynamics and water quality of lakes field monitoring and numerical modelling are the most commonly used methods however comparison of water quality before and after implementation of water diversion is restricted to confined regions and monitoring periods due to a huge demand of long term monitoring data hu et al 2010 nong et al 2020 roy et al 2016 thus numerical method could be a useful alternative to assess hydrodynamics and water quality responses to water diversion project in terms of comprehensive water quality models and transport time calculations vinçon leite and casenave 2019 nonetheless acquisition sufficient data is a prerequisite to parameterize calibrate and validate the water quality model for impact analyses of water diversion project zou et al 2014 in addition biochemical processes could also lead to uncertainties during simulations and predictions as a consequence transport time could be employed as a compromised option to estimate the water exchange process and further characterize the fate of pollutants and variability of phytoplankton biomass gao et al 2018 huang et al 2016 shen et al 2013 wan et al 2013 in fact short transport time theoretically reduces aggregation of algal biomass and nutrients retention thereby inhibiting eutrophication bargu et al 2019 janssen et al 2019 paerl and huisman 2008 schmadel et al 2018 transport time scale could be described by water age residence time and flushing time gómez et al 2014 viero and defina 2016 at present it is imperative to figure out the inherent relationship between transport time and nutrients or phytoplankton biomass usually transport time may induce different fluctuations in water quality and dynamics of phytoplankton in lakes water age demonstrated a similar spatial pattern with chlorophyll a chl a in poyang lake qi et al 2016 while it had a strong positive relationship with total phosphorus tp but was insensitive to total nitrogen tn and chl a during in lake dianchi zhang et al 2016 given these controversial findings water quality responses to water diversion should be comprehensively evaluated in this study a 3 d hydrodynamic water quality sediment diagenesis model will be introduced to evaluate the impact of water diversion on hydrodynamics and water quality in a eutrophic shallow lake in the middle of yangtze river delta lake wanghu multiple factors will be comprehensively considered in this model including quantity and quality of water sources receiving water conditions e g lake topography water quality etc and operation regulations specifically the main objectives of existing research are to 1 investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of water age resulting from water diversion project in lake wanghu 2 elucidate spatial responses of n and p concentrations and algal biomass to water diversion based on the aforementioned model and 3 figure out the intrinsic relationship between water exchange and eutrophication in this lake this work would gain novel insights into the dynamic response of water exchange nutrients and algae growth to water diversion which could in turn benefit the sustainable management of water diversion in eutrophic shallow lakes 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area lake wanghu located between 29 51 29 54 n and 115 20 115 25 e belongs to a crucial wetlandnaturereserve in china fig 1 it is a shallow lake with a surface area of 42 3 km2 and a mean depth of 3 7 m the main types of land use in the catchment include lakes paddy field forest land swag shrubland dry land etc lake wanghu has been suffering from severe eutrophication issue including p enrichment and algal bloom anthropogenic activities such as agriculture operation fish farming rural domestic sewage etc significantly contribute to water quality degradation of lake wanghu naturally high p background concentration in this watershed was another factor resulting in the fragile status of the lake zhu et al 2019 algal bloom in the lake usually occurred from june to august during then the average chl a concentration and algae density were around 45 μg l and 4056 cell ml respectively in 2018 the annual average tp and tn concentrations in lake wanghu were 0 27 and 0 88 mg l according to monthly monitoring data respectively tp was nearly 4 2 times higher than the limit value 0 05 mg l while tn could meet the management requirement 1 mg l complying with administrative department of lake wanghu usually higher nutrients concentrations were observed in wet season in the long run reduction of nutrients input is desired to mitigate eutrophication issue nonetheless hydrodynamic flushing with water from nearby rivers has been regarded as a practical technique to physically flush nutrients and algae out of the lake for emergency cases thus a short distance water diversion has been designed to transfer water from river fuhe to lake wanghu and ultimately into the yangtze river fig 1 in order to obtain a holistic understanding on the impacts of water diversion on spatiotemporal variations of water age nutrients and chl a lake wanghu was divided into five sub areas zone i to v according to its hydrological and ecological characteristics as shown in fig 1 2 2 model development in this study the impact of water diversion on hydrodynamics water age nutrient cycling and biological processes in the lake was evaluated by three dimensional 3 d hydrodynamics water quality sediment diagenesis model fig 2 lake wanghu model was built up based on environmental fluid dynamics code efdc which was initially developed by the united states environmental protection agency and has been successfully applied to simulate the hydrodynamics sediment transport toxic contaminant transport and water quality eutrophication components in coastal regions estuaries lakes reservoirs rivers and wetlands hamrick 1992 ji 2008 the governing mass balance equation for each of the water quality state

account for the diffusive transport the last term describes the kinetic processes and external loadings for each state variable in the wanghu model 16 water column states variables were used to describe the algae dynamics and nutrients cycles the modelling framework is shown in fig 2 chl a was used as an indirect measure of the overall algae population the considered phytoplankton can be expressed as 2 b t p b m p r b h ws b wb v where b is algal biomass g c m 3 t is time d p is production rate d 1 bm is basal metabolism rate d 1 pr is predation rate d 1 h is water depth m ws is positive settling velocity m d 1 wb is external loadings g c d 1 v is cell volume m3 sediment nutrient fluxes across the sediment water interface were simulated using a sediment diagenesis module which was internally coupled with water quality module the module consists three basic processes including depositional flux of particulate organic matter their diagenesis and the resulting sediment flux the governing equations in the sediment diagenesis model are detailed described in park et al 1995 the concept of water age was used to describe the spatiotemporal hydrodynamic impact of the water transfer process in this study water age is defined as the time that has elapsed since the particle under consideration left the region in which its age is prescribed as being zero delhez et al 1999 shen and wang 2007 it is calculated as follows 3 c t x t u c t x k c t x 0 4 α t x t u α t x k α t x c t x where c is the tracer concentration α is the age concentration u is the velocity field k is the diffusivity tensor t is time x is coordinate the mean water age a then can be calculated as follows 5 a t x α t x c t x lake wanghu model consisted rectangular grids with 3878 active cells with a uniform cell size 100 m in both x and y directions three evenly distributed sigma layers were adopted in the vertical dimension the bottom topography data were measured and interpolated into the model grids the model was driven by atmospheric forcing tributary inflow outflow and interaction with sediment flux the flow rate and water quality data of 11 primary rivers including water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do tp phosphate po4 3 tn ammonia nh4 chemical oxygen demand cod and chl a were monthly monitored from november 2018 to july 2019 as the model flow boundary inputs fig 1 water samples were manually collected at 50 cm below the surface water wt and do were measured in situ by ysi other water quality concentrations were analyzed in the laboratory tang et al 2020 tp and tn concentrations in unfiltered water were determined by spectrophotometry after digestion with alkaline potassium persulfate po4 3 and nh4 concentrations were analyzed by spectrophotometric method and nessler s reagent colorimetric method after filtered cod was analyzed by the standard dichromate method chl a concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry at wavelengths of 665 nm and 750 nm following extraction with hot 90 ethanol the daily meteorological data including atmospheric pressure surface air temperature relative humidity precipitation evaporation solar radiation and fractional cloud cover were sourced from the weather station near the lake the 10 water quality monitoring sites shown in fig 1 were used for model calibration 2 3 scenario definitions transferred water quantity and quality in the donating system river fuhe wind field and operation timing are considered as crucial factors affecting the efficiency of water diversion in table 1 seven scenarios based on the combinations of these factors were defined to investigate the response of water exchange n and p concentration and algal biomass to water diversion in lake wanghu more specifically scenario 1 was in the absence of water diversion and used as the baseline case for reference water diversion included two operation rules i e regular and emergency water diversion fresh water was transferred with a relatively low flow rate throughout the year in regular cases scenarios 2 5 while large quantity fresh water was transferred within a short period under emergency cases scenarios 6 and 7 under regular cases scenarios 2 and 3 were applied to examine the effect of transferring flow rate i e 5 to 100 m3 s and various wind fields on hydrodynamics respectively in addition two different water quality conditions in the donating system have been investigated in scenarios 4 and 5 which corresponded to monitoring data average concentration of tp 0 077 mg l and tn 1 63 mg l and administrative standard suggested by the local government tp 0 2 mg l and tn 1 mg l in emergency cases scenario 6 aimed to determine the role of flowrate and transferring period in hydrodynamics whereas scenario 7 was applied to elucidate the influence of water quality in the donating system on water quality in lake wanghu the model configurations and parameters excluding driving factors shown in table 1 were identical for all cases as aforementioned the improvement percentages of water exchange η wa and water quality η wq caused by different water diversion scenarios are calculated as follows 6 η wa w a 1 w a i w a 1 100 7 η wq w q i w q 1 w q 1 100 where wa1 and wa i is the water age day for the baseline scenario 1 and water diversion scenarios 2 7 in table 1 respectively wq1 and wq i is the concentrations of water quality variables mg l for the baseline scenario 1 and water diversion scenarios 2 7 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance this study performed multi sites 10 sites in fig 1 and multi variables i e water depth wd wt do tp tn nh4 cod and chl a calibration for the lake wanghu model the parameters were calibrated by trial and error method to make the modelling results best match the observed data the key calibrated parameters for lake wanghu model are listed in table s1 results showed that the model had an acceptable performance to reproduce the changes of hydrodynamics and water quality statistical results of model calibration at 10 monitoring sites are summarized in table 2 and the comparison of time series between simulated and observed data for site 5 in the central lake is depicted in fig 3 the hydrodynamic module exhibited good agreement between the simulated and observed water depth with an averaged relative error re and absolute error ae of 11 25 and 0 27 m respectively this indicated the module reproduced a good water balance related to inflow outflow precipitation and evaporation besides water temperature accurately followed the spatiotemporal trend of observed data with an averaged re of 9 58 suggesting that the model had reached a reasonable representation of thermal dynamic processes and provided a basis for verifying water quality dynamic processes different from the changing trend of water temperature the module demonstrated a lower do concentration in summer with the re of do concentration ranging from 16 61 to 26 93 despite some missing peak points various spatial distributions of re values for nutrient concentrations in table 2 also depicted acceptable mean re for tp tn nh4 and cod of 33 16 28 20 26 64 and 18 01 respectively although algal concentration in spring summer was slightly overestimated the model could capture the spatial heterogeneity and seasonal changes with re for chl a varying from 20 81 to 55 36 overall lake wanghu model could be applied for further analyses of water diversion scenarios 3 2 improvement of water exchange through water diversion water exchange characteristics could be described by spatiotemporal changes of water age li et al 2011 in the baseline scenario 1 the initial average water age in lake wanghu was 141 days but it may exhibit spatial heterogeneity resulting from tributary locations flow rates and wind fields the influence of water diversion on water exchange was comprehensively assessed in terms of various transferred flow rates scenario 2 operation durations scenario 6 and wind field conditions scenario 3 in scenario 2 eight flow rates ranging from 5 to 100 m3 s were designed to investigate the relationship between water exchange and transferring flow rate fig 4 demonstrates spatial distribution of water age under different transferring flow rates as the transferring flow rate was increased from 5 to 50 m3 s water age decreased from 153 to 25 days implying that water exchange could be enhanced through water diversion transferring water footprint was gradually diffused from zone iv to other subzones leading to heterogeneous spatial distribution of water age specifically water division could promote water exchange in zone iv near the inlet but had limited effect on water movement in bays zone i and ii which were away from the diversion route in fact due to lake size and complex shoreline many previous studies have also found that the improvement of water exchange may not involve the entire lake during the water diversion huang et al 2016 qi et al 2016 furthermore fig 5 a depicts the detailed relationship between water age and transferring flow rate using the function of wa 669 86 q 0 841 r2 0 9914 initially water age decreased dramatically with elevated transferring flow rate but tended to be stable after the flow rate reached 30 m3 s hence an economical water transferring flow rate of 20 30 m3 s would be recommended to improve water exchange water age of 40 58 days when water diversion project is regularly operated water diversion project has been widely deployed as an emergency technique to alleviate water pollution crisis in scenario 6 two high transferring flow rates 50 and 100 m3 s with various operation durations 1 30 days were selected to determine their influences on water exchange in lake wanghu fig 6 demonstrates the effective transferring areas under different transferring flow rates with varying water diversion durations as shown in fig 6 when the operation duration was within 7 days the effective exchange area corresponding to transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s was almost two times larger than that under 50 m3 s when the operation duration of emergency diversion was extended to 30 days the effective exchange area reached 81 91 and 90 31 for transferring flow rate of 50 and 100 m3 s respectively in addition half of the lake area could be effectively exchanged within 10 days under a transferring flow rate of 50 m3 s but it only took 5 days to achieve a similar area for transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s hence it could be concluded that a higher transferring flow rate may significantly improve water exchange in a short term but two different flow rates would ultimately achieve comparable effective exchange area with operation duration more than one week wind field is another driving factor affecting water dynamics li et al 2013 especially for the shallow lake in scenario 3 eight different wind directions under transferring flow rate of 30 m3 s were designed to investigate the effect of wind field on waster exchange fig 5b describes the spatial distribution of water age under different wind field conditions in the whole lake the minimum water age of 23 days was found the southwest wind condition while the east wind could cause a water age high up to 58 days interestingly water age in bay areas was more sensitive to the wind field than that in the open water areas for instance water age in zone i bay area was 138 days under southeast wind but 39 days for west wind however water age in zone iv open water area varied in the range of 15 45 days under all wind fields therefore in order to improve water exchange a southwest wind was suggested for the entire lake while west and northwest wind fields may be beneficial for polluted bay areas 3 3 impact of water diversion on water quality 3 3 1 impact of regular water diversion operation on water quality two different water quality conditions in the donating system have been applied to investigate the role of water diversion in the improvement of water quality actual monitoring data and administrative standard suggested by the local government were used in scenario 4 and 5 respectively as compared with the baseline scenario 1 average tn tp and chl a in the whole lake after water diversion scenario 4 was decreased by 3 7 10 35 and 5 99 to 1 44 mg l 0 094 mg l and 26 38 μg l respectively this implied that regular water diversion could improve lake water quality to some extent fig 7 depicts comparative temporal patterns of nutrients and chl a in site 1 bay area and site 5 central area with and without water diversion particularly water quality in site 1 had no direct and distinct response to water diversion in contrast to the baseline scenario tn tp and chl a was only decreased by 1 35 0 22 and 0 89 respectively in site 5 however the average tn tp and chl a showed a notable decrease by 5 73 20 14 and 10 00 to 1 41 mg l 0 11 mg l and 26 83 μg l respectively this suggested that responses of nutrients and chl a were more sensitive to water diversion in central area than those in the bay area as water quality in source water is dynamically changing water quality standard in river fuhe suggested by government in scenario 5 was also adopted to predict the influence of water diversion after water diversion average tn and chl a in the whole lake were decreased by 13 97 and 1 67 to 1 29 mg l and 27 67 μg l respectively unfortunately an average increase of 11 12 for tp implied the increasing deterioration of tp in the majority areas in the lake thus more stringent tp in the donating system should be executed in addition the influence of water diversion presented spatial heterogeneity due to various water exchange ability and nutrients levels in the donating system fig 7 response of nutrients concentrations in the central zone site 5 to water diversion was more sensitive than that in the bay area site 1 higher reduction of tn was observed in scenario 5 while distinct tp decreased was found in scenario 4 which may be associated with different initial nutrients levels in the source water moreover regardless of nutrients level in the inflow nutrients and chl a showed negligible fluctuations in site 1 revealing that regular water diversion operation could not improve water quality in the bay areas 3 3 2 impact of emergency water diversion operation on water quality according to the long term water quality monitoring data in lake wanghu non point source pollution during wet season june to august would result in poor water quality in addition water diversion project should avoid wet season to ensure the safety of flood control thus in emergency operation of scenario 7 a high flowrate of 100 m3 s was used to flush the lake for seven days starting from early may the water quality of source water was assumed to meet the standard proposed by the administrative department variations of water quality were evaluated after water diversion for seven days although water diversion could reduce the average tn by 11 65 to 1 23 mg l average tp was increased by 54 21 to 0 17 mg l obviously this high tp concentration could not meet the desired water quality standard different from regular water diversion both of water quality in the bay and central area could respond immediately to emergency water diversion fig 8 specifically both of tp in site 1 and 5 increased to a high level which may be ascribed to high p concentration in the donating system and facilitated internal p release by intensive disturbance zhang et al 2016 tn in site 5 showed a distinct decrease of 32 85 but less reduction of 7 55 was found for tn in site 1 in spite of apparent initial decrease chl a in site 5 returned back to normal level shortly actually phytoplankton biomass was dramatically diluted by input water with low chl a and subsequently flushed out of the lake within a short water age effect wan et al 2013 welch et al 1972 nonetheless high phosphorus after the water diversion could lead to accumulated phytoplankton biomass rapidly hence under emergency water diversion fluctuations of nutrients primarily resulted from water quality and quantity in the donating system and intensive release from sediments whereas short time flushing effect was responsible for chl a 3 4 relationship between water exchange and water quality fig 9 compares the improvement efficiency of water exchange and water quality variables in different regions of lake wanghu under regular water diversion scenario 4 and 5 on the whole improvement efficiency of water exchange was not in proportion to those of nutrients and chl a with notable spatial heterogeneity in both scenarios specifically the average improvement efficiency of 53 89 for water age in the entire lake was significantly higher than that of tp 10 34 and 11 12 in scenario 4 and 5 respectively tn 3 70 and 13 97 in scenario 4 and 5 respectively and chl a 5 99 and 1 67 in scenario 4 and 5 respectively this revealed the more remarkable improvement of hydrodynamic process was induced by water diversion as compared with that for various water quality variables both water exchange and water quality were slightly improved in the bay area as compared with scenario 1 water age in zone i and ii for scenario 4 and 5 was decreased by 14 79 and 19 90 to 123 and 104 days respectively tn concentration was decreased by 1 13 7 83 however higher phosphorus input from the source water had negligible improvement for the average tp in bay area extended water residence time and high nutrients levels resulted in less than 1 21 reduction of chl a concentration in the bay area interestingly water age in zone iv and v was decreased by 73 07 and 65 32 to 38 and 57 days respectively tn tp and chl a were decreased by 24 88 4 06 and 11 21 in zone iv for scenario 4 these high improvement efficiencies for hydrodynamics and water quality in zone iv and v may be related to their locations which were close to inlet and outlet of water transfer route respectively previously it is well known that long water age could facilitate the eutrophication process through improved nutrients uptake transformation and sink bargu et al 2019 and promote the growth and accumulation of algal biomass paerl and huisman 2008 nonetheless improvement efficiency of nutrients and chl a after water diversion can be influenced by characteristics of donating water system e g nutrients level receiving water system e g hydrodynamics lake topography and nutrients level and water diversion operation e g transferring flow rate timing and duration interactions between physicochemical and biological processes will determine variations of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass at different spatial and temporal scales thus it is inadequate to speculate variation of algal biomass based on renewal timescale alone in eutrophic lakes in fact diverse relationships e g positive insensitive non monotonic or spatiotemporal variable may exist among water transport time scales nutrients and algal biomass in various water systems bargu et al 2019 lucas et al 2009 phytoplankton biomass accumulation and productivity rates were probably correlated with the water residence time in a wet dry tropical estuary burford et al 2012 after a three year study of water residence time and cyanobacteria dynamics in a shallow lake lake albufera east spain algal biomass was stimulated by 1 2 orders of magnitude with an increased water residence time of 45 and thus flushing was recommended to minimize toxic cyanobacterial blooms romo et al 2013 furthermore since chl a was found to achieve a maximal value when flushing time was approximately four days in eutrophic new river estuary this non monotonic response of phytoplankton biomass to flushing time reflected a balance between nutrient stimulation of phytoplankton biomass and advective losses associated with inflow hall et al 2013 asynchronous response was also found between response variables n retention rate and explanatory variables water residence time and chl a in königshütte reservoir a highly flushed system kong et al 2019 lucas et al 2009 ascribed fuzzy relationship between transport time and algal biomass to phytoplankton growth loss balance using a simplified concept model in a steady state system thus the various limiting factors of algal growth e g nutrients and hydrodynamics could be responsible for these diverse relationships in different aquatic systems in this study the nutrients level in the donating system was a prerequisite to the relationship among water transport time scales nutrients and algal biomass in the eutrophic lake albeit disproportionate changing rates nutrients and algal biomass were positively related with water age during clean water diversion in contrast when the donating system was under the condition of high nutrients nutrients in the lake further accumulate and algal bloom would revive after temporary relief owing to flushing effect 3 5 implication for water diversion management in eutrophic lake in order to achieve sustainable management of the lake reduction of external and internal nutrients loadings is an essential prerequisite huang et al 2019 khorasani et al 2018 appropriate manipulation of water diversion should be employed to mediate hydrodynamic process and water quality in certain lake regions to some extent although water diversion project could remarkably enhance water exchange and shorten retention time in most lake regions its influence on water quality may be ambiguous because of covariation of different driving factors therefore some crucial strategies for water diversion of lake wanghu have been proposed in terms of hydrodynamics and water quality as follows 1 optimal transferring flow rate and wind condition transferring flow rate and wind condition during water diversion could physically accelerate water exchange thereby disturbing the biochemical process under regular operation in lake wanghu water age followed a power function of the transferring flow rate with optimal water transferring flow rate ranging from 20 to 30 m3 s regarding emergency operation larger transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s could provide more satisfactory results in short term operation of about seven days besides southwest wind was a relatively suitable condition for the entire lake whereas west and northwest benefited highly polluted bay areas 2 prerequisites for water quality in the donating system in scenario 5 it has been found that higher nutrients levels in the transferring water can pose threat to water quality in receiving water system which was in good agreement with previous studies davies et al 1992 zeng et al 2015 moreover in lake taihu water diversion project qin et al 2019 also reported that water diverted from the nearby nutrient enriched yangtze river actually led to increased nutrient loadings to taihu by 5 10 so they concluded that some detrimental effects would still exist e g nutrient enrichment and cyanobacteria bloom in the receiving water system hence it is necessary to assess the potential impacts of water diversion project on the eutrophication of the receiving system especially for eutrophic lakes relatively low nutrients concentration in the donating system is a prerequisite for water diversion the critical nutrients level shall be proposed earlier before water diversion implementation in water diversion project of lake wanghu tp in the source water shall keep a lower concentration or at least keep the current status instead of merely meeting the standard required by the administration department eventually more stringent p monitoring and management in river fuhe should be carried out to ensure the effectiveness of water diversion especially for emergency operation with a large amount of inflows 3 transferring operation options timing and duration under regular water diversion operation a constant low inflow rate around 20 to 30 m3 s was advised to accelerate water exchange in most regions of the lake however late spring before the wet season was a more ideal time to perform emergency operation and a high transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s could be helpful to prevent algal bloom 4 deployment of a reliable water diversion route due to different lake shape or topography schmadel et al 2018 and water diversion routes li et al 2011 it is very common to observe spatial heterogeneity of water exchange and water quality improvement during water diversion usually a reliable water diversion route shall be carefully deployed before water diversion transferring routes with multiple inlets were adopted to improve the water diversion performance in lake taihu and lake poyang li et al 2013 qi et al 2016 nevertheless because of very limited water sources near the basin in this study existing water diversion route with sole inlet can only improve the water exchange and water quality in some lake regions adjacent to water transfer route excluding the heavily polluted bay areas therefore apart from water diversion reinforced interconnection with other nearby lakes with desirable water quality may be a supplementary measure 4 conclusions a reliable 3 d hydrodynamic water quality sediment diagenesis model was developed to evaluate influences of water diversion on hydrodynamics and water quality in eutrophic shallow lake wanghu this water diversion project could remarkably enhance water exchange and shorten residence time in most lake regions yet its influence on water quality could be diverse because of covariation of different driving factors in the regular water diversion operation a water transferring flow rate of 20 30 m3 s was recommended to enhance water exchange however in a short term emergency operation a high transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s was proved to be the best option to mitigate algal bloom in late spring before the wet season although southwest wind significantly facilitated water exchange in the entire lake west and northwest wind fields were only beneficial for heavily polluted bay areas furthermore nutrients and chl a exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity in improvement efficiency during a clean water diversion nutrients and algal biomass were positively associated with water age nevertheless accumulated nutrients in the lake may trigger algal bloom after a temporary relief due to flushing effect under a circumstance of high nutrients level in the donating system more importantly p concentration in the source water shall be lower than existing administrative level therefore these fundamental strategies for water diversion could shed lights on sustainable management of eutrophic lake wanghu credit authorship contribution statement chunyan tang methodology software investigation writing

4976,water diversion has been increasingly applied to accelerate lake water exchange and alleviate urgent water crisis however effects of water diversion on water exchange and water quality for eutrophic lakes remain controversial in this study a three dimensional hydrodynamic water quality sediment diagenesis model has been developed to assess effects of water diversion on hydrodynamics and water quality in eutrophic shallow lake wanghu results suggested that water diversion could dramatically promote water exchange and reduce residence time in most lake regions but its influence on water quality was diverse a water transferring flow rate of 20 30 m3 s could reduce water age to 40 58 days during regular water diversion operation whereas a high transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s was the best for emergency operation in late spring before the wet season moreover nutrients and chlorophyll a exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity in improvement efficiency nutrients level in the donating system was a prerequisite to the relationship among water transport time scales nutrients and algal biomass in this eutrophic lake during a clean water diversion nutrients and algal biomass were positively associated with water age however when the donating system contained high level of nutrients accumulated nutrients in the lake may still trigger algal bloom after a temporary relief due to flushing effect therefore these water diversion strategies could be applied to guide a sustainable management of eutrophic lake wanghu in terms of transferring flow rate wind fields water quality in the donating system transferring operation and water diversion route keywords water diversion nutrients efdc water age lake management 1 introduction water quality deterioration is a ubiquitous issue caused by inappropriate anthropogenic activities and climate changes in freshwater bodies ho et al 2019 sinha et al 2017 smith and schindler 2009 currently water diversion project has been increasingly applied to accelerate water exchange and mitigate urgent water crisis hu et al 2008 yu et al 2018 theoretically this technique could shorten renewal time and push nutrients out of the lakes to abate water pollution in fact it has been successfully applied to contain algal bloom amid a short term in lake taihu and lake chaohu china hu et al 2010 xie et al 2009 moses and green lakes in washinton usa hilt et al 2011 welch 1981 lake tega and lake barato in japan amano et al 2010 shinohara et al 2008 etc nevertheless this application is still controversial because it may not address nutrients over enrichment and water quality degradation in lakes in the long run and even some detrimental effects have been reported in previous case studies khorasani et al 2018 qin et al 2019 yao et al 2018 in general the role of water diversion project in the improvement of water quality can be determined by multiple factors such as quantity and quality of water sources receiving water conditions transferring routes and operation regulations gao et al 2018 nutrients in the transferred water may be even higher than those in the receiving waterbodies which is caused by their own sources of pollution and self purification capacity despite the shortened residence time and enhanced water exchanging rate through water diversion the extra nutrients will be another critical concern due to an increased nutrients loading of 5 10 the water diversion from yangtze river failed to curb algal blooms in lake taihu qin et al 2019 on the other hand although high flushing rate may relieve the bloom issue in confined lake regions to some extent li et al 2013 liu et al 2014 zhai et al 2010 the entire efficiency of water diversion in small lakes was found to be much higher than that in large size lakes with greater spatial heterogeneity hu et al 2010 zeng et al 2015 furthermore except the most vigorous flushing condition a short residence time in major lake regions could not sufficiently impede the algal bloom because the growth rate of cyanobacteria can be doubled just within one day under appropriate conditions in order to evaluate the impact of water diversion project on hydrodynamics and water quality of lakes field monitoring and numerical modelling are the most commonly used methods however comparison of water quality before and after implementation of water diversion is restricted to confined regions and monitoring periods due to a huge demand of long term monitoring data hu et al 2010 nong et al 2020 roy et al 2016 thus numerical method could be a useful alternative to assess hydrodynamics and water quality responses to water diversion project in terms of comprehensive water quality models and transport time calculations vinçon leite and casenave 2019 nonetheless acquisition sufficient data is a prerequisite to parameterize calibrate and validate the water quality model for impact analyses of water diversion project zou et al 2014 in addition biochemical processes could also lead to uncertainties during simulations and predictions as a consequence transport time could be employed as a compromised option to estimate the water exchange process and further characterize the fate of pollutants and variability of phytoplankton biomass gao et al 2018 huang et al 2016 shen et al 2013 wan et al 2013 in fact short transport time theoretically reduces aggregation of algal biomass and nutrients retention thereby inhibiting eutrophication bargu et al 2019 janssen et al 2019 paerl and huisman 2008 schmadel et al 2018 transport time scale could be described by water age residence time and flushing time gómez et al 2014 viero and defina 2016 at present it is imperative to figure out the inherent relationship between transport time and nutrients or phytoplankton biomass usually transport time may induce different fluctuations in water quality and dynamics of phytoplankton in lakes water age demonstrated a similar spatial pattern with chlorophyll a chl a in poyang lake qi et al 2016 while it had a strong positive relationship with total phosphorus tp but was insensitive to total nitrogen tn and chl a during in lake dianchi zhang et al 2016 given these controversial findings water quality responses to water diversion should be comprehensively evaluated in this study a 3 d hydrodynamic water quality sediment diagenesis model will be introduced to evaluate the impact of water diversion on hydrodynamics and water quality in a eutrophic shallow lake in the middle of yangtze river delta lake wanghu multiple factors will be comprehensively considered in this model including quantity and quality of water sources receiving water conditions e g lake topography water quality etc and operation regulations specifically the main objectives of existing research are to 1 investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of water age resulting from water diversion project in lake wanghu 2 elucidate spatial responses of n and p concentrations and algal biomass to water diversion based on the aforementioned model and 3 figure out the intrinsic relationship between water exchange and eutrophication in this lake this work would gain novel insights into the dynamic response of water exchange nutrients and algae growth to water diversion which could in turn benefit the sustainable management of water diversion in eutrophic shallow lakes 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area lake wanghu located between 29 51 29 54 n and 115 20 115 25 e belongs to a crucial wetlandnaturereserve in china fig 1 it is a shallow lake with a surface area of 42 3 km2 and a mean depth of 3 7 m the main types of land use in the catchment include lakes paddy field forest land swag shrubland dry land etc lake wanghu has been suffering from severe eutrophication issue including p enrichment and algal bloom anthropogenic activities such as agriculture operation fish farming rural domestic sewage etc significantly contribute to water quality degradation of lake wanghu naturally high p background concentration in this watershed was another factor resulting in the fragile status of the lake zhu et al 2019 algal bloom in the lake usually occurred from june to august during then the average chl a concentration and algae density were around 45 μg l and 4056 cell ml respectively in 2018 the annual average tp and tn concentrations in lake wanghu were 0 27 and 0 88 mg l according to monthly monitoring data respectively tp was nearly 4 2 times higher than the limit value 0 05 mg l while tn could meet the management requirement 1 mg l complying with administrative department of lake wanghu usually higher nutrients concentrations were observed in wet season in the long run reduction of nutrients input is desired to mitigate eutrophication issue nonetheless hydrodynamic flushing with water from nearby rivers has been regarded as a practical technique to physically flush nutrients and algae out of the lake for emergency cases thus a short distance water diversion has been designed to transfer water from river fuhe to lake wanghu and ultimately into the yangtze river fig 1 in order to obtain a holistic understanding on the impacts of water diversion on spatiotemporal variations of water age nutrients and chl a lake wanghu was divided into five sub areas zone i to v according to its hydrological and ecological characteristics as shown in fig 1 2 2 model development in this study the impact of water diversion on hydrodynamics water age nutrient cycling and biological processes in the lake was evaluated by three dimensional 3 d hydrodynamics water quality sediment diagenesis model fig 2 lake wanghu model was built up based on environmental fluid dynamics code efdc which was initially developed by the united states environmental protection agency and has been successfully applied to simulate the hydrodynamics sediment transport toxic contaminant transport and water quality eutrophication components in coastal regions estuaries lakes reservoirs rivers and wetlands hamrick 1992 ji 2008 the governing mass balance equation for each of the water quality state

account for the diffusive transport the last term describes the kinetic processes and external loadings for each state variable in the wanghu model 16 water column states variables were used to describe the algae dynamics and nutrients cycles the modelling framework is shown in fig 2 chl a was used as an indirect measure of the overall algae population the considered phytoplankton can be expressed as 2 b t p b m p r b h ws b wb v where b is algal biomass g c m 3 t is time d p is production rate d 1 bm is basal metabolism rate d 1 pr is predation rate d 1 h is water depth m ws is positive settling velocity m d 1 wb is external loadings g c d 1 v is cell volume m3 sediment nutrient fluxes across the sediment water interface were simulated using a sediment diagenesis module which was internally coupled with water quality module the module consists three basic processes including depositional flux of particulate organic matter their diagenesis and the resulting sediment flux the governing equations in the sediment diagenesis model are detailed described in park et al 1995 the concept of water age was used to describe the spatiotemporal hydrodynamic impact of the water transfer process in this study water age is defined as the time that has elapsed since the particle under consideration left the region in which its age is prescribed as being zero delhez et al 1999 shen and wang 2007 it is calculated as follows 3 c t x t u c t x k c t x 0 4 α t x t u α t x k α t x c t x where c is the tracer concentration α is the age concentration u is the velocity field k is the diffusivity tensor t is time x is coordinate the mean water age a then can be calculated as follows 5 a t x α t x c t x lake wanghu model consisted rectangular grids with 3878 active cells with a uniform cell size 100 m in both x and y directions three evenly distributed sigma layers were adopted in the vertical dimension the bottom topography data were measured and interpolated into the model grids the model was driven by atmospheric forcing tributary inflow outflow and interaction with sediment flux the flow rate and water quality data of 11 primary rivers including water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do tp phosphate po4 3 tn ammonia nh4 chemical oxygen demand cod and chl a were monthly monitored from november 2018 to july 2019 as the model flow boundary inputs fig 1 water samples were manually collected at 50 cm below the surface water wt and do were measured in situ by ysi other water quality concentrations were analyzed in the laboratory tang et al 2020 tp and tn concentrations in unfiltered water were determined by spectrophotometry after digestion with alkaline potassium persulfate po4 3 and nh4 concentrations were analyzed by spectrophotometric method and nessler s reagent colorimetric method after filtered cod was analyzed by the standard dichromate method chl a concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry at wavelengths of 665 nm and 750 nm following extraction with hot 90 ethanol the daily meteorological data including atmospheric pressure surface air temperature relative humidity precipitation evaporation solar radiation and fractional cloud cover were sourced from the weather station near the lake the 10 water quality monitoring sites shown in fig 1 were used for model calibration 2 3 scenario definitions transferred water quantity and quality in the donating system river fuhe wind field and operation timing are considered as crucial factors affecting the efficiency of water diversion in table 1 seven scenarios based on the combinations of these factors were defined to investigate the response of water exchange n and p concentration and algal biomass to water diversion in lake wanghu more specifically scenario 1 was in the absence of water diversion and used as the baseline case for reference water diversion included two operation rules i e regular and emergency water diversion fresh water was transferred with a relatively low flow rate throughout the year in regular cases scenarios 2 5 while large quantity fresh water was transferred within a short period under emergency cases scenarios 6 and 7 under regular cases scenarios 2 and 3 were applied to examine the effect of transferring flow rate i e 5 to 100 m3 s and various wind fields on hydrodynamics respectively in addition two different water quality conditions in the donating system have been investigated in scenarios 4 and 5 which corresponded to monitoring data average concentration of tp 0 077 mg l and tn 1 63 mg l and administrative standard suggested by the local government tp 0 2 mg l and tn 1 mg l in emergency cases scenario 6 aimed to determine the role of flowrate and transferring period in hydrodynamics whereas scenario 7 was applied to elucidate the influence of water quality in the donating system on water quality in lake wanghu the model configurations and parameters excluding driving factors shown in table 1 were identical for all cases as aforementioned the improvement percentages of water exchange η wa and water quality η wq caused by different water diversion scenarios are calculated as follows 6 η wa w a 1 w a i w a 1 100 7 η wq w q i w q 1 w q 1 100 where wa1 and wa i is the water age day for the baseline scenario 1 and water diversion scenarios 2 7 in table 1 respectively wq1 and wq i is the concentrations of water quality variables mg l for the baseline scenario 1 and water diversion scenarios 2 7 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance this study performed multi sites 10 sites in fig 1 and multi variables i e water depth wd wt do tp tn nh4 cod and chl a calibration for the lake wanghu model the parameters were calibrated by trial and error method to make the modelling results best match the observed data the key calibrated parameters for lake wanghu model are listed in table s1 results showed that the model had an acceptable performance to reproduce the changes of hydrodynamics and water quality statistical results of model calibration at 10 monitoring sites are summarized in table 2 and the comparison of time series between simulated and observed data for site 5 in the central lake is depicted in fig 3 the hydrodynamic module exhibited good agreement between the simulated and observed water depth with an averaged relative error re and absolute error ae of 11 25 and 0 27 m respectively this indicated the module reproduced a good water balance related to inflow outflow precipitation and evaporation besides water temperature accurately followed the spatiotemporal trend of observed data with an averaged re of 9 58 suggesting that the model had reached a reasonable representation of thermal dynamic processes and provided a basis for verifying water quality dynamic processes different from the changing trend of water temperature the module demonstrated a lower do concentration in summer with the re of do concentration ranging from 16 61 to 26 93 despite some missing peak points various spatial distributions of re values for nutrient concentrations in table 2 also depicted acceptable mean re for tp tn nh4 and cod of 33 16 28 20 26 64 and 18 01 respectively although algal concentration in spring summer was slightly overestimated the model could capture the spatial heterogeneity and seasonal changes with re for chl a varying from 20 81 to 55 36 overall lake wanghu model could be applied for further analyses of water diversion scenarios 3 2 improvement of water exchange through water diversion water exchange characteristics could be described by spatiotemporal changes of water age li et al 2011 in the baseline scenario 1 the initial average water age in lake wanghu was 141 days but it may exhibit spatial heterogeneity resulting from tributary locations flow rates and wind fields the influence of water diversion on water exchange was comprehensively assessed in terms of various transferred flow rates scenario 2 operation durations scenario 6 and wind field conditions scenario 3 in scenario 2 eight flow rates ranging from 5 to 100 m3 s were designed to investigate the relationship between water exchange and transferring flow rate fig 4 demonstrates spatial distribution of water age under different transferring flow rates as the transferring flow rate was increased from 5 to 50 m3 s water age decreased from 153 to 25 days implying that water exchange could be enhanced through water diversion transferring water footprint was gradually diffused from zone iv to other subzones leading to heterogeneous spatial distribution of water age specifically water division could promote water exchange in zone iv near the inlet but had limited effect on water movement in bays zone i and ii which were away from the diversion route in fact due to lake size and complex shoreline many previous studies have also found that the improvement of water exchange may not involve the entire lake during the water diversion huang et al 2016 qi et al 2016 furthermore fig 5 a depicts the detailed relationship between water age and transferring flow rate using the function of wa 669 86 q 0 841 r2 0 9914 initially water age decreased dramatically with elevated transferring flow rate but tended to be stable after the flow rate reached 30 m3 s hence an economical water transferring flow rate of 20 30 m3 s would be recommended to improve water exchange water age of 40 58 days when water diversion project is regularly operated water diversion project has been widely deployed as an emergency technique to alleviate water pollution crisis in scenario 6 two high transferring flow rates 50 and 100 m3 s with various operation durations 1 30 days were selected to determine their influences on water exchange in lake wanghu fig 6 demonstrates the effective transferring areas under different transferring flow rates with varying water diversion durations as shown in fig 6 when the operation duration was within 7 days the effective exchange area corresponding to transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s was almost two times larger than that under 50 m3 s when the operation duration of emergency diversion was extended to 30 days the effective exchange area reached 81 91 and 90 31 for transferring flow rate of 50 and 100 m3 s respectively in addition half of the lake area could be effectively exchanged within 10 days under a transferring flow rate of 50 m3 s but it only took 5 days to achieve a similar area for transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s hence it could be concluded that a higher transferring flow rate may significantly improve water exchange in a short term but two different flow rates would ultimately achieve comparable effective exchange area with operation duration more than one week wind field is another driving factor affecting water dynamics li et al 2013 especially for the shallow lake in scenario 3 eight different wind directions under transferring flow rate of 30 m3 s were designed to investigate the effect of wind field on waster exchange fig 5b describes the spatial distribution of water age under different wind field conditions in the whole lake the minimum water age of 23 days was found the southwest wind condition while the east wind could cause a water age high up to 58 days interestingly water age in bay areas was more sensitive to the wind field than that in the open water areas for instance water age in zone i bay area was 138 days under southeast wind but 39 days for west wind however water age in zone iv open water area varied in the range of 15 45 days under all wind fields therefore in order to improve water exchange a southwest wind was suggested for the entire lake while west and northwest wind fields may be beneficial for polluted bay areas 3 3 impact of water diversion on water quality 3 3 1 impact of regular water diversion operation on water quality two different water quality conditions in the donating system have been applied to investigate the role of water diversion in the improvement of water quality actual monitoring data and administrative standard suggested by the local government were used in scenario 4 and 5 respectively as compared with the baseline scenario 1 average tn tp and chl a in the whole lake after water diversion scenario 4 was decreased by 3 7 10 35 and 5 99 to 1 44 mg l 0 094 mg l and 26 38 μg l respectively this implied that regular water diversion could improve lake water quality to some extent fig 7 depicts comparative temporal patterns of nutrients and chl a in site 1 bay area and site 5 central area with and without water diversion particularly water quality in site 1 had no direct and distinct response to water diversion in contrast to the baseline scenario tn tp and chl a was only decreased by 1 35 0 22 and 0 89 respectively in site 5 however the average tn tp and chl a showed a notable decrease by 5 73 20 14 and 10 00 to 1 41 mg l 0 11 mg l and 26 83 μg l respectively this suggested that responses of nutrients and chl a were more sensitive to water diversion in central area than those in the bay area as water quality in source water is dynamically changing water quality standard in river fuhe suggested by government in scenario 5 was also adopted to predict the influence of water diversion after water diversion average tn and chl a in the whole lake were decreased by 13 97 and 1 67 to 1 29 mg l and 27 67 μg l respectively unfortunately an average increase of 11 12 for tp implied the increasing deterioration of tp in the majority areas in the lake thus more stringent tp in the donating system should be executed in addition the influence of water diversion presented spatial heterogeneity due to various water exchange ability and nutrients levels in the donating system fig 7 response of nutrients concentrations in the central zone site 5 to water diversion was more sensitive than that in the bay area site 1 higher reduction of tn was observed in scenario 5 while distinct tp decreased was found in scenario 4 which may be associated with different initial nutrients levels in the source water moreover regardless of nutrients level in the inflow nutrients and chl a showed negligible fluctuations in site 1 revealing that regular water diversion operation could not improve water quality in the bay areas 3 3 2 impact of emergency water diversion operation on water quality according to the long term water quality monitoring data in lake wanghu non point source pollution during wet season june to august would result in poor water quality in addition water diversion project should avoid wet season to ensure the safety of flood control thus in emergency operation of scenario 7 a high flowrate of 100 m3 s was used to flush the lake for seven days starting from early may the water quality of source water was assumed to meet the standard proposed by the administrative department variations of water quality were evaluated after water diversion for seven days although water diversion could reduce the average tn by 11 65 to 1 23 mg l average tp was increased by 54 21 to 0 17 mg l obviously this high tp concentration could not meet the desired water quality standard different from regular water diversion both of water quality in the bay and central area could respond immediately to emergency water diversion fig 8 specifically both of tp in site 1 and 5 increased to a high level which may be ascribed to high p concentration in the donating system and facilitated internal p release by intensive disturbance zhang et al 2016 tn in site 5 showed a distinct decrease of 32 85 but less reduction of 7 55 was found for tn in site 1 in spite of apparent initial decrease chl a in site 5 returned back to normal level shortly actually phytoplankton biomass was dramatically diluted by input water with low chl a and subsequently flushed out of the lake within a short water age effect wan et al 2013 welch et al 1972 nonetheless high phosphorus after the water diversion could lead to accumulated phytoplankton biomass rapidly hence under emergency water diversion fluctuations of nutrients primarily resulted from water quality and quantity in the donating system and intensive release from sediments whereas short time flushing effect was responsible for chl a 3 4 relationship between water exchange and water quality fig 9 compares the improvement efficiency of water exchange and water quality variables in different regions of lake wanghu under regular water diversion scenario 4 and 5 on the whole improvement efficiency of water exchange was not in proportion to those of nutrients and chl a with notable spatial heterogeneity in both scenarios specifically the average improvement efficiency of 53 89 for water age in the entire lake was significantly higher than that of tp 10 34 and 11 12 in scenario 4 and 5 respectively tn 3 70 and 13 97 in scenario 4 and 5 respectively and chl a 5 99 and 1 67 in scenario 4 and 5 respectively this revealed the more remarkable improvement of hydrodynamic process was induced by water diversion as compared with that for various water quality variables both water exchange and water quality were slightly improved in the bay area as compared with scenario 1 water age in zone i and ii for scenario 4 and 5 was decreased by 14 79 and 19 90 to 123 and 104 days respectively tn concentration was decreased by 1 13 7 83 however higher phosphorus input from the source water had negligible improvement for the average tp in bay area extended water residence time and high nutrients levels resulted in less than 1 21 reduction of chl a concentration in the bay area interestingly water age in zone iv and v was decreased by 73 07 and 65 32 to 38 and 57 days respectively tn tp and chl a were decreased by 24 88 4 06 and 11 21 in zone iv for scenario 4 these high improvement efficiencies for hydrodynamics and water quality in zone iv and v may be related to their locations which were close to inlet and outlet of water transfer route respectively previously it is well known that long water age could facilitate the eutrophication process through improved nutrients uptake transformation and sink bargu et al 2019 and promote the growth and accumulation of algal biomass paerl and huisman 2008 nonetheless improvement efficiency of nutrients and chl a after water diversion can be influenced by characteristics of donating water system e g nutrients level receiving water system e g hydrodynamics lake topography and nutrients level and water diversion operation e g transferring flow rate timing and duration interactions between physicochemical and biological processes will determine variations of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass at different spatial and temporal scales thus it is inadequate to speculate variation of algal biomass based on renewal timescale alone in eutrophic lakes in fact diverse relationships e g positive insensitive non monotonic or spatiotemporal variable may exist among water transport time scales nutrients and algal biomass in various water systems bargu et al 2019 lucas et al 2009 phytoplankton biomass accumulation and productivity rates were probably correlated with the water residence time in a wet dry tropical estuary burford et al 2012 after a three year study of water residence time and cyanobacteria dynamics in a shallow lake lake albufera east spain algal biomass was stimulated by 1 2 orders of magnitude with an increased water residence time of 45 and thus flushing was recommended to minimize toxic cyanobacterial blooms romo et al 2013 furthermore since chl a was found to achieve a maximal value when flushing time was approximately four days in eutrophic new river estuary this non monotonic response of phytoplankton biomass to flushing time reflected a balance between nutrient stimulation of phytoplankton biomass and advective losses associated with inflow hall et al 2013 asynchronous response was also found between response variables n retention rate and explanatory variables water residence time and chl a in königshütte reservoir a highly flushed system kong et al 2019 lucas et al 2009 ascribed fuzzy relationship between transport time and algal biomass to phytoplankton growth loss balance using a simplified concept model in a steady state system thus the various limiting factors of algal growth e g nutrients and hydrodynamics could be responsible for these diverse relationships in different aquatic systems in this study the nutrients level in the donating system was a prerequisite to the relationship among water transport time scales nutrients and algal biomass in the eutrophic lake albeit disproportionate changing rates nutrients and algal biomass were positively related with water age during clean water diversion in contrast when the donating system was under the condition of high nutrients nutrients in the lake further accumulate and algal bloom would revive after temporary relief owing to flushing effect 3 5 implication for water diversion management in eutrophic lake in order to achieve sustainable management of the lake reduction of external and internal nutrients loadings is an essential prerequisite huang et al 2019 khorasani et al 2018 appropriate manipulation of water diversion should be employed to mediate hydrodynamic process and water quality in certain lake regions to some extent although water diversion project could remarkably enhance water exchange and shorten retention time in most lake regions its influence on water quality may be ambiguous because of covariation of different driving factors therefore some crucial strategies for water diversion of lake wanghu have been proposed in terms of hydrodynamics and water quality as follows 1 optimal transferring flow rate and wind condition transferring flow rate and wind condition during water diversion could physically accelerate water exchange thereby disturbing the biochemical process under regular operation in lake wanghu water age followed a power function of the transferring flow rate with optimal water transferring flow rate ranging from 20 to 30 m3 s regarding emergency operation larger transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s could provide more satisfactory results in short term operation of about seven days besides southwest wind was a relatively suitable condition for the entire lake whereas west and northwest benefited highly polluted bay areas 2 prerequisites for water quality in the donating system in scenario 5 it has been found that higher nutrients levels in the transferring water can pose threat to water quality in receiving water system which was in good agreement with previous studies davies et al 1992 zeng et al 2015 moreover in lake taihu water diversion project qin et al 2019 also reported that water diverted from the nearby nutrient enriched yangtze river actually led to increased nutrient loadings to taihu by 5 10 so they concluded that some detrimental effects would still exist e g nutrient enrichment and cyanobacteria bloom in the receiving water system hence it is necessary to assess the potential impacts of water diversion project on the eutrophication of the receiving system especially for eutrophic lakes relatively low nutrients concentration in the donating system is a prerequisite for water diversion the critical nutrients level shall be proposed earlier before water diversion implementation in water diversion project of lake wanghu tp in the source water shall keep a lower concentration or at least keep the current status instead of merely meeting the standard required by the administration department eventually more stringent p monitoring and management in river fuhe should be carried out to ensure the effectiveness of water diversion especially for emergency operation with a large amount of inflows 3 transferring operation options timing and duration under regular water diversion operation a constant low inflow rate around 20 to 30 m3 s was advised to accelerate water exchange in most regions of the lake however late spring before the wet season was a more ideal time to perform emergency operation and a high transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s could be helpful to prevent algal bloom 4 deployment of a reliable water diversion route due to different lake shape or topography schmadel et al 2018 and water diversion routes li et al 2011 it is very common to observe spatial heterogeneity of water exchange and water quality improvement during water diversion usually a reliable water diversion route shall be carefully deployed before water diversion transferring routes with multiple inlets were adopted to improve the water diversion performance in lake taihu and lake poyang li et al 2013 qi et al 2016 nevertheless because of very limited water sources near the basin in this study existing water diversion route with sole inlet can only improve the water exchange and water quality in some lake regions adjacent to water transfer route excluding the heavily polluted bay areas therefore apart from water diversion reinforced interconnection with other nearby lakes with desirable water quality may be a supplementary measure 4 conclusions a reliable 3 d hydrodynamic water quality sediment diagenesis model was developed to evaluate influences of water diversion on hydrodynamics and water quality in eutrophic shallow lake wanghu this water diversion project could remarkably enhance water exchange and shorten residence time in most lake regions yet its influence on water quality could be diverse because of covariation of different driving factors in the regular water diversion operation a water transferring flow rate of 20 30 m3 s was recommended to enhance water exchange however in a short term emergency operation a high transferring flow rate of 100 m3 s was proved to be the best option to mitigate algal bloom in late spring before the wet season although southwest wind significantly facilitated water exchange in the entire lake west and northwest wind fields were only beneficial for heavily polluted bay areas furthermore nutrients and chl a exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity in improvement efficiency during a clean water diversion nutrients and algal biomass were positively associated with water age nevertheless accumulated nutrients in the lake may trigger algal bloom after a temporary relief due to flushing effect under a circumstance of high nutrients level in the donating system more importantly p concentration in the source water shall be lower than existing administrative level therefore these fundamental strategies for water diversion could shed lights on sustainable management of eutrophic lake wanghu credit authorship contribution statement chunyan tang methodology software investigation writing

4977,flow within offshore aquifers is important for the management of fresh groundwater in coastal zones alongshore head gradients have been observed in many coastal aquifers however this process is typically neglected and offshore aquifers are primarily assessed using cross sectional representations this study explores offshore implications of alongshore head gradients onshore including the alongshore circulation of submarine groundwater using 3d synthetic numerical models model parameter ranges were guided by those observed in seven real world cases each 3d simulation is compared against three 2d cross sectional numerical models to identify the potential mismatch between 2d and 3d approaches results show that alongshore freshwater circulation afwc is greater where alongshore head gradients are steeper onshore heads are lower on average or for low hydraulic conductivity of the offshore aquitard we show that afwc can be significant with a maximum afwc rate of 70 observed across the simulated cases the 3d models show that even though onshore heads indicate active seawater intrusion alongshore head gradients can protect regions of low head such that recirculated freshwater instead of seawater is drawn into onshore wells we conclude that in many situations freshwater flowing from offshore to onshore aquifers may be recirculated groundwater from the onshore aquifers from where the onshore head is higher rather than relic freshwater as has been concluded from cross sectional analysis in previous studies these observations have implications for coastal groundwater management and importantly suggest that long lived contaminants that discharge offshore may return onshore keywords offshore fresh groundwater coastal aquifer saltwater intrusion numerical

the solution to examine the extent of freshwater in the upper floridian aquifer usa and concluded that present day conditions are capable of driving freshwater tens of kilometres offshore pauw et al 2017 applied the bakker 2006 model to several transects of dutch aquifers and demonstrated that alongshore variations in the hydro stratigraphy can generate significantly different ofg distributions in the alongshore direction werner and robinson 2018 presented a modification to the bakker 2006 solutions that allows for a specified salinity in the offshore semi confining unit overlying the offshore freshwater aquifer the modification by werner and robinson 2018 resolved the issue encountered by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who showed that offshore aquitards are more likely to contain freshwater rather than the seawater assumption of bakker 2006 where aquitards overlie fresh offshore aquifers the werner and robinson 2018 solution was applied to 27 regions by knight et al 2018 who concluded that offshore freshwater is likely to influence onshore salinities in 24 of those regions most applications of numerical methods to investigate ofg use 2d cross sectional representations of offshore conditions e g michael et al 2016 paldor et al 2019 solórzano rivas et al 2019 cross sectional models of dispersive flow and transport are significantly less computationally expensive than 3d models that often require relatively coarse grid discretisation the use of coarse grids limits the simulation of local scale dispersive processes that might otherwise require fine grid resolution cross sectional numerical models have been used to investigate the emplacement of ofg under glacial conditions e g marksamer et al 2007 person et al 2012 the effect of pumping both onshore and offshore on ofg extent and longevity e g amir et al 2013 morgan et al 2018 paldor et al 2019 yu and michael 2019a 2019b and the effect of geological heterogeneity on offshore flow paths e g michael et al 2016 however 2d approaches require the assumption that the system is unchanging in the alongshore direction this assumption may often be invalid as alongshore head gradients are likely to be widespread as shown in several studies e g nativ and weisbrod 1994 de melo et al 2001 kaleris et al 2002 zulfic et al 2008 morgan et al 2016 ofg has been investigated through more realistic 3d numerical modelling in only a small number of cases for example cohen et al 2010 and siegel et al 2014 investigated the role of glacial loading and sea level fluctuations on ofg development both studies incorporated a time variable sea level and applied onshore boundary conditions that accounted for a significant increase in hydraulic head due to the accumulation of considerable overlying ice mass the model domain used by cohen et al 2010 extended several hundreds of kilometres in the alongshore direction while the model domain used by siegel et al 2014 was 50 km in the alongshore direction both studies concluded that elevated glacial driven recharge during glacial maxima can generate ofg extents that vary across the model domains in the alongshore direction mulligan et al 2007 used a simplified 3d numerical model to investigate the impact that paleo channels that incise through the offshore confining unit have on offshore freshwater saltwater exchange they found that increased freshwater saltwater mixing can occur around submarine paleo channels mulligan et al 2007 also identified that paleo channels can generate localised lateral flow towards the paleo channel in offshore semi confined aquifers these conditions increase the offshore freshwater flux at the coastline and reduce the predicted ofg extent investigations into the longevity of the new jersey usa water supply by mcauley et al 2001 and pope 2006 provide rare examples of regional scale 3d numerical models that explore ofg distributions in both present day and pre development conditions both studies identified an offshore freshwater saltwater interface and estimated an approximate freshwater resource lifespan of several hundred years under several extraction scenarios significant alongshore hydraulic gradients ahgs have been identified in several regions globally e g nativ and weisbrod 1994 de melo et al 2001 kaleris et al 2002 zulfic et al 2008 morgan et al 2016 these ahgs have been shown to be due to natural forces e g varying recharge or topographic influences or human impacts e g groundwater abstraction in these regions the negligible transverse flow i e flow parallel to the shoreline assumption required to apply 2d analytical and or numerical models may be invalid despite the issues with their use 2d cross sectional approaches have been applied to ofg investigations in at least two of these areas e g amir et al 2013 morgan et al 2018 paldor et al 2019 knight et al 2018 hypothesised that in some regions ahgs may result in alongshore freshwater circulation afwc i e where freshwater passes into the offshore portion of the semi confined aquifer in places of highest onshore head before circulating within the offshore aquifer and subsequently flowing back onshore at another location however the occurrence and magnitude of any freshwater recirculation remains unstudied additionally the validity of the use of cross sectional models to investigate ofg in regions with an ahg is unknown this study explores the potential for afwc to occur because of an ahg we identify the conditions required for afwc to occur using 3d numerical modelling freshwater fluxes at the coastline are explored to determine potential afwc percentages for a range of conditions we compare the modelled freshwater saltwater interface from 2d and 3d numerical models of simplified coastal aquifer systems to investigate potential deviations between the different approaches to our knowledge this study is the first published investigation of the negligible transverse flow assumption that is often made in offshore aquifers investigations that use 2d cross section models 2 methods 2 1 justification of hydraulic parameters and conceptual model hydrogeological parameters from seven regions were collated from existing literature to guide the development and parameterisation of the synthetic 3d numerical models used in this study a conceptualisation of the simplified model domain is shown in fig 1 a with the regional parameters presented in the table 1 the parameters of interest in this study are the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k a l t 1 the aquitard hydraulic conductivity k v l t 1 the depth below sea level to the top of the aquitard h s l the aquifer thicknesses h l the aquitard thickness h l l the influence of maximum and minimum onshore heads h max and h min respectively l the transverse distance between h max and h min δy l and the onshore and offshore lengths of the semi confined aquifer l c and l s respectively l 2d and 3d models are compared using 2d models at the front face middle and back face of 3d models as illustrated in fig 1b 2 2 boundary conditions a specified head boundary was applied at the landward vertical face of the model domain heads at the front face see fig 1b of the onshore boundary were set as h max with heads decreasing linearly to h min at the back face see fig 1b of the onshore boundary the onshore boundary had freshwater inflows 0 g l 1 and ambient concentration outflows no flow boundary conditions were applied at the onshore portion of the semi confining unit the lower boundary and the front and the back faces of the model domain the ocean was represented using a specified saltwater hydraulic head set to 0 m for both the vertical offshore boundary and the top cells of the aquitard in the offshore region the transport boundary conditions for these cells were set to allow saltwater 35 g l 1 inflows and ambient concentration outflows this approach assumes that freshwater outflows do not result in significant local freshening of the ocean three 2d models were also generated for each parameter set see fig 1b the 2d models replicated the conditions modelled at the front face middle row and back face of each 3d model which differed according to the head at the inland boundary h max h mid and h min respectively 2 3 simulation cases twelve parameter combinations were selected to explore afwc using variable density numerical models that were simulated using seawat langevin et al 2008 in all simulations δy was fixed at 15 km while h and h l were 40 m and 10 m respectively δy varies in the real world cases between 4 4 km and 83 km see table 1 the alongshore width selected represents a balance between computational effort and the need to simulate regional scale situations for example simulations run times using an intel i7 3 6 ghz processor for the 3d simulations ranged from 27 to 35 days the model domain extends 5 km onshore while the modelled offshore domain varied between simulations the werner and robinson 2018 sharp interface analytical solution was used to calculate an ofg extent for each parameter combination to ensure that the model extent was sufficient to minimise the influence of boundary effects based on the werner and robinson 2018 solution the offshore boundary was set to be 10 km seaward of the maximum offshore freshwater extent calculated for each parameter set the offshore distance of the aquifer is inconsequential if the offshore domain includes the freshwater extent because flows within the seawater part of the aquifer are small relative to rates of freshwater flow the parameters of the 12 synthetic models table 2 are within the upper and lower limits of recorded real world values table 1 in addition to the parameters in table 2 the molecular diffusion coefficient was 1 10 9 m2 s 1 for all simulations the vertical leakance c h 1 k v t bakker 2006 of the aquitard in the synthetic models spans the range of values observed in the real world cases despite the thickness of the synthetic model aquitard being equal to the thinnest recorded real world case i e 10 m adelaide zulfic et al 2008 typical ranges of aquitard conductance were represented by modifying k v to avoid simulating thick aquitards and thereby reducing the numerical burden the ahg in the synthetic models ranged between 0 4 m km 1 and 1 8 m km 1 while the ahgs of the real world regions ranged between 0 05 m km 1 and 2 m km 1 the parameter combinations of cases s1 to s12 table 2 were selected to investigate the behaviour of afwc for variations in three different processes the parameters of the first simulation s1 are a central base case from which parameters were varied to produce offshore freshwater extents that were both larger and smaller than s1 simulations s1 s4 are used to investigate how changes in k v impact afwc simulations s5 s8 in addition to s1 are used to investigate how the onshore heads influence afwc simulation s9 s12 in addition to s1 are used to investigate how ahgs influence afwc in these simulations h mid remains fixed with the onshore boundary heads in either direction alongshore changing by the specified gradient δh δy all numerical simulations were run to steady state that was assessed according to the total mass within the model domain the 50 seawater concentration isochlor was extracted from the top and bottom layers of the semi confined aquifer to capture the position of the tip x tip l and toe x toe l of the freshwater saltwater interface these values were used in the comparisons between the 2d and 3d approaches the horizontal fluid fluxes and fluid salinity across the coastline were evaluated to calculate afwc freshwater fluxes were calculated in each cell at the shoreline using 1 q f q 1 c c s where q f is the freshwater flux l3 t 1 q is the total fluid flux across the shoreline in each model cell l3 t 1 c is the salinity within each model cell m l 3 and cs is the salinity of seawater m l 3 afwc was calculated as sum of q f crossing the shoreline in the onshore direction for the entire model divided by the sum of q f in the offshore direction 2 4 grid dependency and justification of dispersivities a grid sensitivity analysis was undertaken to evaluate the impact of grid discretization and dispersivity on the results dispersion parameters and the cell size represent a balance between computation load stability of the numerical method and accuracy due to resource constraints grid sensitivity was undertaken using 2d cross sectional models rather than 3d seven different horizontal cell widths δx i e 5 m 10 m 25 m 50 m 75 m 100 m and 125 m were tested on the s4 transect see table 2 that had an onshore head of h max and a longitudinal dispersivity α l of 25 m for all simulations in the grid sensitivity analysis and in the cases outlined in section 2 3 the aquitard and aquifer layers had a fixed thickness of 1 m and 2 m respectively four sets of dispersivity values for the aquifer cells were also tested using the s4 transect with a cell size of 5 m namely α l values of 1 m 5 m 10 m and 25 m horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivity α t and α v respectively values were set at α l 10 for the aquitard both α l and α t were set at 0 5 m and α v was set at 0 05 m where flow is assumed to be predominantly vertical the 50 isochlors of each simulation were compared to identify 1 the slope of the freshwater saltwater interface calculated using s l o p e h x t i p 50 x t o e 50 where x tip50 and x toe50 are x tip and x toe of the 50 isochlor respectively and 2 the displacement in the position of the mixing zone following the grid sensitivity study i e fig 2 grids for cases s1 s12 were set up as follows 1 the width and length of the offshore grid cells was set at 125 m and 2 in the onshore portion of the domain between the onshore boundary and 2 5 km from the coastline the length perpendicular to the coastline of the onshore cells decreases from 375 m near the boundary to 125 m the change in cell size between neighbouring cells did not exceed 50 the 3d models cases s1 s12 were set up to ensure that wherever possible the grid péclet number δ x α l in the aquifer did not exceed the critical value of 2 suggested by zheng and bennett 2002 the cell sizes adopted for the aquifer cells in this study are finer than those adopted in other studies of a similar scale e g 50 500 m mulligan et al 2007 2 km siegel et al 2014 a longitudinal dispersivity of 25 m was adopted in the aquifer while α t and α v values were set at 2 5 m these dispersivities are consistent with parameters of similar studies e g mulligan et al 2007 amir et al 2013 siegel et al 2014 3 results 3 1 grid dependency values of x tip50 and x toe50 for each of the grid dependency simulations and sensitivity analysis of dispersivity are shown in fig 2 in the grid dependency simulations fig 2a the largest change in x tip50 from changing δx occurred between the δx 5 m and δx 10 m simulations x tip50 moves further offshore as δx increases i e for δx 10 m although to a lesser degree this observation suggests that x tip50 has a higher sensitivity to grid resolution at low values of δx x toe50 shows a slightly non monotonic behaviour for the lower values of δx i e δx 5 m to δx 25 m in fig 2a x toe50 is located closer to the shore for simulations with larger δx however between δx 25 m and δx 125 m x toe50 is located further offshore for larger δx values the slope of the interface is also influenced by the grid resolution the slope of the interface is steeper 17 8 for the δx 5 m simulation compared to the δx 25 m simulation 8 simulations with δx 25 m all have interface slopes on the order of 8 this suggests that both x tip50 and x toe50 move offshore at approximately the same rate for a given increase in δx after δx 25 m the sensitivity to changes in α l shown in fig 2b indicate that for the ranges of α l and δx tested here both x tip50 and x toe50 are more sensitive to the changes in α l than changes in δx for the α l simulations that use δx 5 m x tip50 shows a greater sensitivity to increases in α l at low values of α l in all simulations that investigate sensitivity to α l x tip50 is located further shoreward for larger α l values x toe50 appears to be more sensitive to increases in α l than x tip50 especially at low α l values in all simulations tested here x toe50 is located further offshore for larger α l values the slope of the interface increases from 2 1 for α l 1 m to 17 8 for α l 25 m this change in slope is caused by the movement of both x tip50 and x toe50 with x tip50 6 2 530 m further offshore in the α l 1 m simulation than in the α l 25 m simulation the location of x toe is 17 5 1160 m further onshore in the α l 1 m simulation relative to the α l 25 m simulation 3 2 calculated alongshore freshwater circulation the percentage of afwc for each simulation is presented in fig 3 the simulations investigating the impact of k v on afwc fig 3a indicate that the percentage of afwc is higher for lower values of k v for example the percentage of afwc was 19 2 for k v 1 0 10 5 m d 1 and 1 7 for k v 1 0 10 3 m d 1 fig 3a this trend appears to be non linear as the change between s2 and s3 k v 1 0 10 5 m d 1 and k v 1 0 10 4 m d 1 respectively results in a decrease in afwc by 17 5 while the change between s3 and s4 k v 1 0 10 4 m d 1 and k v 1 0 10 3 m d 1 respectively results in a 0 9 decrease in afwc results from the simulations that investigate the impact of the onshore head relative to sea level on afwc are shown in fig 3b the percentage of afwc decreases from 70 3 h max 14 m to 0 as h min increases towards the minimum head required to prevent the onset of active seawater intrusion swi i e 1 m fig 4 b this threshold value was calculated using h f δ h s h l where h f is the equivalent freshwater head imposed by the sea δ is the dimensionless difference between the density of freshwater ρ f m l 3 and the density of saltwater ρ f m l 3 as calculated by δ ρ s ρ f ρ f werner 2017 values of 1025 to 1035 kg m 3 and 1000 kg m 3 are typically used for ρ s and ρ f respectively e g werner 2017 yu and michael 2019b active swi is predicted when h f the onshore head for simulations s7 and s8 h min is h f and no afwc occurs in the systems modelled here a 1 m decline in the onshore heads relative to sea level results in approximately a 10 increase in afwc the relationship between afwc and the ahg is shown in fig 3c in this set of simulations no notable afwc is predicted in s9 and s10 as in these cases h min h f in simulation s10 h min at the base of the aquifer is lower than the equivalent freshwater head of seawater at the base of the aquifer h fbase l where h f b a s e δ h s h l h as a result there is a small onshore freshwater flux at the coastline in this section of the aquifer this circulation represents a total volume of afwc of 0 01 in simulations s1 s11 and s12 h min h f in these three simulations the percentage of afwc increases approximately linearly as the ahg increases across these three simulations an increase in the ahg of 1 m km 1 causes a 28 increase in afwc the flow vectors for simulations s1 and s5 s8 are shown in fig 4 flow vectors for the remaining simulations are presented in the supporting information see figs s1 and s2 the results presented in fig 4 suggest that the transverse flow of freshwater within the onshore domain is a major control on the onshore salinities this trend is common across all simulations where part of the onshore domain has a head lower than h f for the simulations shown in fig 4 the component of transverse flow in the offshore domain decreases as the head at the onshore boundary increases this matches the observed reduction in afwc as the onshore heads increase fig 3 in s7 there is still notable transverse freshwater flow in the offshore domain even though h min h f there is only a minor transverse offshore flow component in s8 which has the highest values of h min h min and h max in simulations s1 s4 shown in fig s1 the transverse flow component reduces as k v increases all of the simulations that investigate the impact of the ahg s1 s9 s12 had notable transverse flow in the offshore aquifer fig s2 in these simulations the proportion of transverse offshore flow increased as the ahg increased interestingly the location of the freshwater saltwater interface in these five simulations shows little variation despite h max ranging from 6 5 m to 17 m fluid flow through the coastline for simulation s5 is shown in fig 5 fig 5a shows that the zone of maximum onshore flow does not necessarily coincide with the zone of maximum onshore freshwater flow shown in fig 5b this disconnection is due to the total flux cross the coastline shown in fig 5a incorporates both freshwater and saltwater components there are higher rates of afwc in the lower portions of the semi confined aquifer compared to the upper portions conversely there are higher rates of freshwater discharging to the offshore region in the upper portions of the semi confined aquifer 3 3 comparison of 2d and 3d simulations fig 6 shows the difference between x tip50 for the front face blue circles middle row red squares and back face green triangles of each 3d model and their 2d equivalents fig 6a indicates that the difference in the x tip50 between the 2d and 3d simulations is smaller for larger values of k v for the front middle and back faces of the model the 2d simulations over predict the location of x tip50 at the front face blue circles and under predict the ofg extent at the back face green triangles for low values of k v values of x tip50 at the back face show non monotonic behaviour for variations k v fig 6a for example in simulations where k v 2 5 10 5 m d 1 log10 k v 4 6 m d 1 s1 and s2 the difference in x tip50 between the 2d and 3d simulations approaches zero with increasing k v fig 6a the middle face red squares shows the smallest deviation between the x tip50 in the 2d and 3d simulations for variations k v fig 6a fig 6b shows that the difference between x tip50 position in the 2d and 3d simulations at the front face blue circles is smaller for higher values of h min i e higher overall onshore heads for the back face green triangles the freshwater saltwater interface reached the onshore boundary in both the 2d and 3d simulations in s5 and s6 as such these two data points return a minimal difference between x tip50 of the 2d and 3d simulations while h min is also less than sea level in the s1 case shown in fig 6b x tip50 at the back face of the 3d simulations remains offshore due to the transverse movement of freshwater both onshore and offshore this results in a major difference between ofg extents predicted by the 2d and 3d models in the simulations where h min h f s7 and s8 the difference at the back face between the 2d and 3d simulations is smaller for larger values of h min the middle row of the models red squares had a large difference between the x tip50 in the 2d and 3d models where h min h f however for cases where h min h f the difference between x tip50 of the 2d and 3d models for the middle row approaches zero fig 6c shows the cases where the ahg was varied the difference between x tip50 for the 2d and 3d simulations at the front face blue circles is larger for larger values of ahg two distinct trends are apparent in the data showing the back face green circles comparisons these two trends appear to be controlled by the presence of active swi in the model domain active swi is not predicted at the back face for the simulations with an ahg of 0 2 m km 1 s9 and 0 4 m km 1 s10 in scenarios s9 and s10 the difference between the 2d and 3d model predictions is larger for larger values of δh δy with the 2d models under predicting the extent of ofg at the back face however in scenarios where h min h f s1 s11 and s12 the difference between the 2d and 3d models is smaller for larger values of ahg the 2d simulation still under predict the ofg extent at the back face in all ahg simulations for the data comparing the 2d and 3d data for the middle section of the model domain red squares there appears to be minimal difference in the calculated ofg extent under higher ahgs the 2d simulations slightly under predict the ofg extent in the middle cross section of the model 4 discussion 4 1 grid sensitivity in the 2d grid sensitivity simulations the cell size of 125 m and α l of 25 m that was used in the 3d models generates an interface that is further offshore than in the models with a finer grid discretisation and a smaller α l however the shoreward shift in the interface due to the adopted α l value is mitigated by the seaward shift in the calculated interface due to the increase in cell size when the effects of both the increased δx and larger α l are combined there was only a 2 1 difference in x tip between the fine discretisation δx 5 m and α l 1 m and coarse discretisation δx 125 m and α l 25 m simulations at the toe the increased δx and larger α l both led to a seaward shift in x toe when compared to x toe of the simulation with a fine discretisation as a result x toe in the coarse discretisation model was 17 further offshore than in its finer discretised counterpart these observations suggest that the impact of the selected discretisation is likely greater at the base of the aquifer the trends in the location of the freshwater saltwater interface observed in our grid resolution and dispersion investigation simulations are similar to those identified by solórzano rivas et al 2019 in their study solórzano rivas et al 2019 investigated the influence of dispersion on offshore freshwater saltwater interfaces solórzano rivas et al 2019 identified that an increase in α l from 1 m to 20 m resulted in a shoreward shift in x tip and an offshore shift in x toe of a similar magnitude a dimensionless sensitivity s of 0 29 0 32 to those observed in our simulations i e s 0 29 s is calculated using s δ x t i p α l x t i p δ α l werner and robinson 2018 due to long model run times it was not feasible to assess the impacts of the selected discretisation using 3d simulations while the effect of the selected model parameters on the 3d simulations is challenging to predict it is likely that the cell discretisation and α l adopted in the 3d simulations resulted in an over estimation of the ofg extent particularly at the toe when compared to a finer discretised model however as there is no notable change in the freshwater fluxes at the coastline in our 2d grid dependency simulations it appears unlikely that the use of a finer mesh would have had a significant impact on the calculated afwc 4 2 calculated alongshore freshwater circulation afwc occurred in all the cases modelled where h min h f all three of the hydrogeological processes explored k v h min and δh δy were able to generate afwc to some degree over the range of conditions modelled the simulations that investigated the effect of k v on afwc showed that for a relatively thin semi confining unit i e h l 10 m with a low k v 1 10 5 m d 1 up to 19 of the freshwater that discharged into the offshore domain may return onshore however the proportion of afwc is smaller for larger values of k v when comparing the vertical leakance of semi confining units modelled against the real world cases presented in table 1 two of the seven regions have vertical leakance values of the same order of magnitude as the s2 case and three have values of vertical leakance comparable to s3 while the last two have a value of vertical leakance that falls between s3 and s4 the simulations presented here also suggest that the amount of afwc is highly sensitive to the magnitude of the onshore heads relative to sea level lowering the onshore heads has two impacts on the model firstly by reducing the head along the onshore boundary the percentage of the model domain subjected to active swi conditions i e onshore heads 1 m increased simulations s6 and s12 both have a similar percentage of the onshore boundary 1 m 39 and 36 respectively and share afwc rates of 38 this suggests that the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f may form a strong control on the afwc percentages to test this one additional simulation herein referred to as s13 was undertaken with a δh δy of 0 4 m km 1 and h mid 0 525 m with all other parameters were consistent with s1 this parameter combination produces a model with the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f comparable to s5 the calculated percentage of afwc in s13 was similar to s5 63 9 and 70 3 respectively this finding supports the notion that afwc in the model domain is strongly controlled by the proportion of the onshore boundary under active swi conditions secondly lowering the onshore heads reduced q f in the offshore direction resulting in a landward movement of the freshwater saltwater interface and a reduced ofg extent the higher percentages of afwc associated with situations involving smaller bodies of ofg as shown in fig 4 are likely caused by the higher rates of transverse flow in the offshore semi confined aquifer close to the shoreline this is evident in the differences in velocity fields for the ofg cases shown in fig 4 the apparent relationship between the afwc and the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads 1 m is also apparent in the response of afwc to changes in the ahg it is interesting to note that although h min in s12 is lower than in s5 7 m and 6 m respectively the percentage of afwc in s5 70 3 is almost double the percentage of afwc measured in s12 38 1 this is despite the maximum seaward q f in s12 being four times greater than in s5 while the maximum landward q f in s12 is three time greater than in s5 when plotting the percentage of afwc against the percentage of the onshore boundary h f for simulations s5 s12 a clear linear relationship appears fig 7 the regression line though these data returns a relationship of afwc 1 07x 2 where x is the percent of the onshore boundary h f this relationship has a pearson r2 of 0 97 suggesting that the relationship is robust the data points from the simulations that investigated changes in k v i e s1 s4 triangle markers in fig 7 indicate that k v may change the relationship between the percentage of the onshore boundary h f and the degree of afwc further investigations into relationships between k v afwc and the proportion of the onshore boundary h f are warranted in future work the results of this study indicate that afwc may play a key role in maintaining onshore water qualities in some coastal aquifers fig 8 shows an illustration of the potential role that afwc may play in maintaining onshore freshwater under steady state conditions in the illustration of s5 shown in fig 8 afwc shifts the freshwater saltwater interface towards h min i e the 15 000 m end similar behaviour is visible in all simulations with h min 1 m these findings are significant as they indicate that a reduction in h max may have major downstream implications both onshore and offshore in some regions lowering h max would likely reduce transverse freshwater flow in both the onshore and offshore domains causing the freshwater saltwater interface to shift towards h max this would result in an increased zone of salinization in the onshore region that would otherwise remain fresh under steady state conditions afwc has potential implications on the estimation of coastal chemical and nutrient budgets the results presented in this study indicate that in situations involving high vertical leakance and onshore aquifers experiencing active swi conditions ignoring afwc could result in the overestimation by up to 70 of groundwater discharge and accompanying waterborne constituents e g nutrients etc flowing to the sea e g see fig 3b this highlights the importance of considering afwc in assessing regional scale nutrient budgets within near shore environments additionally afwc may have implications for the fate of coastal contaminants as our results suggest that there is potential for terrestrially originating contaminants to re enter the onshore environment from offshore 4 3 comparison of 2d and 3d simulations the results presented in fig 6 suggest that the negligible transverse assumption required to apply 2d models may only add low uncertainty to the predicted ofg extent in systems with a low ahg a low vertical leakance i e a high k v and or a small h l and high onshore heads relative h f across the model domain at the h max end it is likely that using a 2d model will result in an overestimation of the ofg extent generated from active freshwater discharge conversely simply assuming that ofg is unable to persist under steady state conditions in a region where the onshore head is lower than the h f may result in a significant underestimation of the ofg extent the 2d to 3d comparison data from the simulations included in this study fig 6 show that in the majority of cases the 2d transect taken at h mid approximated the ofg of the 3d simulation data through the middle row of the 3d model this may indicate that adopting h mid as the head in first pass 2d investigations could provide an approximate estimate of the average ofg in the region however as these simulations were simplified representations that were run to an approximate steady state this observation may not hold true in transient cases where local pumping effects can generate non uniform hydraulic gradients the findings of this investigation suggest that the calculated ofg extents due to present day hydrogeological configurations in five of the 27 regions explored in knight et al 2018 may shift if 3d numerical approaches were applied while eight of the regions studied by knight et al 2018 had an ahg three of these regions display characteristics that are not conducive to notable afwc in the gambier embayment there is a very low ahg whereas in the perth basin both h max and h min are insufficient to prevent active swi in eckernförde bay the relatively high k v 1 2 10 3 m d 1 would limit afwc due to higher vertical leakance through the overlying aquitard in adelaide aveiro canterbury palmahim and southeast georgia afwc may be present to some degree however a detailed hydrogeological characterisation of each of these regions would be required to assess the magnitude of any potential afwc 5 conclusions here we show that significant amounts of alongshore freshwater circulation afwc up to 70 can occur in coastal semi confined aquifer systems the 13 3d numerical simulations included here demonstrate that afwc is predicted under a range of realistic conditions we conclude that when part of the onshore domain has a head that is below the equivalent freshwater head imposed by the sea h f there is potential for significant afwc to occur the proportion of afwc is higher for lower values of the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying confining unit this investigation indicates that the percentage of afwc in a region may be strongly related to the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f our simulations suggest that similar percentages of afwc could be expected in two systems with different ahgs yet a comparable proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f this observation suggests that while the ahg controls the magnitude of freshwater flow across the coastline it does not have a strong control on the proportion of freshwater returning onshore due to afwc a detailed analysis of the relationship between afwc and the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f for varying aquifer to aquitard hydraulic conductivity ratios would provide a valuable addition to the work presented here through comparisons of 3d model results with their equivalent 2d cross section simulations we are able to conclude that in the majority of cases where ahg are present 2d approaches are likely to overpredict the offshore fresh groundwater ofg extent at the location of h max and underpredict the ofg at the location of h min while the model results indicate that the ofg extents predicted at h mid using 2d approaches had minor deviations from the extents predicted using 3d models it is unclear if this observation holds true in transient cases where non uniform onshore head gradients between h max and h min are expected the significant proportions of afwc observed in our simulations suggest that accounting for afwc may improve the characterisation of coastal nutrient budgets for some regions the recirculation of ofg in the longshore direction raises the potential for long lived pollutants to return onshore particularly persistent chemicals such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances i e pfas additionally the potential for afwc to prevent or reduce the degree of salinisation predicted in an onshore aquifer using 2d models under steady state conditions may have important implications for coastal aquifer management in particular this research highlights that extraction and other activities that lead to groundwater head changes in semi confined coastal aquifers can induce changes in the offshore aquifer that may have long term implications and potentially negative impacts to other coastal groundwater users the findings from this study were obtained from using a deliberately simple conceptual model future work could also consider the influence of aquifer and or aquitard heterogeneity and the influence of tidal effects these complicating

4977,flow within offshore aquifers is important for the management of fresh groundwater in coastal zones alongshore head gradients have been observed in many coastal aquifers however this process is typically neglected and offshore aquifers are primarily assessed using cross sectional representations this study explores offshore implications of alongshore head gradients onshore including the alongshore circulation of submarine groundwater using 3d synthetic numerical models model parameter ranges were guided by those observed in seven real world cases each 3d simulation is compared against three 2d cross sectional numerical models to identify the potential mismatch between 2d and 3d approaches results show that alongshore freshwater circulation afwc is greater where alongshore head gradients are steeper onshore heads are lower on average or for low hydraulic conductivity of the offshore aquitard we show that afwc can be significant with a maximum afwc rate of 70 observed across the simulated cases the 3d models show that even though onshore heads indicate active seawater intrusion alongshore head gradients can protect regions of low head such that recirculated freshwater instead of seawater is drawn into onshore wells we conclude that in many situations freshwater flowing from offshore to onshore aquifers may be recirculated groundwater from the onshore aquifers from where the onshore head is higher rather than relic freshwater as has been concluded from cross sectional analysis in previous studies these observations have implications for coastal groundwater management and importantly suggest that long lived contaminants that discharge offshore may return onshore keywords offshore fresh groundwater coastal aquifer saltwater intrusion numerical modelling 1 introduction the management of fresh groundwater in coastal regions requires knowledge of both the onshore and offshore components of coastal aquifers post et al 2013 michael et al 2017 this is particularly important where offshore groundwater flows onshore thereby contributing to the water quality in onshore aquifers and of coastal wells knight et al 2018 offshore freshwater is commonly considered a non renewable resource whereby offshore freshwater is mined by onshore extraction e g post et al 2013 thus characterising the extent of offshore freshwater volumes and onshore offshore aquifer connectivity is critical for predicting the long term resilience of coastal aquifers to pumping stresses offshore fresh groundwater ofg can be generated through either present day or paleo hydrological processes groen et al 2000 the present day discharge of freshwater from the onshore portion of confined and semi confined aquifers herein referred to as semi confined aquifers into their offshore continuations can generate extensive ofg bodies kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 michael et al 2016 werner and robinson 2018 paleo hydrogeological processes such as those associated with glacial maxima are thought to have increased continental shelf exposure and in some instances elevated hydraulic heads due to glacial loading person et al 2012 these paleo processes are thought to have generated extensive freshwater bodies in the semi confined aquifers of continental shelves e g cohen et al 2010 post glacial coastline transgression outpaced the landward movement of the freshwater saltwater interface in many regions groen et al 2000 causing modern ofg extents that are often in disequilibrium with extents expected from present day conditions groen et al 2000 marksamer et al 2007 person et al 2012 post et al 2013 ofg has been studied using both analytical models e g bakker 2006 werner and robinson 2018 and numerical models e g paldor et al 2019 solórzano rivas et al 2019 analytical solutions adopt the assumption of a sharp interface between freshwater and seawater and provide a rapid approach for estimating steady state ofg distributions in simplified coastal aquifer systems werner and robinson 2018 numerical methods can be applied to a wider range of situations and to study the influence of other processes yu and michael 2019a including both a dispersive interface and mixing zone conditions as well as aquifer heterogeneity however numerical simulations can be restricted by the computational effort required for large scale simulation of density coupled dispersive flow and transport analytical solutions include those of bakker 2006 who formulated approaches to investigate ofg assuming a sharp interface between freshwater and seawater bakker 2006 used the solution to examine the extent of freshwater in the upper floridian aquifer usa and concluded that present day conditions are capable of driving freshwater tens of kilometres offshore pauw et al 2017 applied the bakker 2006 model to several transects of dutch aquifers and demonstrated that alongshore variations in the hydro stratigraphy can generate significantly different ofg distributions in the alongshore direction werner and robinson 2018 presented a modification to the bakker 2006 solutions that allows for a specified salinity in the offshore semi confining unit overlying the offshore freshwater aquifer the modification by werner and robinson 2018 resolved the issue encountered by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who showed that offshore aquitards are more likely to contain freshwater rather than the seawater assumption of bakker 2006 where aquitards overlie fresh offshore aquifers the werner and robinson 2018 solution was applied to 27 regions by knight et al 2018 who concluded that offshore freshwater is likely to influence onshore salinities in 24 of those regions most applications of numerical methods to investigate ofg use 2d cross sectional representations of offshore conditions e g michael et al 2016 paldor et al 2019 solórzano rivas et al 2019 cross sectional models of dispersive flow and transport are significantly less computationally expensive than 3d models that often require relatively coarse grid discretisation the use of coarse grids limits the simulation of local scale dispersive processes that might otherwise require fine grid resolution cross sectional numerical models have been used to investigate the emplacement of ofg under glacial conditions e g marksamer et al 2007 person et al 2012 the effect of pumping both onshore and offshore on ofg extent and longevity e g amir et al 2013 morgan et al 2018 paldor et al 2019 yu and michael 2019a 2019b and the effect of geological heterogeneity on offshore flow paths e g michael et al 2016 however 2d approaches require the assumption that the system is unchanging in the alongshore direction this assumption may often be invalid as alongshore head gradients are likely to be widespread as shown in several studies e g nativ and weisbrod 1994 de melo et al 2001 kaleris et al 2002 zulfic et al 2008 morgan et al 2016 ofg has been investigated through more realistic 3d numerical modelling in only a small number of cases for example cohen et al 2010 and siegel et al 2014 investigated the role of glacial loading and sea level fluctuations on ofg development both studies incorporated a time variable sea level and applied onshore boundary conditions that accounted for a significant increase in hydraulic head due to the accumulation of considerable overlying ice mass the model domain used by cohen et al 2010 extended several hundreds of kilometres in the alongshore direction while the model domain used by siegel et al 2014 was 50 km in the alongshore direction both studies concluded that elevated glacial driven recharge during glacial maxima can generate ofg extents that vary across the model domains in the alongshore direction mulligan et al 2007 used a simplified 3d numerical model to investigate the impact that paleo channels that incise through the offshore confining unit have on offshore freshwater saltwater exchange they found that increased freshwater saltwater mixing can occur around submarine paleo channels mulligan et al 2007 also identified that paleo channels can generate localised lateral flow towards the paleo channel in offshore semi confined aquifers these conditions increase the offshore freshwater flux at the coastline and reduce the predicted ofg extent investigations into the longevity of the new jersey usa water supply by mcauley et al 2001 and pope 2006 provide rare examples of regional scale 3d numerical models that explore ofg distributions in both present day and pre development conditions both studies identified an offshore freshwater saltwater interface and estimated an approximate freshwater resource lifespan of several hundred years under several extraction scenarios significant alongshore hydraulic gradients ahgs have been identified in several regions globally e g nativ and weisbrod 1994 de melo et al 2001 kaleris et al 2002 zulfic et al 2008 morgan et al 2016 these ahgs have been shown to be due to natural forces e g varying recharge or topographic influences or human impacts e g groundwater abstraction in these regions the negligible transverse flow i e flow parallel to the shoreline assumption required to apply 2d analytical and or numerical models may be invalid despite the issues with their use 2d cross sectional approaches have been applied to ofg investigations in at least two of these areas e g amir et al 2013 morgan et al 2018 paldor et al 2019 knight et al 2018 hypothesised that in some regions ahgs may result in alongshore freshwater circulation afwc i e where freshwater passes into the offshore portion of the semi confined aquifer in places of highest onshore head before circulating within the offshore aquifer and subsequently flowing back onshore at another location however the occurrence and magnitude of any freshwater recirculation remains unstudied additionally the validity of the use of cross sectional models to investigate ofg in regions with an ahg is unknown this study explores the potential for afwc to occur because of an ahg we identify the conditions required for afwc to occur using 3d numerical modelling freshwater fluxes at the coastline are explored to determine potential afwc percentages for a range of conditions we compare the modelled freshwater saltwater interface from 2d and 3d numerical models of simplified coastal aquifer systems to investigate potential deviations between the different approaches to our knowledge this study is the first published investigation of the negligible transverse flow assumption that is often made in offshore aquifers investigations that use 2d cross section models 2 methods 2 1 justification of hydraulic parameters and conceptual model hydrogeological parameters from seven regions were collated from existing literature to guide the development and parameterisation of the synthetic 3d numerical models used in this study a conceptualisation of the simplified model domain is shown in fig 1 a with the regional parameters presented in the table 1 the parameters of interest in this study are the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k a l t 1 the aquitard hydraulic conductivity k v l t 1 the depth below sea level to the top of the aquitard h s l the aquifer thicknesses h l the aquitard thickness h l l the influence of maximum and minimum onshore heads h max and h min respectively l the transverse distance between h max and h min δy l and the onshore and offshore lengths of the semi confined aquifer l c and l s respectively l 2d and 3d models are compared using 2d models at the front face middle and back face of 3d models as illustrated in fig 1b 2 2 boundary conditions a specified head boundary was applied at the landward vertical face of the model domain heads at the front face see fig 1b of the onshore boundary were set as h max with heads decreasing linearly to h min at the back face see fig 1b of the onshore boundary the onshore boundary had freshwater inflows 0 g l 1 and ambient concentration outflows no flow boundary conditions were applied at the onshore portion of the semi confining unit the lower boundary and the front and the back faces of the model domain the ocean was represented using a specified saltwater hydraulic head set to 0 m for both the vertical offshore boundary and the top cells of the aquitard in the offshore region the transport boundary conditions for these cells were set to allow saltwater 35 g l 1 inflows and ambient concentration outflows this approach assumes that freshwater outflows do not result in significant local freshening of the ocean three 2d models were also generated for each parameter set see fig 1b the 2d models replicated the conditions modelled at the front face middle row and back face of each 3d model which differed according to the head at the inland boundary h max h mid and h min respectively 2 3 simulation cases twelve parameter combinations were selected to explore afwc using variable density numerical models that were simulated using seawat langevin et al 2008 in all simulations δy was fixed at 15 km while h and h l were 40 m and 10 m respectively δy varies in the real world cases between 4 4 km and 83 km see table 1 the alongshore width selected represents a balance between computational effort and the need to simulate regional scale situations for example simulations run times using an intel i7 3 6 ghz processor for the 3d simulations ranged from 27 to 35 days the model domain extends 5 km onshore while the modelled offshore domain varied between simulations the werner and robinson 2018 sharp interface analytical solution was used to calculate an ofg extent for each parameter combination to ensure that the model extent was sufficient to minimise the influence of boundary effects based on the werner and robinson 2018 solution the offshore boundary was set to be 10 km seaward of the maximum offshore freshwater extent calculated for each parameter set the offshore distance of the aquifer is inconsequential if the offshore domain includes the freshwater extent because flows within the seawater part of the aquifer are small relative to rates of freshwater flow the parameters of the 12 synthetic models table 2 are within the upper and lower limits of recorded real world values table 1 in addition to the parameters in table 2 the molecular diffusion coefficient was 1 10 9 m2 s 1 for all simulations the vertical leakance c h 1 k v t bakker 2006 of the aquitard in the synthetic models spans the range of values observed in the real world cases despite the thickness of the synthetic model aquitard being equal to the thinnest recorded real world case i e 10 m adelaide zulfic et al 2008 typical ranges of aquitard conductance were represented by modifying k v to avoid simulating thick aquitards and thereby reducing the numerical burden the ahg in the synthetic models ranged between 0 4 m km 1 and 1 8 m km 1 while the ahgs of the real world regions ranged between 0 05 m km 1 and 2 m km 1 the parameter combinations of cases s1 to s12 table 2 were selected to investigate the behaviour of afwc for variations in three different processes the parameters of the first simulation s1 are a central base case from which parameters were varied to produce offshore freshwater extents that were both larger and smaller than s1 simulations s1 s4 are used to investigate how changes in k v impact afwc simulations s5 s8 in addition to s1 are used to investigate how the onshore heads influence afwc simulation s9 s12 in addition to s1 are used to investigate how ahgs influence afwc in these simulations h mid remains fixed with the onshore boundary heads in either direction alongshore changing by the specified gradient δh δy all numerical simulations were run to steady state that was assessed according to the total mass within the model domain the 50 seawater concentration isochlor was extracted from the top and bottom layers of the semi confined aquifer to capture the position of the tip x tip l and toe x toe l of the freshwater saltwater interface these values were used in the comparisons between the 2d and 3d approaches the horizontal fluid fluxes and fluid salinity across the coastline were evaluated to calculate afwc freshwater fluxes were calculated in each cell at the shoreline using 1 q f q 1 c c s where q f is the freshwater flux l3 t 1 q is the total fluid flux across the shoreline in each model cell l3 t 1 c is the salinity within each model cell m l 3 and cs is the salinity of seawater m l 3 afwc was calculated as sum of q f crossing the shoreline in the onshore direction for the entire model divided by the sum of q f in the offshore direction 2 4 grid dependency and justification of dispersivities a grid sensitivity analysis was undertaken to evaluate the impact of grid discretization and dispersivity on the results dispersion parameters and the cell size represent a balance between computation load stability of the numerical method and accuracy due to resource constraints grid sensitivity was undertaken using 2d cross sectional models rather than 3d seven different horizontal cell widths δx i e 5 m 10 m 25 m 50 m 75 m 100 m and 125 m were tested on the s4 transect see table 2 that had an onshore head of h max and a longitudinal dispersivity α l of 25 m for all simulations in the grid sensitivity analysis and in the cases outlined in section 2 3 the aquitard and aquifer layers had a fixed thickness of 1 m and 2 m respectively four sets of dispersivity values for the aquifer cells were also tested using the s4 transect with a cell size of 5 m namely α l values of 1 m 5 m 10 m and 25 m horizontal and vertical transverse dispersivity α t and α v respectively values were set at α l 10 for the aquitard both α l and α t were set at 0 5 m and α v was set at 0 05 m where flow is assumed to be predominantly vertical the 50 isochlors of each simulation were compared to identify 1 the slope of the freshwater saltwater interface calculated using s l o p e h x t i p 50 x t o e 50 where x tip50 and x toe50 are x tip and x toe of the 50 isochlor respectively and 2 the displacement in the position of the mixing zone following the grid sensitivity study i e fig 2 grids for cases s1 s12 were set up as follows 1 the width and length of the offshore grid cells was set at 125 m and 2 in the onshore portion of the domain between the onshore boundary and 2 5 km from the coastline the length perpendicular to the coastline of the onshore cells decreases from 375 m near the boundary to 125 m the change in cell size between neighbouring cells did not exceed 50 the 3d models cases s1 s12 were set up to ensure that wherever possible the grid péclet number δ x α l in the aquifer did not exceed the critical value of 2 suggested by zheng and bennett 2002 the cell sizes adopted for the aquifer cells in this study are finer than those adopted in other studies of a similar scale e g 50 500 m mulligan et al 2007 2 km siegel et al 2014 a longitudinal dispersivity of 25 m was adopted in the aquifer while α t and α v values were set at 2 5 m these dispersivities are consistent with parameters of similar studies e g mulligan et al 2007 amir et al 2013 siegel et al 2014 3 results 3 1 grid dependency values of x tip50 and x toe50 for each of the grid dependency simulations and sensitivity analysis of dispersivity are shown in fig 2 in the grid dependency simulations fig 2a the largest change in x tip50 from changing δx occurred between the δx 5 m and δx 10 m simulations x tip50 moves further offshore as δx increases i e for δx 10 m although to a lesser degree this observation suggests that x tip50 has a higher sensitivity to grid resolution at low values of δx x toe50 shows a slightly non monotonic behaviour for the lower values of δx i e δx 5 m to δx 25 m in fig 2a x toe50 is located closer to the shore for simulations with larger δx however between δx 25 m and δx 125 m x toe50 is located further offshore for larger δx values the slope of the interface is also influenced by the grid resolution the slope of the interface is steeper 17 8 for the δx 5 m simulation compared to the δx 25 m simulation 8 simulations with δx 25 m all have interface slopes on the order of 8 this suggests that both x tip50 and x toe50 move offshore at approximately the same rate for a given increase in δx after δx 25 m the sensitivity to changes in α l shown in fig 2b indicate that for the ranges of α l and δx tested here both x tip50 and x toe50 are more sensitive to the changes in α l than changes in δx for the α l simulations that use δx 5 m x tip50 shows a greater sensitivity to increases in α l at low values of α l in all simulations that investigate sensitivity to α l x tip50 is located further shoreward for larger α l values x toe50 appears to be more sensitive to increases in α l than x tip50 especially at low α l values in all simulations tested here x toe50 is located further offshore for larger α l values the slope of the interface increases from 2 1 for α l 1 m to 17 8 for α l 25 m this change in slope is caused by the movement of both x tip50 and x toe50 with x tip50 6 2 530 m further offshore in the α l 1 m simulation than in the α l 25 m simulation the location of x toe is 17 5 1160 m further onshore in the α l 1 m simulation relative to the α l 25 m simulation 3 2 calculated alongshore freshwater circulation the percentage of afwc for each simulation is presented in fig 3 the simulations investigating the impact of k v on afwc fig 3a indicate that the percentage of afwc is higher for lower values of k v for example the percentage of afwc was 19 2 for k v 1 0 10 5 m d 1 and 1 7 for k v 1 0 10 3 m d 1 fig 3a this trend appears to be non linear as the change between s2 and s3 k v 1 0 10 5 m d 1 and k v 1 0 10 4 m d 1 respectively results in a decrease in afwc by 17 5 while the change between s3 and s4 k v 1 0 10 4 m d 1 and k v 1 0 10 3 m d 1 respectively results in a 0 9 decrease in afwc results from the simulations that investigate the impact of the onshore head relative to sea level on afwc are shown in fig 3b the percentage of afwc decreases from 70 3 h max 14 m to 0 as h min increases towards the minimum head required to prevent the onset of active seawater intrusion swi i e 1 m fig 4 b this threshold value was calculated using h f δ h s h l where h f is the equivalent freshwater head imposed by the sea δ is the dimensionless difference between the density of freshwater ρ f m l 3 and the density of saltwater ρ f m l 3 as calculated by δ ρ s ρ f ρ f werner 2017 values of 1025 to 1035 kg m 3 and 1000 kg m 3 are typically used for ρ s and ρ f respectively e g werner 2017 yu and michael 2019b active swi is predicted when h f the onshore head for simulations s7 and s8 h min is h f and no afwc occurs in the systems modelled here a 1 m decline in the onshore heads relative to sea level results in approximately a 10 increase in afwc the relationship between afwc and the ahg is shown in fig 3c in this set of simulations no notable afwc is predicted in s9 and s10 as in these cases h min h f in simulation s10 h min at the base of the aquifer is lower than the equivalent freshwater head of seawater at the base of the aquifer h fbase l where h f b a s e δ h s h l h as a result there is a small onshore freshwater flux at the coastline in this section of the aquifer this circulation represents a total volume of afwc of 0 01 in simulations s1 s11 and s12 h min h f in these three simulations the percentage of afwc increases approximately linearly as the ahg increases across these three simulations an increase in the ahg of 1 m km 1 causes a 28 increase in afwc the flow vectors for simulations s1 and s5 s8 are shown in fig 4 flow vectors for the remaining simulations are presented in the supporting information see figs s1 and s2 the results presented in fig 4 suggest that the transverse flow of freshwater within the onshore domain is a major control on the onshore salinities this trend is common across all simulations where part of the onshore domain has a head lower than h f for the simulations shown in fig 4 the component of transverse flow in the offshore domain decreases as the head at the onshore boundary increases this matches the observed reduction in afwc as the onshore heads increase fig 3 in s7 there is still notable transverse freshwater flow in the offshore domain even though h min h f there is only a minor transverse offshore flow component in s8 which has the highest values of h min h min and h max in simulations s1 s4 shown in fig s1 the transverse flow component reduces as k v increases all of the simulations that investigate the impact of the ahg s1 s9 s12 had notable transverse flow in the offshore aquifer fig s2 in these simulations the proportion of transverse offshore flow increased as the ahg increased interestingly the location of the freshwater saltwater interface in these five simulations shows little variation despite h max ranging from 6 5 m to 17 m fluid flow through the coastline for simulation s5 is shown in fig 5 fig 5a shows that the zone of maximum onshore flow does not necessarily coincide with the zone of maximum onshore freshwater flow shown in fig 5b this disconnection is due to the total flux cross the coastline shown in fig 5a incorporates both freshwater and saltwater components there are higher rates of afwc in the lower portions of the semi confined aquifer compared to the upper portions conversely there are higher rates of freshwater discharging to the offshore region in the upper portions of the semi confined aquifer 3 3 comparison of 2d and 3d simulations fig 6 shows the difference between x tip50 for the front face blue circles middle row red squares and back face green triangles of each 3d model and their 2d equivalents fig 6a indicates that the difference in the x tip50 between the 2d and 3d simulations is smaller for larger values of k v for the front middle and back faces of the model the 2d simulations over predict the location of x tip50 at the front face blue circles and under predict the ofg extent at the back face green triangles for low values of k v values of x tip50 at the back face show non monotonic behaviour for variations k v fig 6a for example in simulations where k v 2 5 10 5 m d 1 log10 k v 4 6 m d 1 s1 and s2 the difference in x tip50 between the 2d and 3d simulations approaches zero with increasing k v fig 6a the middle face red squares shows the smallest deviation between the x tip50 in the 2d and 3d simulations for variations k v fig 6a fig 6b shows that the difference between x tip50 position in the 2d and 3d simulations at the front face blue circles is smaller for higher values of h min i e higher overall onshore heads for the back face green triangles the freshwater saltwater interface reached the onshore boundary in both the 2d and 3d simulations in s5 and s6 as such these two data points return a minimal difference between x tip50 of the 2d and 3d simulations while h min is also less than sea level in the s1 case shown in fig 6b x tip50 at the back face of the 3d simulations remains offshore due to the transverse movement of freshwater both onshore and offshore this results in a major difference between ofg extents predicted by the 2d and 3d models in the simulations where h min h f s7 and s8 the difference at the back face between the 2d and 3d simulations is smaller for larger values of h min the middle row of the models red squares had a large difference between the x tip50 in the 2d and 3d models where h min h f however for cases where h min h f the difference between x tip50 of the 2d and 3d models for the middle row approaches zero fig 6c shows the cases where the ahg was varied the difference between x tip50 for the 2d and 3d simulations at the front face blue circles is larger for larger values of ahg two distinct trends are apparent in the data showing the back face green circles comparisons these two trends appear to be controlled by the presence of active swi in the model domain active swi is not predicted at the back face for the simulations with an ahg of 0 2 m km 1 s9 and 0 4 m km 1 s10 in scenarios s9 and s10 the difference between the 2d and 3d model predictions is larger for larger values of δh δy with the 2d models under predicting the extent of ofg at the back face however in scenarios where h min h f s1 s11 and s12 the difference between the 2d and 3d models is smaller for larger values of ahg the 2d simulation still under predict the ofg extent at the back face in all ahg simulations for the data comparing the 2d and 3d data for the middle section of the model domain red squares there appears to be minimal difference in the calculated ofg extent under higher ahgs the 2d simulations slightly under predict the ofg extent in the middle cross section of the model 4 discussion 4 1 grid sensitivity in the 2d grid sensitivity simulations the cell size of 125 m and α l of 25 m that was used in the 3d models generates an interface that is further offshore than in the models with a finer grid discretisation and a smaller α l however the shoreward shift in the interface due to the adopted α l value is mitigated by the seaward shift in the calculated interface due to the increase in cell size when the effects of both the increased δx and larger α l are combined there was only a 2 1 difference in x tip between the fine discretisation δx 5 m and α l 1 m and coarse discretisation δx 125 m and α l 25 m simulations at the toe the increased δx and larger α l both led to a seaward shift in x toe when compared to x toe of the simulation with a fine discretisation as a result x toe in the coarse discretisation model was 17 further offshore than in its finer discretised counterpart these observations suggest that the impact of the selected discretisation is likely greater at the base of the aquifer the trends in the location of the freshwater saltwater interface observed in our grid resolution and dispersion investigation simulations are similar to those identified by solórzano rivas et al 2019 in their study solórzano rivas et al 2019 investigated the influence of dispersion on offshore freshwater saltwater interfaces solórzano rivas et al 2019 identified that an increase in α l from 1 m to 20 m resulted in a shoreward shift in x tip and an offshore shift in x toe of a similar magnitude a dimensionless sensitivity s of 0 29 0 32 to those observed in our simulations i e s 0 29 s is calculated using s δ x t i p α l x t i p δ α l werner and robinson 2018 due to long model run times it was not feasible to assess the impacts of the selected discretisation using 3d simulations while the effect of the selected model parameters on the 3d simulations is challenging to predict it is likely that the cell discretisation and α l adopted in the 3d simulations resulted in an over estimation of the ofg extent particularly at the toe when compared to a finer discretised model however as there is no notable change in the freshwater fluxes at the coastline in our 2d grid dependency simulations it appears unlikely that the use of a finer mesh would have had a significant impact on the calculated afwc 4 2 calculated alongshore freshwater circulation afwc occurred in all the cases modelled where h min h f all three of the hydrogeological processes explored k v h min and δh δy were able to generate afwc to some degree over the range of conditions modelled the simulations that investigated the effect of k v on afwc showed that for a relatively thin semi confining unit i e h l 10 m with a low k v 1 10 5 m d 1 up to 19 of the freshwater that discharged into the offshore domain may return onshore however the proportion of afwc is smaller for larger values of k v when comparing the vertical leakance of semi confining units modelled against the real world cases presented in table 1 two of the seven regions have vertical leakance values of the same order of magnitude as the s2 case and three have values of vertical leakance comparable to s3 while the last two have a value of vertical leakance that falls between s3 and s4 the simulations presented here also suggest that the amount of afwc is highly sensitive to the magnitude of the onshore heads relative to sea level lowering the onshore heads has two impacts on the model firstly by reducing the head along the onshore boundary the percentage of the model domain subjected to active swi conditions i e onshore heads 1 m increased simulations s6 and s12 both have a similar percentage of the onshore boundary 1 m 39 and 36 respectively and share afwc rates of 38 this suggests that the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f may form a strong control on the afwc percentages to test this one additional simulation herein referred to as s13 was undertaken with a δh δy of 0 4 m km 1 and h mid 0 525 m with all other parameters were consistent with s1 this parameter combination produces a model with the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f comparable to s5 the calculated percentage of afwc in s13 was similar to s5 63 9 and 70 3 respectively this finding supports the notion that afwc in the model domain is strongly controlled by the proportion of the onshore boundary under active swi conditions secondly lowering the onshore heads reduced q f in the offshore direction resulting in a landward movement of the freshwater saltwater interface and a reduced ofg extent the higher percentages of afwc associated with situations involving smaller bodies of ofg as shown in fig 4 are likely caused by the higher rates of transverse flow in the offshore semi confined aquifer close to the shoreline this is evident in the differences in velocity fields for the ofg cases shown in fig 4 the apparent relationship between the afwc and the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads 1 m is also apparent in the response of afwc to changes in the ahg it is interesting to note that although h min in s12 is lower than in s5 7 m and 6 m respectively the percentage of afwc in s5 70 3 is almost double the percentage of afwc measured in s12 38 1 this is despite the maximum seaward q f in s12 being four times greater than in s5 while the maximum landward q f in s12 is three time greater than in s5 when plotting the percentage of afwc against the percentage of the onshore boundary h f for simulations s5 s12 a clear linear relationship appears fig 7 the regression line though these data returns a relationship of afwc 1 07x 2 where x is the percent of the onshore boundary h f this relationship has a pearson r2 of 0 97 suggesting that the relationship is robust the data points from the simulations that investigated changes in k v i e s1 s4 triangle markers in fig 7 indicate that k v may change the relationship between the percentage of the onshore boundary h f and the degree of afwc further investigations into relationships between k v afwc and the proportion of the onshore boundary h f are warranted in future work the results of this study indicate that afwc may play a key role in maintaining onshore water qualities in some coastal aquifers fig 8 shows an illustration of the potential role that afwc may play in maintaining onshore freshwater under steady state conditions in the illustration of s5 shown in fig 8 afwc shifts the freshwater saltwater interface towards h min i e the 15 000 m end similar behaviour is visible in all simulations with h min 1 m these findings are significant as they indicate that a reduction in h max may have major downstream implications both onshore and offshore in some regions lowering h max would likely reduce transverse freshwater flow in both the onshore and offshore domains causing the freshwater saltwater interface to shift towards h max this would result in an increased zone of salinization in the onshore region that would otherwise remain fresh under steady state conditions afwc has potential implications on the estimation of coastal chemical and nutrient budgets the results presented in this study indicate that in situations involving high vertical leakance and onshore aquifers experiencing active swi conditions ignoring afwc could result in the overestimation by up to 70 of groundwater discharge and accompanying waterborne constituents e g nutrients etc flowing to the sea e g see fig 3b this highlights the importance of considering afwc in assessing regional scale nutrient budgets within near shore environments additionally afwc may have implications for the fate of coastal contaminants as our results suggest that there is potential for terrestrially originating contaminants to re enter the onshore environment from offshore 4 3 comparison of 2d and 3d simulations the results presented in fig 6 suggest that the negligible transverse assumption required to apply 2d models may only add low uncertainty to the predicted ofg extent in systems with a low ahg a low vertical leakance i e a high k v and or a small h l and high onshore heads relative h f across the model domain at the h max end it is likely that using a 2d model will result in an overestimation of the ofg extent generated from active freshwater discharge conversely simply assuming that ofg is unable to persist under steady state conditions in a region where the onshore head is lower than the h f may result in a significant underestimation of the ofg extent the 2d to 3d comparison data from the simulations included in this study fig 6 show that in the majority of cases the 2d transect taken at h mid approximated the ofg of the 3d simulation data through the middle row of the 3d model this may indicate that adopting h mid as the head in first pass 2d investigations could provide an approximate estimate of the average ofg in the region however as these simulations were simplified representations that were run to an approximate steady state this observation may not hold true in transient cases where local pumping effects can generate non uniform hydraulic gradients the findings of this investigation suggest that the calculated ofg extents due to present day hydrogeological configurations in five of the 27 regions explored in knight et al 2018 may shift if 3d numerical approaches were applied while eight of the regions studied by knight et al 2018 had an ahg three of these regions display characteristics that are not conducive to notable afwc in the gambier embayment there is a very low ahg whereas in the perth basin both h max and h min are insufficient to prevent active swi in eckernförde bay the relatively high k v 1 2 10 3 m d 1 would limit afwc due to higher vertical leakance through the overlying aquitard in adelaide aveiro canterbury palmahim and southeast georgia afwc may be present to some degree however a detailed hydrogeological characterisation of each of these regions would be required to assess the magnitude of any potential afwc 5 conclusions here we show that significant amounts of alongshore freshwater circulation afwc up to 70 can occur in coastal semi confined aquifer systems the 13 3d numerical simulations included here demonstrate that afwc is predicted under a range of realistic conditions we conclude that when part of the onshore domain has a head that is below the equivalent freshwater head imposed by the sea h f there is potential for significant afwc to occur the proportion of afwc is higher for lower values of the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying confining unit this investigation indicates that the percentage of afwc in a region may be strongly related to the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f our simulations suggest that similar percentages of afwc could be expected in two systems with different ahgs yet a comparable proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f this observation suggests that while the ahg controls the magnitude of freshwater flow across the coastline it does not have a strong control on the proportion of freshwater returning onshore due to afwc a detailed analysis of the relationship between afwc and the proportion of the onshore boundary with heads h f for varying aquifer to aquitard hydraulic conductivity ratios would provide a valuable addition to the work presented here through comparisons of 3d model results with their equivalent 2d cross section simulations we are able to conclude that in the majority of cases where ahg are present 2d approaches are likely to overpredict the offshore fresh groundwater ofg extent at the location of h max and underpredict the ofg at the location of h min while the model results indicate that the ofg extents predicted at h mid using 2d approaches had minor deviations from the extents predicted using 3d models it is unclear if this observation holds true in transient cases where non uniform onshore head gradients between h max and h min are expected the significant proportions of afwc observed in our simulations suggest that accounting for afwc may improve the characterisation of coastal nutrient budgets for some regions the recirculation of ofg in the longshore direction raises the potential for long lived pollutants to return onshore particularly persistent chemicals such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances i e pfas additionally the potential for afwc to prevent or reduce the degree of salinisation predicted in an onshore aquifer using 2d models under steady state conditions may have important implications for coastal aquifer management in particular this research highlights that extraction and other activities that lead to groundwater head changes in semi confined coastal aquifers can induce changes in the offshore aquifer that may have long term implications and potentially negative impacts to other coastal groundwater users the findings from this study were obtained from using a deliberately simple conceptual model future work could also consider the influence of aquifer and or aquitard heterogeneity and the influence of tidal effects these complicating

and hydrochemical type of these two springs are 1360 mg l and hco3 so4 na type and 246 mg l and hco3 ca mg type respectively the butterfly spring is enriched in ca2 mg2 and hco3 due to dissolution of carbonate rocks in contrast the xiaguan hot spring is enriched in na k hco3 and so4 2 due to dissolution of albite halite and ion exchange the concentrations of the rare earth elements rees in the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring range from 0 033 μg l to 0 071 μg l and 0 013 μg l to 0 018 μg l respectively the absolute concentrations of the medium rare earth elements mrees and heavy

the δ2h and δ18o values of the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring vary from 102 to 107 and 11 6 to 13 8 respectively showing negative trends due to altitude effect the data points of δ2h and δ18o of the two spring samples are close to the global meteoric water line and the local meteoric water line with a slight 18o shift indicating that the springs are meteoric in origin with a slight 18o exchange with the surrounding rocks the geothermal reservoir temperature of the xiaguan hot spring estimated with sio2 geothermometers ranges from 107 4 c to 114 6 c the xiaguan hot spring occurs in the metamorphic rocks of the paleoproterozoic cangshan group and is recharged from infiltration of precipitation and snow melting water after undergoing a deep circulation the groundwater is heated by heat flow and rises along the tangzipu fault to form a hot spring of deep groundwater circulation type the butterfly spring emerges in the silurian limestone groundwater receives recharge from precipitation and snow melting water in the western mountainous area flows eastward along the fissures and emerges on the lower slopes as a spring of shallow groundwater circulation type with ambient

properties has increased markedly with the rapid development of springs in tourism fagundo castillo et al 2008 lu et al 2018 in order to make sustainable use of springs in yunnan it is necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of springs the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring near dali in western yunnan are about 20 km far from each other with quite different hydrogeological characteristics and limited hydrogeological and isotopic studies on these two springs have been carried out in the last decades as for the xiaguan hot spring the previous studies focused on the applications in earthquake precursor based on water radon and mercury monitoring in the hot spring li et al 2010 2013 miao 2009 specified the genesis of the xiaguan hot spring based on analyses of hydrochemistry and isotopes little is known about the hydrogeological characteristics of the butterfly spring owing to the scarcity of literatures in order to provide some insights into the development of the springs for geothermal resources and tourism field investigation hydrochemical and isotopic analyses of the springs were implemented aiming to solve the following scientific issues

torsionally deep faults were formed the main fault structure in the dali area is the jinsha river fault red river fault zone including the red river fault jinsha river fault lijiang fault etc there are a series of nnw trending normal faults at the northern end of the red river fault zone shang guan 1988 the dali area is characterized by unique geomorphology owing to the influence of the fault zones the cangshan piedmont fault makes the cangshan mountain and erhai lake have an obvious difference in elevation of about 4000 m li et al 1986 the dali area is located between the lijiang indo china fold and thrust belt and the sichuan yunnan uplift area which is a contact zone of the geosyncline and the platform in the dali area occurs the cangshan metamorphic belt on the west side and also exist several faults providing conditions for the formation of hot springs west yunnan also lies in the yunnan tibet geothermal belt part of the mediterranean himalaya geothermal belt where about 1000 hot springs exist the elevation of the xiaguan hot spring is 1950 m and the spring s vent is about 40 m above the xier river some 100 m to the north of the hot spring a small stream on the western side of the hot spring flows from south to north into the xier river the xier river stems from the erhai lake and enters the lancangjiang river the hot spring with temperature of 76 emerges in the metamorphic rocks of the paleoproterozoic cangshan group and a little amount of travertine deposits near the spring s vent the hot spring water is used for bathing and relaxing as local spas the butterfly spring lies in the butterfly spring park to the northwest of dali and to the west of the erhai lake the spring outcrops in the silurian limestone in the lower mountain slope elevation of

the water sample turns red when phenolphthalein is added and free co2 cannot be measured the butterfly spring is mainly used for sightseeing and tourism it is a famous landscape and resort in the dali area 3 methodology 3 1 sampling and analytical procedures field investigation was implemented five times for the xiaguan hot spring and three times for the butterfly spring from 2007 to 2019 eight water samples yd1 1 yd1 2 yd1 3 yd1 4 yd1 5 yd2 1 yd2 2 and yd2 3 were taken from the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring samples yd1 5 and yd2 3 were collected in february and march 2019 in

hydrochemical constituents and water rock interaction processes on the basis of piper diagram qin et al 2005 found that geothermal waters in the xi an geothermal field change from hco3 dominant to cl dominant with increasing depth in addition the piper diagram can indicate the chemical mixing trend and the factor factor diagram such as q mode factor can be used to identify relevant mixing ratios chae et al 2006 the values of δ2h and δ18o in groundwater has been widely used to study spatial and temporal processes in hydrology by numerous researchers e g stumpp et al 2014 craig 1961 found that there exists an empirical average linear correlation of δ2h and δ18o in precipitation according to this relationship qian et al 2013 noted the δ 2h and δ 18o values of water bodies in the yinchuan plain are mainly affected by external water recharge rather than atmospheric precipitation by explaining the slope of the local meteoric water line smaller than that of the global meteoric water line al ameri et al 2014 found that the recharge of the sanya area in yemen is from the non evaporated atmospheric precipitation because data points of δ2h and δ18o of the water samples collected from alluvium and sandstone aquifers are close to the local meteoric water line 222rn and 226ra are a valuable tool to determinate groundwater age which is useful in evaluating circulation rate and renewability of groundwater cherdyntsev 1971 huang et al 2017 moreover some studies has been made from the perspective of rare earth elements rees to reveal hydrochemistry and geochemical processes noack et al 2014 although the contents of rees in groundwater are quite low they can be derived from dissolution of surrounding rocks by the examination of ree concentrations and distribution patterns and the predictable thermodynamic differences between rees allow for tracing natural hydrogeochemical processes goldstein and jacobsen 1988 noack et al 2014 for example singh et al 2016 suggested that carbonates from the mélange zone of manipur ophiolitic complex in northeast india was affected by diagenesis in shallow marine environment by interpretation of shale normalized positive eu anomalies and negative ce anomalies 3 3 statistical analysis and geochemical modeling cluster analysis ca is an assortment of techniques designed to manage hydrogeochemical data set meng and maynard 2001 q mode

and appelo 1999 3 4 geothermometry empirical geochemical geothermometers including silica and cation geothermometers have long been used to predict reservoirs temperature fournier 1977 giggenbach 1988 the silica geothermometers describing the relationship between solubility of quartz and temperature of geothermal water are used to evaluate the temperature of geothermal reservoirs morey et al 1962 according to the calculated temperature of reservoirs mohammadi et al 2010 studied the thermal water samples in the zagros region of iran which originate from meteoric water with a circulation depth of about 1500 m and mix with shallow cold water rafighdoust et al 2015 proposed that the occurrences of the hot springs in tang bijar oilfield of southern iran are spatially related to the young normal faults and are meteoric in origin which are heated at depth with the increasing geothermal gradient 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical constituents the temperature t of the xiaguan hot spring ranges from 71 2 c to 76 5 c ph from 6 41 to 7 23 eh from 34 mv to 115 mv and tds from 529 mg l to 1380 mg l the temperature tds and eh of the butterfly spring are about 15 c and from 235 mg l to 246 mg l from 22 mv to 46 mv respectively and the ph value of the butterfly spring is about 8 according to the previous collection of water samples from the study area the hydrochemical compositions of the pingpo hot spring erhai lake water xiaguan cold stream water and penqianglian cold spring hong 1990 are listed in table 1 for comparison with those of the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring fig 1 the pingpo hot spring outcrops in the metamorphic rocks of the cangshan group about 17 km to the west of the xiaguan hot spring and the water temperature is 41 c the penqianglian cold spring outcrops in the triassic shale about 0 2 km to the west of the xiaguan hot spring with the temperature of 14 c the xiaguan cold stream is near the xiaguan hot spring the concentrations of major cations and anions of springs and other pertinent waters in the study area table 2 and table 3 are shown on a piper diagram fig 2 most of water samples of the xiaguan hot spring samples yd1 b and yd1 1 to yd 1 5 are characterized by hco3 so4 na type except yd1 a so4 na ca type the hydrochemical types of samples yd1 d yd1 e yd2 1 yd2 2 and yd2 3 are of hco3 ca mg type the xiaguan hot spring is of hco3 so4 na type and the pingpo spring is of so4 hco3 co3 na type all the cold waters are of hco3 ca mg type except yd1 f hco3 na type the hydrochemical types of the butterfly spring erhai lake and cold stream water yd2 1 yd2 1 yd2 3 yd1 d and yd1 e are quite close indicating that they have the similar source of recharge from precipitation the concentrations of major anions and cations in water samples from the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring are shown in table 2 content of hco3 in the xiaguan hot spring ranges from 573 mg l to 588 mg l and the milliequivalent meq percentage is 60 to 70 of the anions and that in the butterfly spring from 150 mg l to 191 mg l and accounts for 78 to 98 meq of the anions the meq percentage of hco3 in the adjacent surface water and the penqianglian cold spring are very similar to that in the butterfly spring the meq percentage of hco3 in the pingpo hot spring is about 40 and that of cl is relatively low k and na in the xiaguan hot spring the pingpo spring and the penqianglian cold spring account for 75 to 85 of the meq percentage of the cations the meq percentage of ca2 in the surface water and the butterfly spring account for about 60 of the cations and the surface water has a slightly higher meq percentage of na than that of the butterfly spring 5 the cations and anions of the xiaguan hot spring are dominated by na hco3 so4 2 and the cations and anions of the butterfly spring by ca2 mg2 and hco3 the concentrations of fe2 and fe3 in the xiaguan hot spring and butterfly spring are 1 mg l table 2 from fig 3 a the correlation between fe2 fe3 and ph is not obvious which is roughly negative the concentration of f in xiaguan hot spring is between 6 mg l and 10 mg l and that of the butterfly spring is 1 mg l table 2 generally speaking the correlation between f and t is positive because the solubility of the mineral containing f increases with the increasing water temperature yu 2007 as shown in fig 3b it is obvious that the concentration of f in the xiaguan hot spring is significantly higher than that of the butterfly spring the concentration of f in the groundwater is also directly proportional to ph under normal circumstances because f exists as ions in alkaline water yu 2007 from fig 3c the correlation between f and ph is not obvious possibly due to sampling and measurement errors the independent sample t test was performed on the parameters of yd1 and yd2 to test whether the mean and variance of sample sources are the same student 1908 as displayed in table 4 the confidence is always 0 05 which implies that the difference between yd1 and yd2 cannot be ignored indicating weak hydraulic connections between them the chemical compositions of the samples of the xiaguan hot spring shows no obvious deviations from 2007 to 2019 fig 4 while individual ions slightly fluctuate with time i e k f and fe2 fe3 in the observed zigzag pattern indicating that much changes in the geological and hydrogeological conditions have not occurred during the relatively short period of time the chemical analyses of the three samples of the butterfly spring exhibit similar trends fig 4 with lower standard deviation values than the xiaguan hot spring table 4 highest dissolved concentrations of k cl and f at the first time showing fairly constant thereafter to a little decline apart from the above mentioned ions ionic compositions show no marked change from 2015 to 2019 indicating that the hydrogeology in this spring system did not changed during this short period of time compared to other hot springs of deep circulation in cuba fagundo castillo et al 2008 with low values of the variation coefficients in temperature and tds the xiaguan hot spring have higher temperature and lower tds which nearly do not change with time in such a short period of about 10 years due to deep circulation of the thermal groundwater the shallow groundwater of cuba has seasonal temperature and tds changes due to the dynamic karstic systems make a rapid flow and low storage capacity fagundo castillo et al 2008 compared to the cold springs of short flow path in cuba with high variation of temperature and tds the butterfly spring has almost constant temperature in such a short period of about 5 years due to relatively shallow and long circulation of the groundwater 4 2 cluster analysis and correlation matrix nine hydrochemical parameters t ph ca2 mg2 k na hco3 cl and so4 2 were chosen to classify the 12 samples the q mode hca results are represented by a dendrogram fig 5 from the dendrogram 2 clusters were clearest at the distance of 5 cluster a contains 5 samples belonging to the xiaguan hot spring and cluster b has 7 samples belonging to the butterfly spring and nearby waters the distance between the butterfly spring samples and surface waters yd1 d yd1 e is relatively small indicating that they have similar hydrochemical characteristics massart and kaufman 1983 the dendrogram also shows that groundwater samples with similar hydrochemical types may not present in the same cluster samples of yd1 c yd1 f yd1 1 yd1 2 yd1 3 yd1 4 and yd 1 5 which have similar hydrochemical types are statistically distinct indicating the difference between their geochemical evolutions cluster a is of hco3 so4 na type and has high relatively tds up to 1120 5 mg l the main cations in cluster a are na and ca2 and the anions are predominated by hco3 and so4 2 according to the factor analysis the correlation coefficient calculated can also be used to analyze the source of ions in water sheikhy narany et al 2014 table 5 shows the correlation coefficients among the physico chemical parameters of cluster a there is a relatively good correlation among t ph k mg2 na hco3 and so4 2 the correlation coefficients are greater than 0 7 table 5 hco3 is likely to originate in the dissolution of co2 and weathering of carbonate rocks and the correlation coefficient between hco3 and na is 0 73 the correlation coefficient between so4 2 and mg2 is 0 84 showing a relatively good relation so4 2 is mainly from the groundwater leaching from the schist in the metamorphic rocks of the paleoproterozoic cangshan group the ionic ratios of cl and na show that all the data fall above the dissolution line for halite and halite is undersaturated in cluster a samples from the saturation index si fig 6 a and fig 7 a suggesting that na has other sources apart from the dissolution of halite some samples si of calcite and dolomite are greater than 0 and anhydrite and gypsum 0 indicating precipitation tendency for calcite and dolomite and dissolution tendency for anhydrite and gypsum fig 7b reed and spycher 1984 the dissolution of anhydrite and gypsum may lead to the precipitation of carbonate minerals with decrement of ca2 which results in so4 2 and ca2 lying below the dissolution line fig 6b lu et al 2018 the relationships between hco3 and ca2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and ca2 mg2 are given in fig 6c 6d and 6e all the samples are below the dissolution line suggesting that there are lower ca2 concentration in cluster a water samples two reasons can explain this phenomenon farid et al 2015 calcite precipitation and cation exchange calcite precipitation is due possibly to gypsum dissolution farid et al 2015 as shown in fig 6f all the samples define a straight line indicating that na ca2 mg2 and k cations participate in the ion exchange reaction with the release of na and adsorption of ca2 farid et al 2015 cluster b has low tds and most of the water samples are of hco3 ca mg type table 6 shows the correlation coefficients among the physico chemical parameters of cluster b there is a relatively good correlation among t ph k mg2 na hco3 cl and so4 2 the correlation coefficients are greater than 0 7 table 6 the carbonate rocks outcrop in the study area the values of ca2 hco3 ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 are close to 1 fig 6c 6d and 6e implying that ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 are derived from the dissolution of dolomite calcite gypsum and anhydrite thus there are no cation exchange between na ca2 and mg2 fig 6f the good correlations between ca2 mg2 and hco3 na and cl the correlation coefficients are all greater than 0 7 reflect the dissolution of dolomite calcite and halite table 6 and fig 6a these processes are in accordance with the saturation indices fig 7 4 3 inverse modeling and hydrochemical evolution inverse hydrochemical modeling was conducted on the clusters resulted from hca cluster b is of hco3 ca mg type which is often regarded as recharge area waters in the general hydrochemical evolution model kebede et al 2005 after the further hydrolysis of silicate minerals the hco3 ca mg type waters will have higher concentrations of na mg2 and hco3 and lower concentration of ca2 due to the precipitation of carbonates kebede et al 2005 thus cluster a which are of hco3 so4 na type have undergone a relatively pronounced degree of geochemical evolution cluster b is therefore taken as initial water and cluster a is considered to be derived from cluster b in the inverse modeling the possible mineral phases were selected based on mineral compositions and saturation indices the mineral transfers obtained by inverse modeling are shown in table 7 indicating that gypsum chalcedony albite halite and k feldspar dissolve and calcite dolomite and kaolinite precipitate when groundwater circulates the result of hydrochemical evolution is displayed in table 8 dissolution of albite and halite has large proportions in mineral transfer which results in na being the dominant cation precipitation of calcite and dolomite decrease the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in the water in addition ion exchange mentioned before controls the concentrations of na and ca2 dissolution of gypsum contributes ca2 and so4 2 to the waters dissolution of k feldspar is the main source of k the gaseous co2 reduces in these reactions 4 4 hydrochemistry of ree as an increasingly important research topic rees with unique geochemical characteristics have become especially powerful tracers in recognizing the geochemical processes shahhosseini et al 2017 nigro et al 2018 on the basis of atomic number rees are segregated into light middle and heavy ree lree mree and hree respectively noack et al 2014 the concentrations of the rees in the xiaguan hot spring yd1 5 and the butterfly spring yd2 3 range from 0 033 ug l to 0 071 ug l and 0 013 ug l to 0 018 ug l table 2 and fig 8 with an average value of 0 051 μg l and 0 018 μg l respectively the total concentrations of the mrees 0 269 μg l and the hrees 0 271 μg l in the butterfly spring are relatively higher than those of the lrees 0 168 μg l in the xiaguan hot spring the total concentrations of the lrees in the butterfly spring are relatively higher 0 097 μg l than those of the mrees 0 078 μg l and the hree 0 083 μg l the upper continental crust ucc normalized ree fractionation patterns for the water samples of the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring are presented in fig 9 taylor and mclennan 1985 it can be seen that the ree fractionation patterns have a tendency to increase to the right studies on the characteristics and concentrations of rees complexes in groundwater can reveal the origin of the springs and the subsurface water rock interactions which alter rees patterns predictably göb et al 2013 in the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring inorganic anions that could complex with the rees mainly include cl oh co3 2 so4 2 and their double ions the rees of nd gd and er representing lree mree and hree respectively are chosen to analyze the inorganic speciation of the dissolved rees by conducting the hydrogeochemical code phreeqc with llnl database fig 10 table 9 the results of complication calculation in the spring water samples indicate that the carbonate complex lnco3 2 ln is a certain element of lanthanides 60 and sulfate species lnso4 2 27 are dominated in the lrees of the xiaguan hot spring while those in the mrees and the hrees are lnco3 2 60 70 and ln co3 2 2 27 29 in the butterfly spring the carbonate complexes in the forms of ln co3 2 2 98 99 are the major dissolved inorganic species the carbonate complexes of the spring waters in the butterfly spring account for a greater proportion than those of the xiaguan hot spring indicating that the carbonate complexes of rees tend to exist in the spring waters with high proportion of hco3 the proportion of hco3 in the butterfly spring is higher than the xiaguan hot spring showing similar trend as the ree complexes which means that the different characteristics of the ree complexes of the spring waters in the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring have a relationship with hydrochemical compositions 4 5 isotope compositions isotopes play an important role in groundwater investigations because they carry a record of fluid origin ages and processes al ruwaih and shehata 2004 barbieri 2019 qian et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes can be used to determine the origin of groundwater and the altitude and temperature of the recharge area of groundwater craig 1961 giggenbach et al 1983 the origin of the hot water based on δ2h and δ18o are determined in a δ2h δ18o plot with the following straight lines 1 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 2 δ 2 h 7 9 δ 18 o 8 2 where eq 1 is known as the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and eq 2 stands for the local meteoric water line lmwl in china zheng et al 1983 the δ2h and δ18o values of the xiaguan hot spring vary from 101 6 to 107 and 11 6 to 14 and those of the butterfly spring from 102 3 to 106 9 and 12 2 to 14 5 respectively they are plotted against the gmwl eq 1 and the lmwl eq 2 in fig 11 which shows that the data points are close to the gmwl and lmwl suggesting that the spring waters are of meteoric origin samples yd1 2 yd1 3 yd1 4 yd2 1 and yd2 2 show a slight δ18o shift which results from 18o exchange between the groundwater and the surrounding rocks the altitude of the recharge area can be estimated by the following equations wang 1991 yu et al 1984 3 h δ g δ p k h 4 δ 18 o 0 0031 h 6 2 5 δ 2 h 0 026 h 30 2 where h is the recharge elevation m δg is the δ 2h or δ 18o value of sampled water δp is the δ 2h 69 35 or δ 18o 9 7 value of atmospheric precipitation near the study area k is the δ 2h 2 5 100 m or δ 18o 0 31 100 m elevation gradient of atmospheric precipitation h is the sampled point elevation m tan 2018 yu et al 1984 the average recharge elevation of the xiaguan hot spring yd1 is 3079 m and that of the butterfly spring yd2 is 3127 m table 10 the altitude of the cangshan mountain to the northwest of dali ranges from 3500 m to 4122 m which is in good agreement with the altitude of the recharge area indicating that the estimated results are reasonable and the recharge area of springs is near the cangshan mountain the temperature of the recharge area can be estimated with the following equations dansgaard 1964 wang 1993 yurtsever 1975 6 δ 2 h 5 6 t 100 7 δ 18 o 0 695 t 13 6 8 δ 2 h 3 t 92 9 δ 18 o 0 176 t 10 39 10 δ 18 o 0 521 0 014 t 14 96 0 21 where t is the recharge temperature the average recharge temperature of the xiaguan hot spring is about 0 13 c and that of the butterfly spring is about 0 03 c table 10 since the top of the cangshan mountain near dali has snow for 5 6 months each year it is reasonable for the temperature in the recharge areas to be below zero the age of the hot spring water are calculated using the following equation cherdyntsev 1971 11 t 1 λ ra ln 1 n ra n rn where t is the age of hot spring water a λ ra is the decay constant of 226ra 4 26 10 4 a 1 n ra and n rn are the contents of 226ra 222rn respectively bq l according to eq 11 the age of the xiaguan hot spring is estimated as approximately 22 a after excluding significantly excessive results table 11 the age of the xiaguan hot spring is thought to be a bit younger than expected since it experiences a long circulation path the possible reason for this is that the xiaguan hot spring may be mixed with shallow groundwater of normal temperature before it rises to the land surface 4 6 geothermometry the temperature of geothermal reservoirs is important in evaluation and development of geothermal resources in geothermal systems it is however difficult to directly measure the reservoir temperatures in the field geothermometry can be used to predict geothermal reservoir temperatures in cases of no drilling temperature observations nicholson 1993 it is possible to use the property that the equilibrium concentration of a certain reaction product in the geothermal water is temperature dependent to get the surrounding temperature according to the equilibrium concentration karimi et al 2017 there are several types of geothermometers such as sio2 and cation ratio geothermometers fournier 1977 truesdell and fournier 1977 the uncertain results of geothermometers are due to the mixing of geothermal water with cold water and lack of a full equilibrium with the geothermal reservoir before selecting the proper geothermometers the na k mg triangle diagram method proposed by giggenbach is used to judge the equilibrium state of the geothermal water giggenbach 1988 in fig 12 the data points of geothermal water of the xiaguan hot spring are close to mg1 2 and belong to immature waters indicating that they are not fully equilibrated with the reservoir rocks so the cation ratio geothermometers cannot provide reliable results than silica geothermometers do giggenbach 1988 in this paper the equations of a quartz geothermometer with no steam loss eq 12 and a sio2 geothermometer with no steam loss eq 13 fournier 1977 are employed by solving eqs 12 and 13 the geothermal reservoir temperatures for the xiaguan hot spring ranging from 107 4 to 114 6 c are obtained and the results of the sio2 geothermometer are lower than the spring vent temperature so the results with eq 13 should be ignored thus the reservoir temperature of the xiaguan hot spring is estimated as 107 4 c to 114 6 c 12 t 1309 5 19 log sio 2 273 15 13 t 1032 4 69 log sio 2 273 15 the depth of thermal groundwater circulation is one of the important parameters in geothermal studies especially the formation of the geothermal waters karimi et al 2017 the circulation depth of the xiaguan hot spring can be estimated by using eq 14 li et al 1997 14 m q t h t b m where m is the circulation depth m th is the geothermal reservoir temperature tb is the annual average temperature of the recharge area q is the level of geothermal increase m and m is the thickness of the constant temperature zone m for the xiaguan hot spring tb 15 c th is from 107 4 c to 114 6 c m 30 m and q 33 m zhou et al 2017 the obtained results range from 3079 2 m to 3316 8 m mixing with shallow cold water during upwelling often occurs for thermal groundwater lu et al 2018 both the chemical and isotopic analyses of the xiaguan hot spring suggest that the ascending thermal groundwater may be mixed with shallow cold waters the silicon enthalpy model is used to track the mixing process based on the chemical components in the mixed waters and two end members cold and thermal groundwater to determine the temperature of the thermal groundwater in the mixed water and the proportion of the mixed cold water by introducing the following two equations with two unknowns variables of x 1 and x 2 truesdell and fournier 1977 15 δ h c x 1 δ h h 1 x 1 δ h s 16 s i c x 2 s i h 1 x 2 s i s where δ h c is the enthalpy of cold water δ h c is the enthalpy of thermal water δ h c is the enthalpy of spring water si c is the silica contents of cold water si h is the silica contents of thermal water si s is the silica contents of spring water x 1 x 2 and 1 x 2 1 x 2 are the fractions of cold water and thermal water respectively from eqs 15 and 16 we obtain x 1 δ h h δ h s δ h h δ h c and x 2 s i h s i s s i h s i c using a graphical approach x 1 and x 2 in eqs 15 and 16 can be calculated and the proportion of cold water mixing in the xiaguan hot spring is about 52 to 57 and the temperature of thermal groundwater before mixing is about 140 c to 150 c fig 13 which is a bit higher than that obtained with the sio2 geothermometers 4 7 genesis of the springs summarizing the above discussions the conceptual genetic modes of the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring are presented in figs 15 and 16 the xiaguan hot spring yd1 is located along the tangzipu fault which is a branch fault of the xierhe fault belonging to the red river fault zone the rocks near the fault intersection are fractured and the flow channel of geothermal water was easy to form the south wall of the xierhe fault is the mesozoic red layer which can be regarded as an aquiclude due to its poor permeability hong 1990 it is divided into two parts by the tangzipu fault the triassic shale in the west and the jurassic sandstone in the east hong 1990 the north wall of the xierhe fault is the metamorphic rocks of the cangshan group the faults and fissures were well developed precipitation and snow melting water on top of the mountains infiltrate along the tectonic fissures to recharge groundwater in the metamorphic rocks fig 14 when undergoing deep circulation the groundwater is heated by heat flow from below and then encounters the aquiclude and rises along the tangzipu fault the xiaguan hot spring water is mixed with shallow cold groundwater during ascending to the surface and finally emerges in the form of a hot spring the hot spring is a spring of a deep groundwater circulation type fig 14 in which the deepest point of groundwater flow path is lower than the spring s vent zhou et al 2014 it also belongs to a convective geothermal system of low medium temperature the butterfly spring yd2 is located to the east of the yunnong peak of the cangshan mountain and issues on the east side of a convex hillside the sediments of the quaternary are deposited at lower elevations below the spring s vent the spring is the discharge point of groundwater in the silurian limestone and dolomite the discharge of the butterfly spring is relatively large indicating that groundwater in the silurian carbonate aquifer is abundant the neoproterozoic granite can also be regarded as an aquifer with relatively poor groundwater the recharge of the butterfly spring are from precipitation in the western mountain area the karst fissured aquifer may provide good channels for groundwater flow in the western mountain area precipitation and snow melting water infiltrate and recharge groundwater groundwater seeps eastward in the aquifer and discharges in the form of the spring on the lower slopes the butterfly spring is a ambient temperature spring of shallow groundwater circulation type fig 15 in which the deepest point of groundwater flow path is still higher than the spring s vent zhou et al 2014 5 conclusions the xiaguan hot spring yd1 and the butterfly spring yd2 lying in the western yunnan of china are examined for their hydrogeological characteristics and isotopic compositions which are quite different the former is of hco3 so4 na type and the latter of hco3 ca mg type the yd1 has water temperature ranging from 71 2 c to 76 5 c ph from 6 41 to 7 23 tds from 529 mg l to 1380 mg l and the yd2 has water temperature of about 15 c tds ranging from 235 mg l to 246 mg l ph from 7 3 to 8 which is more alkaline the concentrations of hydrochemical constituents k ca2 na hco3 so4 2 and cl in the yd1 is much higher than in the yd2 the hot spring is rich in na and k and depleted in ca2 and mg2 due to dissolution of albite and halite and ion exchange the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 of the yd2 are slightly higher due to the dissolution of carbonate rocks the concentrations of the rees in the yd1 and the yd2 range from 0 033 μg l to 0 071 μg l and 0 013 μg l to 0 018 μg l respectively ucc normalized ree patterns of the yd1 and the yd2 are similar with increasing fluctuation trends indicating the enrichment of hrees and mrees relative to lrees δ2h and δ18o values for the yd1 and the yd2 vary from 102 to 107 and 11 6 to 13 8 respectively indicating that the springs are meteoric in origin a slight 18o shift exists in the hot spring suggesting 18o exchange with the surrounding rocks using the stable isotope compositions the elevation of the recharge area is estimated as 3009 3246 m the thermal reservoir temperature of the yd1 calculated based on several geothermometers ranges from 107 4 c to 114 6 c by using the method of silica geothermometers and silicon enthalpy model the proportion of the mixed cold water in the yd1 is estimated as 52 to 57 the temperature of geothermal water before mixing ranges between 140 c and 150 c which is higher than that calculated with the silica geothermometers 107 c to 115 c the estimated circulation depth of hot water ranges from 3079 2 m to 3316 8 m the geneses modes of the yd1 and the yd2 are established and they are quite different for the yd1 precipitation infiltrates in the outcropping metamorphic rocks of the paleoproterozoic cangshan group through the tectonic fissures to recharge the groundwater after undergoing deep circulation the groundwater is heated by heat flow and rises along the tangzipu fault to the land surface as a hot spring the thermal groundwater is mixed with shallow cold groundwater during its ascent to the surface it is a hot spring of deep groundwater circulation type the yd1 emerges in the carbonate rocks on the hill side groundwater receives recharge from precipitation in the western mountain area and undergoes a shallow circulation towards east it is a normal temperature spring of shallow groundwater circulation type the genesis of springs in this studies has implications for geothermal resources and tourism management it is of particular relevance in the timing monitoring network of springs including physico chemical parameters measurements in

and hydrochemical type of these two springs are 1360 mg l and hco3 so4 na type and 246 mg l and hco3 ca mg type respectively the butterfly spring is enriched in ca2 mg2 and hco3 due to dissolution of carbonate rocks in contrast the xiaguan hot spring is enriched in na k hco3 and so4 2 due to dissolution of albite halite and ion exchange the concentrations of the rare earth elements rees in the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring range from 0 033 μg l to 0 071 μg l and 0 013 μg l to 0 018 μg l respectively the absolute concentrations of the medium rare earth elements mrees and heavy rare earth elements hrees are relatively higher than those of the light rare earth elements lrees in the xiaguan hot spring the concentrations of the lrees in the butterfly spring are relatively high the δ2h and δ18o values of the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring vary from 102 to 107 and 11 6 to 13 8 respectively showing negative trends due to altitude effect the data points of δ2h and δ18o of the two spring samples are close to the global meteoric water line and the local meteoric water line with a slight 18o shift indicating that the springs are meteoric in origin with a slight 18o exchange with the surrounding rocks the geothermal reservoir temperature of the xiaguan hot spring estimated with sio2 geothermometers ranges from 107 4 c to 114 6 c the xiaguan hot spring occurs in the metamorphic rocks of the paleoproterozoic cangshan group and is recharged from infiltration of precipitation and snow melting water after undergoing a deep circulation the groundwater is heated by heat flow and rises along the tangzipu fault to form a hot spring of deep groundwater circulation type the butterfly spring emerges in the silurian limestone groundwater receives recharge from precipitation and snow melting water in the western mountainous area flows eastward along the fissures and emerges on the lower slopes as a spring of shallow groundwater circulation type with ambient

properties has increased markedly with the rapid development of springs in tourism fagundo castillo et al 2008 lu et al 2018 in order to make sustainable use of springs in yunnan it is necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of springs the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring near dali in western yunnan are about 20 km far from each other with quite different hydrogeological characteristics and limited hydrogeological and isotopic studies on these two springs have been carried out in the last decades as for the xiaguan hot spring the previous studies focused on the applications in earthquake precursor based on water radon and mercury monitoring in the hot spring li et al 2010 2013 miao 2009 specified the genesis of the xiaguan hot spring based on analyses of hydrochemistry and isotopes little is known about the hydrogeological characteristics of the butterfly spring owing to the scarcity of literatures in order to provide some insights into the development of the springs for geothermal resources and tourism field investigation hydrochemical and isotopic analyses of the springs were implemented aiming to solve the following scientific issues

china fold and thrust belt and the sichuan yunnan uplift area which is a contact zone of the geosyncline and the platform in the dali area occurs the cangshan metamorphic belt on the west side and also exist several faults providing conditions for the formation of hot springs west yunnan also lies in the yunnan tibet geothermal belt part of the mediterranean himalaya geothermal belt where about 1000 hot springs exist the elevation of the xiaguan hot spring is 1950 m and the spring s vent is about 40 m above the xier river some 100 m to the north of the hot spring a small stream on the western side of the hot spring flows from south to north into the xier river the xier river stems from the erhai lake and enters the lancangjiang river the hot spring with temperature of 76 emerges in the metamorphic rocks of the paleoproterozoic cangshan group and a little amount of travertine deposits near the spring s vent the hot spring water is used for bathing and relaxing as local spas the butterfly spring lies in the butterfly spring park to the northwest of dali and to the west of the erhai lake the spring outcrops in the silurian limestone in the lower mountain slope elevation of

flows out through five stone dragon mouths with total discharge of approximately 8 l s the spring water is colorless odorless and transparent it is a normal temperature spring with temperature of 15 c the water sample turns red when phenolphthalein is added and free co2 cannot be measured the butterfly spring is mainly used for sightseeing and tourism it is a famous landscape and resort in the dali area 3 methodology 3 1 sampling and analytical procedures field investigation was implemented five times for the xiaguan hot spring and three times for the butterfly spring from 2007 to 2019 eight

hydrochemical constituents and water rock interaction processes on the basis of piper diagram qin et al 2005 found that geothermal waters in the xi an geothermal field change from hco3 dominant to cl dominant with increasing depth in addition the piper diagram can indicate the chemical mixing trend and the factor factor diagram such as q mode factor can be used to identify relevant mixing ratios chae et al 2006 the values of δ2h and δ18o in groundwater has been widely used to study spatial and temporal processes in hydrology by numerous researchers e g stumpp et al 2014 craig 1961 found that there exists an empirical average linear correlation of δ2h and δ18o in precipitation according to this relationship qian et al 2013 noted the δ 2h and δ 18o values of water bodies in the yinchuan plain are mainly affected by external water recharge rather than atmospheric precipitation by explaining the slope of the local meteoric water line smaller than that of the global meteoric water line al ameri et al 2014 found that the recharge of the sanya area in yemen is from the non evaporated atmospheric precipitation because data points of δ2h and δ18o of the water samples collected from alluvium and sandstone aquifers are close to the local meteoric water line 222rn and 226ra are a valuable tool to determinate groundwater age which is useful in evaluating circulation rate and renewability of groundwater cherdyntsev 1971 huang et al 2017 moreover some studies has been made from the perspective of rare earth elements rees to reveal hydrochemistry and geochemical processes noack et al 2014 although the contents of rees in groundwater are quite low they can be derived from dissolution of surrounding rocks by the examination of ree concentrations and distribution patterns and the predictable thermodynamic differences between rees allow for tracing natural hydrogeochemical processes goldstein and jacobsen 1988 noack et al 2014 for example singh et al 2016 suggested that carbonates from the mélange zone of manipur ophiolitic complex in northeast india was affected by diagenesis in shallow marine environment by interpretation of shale normalized positive eu anomalies

the silica geothermometers describing the relationship between solubility of quartz and temperature of geothermal water are used to evaluate the temperature of geothermal reservoirs morey et al 1962 according to the calculated temperature of reservoirs mohammadi et al 2010 studied the thermal water samples in the zagros region of iran which originate from meteoric water with a circulation depth of about 1500 m and mix with shallow cold water rafighdoust et al 2015 proposed that the occurrences of the hot springs in tang bijar oilfield of southern iran are spatially related to the young normal faults and are meteoric in origin which are heated at depth with the increasing geothermal gradient 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical constituents the temperature t of the xiaguan hot spring ranges from 71 2 c to 76 5 c ph from 6 41 to 7 23 eh from 34 mv to 115 mv and tds from 529 mg l to 1380 mg l the temperature tds and eh of the butterfly spring are about 15 c and from 235 mg l to 246 mg l from 22 mv to 46 mv respectively and the ph value of the butterfly spring is about 8 according to the previous collection of water samples from the study area the hydrochemical compositions of the pingpo hot spring erhai lake water xiaguan cold stream water and penqianglian cold spring hong 1990 are listed in table 1 for comparison with those of the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring fig 1 the pingpo hot spring outcrops in the metamorphic rocks of the cangshan group about 17 km to the west of the xiaguan hot spring and the water temperature is 41 c the penqianglian cold spring outcrops in the triassic shale about 0 2 km to the west of the xiaguan hot spring with the temperature of 14 c the xiaguan cold stream is near the xiaguan hot spring the concentrations of major cations and anions of springs and other pertinent waters in the study area table 2 and table 3 are shown on a piper diagram fig 2 most of water samples of the xiaguan hot spring samples yd1 b and yd1 1 to yd 1 5 are characterized by hco3 so4 na type except yd1 a so4 na ca type the hydrochemical types of samples yd1 d yd1 e yd2 1 yd2 2 and yd2 3 are of hco3 ca mg type the xiaguan hot spring is of hco3 so4 na type and the pingpo spring is of so4 hco3 co3 na type all the cold waters are of hco3 ca mg type except yd1 f hco3 na type the hydrochemical types of the butterfly spring erhai lake and cold stream water yd2 1 yd2 1 yd2 3 yd1 d and yd1 e are quite close indicating that they have the similar source of recharge from precipitation the concentrations of major anions and cations in water samples from the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring are shown in table 2 content of hco3 in the xiaguan hot spring ranges from 573 mg l to 588 mg l and the milliequivalent meq percentage is 60 to 70 of the anions and that in the butterfly spring from 150 mg l to 191 mg l and accounts for 78 to 98 meq of the anions the meq percentage of hco3 in the adjacent surface water and the penqianglian cold spring are very similar to that in the butterfly spring the meq percentage of hco3 in the pingpo hot spring is about 40 and that of cl is relatively low k and na in the xiaguan hot spring the pingpo spring and the penqianglian cold spring account for 75 to 85 of the meq percentage of the cations the meq percentage of ca2 in the surface water and the butterfly spring account for about 60 of the cations and the surface water has a slightly higher meq percentage of na than that of the butterfly spring 5 the cations and anions of the xiaguan hot spring are dominated by na hco3 so4 2 and the cations and anions of the butterfly spring by ca2 mg2 and hco3 the concentrations of fe2 and fe3 in the xiaguan hot spring and butterfly spring are 1 mg l table 2 from fig 3 a the correlation between fe2 fe3 and ph is not obvious which is roughly negative the concentration of f in xiaguan hot spring is between 6 mg l and 10 mg l and that of the butterfly spring is 1 mg l table 2 generally speaking the correlation between f and t is positive because the solubility of the mineral containing f increases with the increasing water temperature yu 2007 as shown in fig 3b it is obvious that the concentration of f in the xiaguan hot spring is significantly higher than that of the butterfly spring the concentration of f in the groundwater is also directly proportional to ph under normal circumstances because f exists as ions in alkaline water yu 2007 from fig 3c the correlation between f and ph is not obvious possibly due to sampling and measurement errors the independent sample t test was performed on the parameters of yd1 and yd2 to test whether the mean and variance of sample sources are the same student 1908 as displayed in table 4 the confidence is always 0 05 which implies that the difference between yd1 and yd2 cannot be ignored indicating weak hydraulic connections between them the chemical compositions of the samples of the xiaguan hot spring shows no obvious deviations from 2007 to 2019 fig 4 while individual ions slightly fluctuate with time i e k f and fe2 fe3 in the observed zigzag pattern indicating that much changes in the geological and hydrogeological conditions have not occurred during the relatively short period of time the chemical analyses of the three samples of the butterfly spring exhibit similar trends fig 4 with lower standard deviation values than the xiaguan hot spring table 4 highest dissolved concentrations of k cl and f at the first time showing fairly constant thereafter to a little decline apart from the above mentioned ions ionic compositions show no marked change from 2015 to 2019 indicating that the hydrogeology in this spring system did not changed during this short period of time compared to other hot springs of deep circulation in cuba fagundo castillo et al 2008 with low values of the variation coefficients in temperature and tds the xiaguan hot spring have higher temperature and lower tds which nearly do not change with time in such a short period of about 10 years due to deep circulation of the thermal groundwater the shallow groundwater of cuba has seasonal temperature and tds changes due to the dynamic karstic systems make a rapid flow and low storage capacity fagundo castillo et al 2008 compared to the cold springs of short flow path in cuba with high variation of temperature and tds the butterfly spring has almost constant temperature in such a short period of about 5 years due to relatively shallow and long circulation of the groundwater 4 2 cluster analysis and correlation matrix nine hydrochemical parameters t ph ca2 mg2 k na hco3 cl and so4 2 were chosen to classify the 12 samples the q mode hca results are represented by a dendrogram fig 5 from the dendrogram 2 clusters were clearest at the distance of 5 cluster a contains 5 samples belonging to the xiaguan hot spring and cluster b has 7 samples belonging to the butterfly spring and nearby waters the distance between the butterfly spring samples and surface waters yd1 d yd1 e is relatively small indicating that they have similar hydrochemical characteristics massart and kaufman 1983 the dendrogram also shows that groundwater samples with similar hydrochemical types may not present in the same cluster samples of yd1 c yd1 f yd1 1 yd1 2 yd1 3 yd1 4 and yd 1 5 which have similar hydrochemical types are statistically distinct indicating the difference between their geochemical evolutions cluster a is of hco3 so4 na type and has high relatively tds up to 1120 5 mg l the main cations in cluster a are na and ca2 and the anions are predominated by hco3 and so4 2 according to the factor analysis the correlation coefficient calculated can also be used to analyze the source of ions in water sheikhy narany et al 2014 table 5 shows the correlation coefficients among the physico chemical parameters of cluster a there is a relatively good correlation among t ph k mg2 na hco3 and so4 2 the correlation coefficients are greater than 0 7 table 5 hco3 is likely to originate in the dissolution of co2 and weathering of carbonate rocks and the correlation coefficient between hco3 and na is 0 73 the correlation coefficient between so4 2 and mg2 is 0 84 showing a relatively good relation so4 2 is mainly from the groundwater leaching from the schist in the metamorphic rocks of the paleoproterozoic cangshan group the ionic ratios of cl and na show that all the data fall above the dissolution line for halite and halite is undersaturated in cluster a samples from the saturation index si fig 6 a and fig 7 a suggesting that na has other sources apart from the dissolution of halite some samples si of calcite and dolomite are greater than 0 and anhydrite and gypsum 0 indicating precipitation tendency for calcite and dolomite and dissolution tendency for anhydrite and gypsum fig 7b reed and spycher 1984 the dissolution of anhydrite and gypsum may lead to the precipitation of carbonate minerals with decrement of ca2 which results in so4 2 and ca2 lying below the dissolution line fig 6b lu et al 2018 the relationships between hco3 and ca2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and ca2 mg2 are given in fig 6c 6d and 6e all the samples are below the dissolution line suggesting that there are lower ca2 concentration in cluster a water samples two reasons can explain this phenomenon farid et al 2015 calcite precipitation and cation exchange calcite precipitation is due possibly to gypsum dissolution farid et al 2015 as shown in fig 6f all the samples define a straight line indicating that na ca2 mg2 and k cations participate in the ion exchange reaction with the release of na and adsorption of ca2 farid et al 2015 cluster b has low tds and most of the water samples are of hco3 ca mg type table 6 shows the correlation coefficients among the physico chemical parameters of cluster b there is a relatively good correlation among t ph k mg2 na hco3 cl and so4 2 the correlation coefficients are greater than 0 7 table 6 the carbonate rocks outcrop in the study area the values of ca2 hco3 ca2 mg2 hco3 and ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 are close to 1 fig 6c 6d and 6e implying that ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 are derived from the dissolution of dolomite calcite gypsum and anhydrite thus there are no cation exchange between na ca2 and mg2 fig 6f the good correlations between ca2 mg2 and hco3 na and cl the correlation coefficients are all greater than 0 7 reflect the dissolution of dolomite calcite and halite table 6 and fig 6a these processes are in accordance with the saturation indices fig 7 4 3 inverse modeling and hydrochemical evolution inverse hydrochemical modeling was conducted on the clusters resulted from hca cluster b is of hco3 ca mg type which is often regarded as recharge area waters in the general hydrochemical evolution model kebede et al 2005 after the further hydrolysis of silicate minerals the hco3 ca mg type waters will have higher concentrations of na mg2 and hco3 and lower concentration of ca2 due to the precipitation of carbonates kebede et al 2005 thus cluster a which are of hco3 so4 na type have undergone a relatively pronounced degree of geochemical evolution cluster b is therefore taken as initial water and cluster a is considered to be derived from cluster b in the inverse modeling the possible mineral phases were selected based on mineral compositions and saturation indices the mineral transfers obtained by inverse modeling are shown in table 7 indicating that gypsum chalcedony albite halite and k feldspar dissolve and calcite dolomite and kaolinite precipitate when groundwater circulates the result of hydrochemical evolution is displayed in table 8 dissolution of albite and halite has large proportions in mineral transfer which results in na being the dominant cation precipitation of calcite and dolomite decrease the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 in the water in addition ion exchange mentioned before controls the concentrations of na and ca2 dissolution of gypsum contributes ca2 and so4 2 to the waters dissolution of k feldspar is the main source of k the gaseous co2 reduces in these reactions 4 4 hydrochemistry of ree as an increasingly important research topic rees with unique geochemical characteristics have become especially powerful tracers in recognizing the geochemical processes shahhosseini et al 2017 nigro et al 2018 on the basis of atomic number rees are segregated into light middle and heavy ree lree mree and hree respectively noack et al 2014 the concentrations of the rees in the xiaguan hot spring yd1 5 and the butterfly spring yd2 3 range from 0 033 ug l to 0 071 ug l and 0 013 ug l to 0 018 ug l table 2 and fig 8 with an average value of 0 051 μg l and 0 018 μg l respectively the total concentrations of the mrees 0 269 μg l and the hrees 0 271 μg l in the butterfly spring are relatively higher than those of the lrees 0 168 μg l in the xiaguan hot spring the total concentrations of the lrees in the butterfly spring are relatively higher 0 097 μg l than those of the mrees 0 078 μg l and the hree 0 083 μg l the upper continental crust ucc normalized ree fractionation patterns for the water samples of the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring are presented in fig 9 taylor and mclennan 1985 it can be seen that the ree fractionation patterns have a tendency to increase to the right studies on the characteristics and concentrations of rees complexes in groundwater can reveal the origin of the springs and the subsurface water rock interactions which alter rees patterns predictably göb et al 2013 in the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring inorganic anions that could complex with the rees mainly include cl oh co3 2 so4 2 and their double ions the rees of nd gd and er representing lree mree and hree respectively are chosen to analyze the inorganic speciation of the dissolved rees by conducting the hydrogeochemical code phreeqc with llnl database fig 10 table 9 the results of complication calculation in the spring water samples indicate that the carbonate complex lnco3 2 ln is a certain element of lanthanides 60 and sulfate species lnso4 2 27 are dominated in the lrees of the xiaguan hot spring while those in the mrees and the hrees are lnco3 2 60 70 and ln co3 2 2 27 29 in the butterfly spring the carbonate complexes in the forms of ln co3 2 2 98 99 are the major dissolved inorganic species the carbonate complexes of the spring waters in the butterfly spring account for a greater proportion than those of the xiaguan hot spring indicating that the carbonate complexes of rees tend to exist in the spring waters with high proportion of hco3 the proportion of hco3 in the butterfly spring is higher than the xiaguan hot spring showing similar trend as the ree complexes which means that the different characteristics of the ree complexes of the spring waters in the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring have a relationship with hydrochemical compositions 4 5 isotope compositions isotopes play an important role in groundwater investigations because they carry a record of fluid origin ages and processes al ruwaih and shehata 2004 barbieri 2019 qian et al 2013 wang et al 2020 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes can be used to determine the origin of groundwater and the altitude and temperature of the recharge area of groundwater craig 1961 giggenbach et al 1983 the origin of the hot water based on δ2h and δ18o are determined in a δ2h δ18o plot with the following straight lines 1 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 2 δ 2 h 7 9 δ 18 o 8 2 where eq 1 is known as the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and eq 2 stands for the local meteoric water line lmwl in china zheng et al 1983 the δ2h and δ18o values of the xiaguan hot spring vary from 101 6 to 107 and 11 6 to 14 and those of the butterfly spring from 102 3 to 106 9 and 12 2 to 14 5 respectively they are plotted against the gmwl eq 1 and the lmwl eq 2 in fig 11 which shows that the data points are close to the gmwl and lmwl suggesting that the spring waters are of meteoric origin samples yd1 2 yd1 3 yd1 4 yd2 1 and yd2 2 show a slight δ18o shift which results from 18o exchange between the groundwater and the surrounding rocks the altitude of the recharge area can be estimated by the following equations wang 1991 yu et al 1984 3 h δ g δ p k h 4 δ 18 o 0 0031 h 6 2 5 δ 2 h 0 026 h 30 2 where h is the recharge elevation m δg is the δ 2h or δ 18o value of sampled water δp is the δ 2h 69 35 or δ 18o 9 7 value of atmospheric precipitation near the study area k is the δ 2h 2 5 100 m or δ 18o 0 31 100 m elevation gradient of atmospheric precipitation h is the sampled point elevation m tan 2018 yu et al 1984 the average recharge elevation of the xiaguan hot spring yd1 is 3079 m and that of the butterfly spring yd2 is 3127 m table 10 the altitude of the cangshan mountain to the northwest of dali ranges from 3500 m to 4122 m which is in good agreement with the altitude of the recharge area indicating that the estimated results are reasonable and the recharge area of springs is near the cangshan mountain the temperature of the recharge area can be estimated with the following equations dansgaard 1964 wang 1993 yurtsever 1975 6 δ 2 h 5 6 t 100 7 δ 18 o 0 695 t 13 6 8 δ 2 h 3 t 92 9 δ 18 o 0 176 t 10 39 10 δ 18 o 0 521 0 014 t 14 96 0 21 where t is the recharge temperature the average recharge temperature of the xiaguan hot spring is about 0 13 c and that of the butterfly spring is about 0 03 c table 10 since the top of the cangshan mountain near dali has snow for 5 6 months each year it is reasonable for the temperature in the recharge areas to be below zero the age of the hot spring water are calculated using the following equation cherdyntsev 1971 11 t 1 λ ra ln 1 n ra n rn where t is the age of hot spring water a λ ra is the decay constant of 226ra 4 26 10 4 a 1 n ra and n rn are the contents of 226ra 222rn respectively bq l according to eq 11 the age of the xiaguan hot spring is estimated as approximately 22 a after excluding significantly excessive results table 11 the age of the xiaguan hot spring is thought to be a bit younger than expected since it experiences a long circulation path the possible reason for this is that the xiaguan hot spring may be mixed with shallow groundwater of normal temperature before it rises to the land surface 4 6 geothermometry the temperature of geothermal reservoirs is important in evaluation and development of geothermal resources in geothermal systems it is however difficult to directly measure the reservoir temperatures in the field geothermometry can be used to predict geothermal reservoir temperatures in cases of no drilling temperature observations nicholson 1993 it is possible to use the property that the equilibrium concentration of a certain reaction product in the geothermal water is temperature dependent to get the surrounding temperature according to the equilibrium concentration karimi et al 2017 there are several types of geothermometers such as sio2 and cation ratio geothermometers fournier 1977 truesdell and fournier 1977 the uncertain results of geothermometers are due to the mixing of geothermal water with cold water and lack of a full equilibrium with the geothermal reservoir before selecting the proper geothermometers the na k mg triangle diagram method proposed by giggenbach is used to judge the equilibrium state of the geothermal water giggenbach 1988 in fig 12 the data points of geothermal water of the xiaguan hot spring are close to mg1 2 and belong to immature waters indicating that they are not fully equilibrated with the reservoir rocks so the cation ratio geothermometers cannot provide reliable results than silica geothermometers do giggenbach 1988 in this paper the equations of a quartz geothermometer with no steam loss eq 12 and a sio2 geothermometer with no steam loss eq 13 fournier 1977 are employed by solving eqs 12 and 13 the geothermal reservoir temperatures for the xiaguan hot spring ranging from 107 4 to 114 6 c are obtained and the results of the sio2 geothermometer are lower than the spring vent temperature so the results with eq 13 should be ignored thus the reservoir temperature of the xiaguan hot spring is estimated as 107 4 c to 114 6 c 12 t 1309 5 19 log sio 2 273 15 13 t 1032 4 69 log sio 2 273 15 the depth of thermal groundwater circulation is one of the important parameters in geothermal studies especially the formation of the geothermal waters karimi et al 2017 the circulation depth of the xiaguan hot spring can be estimated by using eq 14 li et al 1997 14 m q t h t b m where m is the circulation depth m th is the geothermal reservoir temperature tb is the annual average temperature of the recharge area q is the level of geothermal increase m and m is the thickness of the constant temperature zone m for the xiaguan hot spring tb 15 c th is from 107 4 c to 114 6 c m 30 m and q 33 m zhou et al 2017 the obtained results range from 3079 2 m to 3316 8 m mixing with shallow cold water during upwelling often occurs for thermal groundwater lu et al 2018 both the chemical and isotopic analyses of the xiaguan hot spring suggest that the ascending thermal groundwater may be mixed with shallow cold waters the silicon enthalpy model is used to track the mixing process based on the chemical components in the mixed waters and two end members cold and thermal groundwater to determine the temperature of the thermal groundwater in the mixed water and the proportion of the mixed cold water by introducing the following two equations with two unknowns variables of x 1 and x 2 truesdell and fournier 1977 15 δ h c x 1 δ h h 1 x 1 δ h s 16 s i c x 2 s i h 1 x 2 s i s where δ h c is the enthalpy of cold water δ h c is the enthalpy of thermal water δ h c is the enthalpy of spring water si c is the silica contents of cold water si h is the silica contents of thermal water si s is the silica contents of spring water x 1 x 2 and 1 x 2 1 x 2 are the fractions of cold water and thermal water respectively from eqs 15 and 16 we obtain x 1 δ h h δ h s δ h h δ h c and x 2 s i h s i s s i h s i c using a graphical approach x 1 and x 2 in eqs 15 and 16 can be calculated and the proportion of cold water mixing in the xiaguan hot spring is about 52 to 57 and the temperature of thermal groundwater before mixing is about 140 c to 150 c fig 13 which is a bit higher than that obtained with the sio2 geothermometers 4 7 genesis of the springs summarizing the above discussions the conceptual genetic modes of the xiaguan hot spring and the butterfly spring are presented in figs 15 and 16 the xiaguan hot spring yd1 is located along the tangzipu fault which is a branch fault of the xierhe fault belonging to the red river fault zone the rocks near the fault intersection are fractured and the flow channel of geothermal water was easy to form the south wall of the xierhe fault is the mesozoic red layer which can be regarded as an aquiclude due to its poor permeability hong 1990 it is divided into two parts by the tangzipu fault the triassic shale in the west and the jurassic sandstone in the east hong 1990 the north wall of the xierhe fault is the metamorphic rocks of the cangshan group the faults and fissures were well developed precipitation and snow melting water on top of the mountains infiltrate along the tectonic fissures to recharge groundwater in the metamorphic rocks fig 14 when undergoing deep circulation the groundwater is heated by heat flow from below and then encounters the aquiclude and rises along the tangzipu fault the xiaguan hot spring water is mixed with shallow cold groundwater during ascending to the surface and finally emerges in the form of a hot spring the hot spring is a spring of a deep groundwater circulation type fig 14 in which the deepest point of groundwater flow path is lower than the spring s vent zhou et al 2014 it also belongs to a convective geothermal system of low medium temperature the butterfly spring yd2 is located to the east of the yunnong peak of the cangshan mountain and issues on the east side of a convex hillside the sediments of the quaternary are deposited at lower elevations below the spring s vent the spring is the discharge point of groundwater in the silurian limestone and dolomite the discharge of the butterfly spring is relatively large indicating that groundwater in the silurian carbonate aquifer is abundant the neoproterozoic granite can also be regarded as an aquifer with relatively poor groundwater the recharge of the butterfly spring are from precipitation in the western mountain area the karst fissured aquifer may provide good channels for groundwater flow in the western mountain area precipitation and snow melting water infiltrate and recharge groundwater groundwater seeps eastward in the aquifer and discharges in the form of the spring on the lower slopes the butterfly spring is a ambient temperature spring of shallow groundwater circulation type fig 15 in which the deepest point of groundwater flow path is still higher than the spring s vent zhou et al 2014 5 conclusions the xiaguan hot spring yd1 and the butterfly spring yd2 lying in the western yunnan of china are examined for their hydrogeological characteristics and isotopic compositions which are quite different the former is of hco3 so4 na type and the latter of hco3 ca mg type the yd1 has water temperature ranging from 71 2 c to 76 5 c ph from 6 41 to 7 23 tds from 529 mg l to 1380 mg l and the yd2 has water temperature of about 15 c tds ranging from 235 mg l to 246 mg l ph from 7 3 to 8 which is more alkaline the concentrations of hydrochemical constituents k ca2 na hco3 so4 2 and cl in the yd1 is much higher than in the yd2 the hot spring is rich in na and k and depleted in ca2 and mg2 due to dissolution of albite and halite and ion exchange the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 of the yd2 are slightly higher due to the dissolution of carbonate rocks the concentrations of the rees in the yd1 and the yd2 range from 0 033 μg l to 0 071 μg l and 0 013 μg l to 0 018 μg l respectively ucc normalized ree patterns of the yd1 and the yd2 are similar with increasing fluctuation trends indicating the enrichment of hrees and mrees relative to lrees δ2h and δ18o values for the yd1 and the yd2 vary from 102 to 107 and 11 6 to 13 8 respectively indicating that the springs are meteoric in origin a slight 18o shift exists in the hot spring suggesting 18o exchange with the surrounding rocks using the stable isotope compositions the elevation of the recharge area is estimated as 3009 3246 m the thermal reservoir temperature of the yd1 calculated based on several geothermometers ranges from 107 4 c to 114 6 c by using the method of silica geothermometers and silicon enthalpy model the proportion of the mixed cold water in the yd1 is estimated as 52 to 57 the temperature of geothermal water before mixing ranges between 140 c and 150 c which is higher than that calculated with the silica geothermometers 107 c to 115 c the estimated circulation depth of hot water ranges from 3079 2 m to 3316 8 m the geneses modes of the yd1 and the yd2 are established and they are quite different for the yd1 precipitation infiltrates in the outcropping metamorphic rocks of the paleoproterozoic cangshan group through the tectonic fissures to recharge the groundwater after undergoing deep circulation the groundwater is heated by heat flow and rises along the tangzipu fault to the land surface as a hot spring the thermal groundwater is mixed with shallow cold groundwater during its ascent to the surface it is a hot spring of deep groundwater circulation type the yd1 emerges in the carbonate rocks on the hill side groundwater receives recharge from precipitation in the western mountain area and undergoes a shallow circulation towards east it is a normal temperature spring of shallow groundwater circulation type the genesis of springs in this studies has implications for geothermal resources and tourism management it is of particular relevance in the timing monitoring network of springs including physico chemical parameters measurements in the future prediction of changes in the flow would be possible by means of modeling with more detailed hydrogeological and mineralogical characteristics credit authorship contribution statement yanqiu

4979,it is of primary interest to determine the extent that natural processes are linked to understand natural system dynamics there is growing interest in investigating the coupling and coevolution occurring between natural processes and the interaction between natural systems soil moisture is a variable that is at the core of the interaction between multiple physical and biological processes therefore it is very important to understand the influence of soil moisture dynamics on that coevolution soil moisture memory smm shows soil moisture dynamics and the nature of their interaction with other related processes several studies have recognized that smm depends on soil properties and some other meteorological and biophysical variables however there has not been a study specifically devoted to studying the relationship between smm and the main soil properties the present study analyzes the relationship between several relevant soil properties texture bulk density and organic matter content involved in soil water dynamics and the stored precipitation fraction fp as a suitable expression of the smm the relationship between smm and precipitation and soil water content was also analyzed these relationships were analyzed both at the surface layer and at several soil layer depths and with four soil moisture sampling frequencies 3 and 12 h and 1 and 3 days the study was conducted with data collected over a period of 12 years at two soil moisture monitoring networks remedhus and scan located in spain and the usa respectively covering a wide range of soil characteristics and environmental conditions the results showed that soil texture plays the main role in understanding smm dynamics and that organic matter content has a good relationship with fp the sand fraction is the variable more correlated with fp with a clear inverse relationship correlation coefficient from 0 62 to 0 92 in remedhus and from 0 65 to 0 76 in scan the variations in fp observed with the different soil layer depths are also mainly correlated with texture and organic matter content but only for sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days the temporal variability of fp in the different soil layers is more correlated with the soil water content than with annual precipitation especially in the surface layer at 0 5 depth r ranges between 0 42 and 0 82 for sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days the r values between fp and mean soil moisture are always significant p 0 01 and higher than 0 66 in all soil layers therefore in view of the cases studied and the results obtained the most critical aspect of understanding smm dynamics is precise characterization of the water storage conditions especially in terms of texture and organic matter content keywords soil moisture stored precipitation fraction soil moisture memory soil properties 1 introduction an important part of understanding natural system dynamics is determining to what extent the involved processes are coupled more specifically the focus should no longer be on particular processes but on all processes that operate together and that have feedbacks with each other sivapalan 2018 the focus of analysis is therefore no longer on particular signatures alone but also on signatures arising from the coevolution of earth system processes sivapalan 2005 soil moisture is a variable that is at the core of the interaction between multiple physical and biological processes therefore it is very important to understand the role of soil moisture dynamics on that coevolution one approach to analyze these dynamics is to study the water storage and its change rate the variability of soil water properties has been studied for a long time nielsen et al 1973 and has been linked to the intrinsic variability of the soils hammond et al 1958 mader 1963 over the past decades researchers have focused on the specific variability of soil moisture both spatially famiglietti et al 1998 and temporally de jong and bootsma 1988 vachaud et al 1985 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 one attribute that expresses soil moisture dynamics and the nature of their interaction with other related processes is soil moisture memory smm the term memory defined as the time taken for storage to dissipate a positive or negative anomaly mccoll et al 2017a is also associated with other hydrological processes and expressed in different ways for example the term residence time is frequently used in this kind of analysis and is defined as the average length of time that water remains in a reservoir before moving to another reservoir ward and robinson 2000 van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 with respect to soil moisture memory is used in the sense of koster and suarez 2001 the soil can remember the wet or dry conditions that caused an anomaly long after these conditions have been forgotten by the atmosphere the persistence of soil moisture is called smm and it has been expressed in many ways and through diverse metrics entin et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2006 katul et al 2007 nakai et al 2014 ghannam et al 2016 a comparative analysis of six smm metrics can be found in mccoll et al 2017a supp mat these authors introduced the stored precipitation fraction fp as a metric to characterize the smm and after the aforementioned comparative analysis they concluded that fp outperforms previous metrics due to its simplicity and because it does not depend on the choice of soil moisture reference state used to define anomalies which may be an annual mean monthly mean time varying trend or another value but on the soil moisture state prior to the last precipitation event it is defined as the average proportion of precipitation falling on a soil layer that is still present in the soil layer after 1 f days or the proportion of the precipitation input flux that enters the soil moisture storage and remains there after a time interval 1 f d 1 being f the sampling frequency several studies have recognized that smm depends on soil properties and some meteorological biophysical variables ghannam et al 2016 kim and lakshmi 2019 however there has not been a study specifically devoted to studying the relationship between smm and the main soil properties mccoll et al 2017a used soil texture to globally analyze the stored precipitation fraction calculated with satellite soil moisture other studies analyzed the influence of some soil properties on attributes related to smm akbar et al 2018 studied the characteristic length scale of the soil moisture profile in many locations over the contiguous united states using only the sand fraction in their analysis the characteristic length scale is defined as the flow length through a soil profile mccoll et al 2017b also considered only the sand fraction as a soil property indicator in their global characterization of surface soil moisture drydowns shellito et al 2018 analyzed the soil drying rate against soil texture using modeled and satellite soil moisture data almost all these studies have used satellite data and it is expected that differences will be observed with respect to others that use point information considering aspects such as the spatial resolution the differences in the soil volume sampled due to differences in soil penetration depth owe and van de griend 1998 or the inherent uncertainty of global soil databases dai et al 2019 the main goal of the present work was to analyze the relationship between several relevant soil properties texture bulk density and organic matter content and the stored precipitation fraction as a suitable expression of the smm the relationship between smm and precipitation and soil water content was also analyzed for these purposes the databases of two soil moisture station networks remedhus and scan were used with the aim of considering a wide range of soil characteristics and environmental conditions the study was conducted for four soil moisture time scales of analysis and for both surface and profile measurements to identify the dynamics of the relationships based on depth 2 databases and methodology 2 1 remedhus network remedhus soil moisture measurement stations network of the university of salamanca is located in the duero basin spain over a semi arid mediterranean agricultural area of approximately 1300 km2 fig 1 covered by rainfed cereals in most cases but also irrigated crops vineyards and forest pasture areas sanchez et al 2012 gonzález zamora et al 2015 remedhus is a member of the international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 and it has been used in many studies related to soil moisture applications gumuzzio et al 2016 gonzález zamora et al 2016 2019 for this work hourly data were used from 19 stations table 1 equipped with capacitance soil moisture probes hydraprobe stevens water monitoring systems inc that measure the soil moisture at 5 cm depth in addition 12 of these stations are equipped with three envirosmart probes sentek pty ltd measuring soil moisture at 25 50 and 100 cm soil depths the daily data from these 12 stations table 2 were used to study the dynamics of the stored precipitation fraction with depth a series of 12 years 2006 2017 of daily soil moisture data of the surface and soil profile was used in this study all the selected stations are located in rainfed crops plots precipitation is recorded every ten minutes at four weather stations along the area in the present study and for each soil moisture station the precipitation series 2006 2017 of the closest weather station was selected and converted to hourly series in all cases the soil moisture stations were located 10 km away from their respective weather stations over a nearly flat area this is an area where temperature and precipitation gradients are very weak ceballos et al 2004 texture bulk density and organic matter content data fig 2 tables 1 and 2 measured in the same locations and at the same depths 5 25 50 and 100 cm where soil moisture is measured and close to the soil moisture probes were used in this analysis 2 2 scan network the soil climate analysis network scan from the natural resources conservation service nrcs of the u s department of agriculture usda gives free access to climatic stations data across the united states of america schaefer et al 2007 each automatic weather station measures a number of variables including soil moisture and precipitation for this work hourly soil moisture data at 5 cm depth and precipitation from 19 stations fig 1 table 1 were used for the period from 2006 to 2017 soil moisture is measured in the scan stations with hydra probes stevens water monitoring systems inc a similar number of stations as that of the remedhus network were selected from scan the selection criteria were a coincident series length minimal data gaps and available soil properties data with a suitable variety of soil characteristics fig 2 and environmental conditions most of the selected stations are located in plots with grass vegetation cover scan network soil properties used for this study included texture bulk density and organic matter content data from the surface layer of the soil where the stations are located table 1 2 3 the stored precipitation fraction as mentioned several metrics have been used to characterize smm in this work the stored precipitation fraction was chosen fp is defined as the average proportion of precipitation falling on a soil layer that is still present in the soil layer after 1 f days mccoll et al 2017a these authors calculate fp as the sum of positive soil water increments normalized by the total precipitation falling during the time period f p f δ z i 1 ft δ θ i 0 t p t d t where δ θ i δ θ i i f δ θ i 0 0 o t h e r w i s e where θ and p are soil moisture and precipitation respectively δ θ i θ i θ i 1 δ z is the soil layer depth and 0 t p t d t is the accumulated precipitation mm during the period time 12 years in this study it is assumed that the soil moisture increment δ θ is positive only if precipitation occurs other processes lateral flow subsurface flow capillary rise than precipitation can increment soil water content but we assume that most of the stations are located in suitable locations in flat or nearly flat areas where these issues were taken into account during the design of the networks and the occurrence probability of those processes is low accordingly hortonian overflow can occasionally occur with very intense rainfall but a long observation period 12 years of soil moisture and a high number of stations 38 would minimize that effect in the results in the present work fp was calculated with the databases of both soil moisture networks for sampling frequencies of 8 2 1 and 1 3 d 1 i e the amount of water still present on the soil layer after 3 and 12 h and 1 and 3 days respectively fp 8 and 2 were selected to analyze the soil response shortly after the precipitation event 1 and 3 days are proved to be sufficient to characterize smm for instance kim and lakshmi 2019 studied the global dynamics of fp with similar sampling frequencies 8 2 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 d 1 but selected 1 3 for their main analysis moreover these are typical sampling frequencies in modeling and in soil moisture monitoring for both in situ and remotely sensed measurements entekhabi et al 2010 fp was calculated for the whole period 2006 2017 and yearly 2 4 statistical analysis to study the relationship between fp and the soil properties precipitation and soil water content a correlation spearman analysis was applied the annual standard deviation of fp was also calculated and a correlation analysis was made with soil properties to analyze whether the temporal variability of the smm is related to these variables considering the variations in fp with depth a linear relationship was assumed and the slope of the linear regression function was calculated and correlated with the soil properties precipitation and soil water content in the different soil layers in the remedhus network stations this analysis was performed with the aim of determining the role of these variables in the variation of fp depending on the soil layer considered with the aim to determine variations of the precipitation fraction remaining in the soil between two sampling intervals the normalized difference nd between sampling frequencies x and y was calculated as follows mccoll et al 2017a nd f p x f p y f p x 3 results and discussion the results obtained from the fp calculation of the surface layer in the two networks are very similar table 3 the average is 0 48 0 30 for fp 8 0 33 0 21 for fp 2 and 0 14 0 15 for fp 1 and 0 08 for fp 1 3 this average is noteworthy considering that these data were measured under very different environmental conditions scan data are from scattered stations spread over several states under different climatic and soil conditions while remedhus is a dense network with stations located under similar climatic conditions but different soil types figs 1 and 2 table 1 the relationship between the fp results is quite similar and follows the same pattern for the two networks and for all stations fig 3 although for fp 8 and fp 2 is more scattered the interannual variability expressed by the standard deviation also shows a similar pattern fig 4 when sampling frequencies are compared for the different stations of the two networks however in the case of fp 8 and fp 2 is less defined indicating a higher variability between stations at finer sampling frequencies the normalized differences between fp 8 and fp 1 3 are close in the two networks but slightly higher in remedhus for this network the normalized difference between 3 h and 3 days after the rainfall event is 0 82 i e reduction of 82 and the normalized difference for the scan data is 0 70 ranging from 0 73 to 0 92 and from 0 52 to 0 86 respectively mccoll et al 2017a calculated the normalized difference between fp 1 3 and fp 1 30 and found values close to 1 all around the world which was expected and consistent considering that they compared sampling frequencies of 3 and 30 days 3 1 soil moisture memory and soil properties for the analysis of the relationship between soil moisture memory and soil properties we chose to focus on a number of variables whose role in soil water behavior is well known hillel 1998 the texture is largely responsible for porosity and plays an important role in hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention kutilek and nielsen 1994 the soil bulk density is an indicator of soil structure and porosity both of which are involved in water flow guo and liu 2019 the organic matter content promotes favorable conditions for soil porosity and soil water retention capacity rawls et al 2003 yang et al 2014 for example hudson 1994 found in his study that as organic matter content increased from 0 5 to 3 the available water capacity of the soil more than doubled considering the results of the statistical analysis with the data of the surface layer table 4 higher correlation coefficient r values were obtained with soil texture both for the remedhus and scan networks and for the four sampling frequencies the sand content is the variable most related to fp with r values ranging from 0 62 to 0 92 in remedhus and r values ranging from 0 65 to 0 76 in scan the variables that are second most related to fp are the clay content in the remedhus soils and the silt content in the scan soils organic matter shows a very good relationship r values ranging from 0 55 to 0 83 in the remedhus soils but is statistically significant in the scan soils only for fp 1 3 bulk density shows good r values for fp 1 and fp 1 3 in the remedhus soils but to a lower level and it was not significant for finer frequencies there was no relationship found between bulk density and fp in the scan soils it is clear from both database results that texture plays the main role in fp and in view of the results obtained from remedhus that organic matter has a good relationship with fp in their study on the global characterization of fp using satellite surface soil moisture mccoll et al 2017a did not find a clear relationship between fp 1 3 and the sand and clay fractions despite observing the lower values of fp at low soil sand fractions these discrepancies could be related to the spatial resolution and to the uncertainty of the global soil databases dai et al 2019 when shellito et al 2018 analyzed the surface soil drying rate which is obviously related to smm they found that soil texture played a larger role in the modeled soil moisture than in the case of satellite soil moisture wang et al 2017 used in situ databases of several mesonet networks and found that the relationship for both soil moisture and soil moisture temporal anomalies was more affected by soil texture than by climatic conditions e g precipitation it is also noteworthy that with respect to the behavior of the soil texture sand is the most important textural fraction sand content shows an inverse relationship to fp fig 5 this relationship is a consistent result considering that unlike other textural fractions it always shows an inverse relationship to soil water retention capacity rawls et al 1982 mccoll et al 2017b found a similar inverse relationship of the sand fraction with drydown rates in view of the results of the four frequencies analyzed table 4 no clear pattern is observed in relation to the evolution of the relationship with the soil properties as the time interval increases one would expect that the influence of soil factors is likely to decrease likewise other factors such as atmospheric factors may increase in relevance to the smm in the surface layer according to kim and lakshmi 2019 the total loss of soil moisture due to evapotranspiration drainage and runoff is much greater three days after rainfall events than few hours after rainfall events however in the present work it was observed that even three days afterwards the influence of soil properties especially texture and organic matter that govern soil water retention capacity is very evident this is in accordance with the two initial phases of the three stage soil water loss scheme brutsaert and chen 1995 laio et al 2001 immediately after the rainfall event the rate of soil water loss is governed by the available energy supply and water flows through the soil driven by gravitational forces during this stage water is very weakly held in the soil and properties like texture and organic matter are more related to water flow e g controlling hydraulic conductivity garcía gutiérrez et al 2018 after soil moisture content has decreased below a critical level a transitional stage sets in during which the energy with which water is retained increases and soil moisture and soil properties are the controlling factors the results have also shown that the r values are higher in the remedhus stations than in the scan stations and the relationship between variables is stronger in the remedhus soils than in the scan soils fig 5 in both cases the relationship between fp and soil texture is very significant but it is much clearer in the remedhus network these discrepancies could be related to the differences in depth sampled in each network case in the remedhus network soil moisture is measured at 0 5 cm depth and the soil properties have been measured exactly in that same layer in the case of the scan network soil moisture is also measured at 0 5 cm depth but the depth of the surface layer in which the information on soil properties is available is variable table 1 oscillating between 5 and 23 cm it is well known that soil properties can have high vertical variability ahuja et al 1988 mainly in the top layer pan et al 2017 qiao et al 2018 and even high variability at small scales kanso et al 2018 scan sites are scattered and cover a wide range of climates and that can be another additional reason for the poor relationship between fp and soil properties in these sites nevertheless in both networks the patterns of the relationship between fp and soil properties are similar fig 5 and the patterns of fp itself in the remedhus and scan soils are the same fig 3 a correlation analysis was performed with the annual standard deviation of fp table 5 to investigate the relationship between the temporal variability of that variable and the soil properties the results obtained show a similar pattern to that found with fp but only in the case of the remedhus network and for fp 1 and fp 1 3 the relationship was significant the texture and organic matter content give the highest r values within the texture the sand fraction shows an inverse relationship indicating that the higher the content of that fraction is the lower the annual variability at 1 and 3 day intervals however for fp 8 and fp 2 no relationship was found indicating that at finer sampling intervals other factors than soil properties like climate variability could probably explain the observed inter annual variability in the scan network none of the cases analyzed showed a significant relationship this lack of significance may be related to the differences in sample depth of soil properties and to the higher variety of environmental conditions as noted earlier in fact the pattern of the annual standard deviation of fp in both networks is the same fig 4 3 2 dynamics of the soil moisture memory and soil depth considering the interference caused by the fact that in the case of the scan network the properties of the soils have not been determined at the same depth at which soil moisture is measured an analysis of the dynamics of fp with depth was only been carried out with the remedhus network in this case soil moisture was measured from 2006 to 2017 along the soil profile at 12 stations with soil probes at depths of 5 25 50 and 100 cm with the aim of studying the changes in fp as the soil depth increases and the relationship of these changes with the soil properties three soil profile layers were considered 0 25 cm average 5 and 25 cm 0 50 cm average 5 25 and 50 cm and 0 100 cm average 5 25 50 and 100 cm note that the 0 5 cm soil profile layer has been analyzed in the previous section as expected fp increases with soil depth fig 6 it is even possible to obtain values 1 table 6 the main reasons to explain this fact are the accumulative effect along the soil profile and the progressive decoupling with the atmospheric processes hauser et al 2017 as the depth increases variability progressively decreases from fp 8 to fp 1 3 across all layers table 6 this outcome indicates that as time proceeds and soil memory decreases the soil response is more uniform between a precipitation event and the subsequent precipitation event the fp variability between stations also increases with depth table 6 in the surface soil layer on average the standard deviation ranges from 0 04 to 0 21 and in the deeper layer 0 100 cm from 0 36 to 1 13 respectively this would lead us to think that the reason for that increase is that soil properties are also more variable as depth increases however for almost all soil properties and the mean soil moisture content the standard deviation decreases with depth table 7 given the semi arid conditions of the area and the fact that the aquifer in this region has been overexploited for decades llamas and custodio 2002 groundwater level oscillations should not be a factor that interferes with the soil water dynamics therefore the reason for this increase in fp variability with depth must be related to another factor which is likely to be the different bedrock depths this limit always results in a strong reduction in hydraulic conductivity graham et al 1997 and a reduction in water flow and therefore it can lead to a differential behavior in the water storage in each case depending on the depth when fp is correlated with the soil properties of the different layers once again texture and organic matter content appear as the determining properties table 8 however it should be noted that only significant relationships have been found for 1 and 3 day sampling intervals for finer frequencies the higher correlation values are observed with the sand fraction and organic matter but do not reach the statistical significance level in this case unlike what was observed in the surface layer the studied soil properties seem to have less influence on soil water storage in the different layers this could be related to what was mentioned about the first phase of the three stage scheme the rate of soil water loss is governed by the available energy supply and water flows rapidly through the soil with the fp 1 and fp 1 3 texture shows r values generally lower than those found on the surface although in all cases r values are statistically significant table 8 this reduction in r as compared to the r values obtained for the 0 5 cm layer is likely related to the emergence of other factors as mentioned in relation to the effect of the bedrock depth the pattern of the textural fraction results is the same for all soil layers without showing noticeable variations with depth the sand fraction again shows an inverse relationship with fp and the silt and clay fractions show a direct relationship the main soil properties that govern the soil water dynamics especially soil water retention are responsible for the persistence of soil moisture in the soil profile after rainfall events regardless of the depth of the soil layer it is noticeable that organic matter content is well correlated with fp 1 and fp 1 3 in all soil layers this correlation means that even if the organic matter content is low or very low its influence on soil water dynamics is relevant hudson 1994 the remedhus network is located in an agricultural area and consequently the amount of organic matter in most soils is low in addition in any soil organic matter accumulates in the surface horizons and dramatically decreases with depth according to batjes 1996 the amount of organic carbon located in the upper 30 cm of the global soil stratum amounts to almost 50 of the soil organic carbon in the 0 100 cm layer in the remedhus soils the percentage of organic matter is 1 1 in the 0 5 cm layer and only 0 3 at 100 cm depth considering the relationship with fp organic matter content seems to be a relevant variable regardless of the depth of the soil layer considering the shape of the increase in fp with depth fig 6 a linear relationship between both variables was assumed a regression analysis was performed to calculate the slope component of the functions of every soil moisture measurement station then the slope value was correlated with the soil properties of each soil layer to determine the main soil factors that govern the variation in fp with depth the results obtained table 9 show that texture and organic matter content have higher r values again it is observed that for the shorter time intervals the correlation coefficients have no statistical significance however for 1 and 3 days as the sand content increases along the profile the increase in fp is clearly lower silt and clay fractions show a direct relationship with that increase for organic matter content similar results to the fine textural fractions were obtained and bulk density did not show a statistical significance for almost all cases once again texture shows the main role in relation to the dynamics of smm finally the relative influence of the annual rainfall and the mean soil moisture on the temporal variability of fp in the different soil layers was investigated it is obvious that the results obtained in this analysis are conditioned by the fact that only one area with similar environmental conditions is considered however during the twelve years of the study period very contrasting climatic years occurred and the annual rainfall ranged between 591 and 297 mm the correlation analysis results table 10 show that it does not matter how rainy or dry the year is in relation to fp and that this lack of dependence is similar for all soil layers considered however a clear relationship was found when fp was analyzed with the annual mean soil moisture a strong connection was observed along the soil profile but mainly in the surface layer in fact below 5 cm r clearly decreases and ceases to be significant for fp 8 and fp 2 apparently when the soil water content is high the smm is also increasing and vice versa these results are contrary to what akbar et al 2018 found for the characteristic length scale of the soil moisture profile with more influence of the precipitation and less influence of the soil moisture state in our study whether it has rained considerably or a small amount over a given year is seemingly less important in influencing smm than the water storage conditions in the soil 4 conclusions both texture and organic matter content have a considerable influence on the relationship between fp and soil properties and it is a much greater influence than that of bulk density the sand content is the variable with the highest correlation coefficient and it is inversely related to fp r values range from 0 62 to 0 92 in remedhus and from 0 65 to 0 76 in scan this relationship is a consistent result considering that unlike other textural fractions sand always shows a strong and inverse relationship with important soil water properties as it does with that of the water retention capacity in the surface layer no clear pattern was observed in relation to the evolution of the relationship with the soil properties as the time interval increases a priori it is reasonable to consider that the influence of soil factors will decrease and that of other factors such as atmospheric factors will increase however in the present work it was observed that even three days afterwards the influence of soil properties is very evident when the relationship between the temporal variability of fp and the soil properties was performed a similar pattern of correlation coefficients was found but only in the case of the remedhus network and for fp 1 and fp 1 3 the relationship was significant the highest r values were obtained for texture and organic matter content similarly within the texture the sand fraction shows an inverse relationship this relationship indicates that as the content of that fraction increases the fp variability is lower in short the higher the sand content in the soils the smaller the memory of precipitation events remaining in the soil and the less variable it is in time the lack of relationship at finer sampling intervals indicates that other factors than soil properties like climate variability could explain the observed inter annual variability at these temporal scales the analysis results of the surface layer of the two study areas showed differences that are attributed to the different sampling schemes utilized in both cases and to the higher variety of environmental conditions above all these differences are because the soil properties of the scan stations are not obtained at exactly the same depth as the soil moisture is measured nevertheless the results obtained for fp and their variability with the two sampling frequencies showed a similar pattern in the remedhus and scan networks considering that the environmental conditions are quite different in both cases considering the misunderstandings that could arise from the different sampling schemes the analysis of the smm dynamics with depth was only carried out with the remedhus network we observed that fp increases with soil depth and that the variability decreases as the monitoring interval increases this outcome indicates that the soil response is more uniform as time proceeds and the memory decreases moreover soil texture and organic matter are well correlated with fp and with the increase of fp with depth regardless of the soil layer that is considered finally a clear relationship was found with fp temporal variability in the different soil layers and the annual mean soil moisture especially in the surface layer at 0 5 cm depth r ranges between 0 42 and 0 82 for sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days the r values between fp and mean soil moisture are always significant p 0 01 and higher than 0 66 in all soil layers however no relationship was found with annual precipitation considering all these results the most important aspect with regard to smm is seemingly the conditions for water storage in the soil this research has been conducted in only two study areas although a wide range of conditions have been included this fact could limit its scope similar studies would therefore need to be carried out in other areas however the results of this study add to the knowledge of smm dynamics the analysis of the relationships with the main soil properties in the surface and along the soil profile can help to better understand the interactions of soil moisture dynamics with other related processes and therefore can be useful for the study and modeling of the interactions and coupling between natural systems 5

4979,it is of primary interest to determine the extent that natural processes are linked to understand natural system dynamics there is growing interest in investigating the coupling and coevolution occurring between natural processes and the interaction between natural systems soil moisture is a variable that is at the core of the interaction between multiple physical and biological processes therefore it is very important to understand the influence of soil moisture dynamics on that coevolution soil moisture memory smm shows soil moisture dynamics and the nature of their interaction with other related processes several studies have recognized that smm depends on soil properties and some other meteorological and biophysical variables however there has not been a study specifically devoted to studying the relationship between smm and the main soil properties the present study analyzes the relationship between several relevant soil properties texture bulk density and organic matter content involved in soil water dynamics and the stored precipitation fraction fp as a suitable expression of the smm the relationship between smm and precipitation and soil water content was also analyzed these relationships were analyzed both at the surface layer and at several soil layer depths and with four soil moisture sampling frequencies 3 and 12 h and 1 and 3 days the study was conducted with data collected over a period of 12 years at two soil moisture monitoring networks remedhus and scan located in spain and the usa respectively covering a wide range of soil characteristics and environmental conditions the results showed that soil texture plays the main role in understanding smm dynamics and that organic matter content has a good relationship with fp the sand fraction is the variable more correlated with fp with a clear inverse relationship correlation coefficient from 0 62 to 0 92 in remedhus and from 0 65 to 0 76 in scan the variations in fp observed with the different soil layer depths are also mainly correlated with texture and organic matter content but only for sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days the temporal variability of fp in the different soil layers is more correlated with the soil water content than with annual precipitation especially in the surface layer at 0 5 depth r ranges between 0 42 and 0 82 for sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days the r values between fp and mean soil moisture are always significant p 0 01 and higher than 0 66 in all soil layers therefore in view of the cases studied and the results obtained the most critical aspect of understanding smm dynamics is precise characterization of the water storage conditions especially in terms of texture and organic matter content keywords soil moisture stored precipitation fraction soil moisture memory soil properties 1 introduction an important part of understanding natural system dynamics is determining to what extent the involved processes are coupled more specifically the focus should no longer be on particular processes but on all processes that operate together and that have feedbacks with each other sivapalan 2018 the focus of analysis is therefore no longer on particular signatures alone but also on signatures arising from the coevolution of earth system processes sivapalan 2005 soil moisture is a variable that is at the core of the interaction between multiple physical and biological processes therefore it is very important to understand the role of soil moisture dynamics on that coevolution one approach to analyze these dynamics is to study the water storage and its change rate the variability of soil water properties has been studied for a long time nielsen et al 1973 and has been linked to the intrinsic variability of the soils hammond et al 1958 mader 1963 over the past decades researchers have focused on the specific variability of soil moisture both spatially famiglietti et al 1998 and temporally de jong and bootsma 1988 vachaud et al 1985 martínez fernández and ceballos 2003 one attribute that expresses soil moisture dynamics and the nature of their interaction with other related processes is soil moisture memory smm the term memory defined as the time taken for storage to dissipate a positive or negative anomaly mccoll et al 2017a is also associated with other hydrological processes and expressed in different ways for example the term residence time is frequently used in this kind of analysis and is defined as the average length of time that water remains in a reservoir before moving to another reservoir ward and robinson 2000 van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 with respect to soil moisture memory is used in the sense of koster and suarez 2001 the soil can remember the wet or dry conditions that caused an anomaly long after these conditions have been forgotten by the atmosphere the persistence of soil moisture is called smm and it has been expressed in many ways and through diverse metrics entin et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2006 katul et al 2007 nakai et al 2014 ghannam et al 2016 a comparative analysis of six smm metrics can be found in mccoll et al 2017a supp mat these authors introduced the stored precipitation fraction fp as a metric to characterize the smm and after the aforementioned comparative analysis they concluded that fp outperforms previous metrics due to its simplicity and because it does not depend on the choice of soil moisture reference state used to define anomalies which may be an annual mean monthly mean time varying trend or another value but on the soil moisture state prior to the last precipitation event it is defined as the average proportion of precipitation falling on a soil layer that is still present in the soil layer after 1 f days or the proportion of the precipitation input flux that enters the soil moisture storage and remains there after a time interval 1 f d 1 being f the sampling frequency several studies have recognized that smm depends on soil properties and some meteorological biophysical variables ghannam et al 2016 kim and lakshmi 2019 however there has not been a study specifically devoted to studying the relationship between smm and the main soil properties mccoll et al 2017a used soil texture to globally analyze the stored precipitation fraction calculated with satellite soil moisture other studies analyzed the influence of some soil properties on attributes related to smm akbar et al 2018 studied the characteristic length scale of the soil moisture profile in many locations over the contiguous united states using only the sand fraction in their analysis the characteristic length scale is defined as the flow length through a soil profile mccoll et al 2017b also considered only the sand fraction as a soil property indicator in their global characterization of surface soil moisture drydowns shellito et al 2018 analyzed the soil drying rate against soil texture using modeled and satellite soil moisture data almost all these studies have used satellite data and it is expected that differences will be observed with respect to others that use point information considering aspects such as the spatial resolution the differences in the soil volume sampled due to differences in soil penetration depth owe and van de griend 1998 or the inherent uncertainty of global soil databases dai et al 2019 the main goal of the present work was to analyze the relationship between several relevant soil properties texture bulk density and organic matter content and the stored precipitation fraction as a suitable expression of the smm the relationship between smm and precipitation and soil water content was also analyzed for these purposes the databases of two soil moisture station networks remedhus and scan were used with the aim of considering a wide range of soil characteristics and environmental conditions the study was conducted for four soil moisture time scales of analysis and for both surface and profile measurements to identify the dynamics of the relationships based on depth 2 databases and methodology 2 1 remedhus network remedhus soil moisture measurement stations network of the university of salamanca is located in the duero basin spain over a semi arid mediterranean agricultural area of approximately 1300 km2 fig 1 covered by rainfed cereals in most cases but also irrigated crops vineyards and forest pasture areas sanchez et al 2012 gonzález zamora et al 2015 remedhus is a member of the international soil moisture network ismn dorigo et al 2011 and it has been used in many studies related to soil moisture applications gumuzzio et al 2016 gonzález zamora et al 2016 2019 for this work hourly data were used from 19 stations table 1 equipped with capacitance soil moisture probes hydraprobe stevens water monitoring systems inc that measure the soil moisture at 5 cm depth in addition 12 of these stations are equipped with three envirosmart probes sentek pty ltd measuring soil moisture at 25 50 and 100 cm soil depths the daily data from these 12 stations table 2 were used to study the dynamics of the stored precipitation fraction with depth a series of 12 years 2006 2017 of daily soil moisture data of the surface and soil profile was used in this study all the selected stations are located in rainfed crops plots precipitation is recorded every ten minutes at four weather stations along the area in the present study and for each soil moisture station the precipitation series 2006 2017 of the closest weather station was selected and converted to hourly series in all cases the soil moisture stations were located 10 km away from their respective weather stations over a nearly flat area this is an area where temperature and precipitation gradients are very weak ceballos et al 2004 texture bulk density and organic matter content data fig 2 tables 1 and 2 measured in the same locations and at the same depths 5 25 50 and 100 cm where soil moisture is measured and close to the soil moisture probes were used in this analysis 2 2 scan network the soil climate analysis network scan from the natural resources conservation service nrcs of the u s department of agriculture usda gives free access to climatic stations data across the united states of america schaefer et al 2007 each automatic weather station measures a number of variables including soil moisture and precipitation for this work hourly soil moisture data at 5 cm depth and precipitation from 19 stations fig 1 table 1 were used for the period from 2006 to 2017 soil moisture is measured in the scan stations with hydra probes stevens water monitoring systems inc a similar number of stations as that of the remedhus network were selected from scan the selection criteria were a coincident series length minimal data gaps and available soil properties data with a suitable variety of soil characteristics fig 2 and environmental conditions most of the selected stations are located in plots with grass vegetation cover scan network soil properties used for this study included texture bulk density and organic matter content data from the surface layer of the soil where the stations are located table 1 2 3 the stored precipitation fraction as mentioned several metrics have been used to characterize smm in this work the stored precipitation fraction was chosen fp is defined as the average proportion of precipitation falling on a soil layer that is still present in the soil layer after 1 f days mccoll et al 2017a these authors calculate fp as the sum of positive soil water increments normalized by the total precipitation falling during the time period f p f δ z i 1 ft δ θ i 0 t p t d t where δ θ i δ θ i i f δ θ i 0 0 o t h e r w i s e where θ and p are soil moisture and precipitation respectively δ θ i θ i θ i 1 δ z is the soil layer depth and 0 t p t d t is the accumulated precipitation mm during the period time 12 years in this study it is assumed that the soil moisture increment δ θ is positive only if precipitation occurs other processes lateral flow subsurface flow capillary rise than precipitation can increment soil water content but we assume that most of the stations are located in suitable locations in flat or nearly flat areas where these issues were taken into account during the design of the networks and the occurrence probability of those processes is low accordingly hortonian overflow can occasionally occur with very intense rainfall but a long observation period 12 years of soil moisture and a high number of stations 38 would minimize that effect in the results in the present work fp was calculated with the databases of both soil moisture networks for sampling frequencies of 8 2 1 and 1 3 d 1 i e the amount of water still present on the soil layer after 3 and 12 h and 1 and 3 days respectively fp 8 and 2 were selected to analyze the soil response shortly after the precipitation event 1 and 3 days are proved to be sufficient to characterize smm for instance kim and lakshmi 2019 studied the global dynamics of fp with similar sampling frequencies 8 2 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 d 1 but selected 1 3 for their main analysis moreover these are typical sampling frequencies in modeling and in soil moisture monitoring for both in situ and remotely sensed measurements entekhabi et al 2010 fp was calculated for the whole period 2006 2017 and yearly 2 4 statistical analysis to study the relationship between fp and the soil properties precipitation and soil water content a correlation spearman analysis was applied the annual standard deviation of fp was also calculated and a correlation analysis was made with soil properties to analyze whether the temporal variability of the smm is related to these variables considering the variations in fp with depth a linear relationship was assumed and the slope of the linear regression function was calculated and correlated with the soil properties precipitation and soil water content in the different soil layers in the remedhus network stations this analysis was performed with the aim of determining the role of these variables in the variation of fp depending on the soil layer considered with the aim to determine variations of the precipitation fraction remaining in the soil between two sampling intervals the normalized difference nd between sampling frequencies x and y was calculated as follows mccoll et al 2017a nd f p x f p y f p x 3 results and discussion the results obtained from the fp calculation of the surface layer in the two networks are very similar table 3 the average is 0 48 0 30 for fp 8 0 33 0 21 for fp 2 and 0 14 0 15 for fp 1 and 0 08 for fp 1 3 this average is noteworthy considering that these data were measured under very different environmental conditions scan data are from scattered stations spread over several states under different climatic and soil conditions while remedhus is a dense network with stations located under similar climatic conditions but different soil types figs 1 and 2 table 1 the relationship between the fp results is quite similar and follows the same pattern for the two networks and for all stations fig 3 although for fp 8 and fp 2 is more scattered the interannual variability expressed by the standard deviation also shows a similar pattern fig 4 when sampling frequencies are compared for the different stations of the two networks however in the case of fp 8 and fp 2 is less defined indicating a higher variability between stations at finer sampling frequencies the normalized differences between fp 8 and fp 1 3 are close in the two networks but slightly higher in remedhus for this network the normalized difference between 3 h and 3 days after the rainfall event is 0 82 i e reduction of 82 and the normalized difference for the scan data is 0 70 ranging from 0 73 to 0 92 and from 0 52 to 0 86 respectively mccoll et al 2017a calculated the normalized difference between fp 1 3 and fp 1 30 and found values close to 1 all around the world which was expected and consistent considering that they compared sampling frequencies of 3 and 30 days 3 1 soil moisture memory and soil properties for the analysis of the relationship between soil moisture memory and soil properties we chose to focus on a number of variables whose role in soil water behavior is well known hillel 1998 the texture is largely responsible for porosity and plays an important role in hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention kutilek and nielsen 1994 the soil bulk density is an indicator of soil structure and porosity both of which are involved in water flow guo and liu 2019 the organic matter content promotes favorable conditions for soil porosity and soil water retention capacity rawls et al 2003 yang et al 2014 for example hudson 1994 found in his study that as organic matter content increased from 0 5 to 3 the available water capacity of the soil more than doubled considering the results of the statistical analysis with the data of the surface layer table 4 higher correlation coefficient r values were obtained with soil texture both for the remedhus and scan networks and for the four sampling frequencies the sand content is the variable most related to fp with r values ranging from 0 62 to 0 92 in remedhus and r values ranging from 0 65 to 0 76 in scan the variables that are second most related to fp are the clay content in the remedhus soils and the silt content in the scan soils organic matter shows a very good relationship r values ranging from 0 55 to 0 83 in the remedhus soils but is statistically significant in the scan soils only for fp 1 3 bulk density shows good r values for fp 1 and fp 1 3 in the remedhus soils but to a lower level and it was not significant for finer frequencies there was no relationship found between bulk density and fp in the scan soils it is clear from both database results that texture plays the main role in fp and in view of the results obtained from remedhus that organic matter has a good relationship with fp in their study on the global characterization of fp using satellite surface soil moisture mccoll et al 2017a did not find a clear relationship between fp 1 3 and the sand and clay fractions despite observing the lower values of fp at low soil sand fractions these discrepancies could be related to the spatial resolution and to the uncertainty of the global soil databases dai et al 2019 when shellito et al 2018 analyzed the surface soil drying rate which is obviously related to smm they found that soil texture played a larger role in the modeled soil moisture than in the case of satellite soil moisture wang et al 2017 used in situ databases of several mesonet networks and found that the relationship for both soil moisture and soil moisture temporal anomalies was more affected by soil texture than by climatic conditions e g precipitation it is also noteworthy that with respect to the behavior of the soil texture sand is the most important textural fraction sand content shows an inverse relationship to fp fig 5 this relationship is a consistent result considering that unlike other textural fractions it always shows an inverse relationship to soil water retention capacity rawls et al 1982 mccoll et al 2017b found a similar inverse relationship of the sand fraction with drydown rates in view of the results of the four frequencies analyzed table 4 no clear pattern is observed in relation to the evolution of the relationship with the soil properties as the time interval increases one would expect that the influence of soil factors is likely to decrease likewise other factors such as atmospheric factors may increase in relevance to the smm in the surface layer according to kim and lakshmi 2019 the total loss of soil moisture due to evapotranspiration drainage and runoff is much greater three days after rainfall events than few hours after rainfall events however in the present work it was observed that even three days afterwards the influence of soil properties especially texture and organic matter that govern soil water retention capacity is very evident this is in accordance with the two initial phases of the three stage soil water loss scheme brutsaert and chen 1995 laio et al 2001 immediately after the rainfall event the rate of soil water loss is governed by the available energy supply and water flows through the soil driven by gravitational forces during this stage water is very weakly held in the soil and properties like texture and organic matter are more related to water flow e g controlling hydraulic conductivity garcía gutiérrez et al 2018 after soil moisture content has decreased below a critical level a transitional stage sets in during which the energy with which water is retained increases and soil moisture and soil properties are the controlling factors the results have also shown that the r values are higher in the remedhus stations than in the scan stations and the relationship between variables is stronger in the remedhus soils than in the scan soils fig 5 in both cases the relationship between fp and soil texture is very significant but it is much clearer in the remedhus network these discrepancies could be related to the differences in depth sampled in each network case in the remedhus network soil moisture is measured at 0 5 cm depth and the soil properties have been measured exactly in that same layer in the case of the scan network soil moisture is also measured at 0 5 cm depth but the depth of the surface layer in which the information on soil properties is available is variable table 1 oscillating between 5 and 23 cm it is well known that soil properties can have high vertical variability ahuja et al 1988 mainly in the top layer pan et al 2017 qiao et al 2018 and even high variability at small scales kanso et al 2018 scan sites are scattered and cover a wide range of climates and that can be another additional reason for the poor relationship between fp and soil properties in these sites nevertheless in both networks the patterns of the relationship between fp and soil properties are similar fig 5 and the patterns of fp itself in the remedhus and scan soils are the same fig 3 a correlation analysis was performed with the annual standard deviation of fp table 5 to investigate the relationship between the temporal variability of that variable and the soil properties the results obtained show a similar pattern to that found with fp but only in the case of the remedhus network and for fp 1 and fp 1 3 the relationship was significant the texture and organic matter content give the highest r values within the texture the sand fraction shows an inverse relationship indicating that the higher the content of that fraction is the lower the annual variability at 1 and 3 day intervals however for fp 8 and fp 2 no relationship was found indicating that at finer sampling intervals other factors than soil properties like climate variability could probably explain the observed inter annual variability in the scan network none of the cases analyzed showed a significant relationship this lack of significance may be related to the differences in sample depth of soil properties and to the higher variety of environmental conditions as noted earlier in fact the pattern of the annual standard deviation of fp in both networks is the same fig 4 3 2 dynamics of the soil moisture memory and soil depth considering the interference caused by the fact that in the case of the scan network the properties of the soils have not been determined at the same depth at which soil moisture is measured an analysis of the dynamics of fp with depth was only been carried out with the remedhus network in this case soil moisture was measured from 2006 to 2017 along the soil profile at 12 stations with soil probes at depths of 5 25 50 and 100 cm with the aim of studying the changes in fp as the soil depth increases and the relationship of these changes with the soil properties three soil profile layers were considered 0 25 cm average 5 and 25 cm 0 50 cm average 5 25 and 50 cm and 0 100 cm average 5 25 50 and 100 cm note that the 0 5 cm soil profile layer has been analyzed in the previous section as expected fp increases with soil depth fig 6 it is even possible to obtain values 1 table 6 the main reasons to explain this fact are the accumulative effect along the soil profile and the progressive decoupling with the atmospheric processes hauser et al 2017 as the depth increases variability progressively decreases from fp 8 to fp 1 3 across all layers table 6 this outcome indicates that as time proceeds and soil memory decreases the soil response is more uniform between a precipitation event and the subsequent precipitation event the fp variability between stations also increases with depth table 6 in the surface soil layer on average the standard deviation ranges from 0 04 to 0 21 and in the deeper layer 0 100 cm from 0 36 to 1 13 respectively this would lead us to think that the reason for that increase is that soil properties are also more variable as depth increases however for almost all soil properties and the mean soil moisture content the standard deviation decreases with depth table 7 given the semi arid conditions of the area and the fact that the aquifer in this region has been overexploited for decades llamas and custodio 2002 groundwater level oscillations should not be a factor that interferes with the soil water dynamics therefore the reason for this increase in fp variability with depth must be related to another factor which is likely to be the different bedrock depths this limit always results in a strong reduction in hydraulic conductivity graham et al 1997 and a reduction in water flow and therefore it can lead to a differential behavior in the water storage in each case depending on the depth when fp is correlated with the soil properties of the different layers once again texture and organic matter content appear as the determining properties table 8 however it should be noted that only significant relationships have been found for 1 and 3 day sampling intervals for finer frequencies the higher correlation values are observed with the sand fraction and organic matter but do not reach the statistical significance level in this case unlike what was observed in the surface layer the studied soil properties seem to have less influence on soil water storage in the different layers this could be related to what was mentioned about the first phase of the three stage scheme the rate of soil water loss is governed by the available energy supply and water flows rapidly through the soil with the fp 1 and fp 1 3 texture shows r values generally lower than those found on the surface although in all cases r values are statistically significant table 8 this reduction in r as compared to the r values obtained for the 0 5 cm layer is likely related to the emergence of other factors as mentioned in relation to the effect of the bedrock depth the pattern of the textural fraction results is the same for all soil layers without showing noticeable variations with depth the sand fraction again shows an inverse relationship with fp and the silt and clay fractions show a direct relationship the main soil properties that govern the soil water dynamics especially soil water retention are responsible for the persistence of soil moisture in the soil profile after rainfall events regardless of the depth of the soil layer it is noticeable that organic matter content is well correlated with fp 1 and fp 1 3 in all soil layers this correlation means that even if the organic matter content is low or very low its influence on soil water dynamics is relevant hudson 1994 the remedhus network is located in an agricultural area and consequently the amount of organic matter in most soils is low in addition in any soil organic matter accumulates in the surface horizons and dramatically decreases with depth according to batjes 1996 the amount of organic carbon located in the upper 30 cm of the global soil stratum amounts to almost 50 of the soil organic carbon in the 0 100 cm layer in the remedhus soils the percentage of organic matter is 1 1 in the 0 5 cm layer and only 0 3 at 100 cm depth considering the relationship with fp organic matter content seems to be a relevant variable regardless of the depth of the soil layer considering the shape of the increase in fp with depth fig 6 a linear relationship between both variables was assumed a regression analysis was performed to calculate the slope component of the functions of every soil moisture measurement station then the slope value was correlated with the soil properties of each soil layer to determine the main soil factors that govern the variation in fp with depth the results obtained table 9 show that texture and organic matter content have higher r values again it is observed that for the shorter time intervals the correlation coefficients have no statistical significance however for 1 and 3 days as the sand content increases along the profile the increase in fp is clearly lower silt and clay fractions show a direct relationship with that increase for organic matter content similar results to the fine textural fractions were obtained and bulk density did not show a statistical significance for almost all cases once again texture shows the main role in relation to the dynamics of smm finally the relative influence of the annual rainfall and the mean soil moisture on the temporal variability of fp in the different soil layers was investigated it is obvious that the results obtained in this analysis are conditioned by the fact that only one area with similar environmental conditions is considered however during the twelve years of the study period very contrasting climatic years occurred and the annual rainfall ranged between 591 and 297 mm the correlation analysis results table 10 show that it does not matter how rainy or dry the year is in relation to fp and that this lack of dependence is similar for all soil layers considered however a clear relationship was found when fp was analyzed with the annual mean soil moisture a strong connection was observed along the soil profile but mainly in the surface layer in fact below 5 cm r clearly decreases and ceases to be significant for fp 8 and fp 2 apparently when the soil water content is high the smm is also increasing and vice versa these results are contrary to what akbar et al 2018 found for the characteristic length scale of the soil moisture profile with more influence of the precipitation and less influence of the soil moisture state in our study whether it has rained considerably or a small amount over a given year is seemingly less important in influencing smm than the water storage conditions in the soil 4 conclusions both texture and organic matter content have a considerable influence on the relationship between fp and soil properties and it is a much greater influence than that of bulk density the sand content is the variable with the highest correlation coefficient and it is inversely related to fp r values range from 0 62 to 0 92 in remedhus and from 0 65 to 0 76 in scan this relationship is a consistent result considering that unlike other textural fractions sand always shows a strong and inverse relationship with important soil water properties as it does with that of the water retention capacity in the surface layer no clear pattern was observed in relation to the evolution of the relationship with the soil properties as the time interval increases a priori it is reasonable to consider that the influence of soil factors will decrease and that of other factors such as atmospheric factors will increase however in the present work it was observed that even three days afterwards the influence of soil properties is very evident when the relationship between the temporal variability of fp and the soil properties was performed a similar pattern of correlation coefficients was found but only in the case of the remedhus network and for fp 1 and fp 1 3 the relationship was significant the highest r values were obtained for texture and organic matter content similarly within the texture the sand fraction shows an inverse relationship this relationship indicates that as the content of that fraction increases the fp variability is lower in short the higher the sand content in the soils the smaller the memory of precipitation events remaining in the soil and the less variable it is in time the lack of relationship at finer sampling intervals indicates that other factors than soil properties like climate variability could explain the observed inter annual variability at these temporal scales the analysis results of the surface layer of the two study areas showed differences that are attributed to the different sampling schemes utilized in both cases and to the higher variety of environmental conditions above all these differences are because the soil properties of the scan stations are not obtained at exactly the same depth as the soil moisture is measured nevertheless the results obtained for fp and their variability with the two sampling frequencies showed a similar pattern in the remedhus and scan networks considering that the environmental conditions are quite different in both cases considering the misunderstandings that could arise from the different sampling schemes the analysis of the smm dynamics with depth was only carried out with the remedhus network we observed that fp increases with soil depth and that the variability decreases as the monitoring interval increases this outcome indicates that the soil response is more uniform as time proceeds and the memory decreases moreover soil texture and organic matter are well correlated with fp and with the increase of fp with depth regardless of the soil layer that is considered finally a clear relationship was found with fp temporal variability in the different soil layers and the annual mean soil moisture especially in the surface layer at 0 5 cm depth r ranges between 0 42 and 0 82 for sampling intervals of 1 and 3 days the r values between fp and mean soil moisture are always significant p 0 01 and higher than 0 66 in all soil layers however no relationship was found with annual precipitation considering all these results the most important aspect with regard to smm is seemingly the conditions for water storage in the soil this research has been conducted in only two study areas although a wide range of conditions have been included this fact could limit its scope similar studies would therefore need to be carried out in other areas however the results of this study add to the knowledge of smm dynamics the analysis of the relationships with the main soil properties in the surface and along the soil profile can help to better understand the interactions of soil moisture dynamics with other related processes and therefore can be useful for the study and modeling of the interactions and coupling between natural systems 5
