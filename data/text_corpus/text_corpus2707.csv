13535,the effect of vacuum degassing of activated sludge on biological wastewater treatment over a total period of 4 years was examined in half of the period studied the treatment system was classic where wastewater after a biological reactor with nitrification denitrification and biological dephosphatation was directed to secondary settlers in the second period the treatment system was modified so that the sludge from the biological reactor was directed to the vacuum degasser followed by the secondary settling tanks vacuum degassing activated sludge system vdas as a result of using the vdas a significant improvement in sludge settling ability was recorded which allowed the plant operators to increase the amount of biomass in the biological reactor differences in the quantity and quality of the wastewater influent were found during both periods however the quality of treated wastewater and the efficiencies of nutrient removal and removal rates were usually better in the system with vacuum degassing an improvement was achieved not only for the elimination of the different forms of nitrogen which by definition were to be removed as ammonia and gaseous nitrogen but also for organic compounds expressed as cod and phosphorus as a result of the lower sludge loading sludge production expressed in g ss per g cod removed was significantly lower 20 with the vdas keywords activated sludge vacuum degassing wastewater treatment nutrients removal 1 introduction the settling tank is a critical element in a traditional wastewater treatment plant the amounts of suspended solids in the effluent and the range of control of the biological phase of wastewater treatment depend on the proper operation of the plant the range of control is based on the need to maintain the highest amount of biomass in the bioreactor and to separate the sludge from the treated wastewater the main goals of its operation are therefore the separation of activated sludge from treated wastewater and the recycling of biomass to the biological reactor the effectiveness of activated sludge sedimentation depends on several parameters such as solid retention time concentration of suspended solids biomass 1 degree of turbulence 2 dissolved oxygen concentration 3 and surface properties of activated sludge flocs 4 5 the presence of filamentous or zoogleal bacteria which can cause sludge bulking and or foaming 6 or toxic substances causing the formation of so called pin floc is incidental and periodic 7 the saturation of wastewater and sludge with various gases as a result of biological processes or because of turbulence in the aeration chamber is a constant and integral element of the treatment process the concentration of dissolved nitrogen which reaches the secondary settling tank is close to the level of full saturation 8 therefore the gas accumulating as a result of denitrification in the secondary settling tank is not able to dissolve in the water phase and gas bubbles are formed larger bubbles can cause the sludge to float to the surface of the secondary settling tank whereas smaller gas bubbles result in a higher sludge volume and an impeded sludge thickening 9 therefore sludge degassing prior to the introduction into the secondary settling tank is a viable approach in the 1990a the continuous vacuum degassing technology has been created 10 the degassing of a mixture of treated wastewater and activated sludge is as a result of pressure lowering while transporting the mixture from a biological chamber to a secondary settling tank according to henry s law the reduced pressure results in a reduced solubility of the gases contained in the wastewater and the activated sludge floc matrix allowing the gases to be discharged into the atmosphere the biogradex technology has been patented in poland and other countries both in europe and elsewhere 11 currently there are several dozen treatment plants that use this technology e g in poland ireland estonia canada and china 12 14 the operation of this technology is shown in fig 1 due to the vacuum the activated sludge from the bioreactor is sucked into one of the arms of the u shaped system the pressure drop causes the removal of gases from the sludge which are discharged in the upper part of the system the degassed sludge falls from the second arm and is directed to the secondary settling tank as a result of degassing the saturation of the mixture of sludge and wastewater with nitrogen gas drops by approximately 25 50 despite the numerous applications of this technology there is little scientific information about the effectiveness of its long term use in full scale table 1 presents several studies mainly conference reports describing the effects obtained in three wastewater treatment plants in two cases analysis time was only a few weeks after system installation besides the presented results are mainly based on the quality of the treated wastewater which is the most crucial information from a technologist s point of view as a result of the degassing of activated sludge due to the improvement of the sedimentation index the concentration of suspended solids in the biological chamber could be increased up to 8600 mg l 15 16 a significant improvement of the effluent quality was observed in terms of the concentrations of both total and ammonium nitrogen however there is no information on how the changed conditions and intermittent stress influence sludge properties other than svi such as sludge activity and removal efficiencies vacuum degassing is a continuous process however from the point of view of the activated sludge and the bacteria inhabiting it this process is intermittent activated sludge flocs together with resident bacteria circulate in the system and from time to time reach the degassing system therefore they are subjected to lower pressure at time intervals equal to the time of sludge retention in the reactor and the settling tank in this sense from time to time the floc surrounding environment changes considerably as there is not only a change in pressure but also enhanced turbulence caused by sucking the sludge up and the movement of gas bubbles literature reports indicate that when using a vacuum activated sludge flocs and bacteria are subjected to stress potentially causing the breakdown and morphology changes of activated sludge flocs 14 the breakdown of bacterial cells 17 18 and changes in bacterial activity 19 21 or biocenosis structure 21 22 most key changes in the environment and in biological systems occur over prolonged periods thus a long period of wastewater treatment has been taken into account 23 24 in this context we estimated whether the use of vacuum degassing has an impact on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment based on 4 year data collected as part of the ongoing control of wastewater treatment plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant configuration and wastewater composition the wwtp of interest treats municipal wastewater from around 150 000 population equivalents via biological nutrient removal bnr the identification of the treatment plant is concealed at the request of the management of the treatment plant the system of biological wastewater treatment consists of the following zones anaerobic dephosphatation anoxic denitrification anoxic aerobic denitrification nitrification and aerobic nitrification around half of the plant capacity is used for aerobic treatment with an oxygen concentration around 1 5 g o2 l the biological stage was characterized by an average hydraulic retention time hrt of 14 h and an average sludge retention time srt of 15 days the concentration of activated sludge in the reactor was approximately 3 5 g l with the organic fraction volatile suspended solids vss accounting for 65 to increase the capacity of the treatment plant in terms of pollutant load improve the removal of total nitrogen in cold periods and aid sludge sedimentation the vacuum degassing of activated sludge vdas technology biogradex poland was implemented average daily samples from 24 months before and 24 months after the introduction of the technology were made available by the wwtp for use in assessing the impact on the wastewater treatment effect the scheme of the analysis period is presented in fig 2 the assessment of the long term influence of the sludge vacuum degassing system on activated sludge and wastewater treatment efficiency was based on sludge properties and concentration and on wastewater quality after the mechanical and biological stages the frequency and type of available data on wastewater characterization are presented in table 2 2 2 wastewater and sludge characteristics influent and effluent analysis for organic substance indicators and nutrient concentration was based on the following standard procedures cod by iso 6060 1989 bod5 by en 1899 1 1998 ammonium by iso 5664 1984 total nitrogen by en iso 11905 1 2003 and total phosphorus by iso 6878 2004 total and volatile mixed liquor suspended solids were determined according to pn en 872 2002 the sludge volume index svi was calculated as the ratio of the volume of activated sludge settled during 30 min to mlss and presented in ml g ss 2 3 calculations and statistical analysis the loading of a particular compound or indicator e g cod in kg d was calculated as the product of the wastewater flow rate and the concentration of a given component or cod in the influent influent loading or effluent effluent loading the change of a parameter was calculated using the following formula change parameter in period a parameter in period p parameter in period a 100 the percentage removal of nutrients was calculated as follows percentage removal influent

r a t i o n m l s s the analysis was carried out using ms excel and xlstat 25 univariate analyses for the differences between stated periods before and after the vdas installation for all measured parameters were performed using welch s anova or kruskal wallis tests as appropriate in all analyses the sequential modified bonferroni correction benjamini hochberg method for multiple hypothesis testing was used to control the false discovery rate 26 in all cases the level of significance was set at a p value 0 05 after multiple hypothesis testing corrections all statistical analyses were performed using the r version 3 4 2 27 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the control of the biological stage of the wastewater treatment plant was based on inter alia cod and bod analyses and the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus forms in the influent and effluent fig 3 shows the monthly average results obtained the amount of organic compounds including those that are readily biodegradable in the influent was 314 78 mg o2 l for the period a with higher levels in the period after the introduction of the vdas i e 365 72 mg o2 l fig 3a and b both cod and bod differed statistically between the two periods p 0 0001 the cod bod ratio was slightly higher in period p but without statistical importance p 0 01 more pronounced differences were visible in the case of the concentration of nitrogen forms in the wastewater introduced to the biological stage fig 3c and d in the influent both for total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen a greater non uniformity was observed especially in the case of the latter component the average concentrations of ammonium in the influent were 41 7 8 8 and 44 9 4 7 mg nh4 n l respectively in period a and p whereas the concentrations of total nitrogen were 41 7 8 8 and 44 9 4 7 mg tn l respectively in the case of phosphorus its concentration in the influent increased significantly fig 3e in period a it was 5 6 mg tp l 8 while in period p it amounted to 6 5 mg tp l 11 3 2 technological parameter changes the concentrations of individual wastewater components in the influent to the treatment plant and the biological stage of treatment changed as a result of closing several industrial plants in the wastewater catchment area this also resulted in a decrease in wastewater flow by about 12 compared to previous years significant difference p 0 0001 the closing appeared at the same time as the installation of the vacuum sludge degassing system along with the decrease in flow the unevenness of the wastewater influent also decreased the concentration of all the discussed wastewater components both after mechanical influent and biological effluent treatment did not show any evident variation due to seasonal temperature changes the dynamics of changes in the ability of activated sludge to settle is presented in fig 3f as a consequence of the introduction of the degassing technology an improvement in the sludge volume index svi by an average of 30 was obtained the obtained results are consistent with the observations obtained on a technical scale 8 fig 4 shows the histogram of the relative frequency of the svi obviously when using vacuum degassing period p the svi was much more often in the range up to 200 ml g ss and 85 of the measurements were below than 250 ml g ss without the use of degassing period a only less than 4 of the measurements indicated an svi below 200 ml g ss and 60 of the svi values were above 250 ml g ss in particular during the year prior to the installation of the vdas system svi values were very high 250 ml g indicating a bulking sludge it is assumed that sludge with an svi above 150 ml g is a bulking sludge in the case of an svi increase above this threshold problems with stable wastewater treatment may occur 28 despite the high svi values in both periods a and p the concentration of biogenic compounds in the effluent was acceptable and the permissible concentration was exceeded only in individual cases despite the high svi values also the concentration of suspended solids in the effluent was lower than 18 mg ss l regardless of the period studied the average concentration of suspended solids in the effluent in period a was approximately 13 mg ss l while in period p it was approximately 9 mg ss l the great svi improvement allowed for an increase in the concentration of suspended solids in the biological reactor which was higher in period p by approximately 42 the improvement of the settling properties of the activated sludge resulted in an increase in the amount of suspended solids in the bioreactor as shown in fig 5 an improvement in the settling properties of the sludge resulting in the possibility of increasing the concentration of biomass in the bioreactor has also been reported by other authors 8 9 13 15 16 the concentration of sludge in the reactor ss rbio and the recirculated sludge ssrec were significantly higher the ss rbio increased from 3 6 0 9 5 1 1 2 g l and ssrec from 6 5 1 5 9 1 3 3 g l the wastewater flow significantly decreased p 0 05 in the period after the introduction of the degassing technology in period a average wastewater flow was 43 300 8400 m3 d while in period p it was 38 000 4 900 m3 d the wastewater flow was therefore around 12 lower in period p than in period a also the uniformity of the wastewater inflow was greater in p period as evidenced by the lower coefficient of variation of 12 8 in contrast to 19 3 in period a due to the decrease in wastewater influent rate the hydraulic retention time of the wastewater increased from 13 7 2 1 14 5 2 2 h the increase in the amount of biomass in the reactor and the different wastewater flow rate during period p resulted in a reduction in nutrient load in the influent per gram of sludge despite the reduced wastewater influent and the higher density of suspended solids in the recirculated sludge the recirculation degree was higher by approximately 10 in period p although this difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 in both periods the range of recirculation degree was large 20 685 and 30 740 respectively for periods a and p a correlation was searched between the degree of recirculation which may affect for example the amount of activated sludge in the reactor and the amount of suspension as well as the treatment performance no significant correlations were found and the coefficient of determination for linear regression was always below 0 2 when comparing the entire periods 2 years each sludge production in kg per day with the vdas technology was about 8 6 lower significant difference p 0 05 than without this technology the excess sludge load in both periods was comparable and even slightly smaller 3 5 in period p although statistically insignificant compared to period a thus this load was within the range of 787 22 385 kg d average 6 523 2 550 kg d and 460 14 670 kg d average 6306 2426 kg d respectively for periods a and p the sludge yield calculated for period a was 0 63 0 33 g ss g cod while for the period p it was 0 54 0 20 g ss g cod the decrease in sludge yield amounted to 20 and was statistically significant the lower sludge production may result from a longer sludge retention time srt which was significantly different p 0 001 prior to the installation of the vdas sludge age was 15 1 6 7 days whereas after installation it was 19 1 7 7 days enabling an increase in sludge age can be an important added value of the sludge degassing system in systems with a higher sludge age not only is the nitrification process more reliable but also the oxygen transfer efficiency is enhanced 29 3 3 effluent characteristics and percentage removals of nutrients the cod in the effluent remained unchanged while the bod was lower fig 3a and b in period a the cod values ranged from 18 to 120 mg cod l medium 36 mg l and from 20 to 140 mg l medium 36 mg l respectively for periods a and p however the median bod was 5 5 mg o2 l in period a and 3 2 mg o2 l in period p in the effluent in period a fig 3c and d 5 9 23 0 mg tn l median 10 0 mg l and 0 1 22 0 mg nh4 n l median 1 9 mg l were found respectively in period p the concentrations of these parameters fluctuated in the range of 2 8 13 0 mg tn l median 7 0 mg l and 0 1 15 mg nh4 n l median 0 8 mg l for total and ammonia nitrogen respectively the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent fig 3e was comparable in both periods and was 0 1 2 2 mg tp l median 0 6 mg l and 0 3 2 0 mg tp l median 0 6 mg l for periods a and p respectively table 3 shows the percentage removal of organic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds obtained during the research period before and after the installation of the degassing technology the highest changes were observed in the case of nitrogen compounds however the improvement in the removal of organic and phosphorus compounds was also impressive the removal of organic compounds expressed as cod and bod was improved by over 2 in the case of nitrogen compounds the removal improvement was 5 and 8 for ammonia and total nitrogen respectively in the case of phosphorus compounds the average percentage of removal was almost 1 5 higher after applying the vdas technology the amounts of organic compounds the concentration of phosphates and the ammonium level increased as shown in fig 6 to take into account the differences in wastewater flow in individual periods the load of the most important parameters that flowed in and out of the biological reactor was calculated in kg d the changes in these parameters after the introduction of vdas compared to the period without using this technology are also shown in fig 6 the cod of the influent to the biological stage was higher by about 16 in the years after the introduction of the sludge degassing technology as a result the loading of the biological reactor with organic pollutants was about 4 higher in the years after modernization the bod value also increased with the increase in cod the change in the bod cod ratio however was not significant as a result of the introduction of the degassing technology and despite the higher organic load in the biological reactor cod effluent loading decreased compared to the period when the sludge was not degassed the same tendency was observed for nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the case of phosphorus its concentration in the influent of the biological reactor changed significantly and was higher by almost 20 in the 2 years after the introduction of the technology compared to the period of 2 years before its introduction the loading reaching the biological chamber was over 4 higher the average loading that drained out of the biological reactor was over 16 lower in the case of nitrogen compounds a higher concentration of ammonium nitrogen by about 7 5 and a slightly higher 0 9 total nitrogen concentration were observed however the ratio of bod to total nitrogen changed by 15 as a result of these changes in the quality of wastewater flowing into the biological reactor the nitrogen compound concentrations were slightly lower after installing the degassing technology in comparison to the analogous period without vdas technology in the period of sludge degassing p the ammonium and total nitrogen influent loadings were almost 4 and 9 5 lower respectively however the effluent loading of the biological reactor was considerably lower during the period of using the degassing technology in the case of ammonium nitrogen the loading of the effluent from the biological reactor was almost 72 lower and in the case of total nitrogen it was nearly 44 lower when compared to the period without the vdas technology 3 4 nutrient removal rate the specific sludge loading and removal rates were calculated table 4 to consider the different suspended solid concentration in each case the specific loading of the activated sludge before the usage of the degassing technology was higher than in the later years in comparison to period a the specific sludge loading in period p was reduced by 23 30 30 and 34 5 for cod p nh4 n and total n respectively in line with the results presented in table 3 the removal degree represented by a ratio of specific removal rate and loading rate showed better results obtained in period p the nitrogen gas produced during denitrification and entrapped within activated sludge flocs was evacuated by the degassing system to the air the enhanced ammonium removal can be explained by one or both of two routes for ammonium removal via a biological route of the nitrification or via the physical process of ammonia stripping due to the changes in the quantity and quality of the influent wastewater it is difficult to estimate whether both of these routes had an impact on the improvement of nitrogen removal efficiency and to what extent if the biological removal of nitrogen was improved it is not known whether this is the result of a change in the amount of bacteria in the bioreactor and the sludge age or the stimulation of bacteria due to the intermittent vacuum more research including modeling is planned to answer these questions in other laboratory studies 30 the application of a vacuum with the use of technological parameters at a similar level as those of the non vacuumed system did not contribute to a significant improvement in the efficiency of wastewater treatment these tests were conducted at room temperature due to the dependence of gas solubility on temperature the results of the above tests cannot be fully applied to the actual study where the wastewater temperature was dependent on the season and ranged from 10 1 22 6 c however based on these reports it can be assumed that in the discussed case the improvement in nitrogen removal was the result of degassing the activated sludge and the change in its amount in the bioreactor improving the removal rates of organic and phosphorus compounds is difficult to explain by the physical degassing process although gases extracted from treated wastewater and intercellular matrix may also contain other gases such as carbon dioxide the loss of this inorganic component would not affect the cod measurement similarly in the case of phosphorus compounds their removal from wastewater results from the incorporation of these compounds into cell biomass and not from metabolism to gaseous products thus the observed removal of organic compounds and phosphorus should have been biological in nature due to the changes in the technological parameters and the quality of influent wastewater it is suspected that the activated sludge biocenosis underwent reconstruction after the introduction of the vdas technology in related studies 18 31 during the degassing process of the sludge activated sludge flocs and bacterial cells underwent partial destruction when the pressure was lowered to 20 the bacterial cells were disintegrated 18 the disintegration of activated sludge may lead to a lower sludge increment 32 which was observed in the present case in the previously mentioned studies 18 31 no long term comparative tests were performed with systems without the vdas technology however the activated sludge from the tested wastewater treatment plant based on vdas had an exceptionally high proportion of live bacteria amounting to a minimum of 96 it was therefore suspected that the periodic disintegration of the activated sludge caused rejuvenation of the biocenosis and faster cell growth the biodiversity of the sludge is not the subject of the study but a difference in the share of the organic part of the biomass was recorded without vdas 64 9 10 5 of the activated sludge was organic volatile suspended solids vss whereas after the installation of vdas it decreased even in a statistically significant manner p 0 001 to 62 8 5 0 the organic matter content of activated sludge may be related to the accumulation of inorganic matter in the system 33 or to sludge age 34 the latter is consistent with the results obtained in the present case the increase in the age of the sludge after the introduction of the vdas was most likely the cause of the accumulation of non biodegradable residues in the activated sludge 34 and thus the reduction of the organic fraction in biomass however the effect of the disintegration of activated sludge on changes in the microbiome and sludge composition should be further investigated to compare the microbial activity at different periods absolute nutrient removal was calculated fig 7 the absolute nutrient removal was always lower in period p in comparison to period a the removal of cod by gram of sludge was lower by almost 9 while for nh4 n tn and tp it was 17 6 18 3 and 13 7 lower respectively because in the bioreactor a higher amount of biomass was involved in biological nutrients removal there were lower specific loadings and thus the bacterial activity could be lower furthermore a higher sludge retention time impedes microbial activity however the lower unit activity did not adversely affect the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment 3 5 seasonality statistical analysis this analysis included several parameters representing both the influent and effluent from the bioreactor as well as technological parameters characterizing the entire research periods and the individual seasons due to the geographical location of the treatment plant air temperature and consequently the temperature of the wastewater differed significantly among the seasons the average seasonal temperatures are given in table 5 according to henry s law 35 the amount of dissolved gas in a liquid is lower at lower pressures moreover in warm seasons the solubility of gases is lower 36 and the likelihood of their spontaneous passage to the atmosphere is higher therefore the effect of pressure reduction and nitrogen rich gas evacuation should be more pronounced in seasons characterized by low air temperature and thus by a lower temperature of the activated sludge mixed liquor table 6 presents the results of the statistical analysis where the statistically significant differences between different seasons of period a and p are represented by the fdr corrected p value lower than 0 05 the table shows that in the majority of cases the nutrient concentration in the inflowing wastewater in period p was significantly different from that in the influent in period a however due to the change in the amount of influent wastewater the change in the load of organic compounds and in phosphorus in particular seasons was not statistically significant the improvement of sludge settling was significant regardless of the season this resulted in a statistically significant change in the concentration of activated sludge in both the bioreactor and the recirculated sludge the improvement in settling ability did not result from a change in the degree of recirculation although in period p the recirculation degree was higher by a few percent than in period a these differences in most seasons were not statistically significant taking into account the fdr corrected p value the lowest values were observed for activated sludge concentration followed by svi and hrt for these parameters a relative standard deviation of less than 35 was found while the relative variability of the recirculation rate was over 120 this tendency was observed both across the entire research period and the individual seasons of the year in period p in each season the removal efficiencies for cod and tn were significantly different than those in the period without this system a in the case of phosphorus removal the statistically significant changes concerned seasons with extreme temperatures winter and summer such an improvement may rely on an increased sludge retention time which can increase nitrogen removal by denitrification since denitrifying microorganisms are heterotrophs improving the rate of denitrification also affects the removal of cod a similar consideration applies for the dephosphatation process in contrast the removal of ammonium nitrogen was statistically significant significantly different in colder periods winter and spring the equilibrium between ammonium and ammonia in water depends on the ph and temperature 37 in our bioreactor the ph ranged from 6 5 7 7 period a and from 5 8 to 7 4 period p at atmospheric pressure for this ph value the proportion of ammonia can range from 0 01 to 1 3 depending on the temperature 37 the solubility of ammonia rises with temperature 38 being lower in cold seasons than warmer months ammonia dissolution is enhanced by lowering the pressure during sludge degassing thus in the colder months higher ammonia stripping is expected surprisingly the change in the total nitrogen loading removed in each season and in the whole periods was not statistically significant the removal of total nitrogen is indicative of an ongoing denitrification process in which nitrites and nitrates are reduced to gaseous nitrogen volatiles the lack of statistical differences in tn removal suggests that the significant changes observed in the case of organic compound removal were rather connected to dephosphatation than to denitrification the aim of the degassing installation is to remove gaseous products originated from cellular metabolism because if trapped in activated sludge flocs they slow down the sludge settling processes as shown by the results of the statistical tests this release is not however significantly higher than the release that occurs spontaneously during the sedimentation process in the secondary settling tank without degassing technology however the place where the gaseous products are removed throughout the technological path is important for the sludge settling ability better settling properties made it possible to increase the concentration of biomass in the bioreactor and to further improve the wastewater treatment process 4 conclusions the main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are that the sludge degassing improves the sludge volume index by about 30 as a consequence a higher biomass concentration may be sustained in the bioreactor the treatment system can thus run with higher sludge retention times higher average percentage removals and removal rates and lower sludge production per organic compound removed were obtained in a vacuum degassing based system than without this technology the obtained wastewater treatment improvement resulted from a change in technological parameters such as an increased amount of biomass in the bioreactor and an extended sludge age and not from the vacuum stimulation of activated sludge bacteria however there is need for more in depth research focused on the influence of vacuum on the activity of bacteria and on biocenosis composition

13535,the effect of vacuum degassing of activated sludge on biological wastewater treatment over a total period of 4 years was examined in half of the period studied the treatment system was classic

sludge vacuum degassing wastewater treatment nutrients removal 1 introduction the settling tank is a critical element in a traditional wastewater treatment plant the amounts of suspended solids in the effluent and the range of control of the biological phase of wastewater treatment depend on the proper operation of the plant the range of control is based on the need to maintain the highest amount of biomass in the bioreactor and to separate the sludge from the treated wastewater the main goals of its operation are therefore the separation of activated sludge from treated wastewater and the recycling of biomass to the biological reactor the effectiveness of activated sludge sedimentation depends on several parameters such as solid retention time concentration of suspended solids biomass 1 degree of turbulence 2 dissolved oxygen concentration 3 and surface properties of activated sludge flocs 4 5 the presence of filamentous or zoogleal bacteria which can cause sludge bulking and or foaming 6 or toxic substances causing the formation of so called pin floc is incidental and periodic 7 the saturation of wastewater and sludge with various gases as a result of biological processes or because of turbulence in the aeration chamber is a constant and integral element of the treatment process the concentration of dissolved nitrogen which reaches the secondary settling tank is close to the level of full saturation 8 therefore the gas accumulating as a result of denitrification in the secondary settling tank is not able to dissolve in the water phase and gas bubbles are formed larger bubbles can cause the sludge to float to the surface of the secondary settling tank whereas smaller gas bubbles result in a higher sludge volume and an impeded sludge thickening 9 therefore sludge degassing prior to the introduction into the secondary settling tank is a viable approach in the 1990a the continuous vacuum degassing technology has been created 10 the degassing of a mixture of treated wastewater and activated sludge is as a result of pressure lowering while transporting the mixture from a biological chamber to a secondary settling tank according to henry s law the reduced pressure results in a reduced solubility of the gases contained in the wastewater and the activated sludge floc matrix allowing the gases to be discharged into the atmosphere the biogradex technology has been patented in poland and other countries both in europe and elsewhere 11 currently there are several dozen treatment plants that use this technology e g in poland ireland estonia canada and china 12 14 the operation of this technology is shown in fig 1 due to the vacuum the activated sludge from the bioreactor is sucked into one of the arms of the u shaped system the pressure drop causes the removal of gases from the sludge which are discharged in the upper part of the system the degassed sludge falls from the second arm and is directed to the secondary settling tank as a result of degassing the saturation of the mixture of sludge and wastewater with nitrogen gas drops by approximately 25 50 despite the numerous applications of this technology there is little scientific information about the effectiveness of its long term use in full scale table 1 presents several studies mainly conference reports describing the effects obtained in three wastewater treatment plants in two cases analysis time was only a few weeks after system installation besides the presented results are mainly based on the quality of the treated wastewater which is the most crucial information from a technologist s point of view as a result of the degassing of activated sludge due to the improvement of the sedimentation index the concentration of suspended solids in the biological chamber could be increased up to 8600 mg l 15 16 a significant improvement of the effluent quality was observed in terms of the concentrations of both total and ammonium nitrogen however there is no information on how the changed conditions and intermittent stress influence sludge properties other than svi such as sludge activity and removal efficiencies vacuum degassing is a continuous process however from the point of view of the activated sludge and the bacteria inhabiting it this process is intermittent activated sludge flocs together with resident bacteria circulate in the system and from time to time reach the degassing system therefore they are subjected to lower pressure at time intervals equal to the time of sludge retention in the reactor and the settling tank in this sense from time to time the floc surrounding environment changes considerably as there is not only a change in pressure but also enhanced turbulence caused by sucking the sludge up and the movement of gas bubbles literature reports indicate that when using a vacuum activated sludge flocs and bacteria are subjected to stress potentially causing the breakdown and morphology changes of activated sludge flocs 14 the breakdown of bacterial cells 17 18 and changes in bacterial activity 19 21 or biocenosis structure 21 22 most key changes in the environment and in biological systems occur over prolonged periods thus a long period of wastewater treatment has been taken into account 23 24 in this context we estimated whether the use of vacuum degassing has an impact on the effectiveness of wastewater treatment based on 4 year data collected as part of the ongoing control of wastewater treatment plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant configuration and wastewater composition the wwtp of interest treats municipal wastewater from around 150 000 population equivalents via biological nutrient removal bnr the identification of the treatment plant is concealed at the request of the management of the treatment plant the system of biological wastewater treatment consists of the following zones anaerobic dephosphatation anoxic denitrification anoxic aerobic denitrification nitrification and aerobic nitrification around half of the plant capacity is used for aerobic treatment with an oxygen concentration around 1 5 g o2 l the biological stage was characterized by an average hydraulic retention time hrt of 14 h and an average sludge retention time srt of 15 days the concentration of activated sludge in the reactor was approximately 3 5 g l with the organic fraction volatile suspended solids vss accounting for 65 to increase the capacity of the treatment plant in terms of pollutant load improve the removal of total nitrogen in cold periods and aid sludge sedimentation the vacuum degassing of activated sludge vdas technology biogradex poland was implemented average daily samples from 24 months before and 24 months after the introduction of the technology were made available by the wwtp for use in assessing the impact on the wastewater treatment effect the scheme of the analysis period is presented in fig 2 the assessment of the long term influence of the sludge vacuum degassing system on activated sludge and wastewater treatment efficiency was based on sludge properties and concentration and on wastewater quality after the mechanical and biological stages the frequency and type of available data on wastewater characterization are presented in table 2 2 2 wastewater and sludge characteristics influent and effluent analysis for organic substance indicators and nutrient concentration was based on the following standard procedures cod by iso 6060 1989 bod5 by en 1899 1 1998 ammonium by iso 5664 1984 total nitrogen by en iso 11905 1 2003 and total phosphorus by iso 6878 2004 total and volatile mixed liquor suspended solids were determined according to pn en 872 2002 the sludge volume index svi was calculated as the ratio of the volume of activated sludge settled during 30 min to mlss and presented in ml g ss 2 3 calculations and statistical analysis the loading of a particular compound or indicator e g cod in kg d was calculated as the product of the wastewater flow rate and the concentration of a given component or cod in the influent influent loading or effluent effluent loading the change of a parameter was calculated using

parameters were performed using welch s anova or kruskal wallis tests as appropriate in all analyses the sequential modified bonferroni correction benjamini hochberg method for multiple hypothesis testing was used to control the false discovery rate 26 in all cases the level of significance was set at a p value 0 05 after multiple hypothesis testing corrections all statistical analyses were performed using the r version 3 4 2 27 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater characteristics the control of the biological stage of the wastewater treatment plant was based on inter alia cod and bod analyses and the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus forms in the influent and effluent fig 3 shows the monthly average results obtained the amount of organic compounds including those that are readily biodegradable in the influent was 314 78 mg o2 l for the period a with higher levels in the period after the introduction of the vdas i e 365 72 mg o2 l fig 3a and b both cod and bod differed statistically between the two periods p 0 0001 the cod bod ratio was slightly higher in period p but without statistical importance p 0 01 more pronounced differences were visible in the case of the concentration of nitrogen forms in the wastewater introduced to the biological stage fig 3c and d in the influent both for total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen a greater non uniformity was observed especially in the case of the latter component the average concentrations of ammonium in the influent were 41 7 8 8 and 44 9 4 7 mg nh4 n l respectively in period a and p whereas the concentrations of total nitrogen were 41 7 8 8 and 44 9 4 7 mg tn l respectively in the case of phosphorus its concentration in the influent increased significantly fig 3e in period a it was 5 6 mg tp l 8 while in period p it amounted to 6 5 mg tp l 11 3 2 technological parameter changes the concentrations of individual wastewater components in the influent to the treatment plant and the biological stage of treatment changed as a result of closing several industrial plants in the wastewater catchment area this also resulted in a decrease in wastewater flow by about 12 compared to previous years significant difference p 0 0001 the closing appeared at the same time as the installation of the vacuum sludge degassing system along with the decrease in flow the unevenness of the wastewater influent also decreased the concentration of all the discussed wastewater components both after mechanical influent and biological effluent treatment did not show any evident variation due to seasonal temperature changes the dynamics of changes in the ability of activated sludge to settle is presented in fig 3f as a consequence of the introduction of the degassing technology an improvement in the sludge volume index svi by an average of 30 was obtained the obtained results are consistent with the observations obtained on a technical scale 8 fig 4 shows the histogram of the relative frequency of the svi obviously when using vacuum degassing period p the svi was much more often in the range up to 200 ml g ss and 85 of the measurements were below than 250 ml g ss without the use of degassing period a only less than 4 of the measurements indicated an svi below 200 ml g ss and 60 of the svi values were above 250 ml g ss in particular during the year prior to the installation of the vdas system svi values were very high 250 ml g indicating a bulking sludge it is assumed that sludge with an svi above 150 ml g is a bulking sludge in the case of an svi increase above this threshold problems with stable wastewater treatment may occur 28 despite the high svi values in both periods a and p the concentration of biogenic compounds in the effluent was acceptable and the permissible concentration was exceeded only in individual cases despite the high svi values also the concentration of suspended solids in the effluent was lower than 18 mg ss l regardless of the period studied the average concentration of suspended solids in the effluent in period a was approximately 13 mg ss l while in period p it was approximately 9 mg ss l the great svi improvement allowed for an increase in the concentration of suspended solids in the biological reactor which was higher in period p by approximately 42 the improvement of the settling properties of the activated sludge resulted in an increase in the amount of suspended solids in the bioreactor as shown in fig 5 an improvement in the settling properties of the sludge resulting in the possibility of increasing the concentration of biomass in the bioreactor has also been reported by other authors 8 9 13 15 16 the concentration of sludge in the reactor ss rbio and the recirculated sludge ssrec were significantly higher the ss rbio increased from 3 6 0 9 5 1 1 2 g l and ssrec from 6 5 1 5 9 1 3 3 g l the wastewater flow significantly decreased p 0 05 in the period after the introduction of the degassing technology in period a average wastewater flow was 43 300 8400 m3 d while in period p it was 38 000 4 900 m3 d the wastewater flow was therefore around 12 lower in period p than in period a also the uniformity of the wastewater inflow was greater in p period as evidenced by the lower coefficient of variation of 12 8 in contrast to 19 3 in period a due to the decrease in wastewater influent rate the hydraulic retention time of the wastewater increased from 13 7 2 1 14 5 2 2 h the increase in the amount of biomass in the reactor and the different wastewater flow rate during period p resulted in a reduction in nutrient load in the influent per gram of sludge despite the reduced wastewater influent and the higher density of suspended solids in the recirculated sludge the recirculation degree was higher by approximately 10 in period p although this difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 in both periods the range of recirculation degree was large 20 685 and 30 740 respectively for periods a and p a correlation was searched between the degree of recirculation which may affect for example the amount of activated sludge in the reactor and the amount of suspension as well as the treatment performance no significant correlations were found and the coefficient of determination for linear regression was always below 0 2 when comparing the entire periods 2 years each sludge production in kg per day with the vdas technology was about 8 6 lower significant difference p 0 05 than without this technology the excess sludge load in both periods was comparable and even slightly smaller 3 5 in period p although statistically insignificant compared to period a thus this load was within the range of 787 22 385 kg d average 6 523 2 550 kg d and 460 14 670 kg d average 6306 2426 kg d respectively for periods a and p the sludge yield calculated for period a was 0 63 0 33 g ss g cod while for the period p it was 0 54 0 20 g ss g cod the decrease in sludge yield amounted to 20 and was statistically significant the lower sludge production may result from a longer sludge retention time srt which was significantly different p 0 001 prior to the installation of the vdas sludge age was 15 1 6 7 days whereas after installation it was 19 1 7 7 days enabling an increase in sludge age can be an important added value of the sludge degassing system in systems with a higher sludge age not only is the nitrification process more reliable but also the oxygen transfer efficiency is enhanced 29 3 3 effluent characteristics and percentage removals of nutrients the cod in the effluent remained unchanged while the bod was lower fig 3a and b in period a the cod values ranged from 18 to 120 mg cod l medium 36 mg l and from 20 to 140 mg l medium 36 mg l respectively for periods a and p however the median bod was 5 5 mg o2 l in period a and 3 2 mg o2 l in period p in the effluent in period a fig 3c and d 5 9 23 0 mg tn l median 10 0 mg l and 0 1 22 0 mg nh4 n l median 1 9 mg l were found respectively in period p the concentrations of these parameters fluctuated in the range of 2 8 13 0 mg tn l median 7 0 mg l and 0 1 15 mg nh4 n l median 0 8 mg l for total and ammonia nitrogen respectively the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent fig 3e was comparable in both periods and was 0 1 2 2 mg tp l median 0 6 mg l and 0 3 2 0 mg tp l median 0 6 mg l for periods a and p respectively table 3 shows the percentage removal of organic nitrogen and phosphorus compounds obtained during the research period before and after the installation of the degassing technology the highest changes were observed in the case of nitrogen compounds however the improvement in the removal of organic and phosphorus compounds was also impressive the removal of organic compounds expressed as cod and bod was improved by over 2 in the case of nitrogen compounds the removal improvement was 5 and 8 for ammonia and total nitrogen respectively in the case of phosphorus compounds the average percentage of removal was almost 1 5 higher after applying the vdas technology the amounts of organic compounds the concentration of phosphates and the ammonium level increased as shown in fig 6 to take into account the differences in wastewater flow in individual periods the load of the most important parameters that flowed in and out of the biological reactor was calculated in kg d the changes in these parameters after the introduction of vdas compared to the period without using this technology are also shown in fig 6 the cod of the influent to the biological stage was higher by about 16 in the years after the introduction of the sludge degassing technology as a result the loading of the biological reactor with organic pollutants was about 4 higher in the years after modernization the bod value also increased with the increase in cod the change in the bod cod ratio however was not significant as a result of the introduction of the degassing technology and despite the higher organic load in the biological reactor cod effluent loading decreased compared to the period when the sludge was not degassed the same tendency was observed for nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the case of phosphorus its concentration in the influent of the biological reactor changed significantly and was higher by almost 20 in the 2 years after the introduction of the technology compared to the period of 2 years before its introduction the loading reaching the biological chamber was over 4 higher the average loading that drained out of the biological reactor was over 16 lower in the case of nitrogen compounds a higher concentration of ammonium nitrogen by about 7 5 and a slightly higher 0 9 total nitrogen concentration were observed however the ratio of bod to total nitrogen changed by 15 as a result of these changes in the quality of wastewater flowing into the biological reactor the nitrogen compound concentrations were slightly lower after installing the degassing technology in comparison to the analogous period without vdas technology in the period of sludge degassing p the ammonium and total nitrogen influent loadings were almost 4 and 9 5 lower respectively however the effluent loading of the biological reactor was considerably lower during the period of using the degassing technology in the case of ammonium nitrogen the loading of the effluent from the biological reactor was almost 72 lower and in the case of total nitrogen it was nearly 44 lower when compared to the period without the vdas technology 3 4 nutrient removal rate the specific sludge loading and removal rates were calculated table 4 to consider the different suspended solid concentration in each case the specific loading of the activated sludge before the usage of the degassing technology was higher than in the later years in comparison to period a the specific sludge loading in period p was reduced by 23 30 30 and 34 5 for cod p nh4 n and total n respectively in line with the results presented in table 3 the removal degree represented by a ratio of specific removal rate and loading rate showed better results obtained in period p the nitrogen gas produced during denitrification and entrapped within activated sludge flocs was evacuated by the degassing system to the air the enhanced ammonium removal can be explained by one or both of two routes for ammonium removal via a biological route of the nitrification or via the physical process of ammonia stripping due to the changes in the quantity and quality of the influent wastewater it is difficult to estimate whether both of these routes had an impact on the improvement of nitrogen removal efficiency and to what extent if the biological removal of nitrogen was improved it is not known whether this is the result of a change in the amount of bacteria in the bioreactor and the sludge age or the stimulation of bacteria due to the intermittent vacuum more research including modeling is planned to answer these questions in other laboratory studies 30 the application of a vacuum with the use of technological parameters at a similar level as those of the non vacuumed system did not contribute to a significant improvement in the efficiency of wastewater treatment these tests were conducted at room temperature due to the dependence of gas solubility on temperature the results of the above tests cannot be fully applied to the actual study where the wastewater temperature was dependent on the season and ranged from 10 1 22 6 c however based on these reports it can be assumed that in the discussed case the improvement in nitrogen removal was the result of degassing the activated sludge and the change in its amount in the bioreactor improving the removal rates of organic and phosphorus compounds is difficult to explain by the physical degassing process although gases extracted from treated wastewater and intercellular matrix may also contain other gases such as carbon dioxide the loss of this inorganic component would not affect the cod measurement similarly in the case of phosphorus compounds their removal from wastewater results from the incorporation of these compounds into cell biomass and not from metabolism to gaseous products thus the observed removal of organic compounds and phosphorus should have been biological in nature due to the changes in the technological parameters and the quality of influent wastewater it is suspected that the activated sludge biocenosis underwent reconstruction after the introduction of the vdas technology in related studies 18 31 during the degassing process of the sludge activated sludge flocs and bacterial cells underwent partial destruction when the pressure was lowered to 20 the bacterial cells were disintegrated 18 the disintegration of activated sludge may lead to a lower sludge increment 32 which was observed in the present case in the previously mentioned studies 18 31 no long term comparative tests were performed with systems without the vdas technology however the activated sludge from the tested wastewater treatment plant based on vdas had an exceptionally high proportion of live bacteria amounting to a minimum of 96 it was therefore suspected that the periodic disintegration of the activated sludge caused rejuvenation of the biocenosis and faster cell growth the biodiversity of the sludge is not the subject of the study but a difference in the share of the organic part of the biomass was recorded without vdas 64 9 10 5 of the activated sludge was organic volatile suspended solids vss whereas after the installation of vdas it decreased even in a statistically significant manner p 0 001 to 62 8 5 0 the organic matter content of activated sludge may be related to the accumulation of inorganic matter in the system 33 or to sludge age 34 the latter is consistent with the results obtained in the present case the increase in the age of the sludge after the introduction of the vdas was most likely the cause of the accumulation of non biodegradable residues in the activated sludge 34 and thus the reduction of the organic fraction in biomass however the effect of the disintegration of activated sludge on changes in the microbiome and sludge composition should be further investigated to compare the microbial activity at different periods absolute nutrient removal was calculated fig 7 the absolute nutrient removal was always lower in period p in comparison to period a the removal of cod by gram of sludge was lower by almost 9 while for nh4 n tn and tp it was 17 6 18 3 and 13 7 lower respectively because in the bioreactor a higher amount of biomass was involved in biological nutrients removal there were lower specific loadings and thus the bacterial activity could be lower furthermore a higher sludge retention time impedes microbial activity however the lower unit activity did not adversely affect the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment 3 5 seasonality statistical analysis this analysis included several parameters representing both the influent and effluent from the bioreactor as well as technological parameters characterizing the entire research periods and the individual seasons due to the geographical location of the treatment plant air temperature and consequently the temperature of the wastewater differed significantly among the seasons the average seasonal temperatures are given in table 5 according to henry s law 35 the amount of dissolved gas in a liquid is lower at lower pressures moreover in warm seasons the solubility of gases is lower 36 and the likelihood of their spontaneous passage to the atmosphere is higher therefore the effect of pressure reduction and nitrogen rich gas evacuation should be more pronounced in seasons characterized by low air temperature and thus by a lower temperature of the activated sludge mixed liquor table 6 presents the results of the statistical analysis where the statistically significant differences between different seasons of period a and p are represented by the fdr corrected p value lower than 0 05 the table shows that in the majority of cases the nutrient concentration in the inflowing wastewater in period p was significantly different from that in the influent in period a however due to the change in the amount of influent wastewater the change in the load of organic compounds and in phosphorus in particular seasons was not statistically significant the improvement of sludge settling was significant regardless of the season this resulted in a statistically significant change in the concentration of activated sludge in both the bioreactor and the recirculated sludge the improvement in settling ability did not result from a change in the degree of recirculation although in period p the recirculation degree was higher by a few percent than in period a these differences in most seasons were not statistically significant taking into account the fdr corrected p value the lowest values were observed for activated sludge concentration followed by svi and hrt for these parameters a relative standard deviation of less than 35 was found while the relative variability of the recirculation rate was over 120 this tendency was observed both across the entire research period and the individual seasons of the year in period p in each season the removal efficiencies for cod and tn were significantly different than those in the period without this system a in the case of phosphorus removal the statistically significant changes concerned seasons with extreme temperatures winter and summer such an improvement may rely on an increased sludge retention time which can increase nitrogen removal by denitrification since denitrifying microorganisms are heterotrophs improving the rate of denitrification also affects the removal of cod a similar consideration applies for the dephosphatation process in contrast the removal of ammonium nitrogen was statistically significant significantly different in colder periods winter and spring the equilibrium between ammonium and ammonia in water depends on the ph and temperature 37 in our bioreactor the ph ranged from 6 5 7 7 period a and from 5 8 to 7 4 period p at atmospheric pressure for this ph value the proportion of ammonia can range from 0 01 to 1 3 depending on the temperature 37 the solubility of ammonia rises with temperature 38 being lower in cold seasons than warmer months ammonia dissolution is enhanced by lowering the pressure during sludge degassing thus in the colder months higher ammonia stripping is expected surprisingly the change in the total nitrogen loading removed in each season and in the whole periods was not statistically significant the removal of total nitrogen is indicative of an ongoing denitrification process in which nitrites and nitrates are reduced to gaseous nitrogen volatiles the lack of statistical differences in tn removal suggests that the significant changes observed in the case of organic compound removal were rather connected to dephosphatation than to denitrification the aim of the degassing installation is to remove gaseous products originated from cellular metabolism because if trapped in activated sludge flocs they slow down the sludge settling processes as shown by the results of the statistical tests this release is not however significantly higher than the release that occurs spontaneously during the sedimentation process in the secondary settling tank without degassing technology however the place where the gaseous products are removed throughout the technological path is important for the sludge settling ability better settling properties made it possible to increase the concentration of biomass in the bioreactor and to further improve the wastewater treatment process 4 conclusions the main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are that the sludge degassing improves the sludge volume index by about 30 as a consequence a higher biomass concentration may be sustained in the bioreactor the treatment system can thus run with higher sludge retention times higher average percentage removals and removal rates and lower sludge production per organic compound removed were obtained in a vacuum degassing based system than without this technology the obtained wastewater treatment improvement resulted from a change in technological parameters such as an increased amount of biomass in the bioreactor and an extended sludge age and not from the vacuum stimulation of activated sludge bacteria however there is need for more in depth research focused on the influence of vacuum on the activity of bacteria and on biocenosis composition

13536,this study aimed to investigate the performance of a sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor sb mbbr for biological p removal bio p treating diluted municipal wastewater at 10 c and 20 c with volatile fatty acid vfa dosing during weekdays and without vfa dosing during weekends to simulate an industrial influenced wastewater the overall results revealed that phosphorus removal efficiency for weekdays reached 53 and 81 at cold and moderated temperatures respectively however phosphorus removal efficiency for the weekend was 49 for cold temperature and 52 for moderate temperature it was concluded that low temperature and low vfa might have suppressed the phosphate accumulating organisms paos performance besides high extracellular polymeric substance eps production might have hampered the paos activity which could be linked to the observed high consumption of soluble chemical oxygen demand scod to p release ratio and thick biomass growth in the cold system keywords biological phosphorus removal moving bed biofilm reactor phosphorus accumulating organisms temperature volatile fatty acid 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential macronutrient for all forms of life and is a prerequisite for modern agriculture however it is prone to depletion as it belongs to one of the non renewable natural resources 1 the global p price increase the need to comply with stringent discharge requirements and the demand to implement more sustainable process solutions made enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr an economically and environmentally attractive process 2 currently ebpr is increasingly being implemented due to the growing interest to capture and recycle p from wastewater for many years most of the research activities on biological p bio p removal has been conducted based on the activated sludge processes 3 4 compared to the activated sludge system an mbbr process retains more biomass without sludge recirculation and thereby reduce problems related to biomass loss 5 besides it is commonly believed that the mbbr can withstand concentration variations and it can tolerate changes in temperature of raw wastewater 5 despite the number of available publications based on mbbr processes a limited number of studies have been conducted to address the potential of using a sb mbbr for bio p removal from wastewater under challenging operational conditions such as low temperature and low vfa 6 the bio p removal is achieved by a specific group of microorganisms commonly known as phosphate accumulating organisms paos which are responsible for a surplus amount of phosphorus uptake compared to what is required for their metabolic activities this surplus is considered as a luxury p uptake 7 under anaerobic conditions paos consume vfa with the aid of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate atp and generate an intermediate polyhydroxy β alkanoate pha 8 the paos get their energy requirement from an external carbon source intracellular polyphosphate poly p degradation and atp destruction to adenosine diphosphate concurrently phosphate ions and counter cations calcium magnesium and potassium are released to the bulk 9 furthermore metabolic conversion of glycogen into polyhydroxyl valerate phv and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide also provide energy to paos 10 11 during aerobic conditions pha is oxidized and used as an energy source for p uptake poly p formation cell growth and production of glycogen 8 12 in general internally stored pha poly p and glycogen play a major role in p removal mechanisms 12 operational parameters such as temperature hydraulic retention time hrt variations in the influent wastewater concentrations particularly the vfa types of carbon source and ph have shown to affect the efficiency of ebpr 13 14 among these parameters the availability of the appropriate types of carbon sources and temperature are considered as the key operational parameters influencing the bio p process performance 15 norwegian wastewater is generally considered to be highly influenced by high precipitation rain and snow fall which results in large variability in the composition of municipal wastewater discharge the runoff water and snow melting infiltration results in the dilution of wastewater and this in turn reduces the temperature of the wastewater significantly no systematic studies on the composition of norwegian wastewater have been conducted in the past even though significant amounts of data from certain plants are available 16 for instance rusten et al 5 have shown that the typical value of scod in the municipal wastewater they have treated was below 100 mg scod l during the winter period further carrera et al 2001 reported that the influent c p ratio of 41 mg p mg c is required to achieve efficient ebpr in activated sludge systems on the other hand different ranges of temperatures have been investigated to study how they affect the ebpr process previous studies showed that paos have a competitive advantage over glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in ebpr operated system at 10 c 15 17 in contrast it was reported that high temperatures 24 32 c promoted and improved the performance of ebpr in activated sludge systems 18 the ebpr is a well developed wastewater treatment technology as it has been well researched 7 19 20 however the impact of temperature and vfa on an sb mbbr bio p process is not well documented this is particularly the case when the mbbr bio p process is operated with real municipal wastewater which is influenced by industrial wastewater moreover there is a fundamental knowledge gap concerning the effect of alternating external vfa supply during weekdays and weekends regarding the sb mbbr bio p organisms response therefore this study aimed to investigate the performance of the mbbr bio p system treating diluted municipal wastewater at 10 c and 20 c with vfa dosing during weekdays and without vfa dosing during weekends to simulate an industrial influenced municipal wastewater the specific objectives of this study include 1 investigating the effects of vfa concentrations and variations in vfa on sb mbbr bio p processes during weekdays and weekends 2 quantifying the performance and capability of the paos developed under steady state conditions it is hypothesized that a minor increase in vfa concentration 50 mg scod l during weekdays is enough to maintain a stable bio p performance at both 10 c and 20 c temperature systems this study was conducted by simulating a diluted actual municipal wastewater with a minor contribution of industrial wastewater the results of this study can be used for a bio p system treating industrial influenced municipal wastewater where enough vfa is expected during weekdays due to industrial activity and vfa limitation during weekends less industrial wastewater discharge a typical norwegian municipal wastewater is diluted has a significantly low temperature as explained earlier and the wastewater is aerated with relatively high dissolved oxygen do increased organic loading from the food processing industry will increase the chance of vfa production by fermentation of biodegradable organic matter this means the food processing industry discharges wastewater with relatively high biodegradable organic matter concentrations a potential source of vfa for the bio p processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 composition of municipal wastewater and operational conditions table 1 shows the overall characteristics of raw municipal wastewater the municipal wastewater was stored in a tank which receives a steady supply of raw wastewater from a nearby municipal sewer every hour the storage tank had a total volume of 3 5 m3 which ensured an uninterrupted supply of wastewater while maintaining enough variability in influent wastewater quality controlling the storage tank residence time ensured enough variability in the influent wastewater composition the fresh wastewater undergoes primary treatment by passing through a fine sieve to remove large particles before the sb mbbr reactor was fed a 200 l stainless steel tank was filled with fresh wastewater every day from the main storage tank to feed the pilot sb mbbr reactors this tank serves as a backup in case of pump maintenance downtime or low wastewater in the sewer no or little vfa production due to fermentation was expected in the storage tanks two sequence batch reactors with a working volume of 14 7 l each including carrier volume were operated at 10 c called cold reactor hereafter and 20 c called moderate reactor hereafter for a period of 213 days with the supply of vfa 50 mg scod l during weekdays and without vfa supply during weekends in the beginning the sb mbbr reactors were operated under anaerobic aerobic conditions without vfa supply at cold and moderate temperatures for 17 days on weekdays and weekends these measurements were excluded from the average values presented in tables 1 and 3 the sb mbbr contains the standard biofilm carriers kaldnes k1 with a 61 filling degree 21 a refrigerator and an aquarium heater were used to maintain the temperature of the reactors at 10 and 20 c respectively table 2 shows the operational conditions of the reactors a simplified drawing of the reactor is shown in fig 1 the biofilm attachment on the carriers was ensured by exposing the carriers to the aerobic conditions after this the reactors were operated in an anaerobic aerobic cyclic process with three cycles per day each 8 h hydraulic retention time consisting of 3 25 h in the anaerobic phase and 4 75 h in the aerobic phase this included 3 min filling and 3 min emptying time at the beginning of the anaerobic phase nitrogen gas was purged dissolved oxygen do 0 02 mg l during the aerobic phase air was purged do 2 8 mg l to make the do level in the reactors in the desired range both to ensure the movement of the biofilm carriers and to avoid settling of the detached biomass suspended solids the systems were mechanically mixed using a custom made mixer for the entire cycle period during aerobic and anaerobic phases with a mixing speed of 100 rotations per minute the system cyclic sequence was controlled by a custom made micro controller equipped with a display and data storage unit 2 2 kinetic studies 2 2 1 parent reactors the parent reactor kinetic studies were conducted during weekdays thursday or friday with a constant vfa supply 50 mg scod l the kinetic studies p release p uptake and scod consumption were conducted from the early stages of the biomass development until the sb mbbr bio p reactor showed steady state performance for a moderate temperature operation and semi steady state performance for a cold temperature operation 2 2 2 bench scale experiments the bench scale experiment aimed at quantifying the performance and capability of paos developed under steady state operations the quantification of the p release and uptake potential of the biomass adapted to low vfa dosing 50 mg scod l was evaluated by exposing the biomass to lower and higher vfa dosing on the bench scale experiment after the steady state performance was established with a constant supply of vfa 50 mg scod l during weekdays monday to friday and without vfa addition during weekends saturday and sunday a series of bench scale kinetic studies were conducted in separate batch reactors laboratory scale reactor with 2 5 l working volume to carry out kinetic studies the biomass carriers were collected from the parent reactors on thursdays and fridays when the reactors were under stable moderate temperature and semi stable cold temperature operations with low vfa supply 50 mg scod l for the bench scale experiment five different vfa dosing 0 25 50 100 and 300 mg l as scod were examined all other feeds and operational conditions were identical to that of the parent reactors the short term effect of temperature was also studied by exposing the cold adapted biomass to moderate temperature conditions and moderate temperature adapted biomass to cold temperature conditions on bench scale experiments these experiments were conducted to evaluate the p release p uptake and scod consumption of the paos adapted to low vfa dosing 50 mg scod l for such experiments 300 mg l scod was added to avoid carbon limitation 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 chemical analysis the sb mbbr bio p activity was studied with vfa dosing 50 mg scod l during weekdays and without vfa dosing during weekends the development of the systems was monitored daily for ph do temperature scod nh4 n po4 p and no3 n grab samples were collected during the entire cycle 8 h every 0 5 h for kinetic studies samples were filtered immediately through 0 45 μm filters the concentrations of scod orthophosphate po4 p ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were measured using dr lange cuvette using hach lange gmbh dr 1900 china spectrophotometer all the analyses were performed immediately during the cycle test 2 3 2 biomass analysis biofilm carriers were sampled once every two weeks for total biomass determination as total suspended solids g tss m2 or g tss l following the procedure described by 22 the biomass total p content mg total p mg tss was also determined every week on fridays following the standard method 23 the detached biomass surplus sludge suspended solids and the treated wastewater were completely drained between each cycle and discharged into the drainage line however the sludge was collected and used when needed for experiments or analyses 2 4 mathematical model of kinetic and stoichiometric parameters during scod utilization several models explaining the kinetics of substrate consumption for biomass growth exist in the wastewater treatment literature 24 26 most models use the monod equation to explain the kinetics of biological processes however alternative concepts such as linear substrate removal kinetics 27 have also been used to describe biological processes a comparison between the first and second order kinetics has been presented in 28 fractional order kinetics explaining the substrate removal kinetics in biological systems have also been reported in the literature 29 in the current work a generic form of the nth order kinetics eq 1 was used to describe the substrate consumption in the sb mbbrs the order of reaction and the rate constants are obtained by fitting the equation with data obtained from the kinetic experiment performed in the sb mbbrs in the nth order kinetic model 29 the rate of substrate utilization in the model is presented in eq 1 1 dc dt k n c n where c is substrate concentration kn is rate constant for the nth order substrate removal model and n is reaction order the optimization procedure involving minimization of the error function 30 31 is used to fit the experimental data to the nth order kinetic model eq 1 and obtain rate constant k n and reaction order n the optimization problem statement is presented in eq 2 2 f obj k n n i 1 n c l a b i c mod e l i k n n 2 l b k n n u b min k n n f obj k n n the experimental measurements of scod are presented as clab i and the model predicted value of scod was represented as cmodel i the term i represents the time index of experimental measurements and n is the total number of samples collected during the kinetic study the model output was obtained by numerically integrating eq 1 the lower bounds lb and upper bound ub for the parameters kn n were 0 0 and 10 5 respectively the initial guess of the parameters was kn0 0 05 and n0 1 the optimization problem presented in eq 2 was solved using the non linear programming solver fmincon provided by matlab the interior point algorithm was chosen to minimize the objective function and obtain the optimal values of the kinetic parameters 3 results and discussions 3 1 overall sb mbbr bio p performances to ensure an indiscriminate biomass attachment on the carrier media the parent reactors were operated for more than 70 days under aeration conditions at room temperature and with fresh wastewater supply every day after this the reactors were operated under anaerobic aerobic conditions without vfa supply both on weekdays and weekends at cold and moderate temperatures for 17 days see fig 2 a this was done to explore the development of bio p activity without vfa dosing at cold and moderate temperatures however no or very little bio p activity was observed in both cold and moderate reactors fig 2a suggesting the need for an external vfa source after this the sb mbbr was monitored for 213 days to observe the performance of paos activity in cold and moderate temperature systems with monday to friday and without vfa supply saturday and sunday the effect of vfa availability on paos performance was explored with low vfa supply 50 mg scod l during weekdays and without vfa supply raw wastewater during weekends at cold and moderate temperatures vfa dosing was started on day 17 and it was observed that paos behavior that consists of anaerobic scod uptake anaerobic p release and aerobic p uptake prevailed 3 days after the vfa dosing was started in the moderate reactor on day 28 58 p removal was observed in the moderate reactor while lower bio p activity 22 p removal was observed in the cold reactor see fig 2a the average values 213 days of the regular chemical analysis show clear differences in the p removal performance between the reactors operated at cold and moderate temperatures table 3 the moderate temperature operated reactor displayed a good average po4 p removal efficiency 81 compared to the cold temperature operated reactor 53 during weekdays table 3 both cold 49 and moderate 52 temperature operated reactors showed lower bio p activities during weekends when vfa dosing temporarily stopped in the moderate temperature operated reactor when the system reached steady state performance the effluent p concentration was always below 0 5 mg l from day 136 195 see fig 2a both on weekdays and weekends except one incidence on day 197 the observed stable operation could be due to the biomass s ability to store a high pha at a moderate temperature this storage product was able to support the bio p performance during weekends where no vfa was supplied this situation was observed after long term operation during the summer period due to less wastewater dilution effect relatively higher biodegradable organic matter than the winter period and increased wastewater temperature however the cold reactor showed large variation in the effluent p concentrations during weekdays and weekends for the entire operational period fig 2a it was observed that effluent po4 p concentration peaked up see fig 2a in both cold and moderate reactors when the vfa supply temporarily stopped during the weekends this indicated that the biomass contained insufficient stored pha to perform bio p activity during weekends the moderate temperature operated reactor performance was stable from wednesdays to fridays in most cases this indicates the need for a carbon source addition for stable bio p operation during weekends this finding agrees with the work of brdjanovic et al 32 that have observed increased p in the effluent on mondays in some full scale treatment plants brdjanovic et al 32 also observed deterioration of the ebpr after heavy rainfall occurrences since pha in the cell exhausts as a result of prolonged aeration similarly in the current study during heavy rainfall and snow melting events both the cold and moderate temperatures operated reactors showed deteriorated bio p performance only one time incident on day 89 90 see fig 2a after this event an unstable operation was observed from day 100 107 in the moderate temperature operated reactor which recovered faster than the cold reactor fig 2a similarly the moderate temperature operated reactor showed an excellent nitrification efficiency nh4 n conversion to nitrite and nitrate with more than 99 5 during weekdays and weekends whereas the cold reactor demonstrated large variations with more than 45 for weekdays and weekend table 3 and fig 2b the lower nh4 n oxidation at cold temperature operation might be linked to the reduced relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria as they are sensitive to cold temperatures 33 nitrogen removal was estimated based on influent nh4 n and effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n fig 2b and c by neglecting hydrolysis and assimilation in both reactors poor nitrogen removal efficiencies due to denitrification were observed 30 during weekdays and 20 during weekends see table 3 the possible reason could be vfa limitation might inhibit denitrifying paos dpaos performance or high do level increased the likelihood for oxygen to penetrate the thin biofilm layer in the moderate temperature reactor and thereby inhibiting dpaos performance similarly insufficient vfa may affect the dpaos performance or thick biofilm growth in the cold system restricted no3 diffusion previous study showed that denitrifying bacteria residing in the deep layer utilize the nitrate produced under aerobic condition and hence denitrification occurs 34 generally the moderate temperature operated reactor performed better than the cold reactor for all the parameters monitored for the entire operational period except for the scod removal where no differences were observed for both cold and moderate temperatures fig 2d the removal potential is proportional to the biomass concentration which in the sb mbbr process is related to the thickness of the biofilm 35 the total attached biomass concentration of the system was 12 1 3 0 g tss m2 3 7 0 9 g tss l and 16 3 5 3 g tss m2 5 1 1 6 g tss l for the moderate and cold temperatures respectively table 3 the biomass p content was also monitored for the experimental period and it was found to be 0 9 0 7 g total p m2 0 07 0 04 as g total p g tss for moderate temperature operated reactor and 0 7 0 2 g total p m2 0 04 0 01 as g total p g tss for the cold temperature operated reactor table 3 a thicker biomass was observed at low temperatures likely because the growth rate of biofilm is slower and it leads to denser and more compact biofilms which in turn lead to less detachment of the biofilm compaction of the biofilm might occur due to changes in internal pore structure and the microorganism s self aggregation properties 36 furthermore a previous study documented that high production of eps polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids occurs under cold temperature operations 37 the eps could provide mechanical stability to biofilm mediate its adhesion to the surface and form a cohesive three dimensional polymer network that interconnects biofilm cells and therefore the biomass is less prone to the shear forces caused by mixing and less biomass detachment 38 the thick biomass growth and high eps production might have hindered the diffusion of molecules such as oxygen essential for oxidation of pha for cell growth and nitrification process for efficient pao activities a previous study showed that high eps production was observed at 5 c and the possible explanation for such high eps production could be due to environmental stress as a result of cold temperature 37 similar to the current study a previous study demonstrated that thick biofilm growth could reduce cell development and bioactivity in the system 39 it could be speculated that cold operational temperature combined with low vfa might be unfavorable for the typical microbial community developed in the current study system when two factors low temperature and vfa limitation influence the process simultaneously it is difficult to draw a strong conclusion where the effect was originated however it is important to note that p uptake during aerobic condition is mainly governed by the storage product pha in the biofilm under the anaerobic stage indicating the mass of new paos formed depends on the mass of the stored pha 4 40 the current study demonstrated the existence of bio p organisms in both cold and moderate temperature operated reactors the findings from this study have shown that the bio p activities are affected by limitation of vfa during weekends in both cold and moderate temperature operated reactors however the cold reactor is affected the most it is not clear why the cold reactor performed poorer compared to the moderate reactor during both weekdays and weekends therefore further investigations are needed to explain whether low temperature eps production biomass sensitivity to low vfa or a combination of those factors are the most important ones this study provides useful information for wastewater treatment plants receiving some vfa during weekdays due to industrial activities but lower vfa during weekends lesser industrial activities 3 2 kinetic study in the parent reactors the kinetic studies were conducted after a steady state moderate reactor and semi steady state cold reactor performances were observed a typical data of the cycles of the kinetic studies is shown in fig 3 a and b the p release was assessed as a primary and secondary release the primary release took place when the scod was available while the secondary p release occurred when all the scod was consumed by the biomass the secondary p release occurred due to the consumption of the fermentation products which was slow and could not be controlled and the average values are presented in table 4 the concept of primary and secondary p release was adapted from 41 in both moderate and cold temperature reactors all the available scod both acetic acid dosed and the acetic acid present in the raw wastewater as scod were consumed rapidly in the first 0 5 h fig 3a and b the primary po4 p release rate and the secondary p release rate respectively were found to be 0 3 g po4 p g tss l h and 0 01 g po4 p g tss l h for moderate temperature operated reactor table 4 the po4 p released to scod consumed was found to be 0 3 mg po4 p mg scod ratio based on the total p release and scod consumed in 3 h but the primary p release to scod uptake ratio was 0 2 mg po4 p mg scod table 4 this result agrees with the study of brdjanovic et al 32 where 0 29 g p g cod was found in the anaerobic phase during the aerobic conditions the biomass also showed a rapid po4 p uptake rate in the moderate temperature reactor 0 06 g po4 p g tss l h table 4 all the p released in the moderate reactor was taken up in less than 2 h aerobic phase resulting in 0 05 mg po4 p l in the effluent fig 3b the cold operated reactor showed a primary p release rate of 0 1 g po4 p g tss l h and a secondary p release rate of 0 01 g po4 p g tss l h a total of 18 2 0 9 mg po4 p l was released with 0 1 mg po4 p released mg scod consumed ratio for both primary and secondary p release and scod uptake in 3 h anaerobic retention time table 4 this result is different from a previous study conducted by li et al 15 that they observed 55 mg l po4 p release in 1 h anaerobic retention time in the sb activated sludge system at 10 c however it is very difficult to make such a comparison without more information about the system the differences could be explained by the quality of the biomass developed the type of biofilm processes activated sludge versus moving bed biofilm mixing speed do level the variation in influent wastewater composition the thickness of the biomass grown due to eps production and other operational conditions in addition mulkerrins et al 42 indicated that specific p release clearly decreases when the temperature decreases with sludge activity being influenced by a quick shift in temperature which is consistent with the current study that the p uptake rate was also slow 0 01 g po4 p g tss l h table 4 with the final effluent concentration of 2 5 0 9 mg po4 p l after 5 h aerobic phase in the cold reactor fig 3a at the end of the aerobic phase 1 0 1 0 mg no2 n l and 27 3 2 7 mg no3 n l were measured in the moderate temperature reactor table 4 as a result nitrogen removal efficiency due to denitrification was estimated to be 35 1 0 4 table 4 below 2 mg l effluent nh4 n concentration was measured in less than 3 5 h aerobic phase of the moderate reactor fig 3b however 3 7 0 1 mg no2 n l and 6 5 mgno3 n l table 4 were measured in the cold reactor the resulting nitrogen removal efficiency was estimated to be 27 2 0 02 table 4 high effluent nh4 n concentration was measured 20 mg nh4 n l in the cold reactor at the end of the aerobic phase this result differs from the previous study where nitrogen removal efficiency of 89 6 was achieved in the activated sludge system at 10 c 15 as has been discussed earlier compact and dense biomass growth and low detachment of the biomass due to slow growth rate as a result of the cold temperature could be possible reasons for such differences as compared with previous studies furthermore thick biofilm growth results in lower diffusion of oxygen and no3 and the selected operating temperature might have hindered the paos growth as well as ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria growth 33 gieger and rauch 56 indicated that in thick biofilms the deeper layer contains inactive biomass which may not provide significant benefits these authors suggest that optimum substrate diffusion could be achieved with a 0 5 mm biofilm thickness in addition the p uptake might be influenced by the pha composition poly hydroxy butyrate phb and phv in the system at the beginning of the aerobic phase a higher fraction of phb is known to result in higher p uptake which is observed in the pao dominated bio p systems 41 the production of phb depends on the influent wastewater composition and the microbial community composition in the system the eps are also known to contribute to extracellular phosphorus removal especially at cold temperatures 37 in the current study the limited p uptake and higher scod consumption per p released in the cold reactor might also be attributed to the eps production it has been documented that eps could serve as p sink due to its adsorptive properties 43 the sb mbbr bio p process demonstrated distinct behaviors on p release and uptake under cold and moderate temperature conditions however the result showed that the cold temperature and low vfa affected the cold system more than the moderate temperature operated reactor therefore it is proposed that the ebpr plant operators should be aware of this situation and apply vfa dosing during weekends to achieve stable operation 3 3 effects of vfa concentration on po4 p release and uptake the bench scale kinetic studies were conducted to quantify the effects of vfa on the p release and uptake of biomass enriched at low vfa dosing 50 mg scod l during weekdays only once the parent reactors reached a stable and semi stable performance for moderate and cold temperature reactors respectively batch activity studies were performed with the supply of different vfa concentrations varied between 0 300 mg scod l the influent po4 p was adjusted to 17 8 20 2 mg po4 p l for both cold and moderate temperature reactors for all the vfa dosing investigated very good p releases were observed at moderate temperature r2 0 9962 fig 4 c with increasing scod consumption and good total po4 p released and uptake was also observed r2 0 9935 fig 4d whereas the cold reactor exhibited relatively poor p releases r2 0 9739 fig 4a for all scod concentrations tested except for 300 mg scod l the cold reactor also showed lower total po4 p release and uptake r2 0 9256 than the moderate reactor fig 4b in the moderate temperature reactor po4 p release varied between 15 5 101 9 mg po4 p l fig 4d while the p release varied between 17 3 23 7 mg po4 p l fig 4b for the cold reactor the ratio of po4 p released to scod consumed ranged between 0 17 0 26 mg po4 p released mg scod consumed 3 91 4 73 mg scod consumed mg po4 p released in the moderate temperature reactor and 0 01 0 11 mg po4 p mg scod 9 48 13 54 mg scod consumed mg po4 p released for the cold reactor literature review revealed that the metabolism of activated sludge is considered to be gao dominated metabolism if the ratio of p release to scod uptake is lower than 0 25 mg p mg scod intermediate gao pao metabolism if this ratio is between 0 25 to 0 50 mg p mg scod and pao dominated metabolism if the ratio is more than 0 50 mg p mg scod for the system operated at ph 7 and 20 c 44 however it is difficult to consider the p release to scod consumption ratio as a general indicator for the sb mbbr bio p systems as it is possible to achieve a good p removal with lower p release to scod consumption ratios with low vfa dosing at 20 c as the result of this study shows the cold reactor showed poor correlation for p uptake versus p release r2 0 9256 thus it is not possible to obtain a proportionality constant fig 4b the biomass continued to release po4 p during anaerobic conditions with increasing vfa however the biomass seems to have a limited po4 p uptake capacity in the cold system as negative p uptake was observed at higher vfa dosing 300 mg scod l possible reasons for this might be factors like eps production thick biomass low temperature etc affecting the system in the moderate reactor aerobic p uptake and anaerobic p release showed a strong correlation r2 0 9935 fig 4d compared to the cold operated reactor similar to this study pastorelli et al 6 observed a direct correlation between p release vs p uptake but with a lower proportionality constant 1 055 g p taken up g p released where 1 25 g p taken up g p released was observed at 20 c fig 4d in the current study high phosphate release is beneficial to achieve a high net p uptake which depends on the amount of pha stored in the cell which is directly linked to p release under anaerobic conditions 34 the net p uptake varied between 7 3 17 8 mg po4 p l in the moderate temperature reactor on the other hand the net p uptake in the cold reactor varied between 0 9 7 8 mg po4 p l but negative p uptake was observed at 300 mg scod l dosing the moderate operated reactor also showed a better net p release 101 9 mg po4 p l and net p uptake 17 8 mg po4 p l in the moderate reactor the high effluent concentrations 1 3 4 0 mg po4 p l observed in all bench scale experiments could be explained by the high influent po4 p literature review revealed that overdosing of vfa may not be good for bio p activities because it may lead to the proliferation of unwanted microbial communities such as gaos 32 however since the parent reactors both cold and moderate temperature reactors were run under low vfa conditions the gao dominance may not be expected in one time high vfa dosing on the bench scale experiment nevertheless if external carbon dosing is required in a full scale wastewater treatment plan the operators are advised to estimate the proper amount of vfa and avoid overdosing to prevent the gaos proliferation 45 these bench scale studies showed that the parent reactors operational conditions could be further optimized in terms of vfa dosing do level and temperature as the effect could originate from a combination of the different operational conditions the influent nh4 n concentration was not adjusted and it was in the range of 38 0 39 1 mg l for cold and 33 8 45 7 mg l for the moderate reactors the sb mbbr operated at 20 c showed 100 nitrification efficiency and nitrogen removal efficiency in the range of 21 2 47 7 the denitrification was inhibited probably due to high oxygen penetration however the cold operated system showed lower nitrification efficiency 62 6 75 8 and higher 41 6 56 7 nitrogen removal efficiency compared to the moderate temperature reactor a previous study suggested that due to low do levels in the activated sludge system the dpaos utilizing the no3 as an electron acceptor in a deeper layer of the bio flocs seemed to contribute to simultaneous nitrification denitrification and bio p removal 15 in the current study this seemed to have happened to a larger extent in the cold reactor than in the moderate reactor it is suggested to optimize aeration to improve the denitrification process in the moderate reactors by reducing the do level in such a way that it does not hinder the nitrification process in the system a study showed that nitrification is the most temperature sensitive step among the biological processes in the wastewater treatment 46 other study has shown that a sudden temperature change can prevent proper functioning of the bacteria protein damage the outer cell membrane and or make it gel like which could result in decreased oxygen transfer rate 47 it is assumed that the cold reactor might have contained relatively higher dpaos compared to the moderate reactor since the estimated nitrogen removal efficiency was relatively higher in the cold reactor this finding suggests the need for further optimization of the operational parameters of the sb mbbr reactors to achieve a better bio p performance efficiency the effluent concentrations of scod po4 p nh4 n no2 n and no3 n of the bench scale kinetic studies are shown in table 5 3 4 kinetics of scod consumption in bench scale experiments the experimental results of scod consumption in the sb mbbr were evaluated using nth order kinetics for both cold and moderate temperature operated reactors the concentration of the scod and hrt were considered as governing parameters for the scod utilization in the reactors it was assumed that the biomass concentration in the system is constant table 2 according to the kinetic studies the kinetic coefficients obtained from anaerobic scod removal from the municipal wastewater strongly fits a reaction with an order of 1 50 table 6 a rate constant of 2 02 mg l day was obtained for the sb mbbr for both cold and moderate temperature conditions table 6 a comparison between the experimental data and the model predicted values are presented in fig 5 and table 6 the r2 values are 0 869 and 0 824 for the reactor operation at moderate and cold temperature conditions respectively however it seems there is some bias in the model at zero and lower vfa dosing where the model describes the experimental data less accurate as it can be seen in fig 5a and b this could be due to the importance of the availability of scod at lower concentrations a quantitative comparison between the model presented in this work and the first and second order model described in borghei et al 28 based on root mean square error rmse is presented in table 6 a lower rmse value for the model with a reaction order 1 50 implies that the fractional order model better explains the scod consumption in the sb mbbr compared to a first or a second order model the higher r2 value for the moderate reactor was also an indication for the model fit table 6 3 5 effect of temperature on bio p removal this study also investigated the effect of short term change of temperature on the behavior of biomass scod consumption p release and uptake the biomass carriers were collected from cold and moderate temperature operated reactors with low vfa dosing 50 mg scod l bench scale experiments were conducted against the temperature of the parent reactors the biomass was collected when the systems were at a stable moderate reactor and semi stable cold reactor performance as illustrated in fig 6 the behavior of paos on p removal was similar to other ebpr study results that showed paos were enriched in both cold and moderate temperature operated systems 11 41 48 the results of the current study have shown that short term exposure of cold adapted biomass to a moderate temperature and the moderate temperature adapted biomass to cold temperature did not affect the po4 p release and uptake behavior of the biomass but slower scod consumption and nitrification rates were observed on the bench scale experiments fig 6a b this means that the moderate reactor biomass exposed to cold temperature still behaves like the parent moderate reactor and the cold reactor biomass exposed to the moderate temperature still behaved like the parent cold reactor the ratio of po4 p released to scod consumed was the same as the parent reactors a better p uptake was observed in a moderate temperature adapted biomass exposed to cold temperature than a cold adapted biomass exposed to moderate temperature the poor and negative po4 p uptake observed in cold adapted biomass exposed to moderate temperature is the same as observed in the parent cold reactor as explained further up in the text to see the relationship between the bio p removal performance of the current and other studies that considered the effect of temperature type and source of external carbon comparative results are shown in table 7 a study shows that temperature influence metabolic activities and the diversity of microorganisms 37 in addition several studies have demonstrated the effect of temperature on bio p and it showed that paos are able to cope at high and low temperature conditions 17 18 37 49 the current finding showed that at cold temperature the paos did not function well in the parent reactor weekdays and poor p removal on bench scale experiments even with vfa supply the finding of this study is somewhat inconsistent with the study of lopez vazquez et al 17 where they indicated that paos have a competitive advantage over gaos at lower temperature condition 10 c and therefore beneficial for capturing surplus po4 p in the wastewater but in the current study the gao pao competition was not studied however such differences in the results could be due to variations in the wastewater composition the type of carbon sources chosen vfa fractions in the wastewater and the development of dense and compact biomass hindering the falling of the biomass due to high eps production under cold operation but also hrt ph and other reactor operational parameters may play a role moreover in an activated sludge system it is important to remove a portion of sludge at certain sludge retention times which is not applicable in the sb mbbr process in the current study the moderate temperature sb mbbr reactor resulted in higher p removal efficiency on weekdays the differences between cold and moderate temperature operation results might originate from environmental stress created due to cold temperatures in the parent reactor mulkerrins et al 42 observed that the specific p release rate decreases clearly with decreasing temperature 20 15 c showing sludge activity being influenced by temperature shift the authors indicated that paos are lower range mesophilic or psychrophilic organisms which proliferate and become predominant only at 20 c or lower 42 their finding agrees with the findings of the current study where the p release at 10 c is much lower than that of 20 c operated reactor the p removal efficiency obtained in this study at moderate temperature is lower than that of the previously mentioned studies table 7 however the sb mbbr bio p reactor showed great flexibility and reliability rapid bio p activities were observed when vfa dosing was commenced no clogging experience no biomass accumulation in the reactors and the samples were easy to filter it has been documented that compared to the activated sludge systems the sb mbbr system showed resistance to shocking volumetric load and huge organic matter loading rate low maintenance requirement high specific biofilm surface area less head loss no backwashing requirement compact system less requirement of final sludge separation no clogging challenges and financial saving in terms of sludge handling and discharge cost 21 50 51 bio p studies have been conducted using different types of vfa which include acetate 20 41 propionate 48 a combination of acetate and propionate 17 as the sole carbon source table 7 the dependency or picky nature of paos on external carbon source made the ebpr process to be inefficient in wastewater treatment processes this is because the p removal is highly dependent on the amount of the pha stored under anaerobic conditions which is directly related to the influent readily biodegradable organic carbon level and sources 17 41 the ratio of influent scod to p is another factor determining the performance of ebpr processes experimental data of pastorelli et al 6 showed that the influent scod p ratio varied between 10 7 and 20 0 for the three experimental phases they have considered in the current study the influent scod p ratio varied between 38 and 36 low scod consumed to po4 p released ratio 9 7 mol c mol po4 p or 0 1 mol p released to c consumed was observed in the moderate reactor the higher scod consumed per po4 p release 23 9 mol scod mol po4 p or 0 04 mol p released c consumed value in the cold system could be due to the low poly p stored in the biomass the p content of the biomass in the moderate reactor was higher than that of the cold reactor table 7 a previous study suggested that poly p storage levels and gao like metabolism are important factors affecting the competition between different pao types in ebpr 54 other study showed that differences in vfa uptake at different operational temperatures were of great importance in determining whether a particular system is pao enriched or not 55 these types of studies were not conducted in our sb mbbr bio p processes and it is recommended to investigate the effect of gaos and paos interaction as the change in pha composition will determine whether the system is pao or gao dominated 54 4 conclusions an average of 81 and 53 p removal at 20 and 10 c respectively were obtained using the sb mbbr bio p process treating industrial influenced diluted municipal wastewater the reactor operated at 20 c showed better long term performance during weekdays and weekends compared to 10 c reactor long term operation of the reactors showed that short term changes in vfa during weekends affected the bio p activities in both 10 and 20 c resulting in lower p removal efficiency high vfa consumption per po4 p release ratio and thick biomass was observed at 10 c which could be linked to high eps production inhibiting paos performance declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13536,this study aimed to investigate the performance of a sequencing batch moving bed biofilm reactor sb mbbr for biological p removal bio p treating diluted municipal wastewater at 10 c and 20 c with volatile fatty acid vfa dosing during weekdays and without vfa dosing during weekends to simulate an industrial influenced wastewater the overall results revealed that phosphorus removal efficiency for weekdays reached 53 and 81 at cold and moderated temperatures respectively however phosphorus removal efficiency for the weekend was 49 for cold temperature and 52 for moderate temperature it was concluded that low temperature and low vfa might have suppressed the phosphate accumulating organisms paos performance besides high extracellular polymeric substance eps production might have hampered the paos activity which could be linked to the observed high consumption of soluble chemical oxygen demand scod to p release ratio and thick biomass growth in the cold system keywords biological phosphorus removal moving bed biofilm reactor phosphorus accumulating organisms temperature volatile fatty acid 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential macronutrient for all forms of life and is a prerequisite for modern agriculture however it is prone to depletion as it belongs to one of the non renewable natural resources 1 the global p price increase the need to comply with stringent discharge requirements and the demand to implement more sustainable process solutions made enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr an economically and environmentally attractive process 2 currently ebpr is increasingly being implemented due to the growing interest to capture and recycle p from wastewater for many years most of the research activities on biological p bio p removal has been conducted based on the activated sludge processes 3 4 compared to the activated sludge system an mbbr process retains more biomass without sludge recirculation and thereby reduce problems related to biomass loss 5 besides it is commonly believed that the mbbr can withstand concentration variations and it can tolerate changes in temperature of raw wastewater 5 despite the number of available publications based on mbbr processes a limited number of studies have been conducted to address the potential of using a sb mbbr for bio p removal from wastewater under challenging operational conditions such as low temperature and low vfa 6 the bio p removal is achieved by a specific group of microorganisms commonly known as phosphate accumulating organisms paos which are responsible for a surplus amount of phosphorus uptake compared to what is required for their metabolic activities this surplus is considered as a luxury p uptake 7 under anaerobic conditions paos consume vfa with the aid of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate atp and generate an intermediate polyhydroxy β alkanoate pha 8 the paos get their energy requirement from an external carbon source intracellular polyphosphate poly p degradation and atp destruction to adenosine diphosphate concurrently phosphate ions and counter cations calcium magnesium and potassium are released to the bulk 9 furthermore metabolic conversion of glycogen into polyhydroxyl valerate phv and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide also provide energy to paos 10 11 during aerobic conditions pha is oxidized and used as an energy source for p uptake poly p formation cell growth and production of glycogen 8 12 in general internally stored pha poly p and glycogen play a major role in p removal mechanisms 12 operational parameters such as temperature hydraulic retention time hrt variations in the influent wastewater concentrations particularly the vfa types of carbon source and ph have shown to affect the efficiency of ebpr 13 14 among these parameters the availability of the appropriate types of carbon sources and temperature are considered as the key operational parameters influencing the bio p process performance 15 norwegian wastewater is generally considered to be highly influenced by high precipitation rain and snow fall which results in large variability in the composition of municipal wastewater discharge the runoff water and snow melting infiltration results in the dilution of wastewater and this in turn reduces the temperature of the wastewater significantly no systematic studies on the composition of norwegian wastewater have been conducted in the past even though significant amounts of data from certain plants are available 16 for instance rusten et al 5 have shown that the typical value of scod in the municipal wastewater they have treated was below 100 mg scod l during the winter period further carrera et al 2001 reported that the influent c p ratio of 41 mg p mg c is required to achieve efficient ebpr in activated sludge systems on the other hand different ranges of temperatures have been investigated to study how they affect the ebpr process previous studies showed that paos have a competitive advantage over glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in ebpr operated system at 10 c 15 17 in contrast it was reported that high temperatures 24 32 c promoted and improved the performance of ebpr in activated sludge systems 18 the ebpr is a well developed wastewater treatment technology as it has been well researched 7 19 20 however the impact of temperature and vfa on an sb mbbr bio p process is not well documented this is particularly the case when the mbbr bio p process is operated with real municipal wastewater which is influenced by industrial wastewater moreover there is a fundamental knowledge gap concerning the effect of alternating external vfa supply during weekdays and weekends regarding the sb mbbr bio p organisms response therefore this study aimed to investigate the performance of the mbbr bio p system treating diluted municipal wastewater at 10 c and 20 c with vfa dosing during weekdays and without vfa dosing during weekends to simulate an industrial influenced municipal wastewater the specific objectives of this study include 1 investigating the effects of vfa concentrations and variations in vfa on sb mbbr bio p processes during weekdays and weekends 2 quantifying the performance and capability of the paos developed under steady state conditions it is hypothesized that a minor increase in vfa concentration 50 mg scod l during weekdays is enough to maintain a stable bio p performance at both 10 c and 20 c temperature systems this study was conducted by simulating a diluted actual municipal wastewater with a minor contribution of industrial wastewater the results of this study can be used for a bio p system treating industrial influenced municipal wastewater where enough vfa is expected during weekdays due to industrial activity and vfa limitation during weekends less industrial wastewater discharge a typical norwegian municipal wastewater is diluted has a significantly low temperature as explained earlier and the wastewater is aerated with relatively high dissolved oxygen do increased organic loading from the food processing industry will increase the chance of vfa production by fermentation of biodegradable organic matter this means the food processing industry discharges wastewater with relatively high biodegradable organic matter concentrations a potential source of vfa for the bio p processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 composition of municipal wastewater and operational conditions table 1 shows the overall characteristics of raw municipal wastewater the municipal wastewater was stored in a tank which receives a steady supply of raw wastewater from a nearby municipal sewer every hour the storage tank had a total volume of 3 5 m3 which ensured an uninterrupted supply of wastewater while maintaining enough variability in influent wastewater quality controlling the storage tank residence time ensured enough variability in the influent wastewater composition the fresh wastewater undergoes primary treatment by passing through a fine sieve to remove large particles before the sb mbbr reactor was fed a 200 l stainless steel tank was filled with fresh wastewater every day from the main storage tank to feed the pilot sb mbbr reactors this tank serves as a backup in case of pump maintenance downtime or low wastewater in the sewer no or little vfa production due to fermentation was expected in the storage tanks two sequence batch reactors with a working volume of 14 7 l each including carrier volume were operated at 10 c called cold reactor hereafter and 20 c called moderate reactor hereafter for a period of 213 days with the supply of vfa 50 mg scod l during weekdays and without vfa supply during weekends in the beginning the sb mbbr reactors were operated under anaerobic aerobic conditions without vfa supply at cold and moderate temperatures for 17 days on weekdays and weekends these measurements were excluded from the average values presented in tables 1 and 3 the sb mbbr contains the standard biofilm carriers kaldnes k1 with a 61 filling degree 21 a refrigerator and an aquarium heater were used to maintain the temperature of the reactors at 10 and 20 c respectively table 2 shows the operational conditions of the reactors a simplified drawing of the reactor is shown in fig 1 the biofilm attachment on the carriers was ensured by exposing the carriers to the aerobic conditions after this the reactors were operated in an anaerobic aerobic cyclic process with three cycles per day each 8 h hydraulic retention time consisting of 3 25 h in the anaerobic phase and 4 75 h in the aerobic phase this included 3 min filling and 3 min emptying time at the beginning of the anaerobic phase nitrogen gas was purged dissolved oxygen do 0 02 mg l during the aerobic phase air was purged do 2 8 mg l to make the do level in the reactors in the desired range both to ensure the movement of the biofilm carriers and to avoid settling of the detached biomass suspended solids the systems were mechanically mixed using a custom made mixer for the entire cycle period during aerobic and anaerobic phases with a mixing speed of 100 rotations per minute the system cyclic sequence was controlled by a custom made micro controller equipped with a display and data storage unit 2 2 kinetic studies 2 2 1 parent reactors the parent reactor kinetic studies were conducted during weekdays thursday or friday with a constant vfa supply 50 mg scod l the kinetic studies p release p uptake and scod consumption were conducted from the early stages of the biomass development until the sb mbbr bio p reactor showed steady state performance for a moderate temperature operation and semi steady state performance for a cold temperature operation 2 2 2 bench scale experiments the bench scale experiment aimed at quantifying the performance and capability of paos developed under steady state operations the quantification of the p release and uptake potential of the biomass adapted to low vfa dosing 50 mg scod l was evaluated by exposing the biomass to lower and higher vfa dosing on the bench scale experiment after the steady state performance was established with a constant supply of vfa 50 mg scod l during weekdays monday to friday and without vfa addition during weekends saturday and sunday a series of bench scale kinetic studies were conducted in separate batch reactors laboratory scale reactor with 2 5 l working volume to carry out kinetic studies the biomass carriers were collected from the parent reactors on thursdays and fridays when the reactors were under stable moderate temperature and semi stable cold temperature operations with low vfa supply 50 mg scod l for the bench scale experiment five different vfa dosing 0 25 50 100 and 300 mg l as scod were examined all other feeds and operational conditions were identical to that of the parent reactors the short term effect of temperature was also studied by exposing the cold adapted biomass to moderate temperature conditions and moderate temperature adapted biomass to cold temperature conditions on bench scale experiments these experiments were conducted to evaluate the p release p uptake and scod consumption of the paos adapted to low vfa dosing 50 mg scod l for such experiments 300 mg l scod was added to avoid carbon limitation 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 chemical analysis the sb mbbr bio p activity was studied with vfa dosing 50 mg scod l during weekdays and without vfa dosing during weekends the development of the systems was monitored daily for ph do temperature scod nh4 n po4 p and no3 n grab samples were collected during the entire cycle 8 h every 0 5 h for kinetic studies samples were filtered immediately through 0 45 μm filters the concentrations of scod orthophosphate po4 p ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were measured using dr lange cuvette using hach lange gmbh dr 1900 china spectrophotometer all the analyses were performed immediately during the cycle test 2 3 2 biomass analysis biofilm carriers were sampled once every two weeks for total biomass determination as total suspended solids g tss m2 or g tss l following the procedure described by 22 the biomass total p content mg total p mg tss was also determined every week on fridays following the standard method 23 the detached biomass surplus sludge suspended solids and the treated wastewater were completely drained between each cycle and discharged into the drainage line however the sludge was collected and used when needed for experiments or analyses 2 4 mathematical model of kinetic and stoichiometric parameters during scod utilization several models explaining the kinetics of substrate consumption for biomass growth exist in the wastewater treatment literature 24 26 most models use the monod equation to explain the kinetics of biological processes however alternative concepts such as linear substrate removal kinetics 27 have also been used to describe biological processes a comparison between the first and second order kinetics has been presented in 28 fractional order kinetics explaining the substrate removal kinetics in biological systems have also been reported in the literature 29 in the current work a generic form of the nth order kinetics eq 1 was used to describe the substrate consumption in the sb mbbrs the order of reaction and the rate constants are obtained by fitting the equation with data obtained from the kinetic experiment performed in the sb mbbrs in the nth order kinetic model 29 the rate of substrate utilization in the model is presented in eq 1 1 dc dt k n c n where c is substrate concentration kn is rate constant for the nth order substrate removal model and n is reaction order the optimization procedure involving minimization of the error function 30 31 is used to fit the experimental data to the nth order kinetic model eq 1 and obtain rate constant k n and reaction order n the optimization problem statement is presented in eq 2 2 f obj k n n i 1 n c l a b i c mod e l i k n n 2 l b k n n u b min k n n f obj k n n the experimental measurements of scod are presented as clab i and the model predicted value of scod was represented as cmodel i the term i represents the time index of experimental measurements and n is the total number of samples collected during the kinetic study the model output was obtained by numerically integrating eq 1 the lower bounds lb and upper bound ub for the parameters kn n were 0 0 and 10 5 respectively the initial guess of the parameters was kn0 0 05 and n0 1 the optimization problem presented in eq 2 was solved using the non linear programming solver fmincon provided by matlab the interior point algorithm was chosen to minimize the objective function and obtain the optimal values of the kinetic parameters 3 results and discussions 3 1 overall sb mbbr bio p performances to ensure an indiscriminate biomass attachment on the carrier media the parent reactors were operated for more than 70 days under aeration conditions at room temperature and with fresh wastewater supply every day after this the reactors were operated under anaerobic aerobic conditions without vfa supply both on weekdays and weekends at cold and moderate temperatures for 17 days see fig 2 a this was done to explore the development of bio p activity without vfa dosing at cold and moderate temperatures however no or very little bio p activity was observed in both cold and moderate reactors fig 2a suggesting the need for an external vfa source after this the sb mbbr was monitored for 213 days to observe the performance of paos activity in cold and moderate temperature systems with monday to friday and without vfa supply saturday and sunday the effect of vfa availability on paos performance was explored with low vfa supply 50 mg scod l during weekdays and without vfa supply raw wastewater during weekends at cold and moderate temperatures vfa dosing was started on day 17 and it was observed that paos behavior that consists of anaerobic scod uptake anaerobic p release and aerobic p uptake prevailed 3 days after the vfa dosing was started in the moderate reactor on day 28 58 p removal was observed in the moderate reactor while lower bio p activity 22 p removal was observed in the cold reactor see fig 2a the average values 213 days of the regular chemical analysis show clear differences in the p removal performance between the reactors operated at cold and moderate temperatures table 3 the moderate temperature operated reactor displayed a good average po4 p removal efficiency 81 compared to the cold temperature operated reactor 53 during weekdays table 3 both cold 49 and moderate 52 temperature operated reactors showed lower bio p activities during weekends when vfa dosing temporarily stopped in the moderate temperature operated reactor when the system reached steady state performance the effluent p concentration was always below 0 5 mg l from day 136 195 see fig 2a both on weekdays and weekends except one incidence on day 197 the observed stable operation could be due to the biomass s ability to store a high pha at a moderate temperature this storage product was able to support the bio p performance during weekends where no vfa was supplied this situation was observed after long term operation during the summer period due to less wastewater dilution effect relatively higher biodegradable organic matter than the winter period and increased wastewater temperature however the cold reactor showed large variation in the effluent p concentrations during weekdays and weekends for the entire operational period fig 2a it was observed that effluent po4 p concentration peaked up see fig 2a in both cold and moderate reactors when the vfa supply temporarily stopped during the weekends this indicated that the biomass contained insufficient stored pha to perform bio p activity during weekends the moderate temperature operated reactor performance was stable from wednesdays to fridays in most cases this indicates the need for a carbon source addition for stable bio p operation during weekends this finding agrees with the work of brdjanovic et al 32 that have observed increased p in the effluent on mondays in some full scale treatment plants brdjanovic et al 32 also observed deterioration of the ebpr after heavy rainfall occurrences since pha in the cell exhausts as a result of prolonged aeration similarly in the current study during heavy rainfall and snow melting events both the cold and moderate temperatures operated reactors showed deteriorated bio p performance only one time incident on day 89 90 see fig 2a after this event an unstable operation was observed from day 100 107 in the moderate temperature operated reactor which recovered faster than the cold reactor fig 2a similarly the moderate temperature operated reactor showed an excellent nitrification efficiency nh4 n conversion to nitrite and nitrate with more than 99 5 during weekdays and weekends whereas the cold reactor demonstrated large variations with more than 45 for weekdays and weekend table 3 and fig 2b the lower nh4 n oxidation at cold temperature operation might be linked to the reduced relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria as they are sensitive to cold temperatures 33 nitrogen removal was estimated based on influent nh4 n and effluent nh4 n no2 n and no3 n fig 2b and c by neglecting hydrolysis and assimilation in both reactors poor nitrogen removal efficiencies due to denitrification were observed 30 during weekdays and 20 during weekends see table 3 the possible reason could be vfa limitation might inhibit denitrifying paos dpaos performance or high do level increased the likelihood for oxygen to penetrate the thin biofilm layer in the moderate temperature reactor and thereby inhibiting dpaos performance similarly insufficient vfa may affect the dpaos performance or thick biofilm growth in the cold system restricted no3 diffusion previous study showed that denitrifying bacteria residing in the deep layer utilize the nitrate produced under aerobic condition and hence denitrification occurs 34 generally the moderate temperature operated reactor performed better than the cold reactor for all the parameters monitored for the entire operational period except for the scod removal where no differences were observed for both cold and moderate temperatures fig 2d the removal potential is proportional to the biomass concentration which in the sb mbbr process is related to the thickness of the biofilm 35 the total attached biomass concentration of the system was 12 1 3 0 g tss m2 3 7 0 9 g tss l and 16 3 5 3 g tss m2 5 1 1 6 g tss l for the moderate and cold temperatures respectively table 3 the biomass p content was also monitored for the experimental period and it was found to be 0 9 0 7 g total p m2 0 07 0 04 as g total p g tss for moderate temperature operated reactor and 0 7 0 2 g total p m2 0 04 0 01 as g total p g tss for the cold temperature operated reactor table 3 a thicker biomass was observed at low temperatures likely because the growth rate of biofilm is slower and it leads to denser and more compact biofilms which in turn lead to less detachment of the biofilm compaction of the biofilm might occur due to changes in internal pore structure and the microorganism s self aggregation properties 36 furthermore a previous study documented that high production of eps polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and lipids occurs under cold temperature operations 37 the eps could provide mechanical stability to biofilm mediate its adhesion to the surface and form a cohesive three dimensional polymer network that interconnects biofilm cells and therefore the biomass is less prone to the shear forces caused by mixing and less biomass detachment 38 the thick biomass growth and high eps production might have hindered the diffusion of molecules such as oxygen essential for oxidation of pha for cell growth and nitrification process for efficient pao activities a previous study showed that high eps production was observed at 5 c and the possible explanation for such high eps production could be due to environmental stress as a result of cold temperature 37 similar to the current study a previous study demonstrated that thick biofilm growth could reduce cell development and bioactivity in the system 39 it could be speculated that cold operational temperature combined with low vfa might be unfavorable for the typical microbial community developed in the current study system when two factors low temperature and vfa limitation influence the process simultaneously it is difficult to draw a strong conclusion where the effect was originated however it is important to note that p uptake during aerobic condition is mainly governed by the storage product pha in the biofilm under the anaerobic stage indicating the mass of new paos formed depends on the mass of the stored pha 4 40 the current study demonstrated the existence of bio p organisms in both cold and moderate temperature operated reactors the findings from this study have shown that the bio p activities are affected by limitation of vfa during weekends in both cold and moderate temperature operated reactors however the cold reactor is affected the most it is not clear why the cold reactor performed poorer compared to the moderate reactor during both weekdays and weekends therefore further investigations are needed to explain whether low temperature eps production biomass sensitivity to low vfa or a combination of those factors are the most important ones this study provides useful information for wastewater treatment plants receiving some vfa during weekdays due to industrial activities but lower vfa during weekends lesser industrial activities 3 2 kinetic study in the parent reactors the kinetic studies were conducted after a steady state moderate reactor and semi steady state cold reactor performances were observed a typical data of the cycles of the kinetic studies is shown in fig 3 a and b the p release was assessed as a primary and secondary release the primary release took place when the scod was available while the secondary p release occurred when all the scod was consumed by the biomass the secondary p release occurred due to the consumption of the fermentation products which was slow and could not be controlled and the average values are presented in table 4 the concept of primary and secondary p release was adapted from 41 in both moderate and cold temperature reactors all the available scod both acetic acid dosed and the acetic acid present in the raw wastewater as scod were consumed rapidly in the first 0 5 h fig 3a and b the primary po4 p release rate and the secondary p release rate respectively were found to be 0 3 g po4 p g tss l h and 0 01 g po4 p g tss l h for moderate temperature operated reactor table 4 the po4 p released to scod consumed was found to be 0 3 mg po4 p mg scod ratio based on the total p release and scod consumed in 3 h but the primary p release to scod uptake ratio was 0 2 mg po4 p mg scod table 4 this result agrees with the study of brdjanovic et al 32 where 0 29 g p g cod was found in the anaerobic phase during the aerobic conditions the biomass also showed a rapid po4 p uptake rate in the moderate temperature reactor 0 06 g po4 p g tss l h table 4 all the p released in the moderate reactor was taken up in less than 2 h aerobic phase resulting in 0 05 mg po4 p l in the effluent fig 3b the cold operated reactor showed a primary p release rate of 0 1 g po4 p g tss l h and a secondary p release rate of 0 01 g po4 p g tss l h a total of 18 2 0 9 mg po4 p l was released with 0 1 mg po4 p released mg scod consumed ratio for both primary and secondary p release and scod uptake in 3 h anaerobic retention time table 4 this result is different from a previous study conducted by li et al 15 that they observed 55 mg l po4 p release in 1 h anaerobic retention time in the sb activated sludge system at 10 c however it is very difficult to make such a comparison without more information about the system the differences could be explained by the quality of the biomass developed the type of biofilm processes activated sludge versus moving bed biofilm mixing speed do level the variation in influent wastewater composition the thickness of the biomass grown due to eps production and other operational conditions in addition mulkerrins et al 42 indicated that specific p release clearly decreases when the temperature decreases with sludge activity being influenced by a quick shift in temperature which is consistent with the current study that the p uptake rate was also slow 0 01 g po4 p g tss l h table 4 with the final effluent concentration of 2 5 0 9 mg po4 p l after 5 h aerobic phase in the cold reactor fig 3a at the end of the aerobic phase 1 0 1 0 mg no2 n l and 27 3 2 7 mg no3 n l were measured in the moderate temperature reactor table 4 as a result nitrogen removal efficiency due to denitrification was estimated to be 35 1 0 4 table 4 below 2 mg l effluent nh4 n concentration was measured in less than 3 5 h aerobic phase of the moderate reactor fig 3b however 3 7 0 1 mg no2 n l and 6 5 mgno3 n l table 4 were measured in the cold reactor the resulting nitrogen removal efficiency was estimated to be 27 2 0 02 table 4 high effluent nh4 n concentration was measured 20 mg nh4 n l in the cold reactor at the end of the aerobic phase this result differs from the previous study where nitrogen removal efficiency of 89 6 was achieved in the activated sludge system at 10 c 15 as has been discussed earlier compact and dense biomass growth and low detachment of the biomass due to slow growth rate as a result of the cold temperature could be possible reasons for such differences as compared with previous studies furthermore thick biofilm growth results in lower diffusion of oxygen and no3 and the selected operating temperature might have hindered the paos growth as well as ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria growth 33 gieger and rauch 56 indicated that in thick biofilms the deeper layer contains inactive biomass which may not provide significant benefits these authors suggest that optimum substrate diffusion could be achieved with a 0 5 mm biofilm thickness in addition the p uptake might be influenced by the pha composition poly hydroxy butyrate phb and phv in the system at the beginning of the aerobic phase a higher fraction of phb is known to result in higher p uptake which is observed in the pao dominated bio p systems 41 the production of phb depends on the influent wastewater composition and the microbial community composition in the system the eps are also known to contribute to extracellular phosphorus removal especially at cold temperatures 37 in the current study the limited p uptake and higher scod consumption per p released in the cold reactor might also be attributed to the eps production it has been documented that eps could serve as p sink due to its adsorptive properties 43 the sb mbbr bio p process demonstrated distinct behaviors on p release and uptake under cold and moderate temperature conditions however the result showed that the cold temperature and low vfa affected the cold system more than the moderate temperature operated reactor therefore it is proposed that the ebpr plant operators should be aware of this situation and apply vfa dosing during weekends to achieve stable operation 3 3 effects of vfa concentration on po4 p release and uptake the bench scale kinetic studies were conducted to quantify the effects of vfa on the p release and uptake of biomass enriched at low vfa dosing 50 mg scod l during weekdays only once the parent reactors reached a stable and semi stable performance for moderate and cold temperature reactors respectively batch activity studies were performed with the supply of different vfa concentrations varied between 0 300 mg scod l the influent po4 p was adjusted to 17 8 20 2 mg po4 p l for both cold and moderate temperature reactors for all the vfa dosing investigated very good p releases were observed at moderate temperature r2 0 9962 fig 4 c with increasing scod consumption and good total po4 p released and uptake was also observed r2 0 9935 fig 4d whereas the cold reactor exhibited relatively poor p releases r2 0 9739 fig 4a for all scod concentrations tested except for 300 mg scod l the cold reactor also showed lower total po4 p release and uptake r2 0 9256 than the moderate reactor fig 4b in the moderate temperature reactor po4 p release varied between 15 5 101 9 mg po4 p l fig 4d while the p release varied between 17 3 23 7 mg po4 p l fig 4b for the cold reactor the ratio of po4 p released to scod consumed ranged between 0 17 0 26 mg po4 p released mg scod consumed 3 91 4 73 mg scod consumed mg po4 p released in the moderate temperature reactor and 0 01 0 11 mg po4 p mg scod 9 48 13 54 mg scod consumed mg po4 p released for the cold reactor literature review revealed that the metabolism of activated sludge is considered to be gao dominated metabolism if the ratio of p release to scod uptake is lower than 0 25 mg p mg scod intermediate gao pao metabolism if this ratio is between 0 25 to 0 50 mg p mg scod and pao dominated metabolism if the ratio is more than 0 50 mg p mg scod for the system operated at ph 7 and 20 c 44 however it is difficult to consider the p release to scod consumption ratio as a general indicator for the sb mbbr bio p systems as it is possible to achieve a good p removal with lower p release to scod consumption ratios with low vfa dosing at 20 c as the result of this study shows the cold reactor showed poor correlation for p uptake versus p release r2 0 9256 thus it is not possible to obtain a proportionality constant fig 4b the biomass continued to release po4 p during anaerobic conditions with increasing vfa however the biomass seems to have a limited po4 p uptake capacity in the cold system as negative p uptake was observed at higher vfa dosing 300 mg scod l possible reasons for this might be factors like eps production thick biomass low temperature etc affecting the system in the moderate reactor aerobic p uptake and anaerobic p release showed a strong correlation r2 0 9935 fig 4d compared to the cold operated reactor similar to this study pastorelli et al 6 observed a direct correlation between p release vs p uptake but with a lower proportionality constant 1 055 g p taken up g p released where 1 25 g p taken up g p released was observed at 20 c fig 4d in the current study high phosphate release is beneficial to achieve a high net p uptake which depends on the amount of pha stored in the cell which is directly linked to p release under anaerobic conditions 34 the net p uptake varied between 7 3 17 8 mg po4 p l in the moderate temperature reactor on the other hand the net p uptake in the cold reactor varied between 0 9 7 8 mg po4 p l but negative p uptake was observed at 300 mg scod l dosing the moderate operated reactor also showed a better net p release 101 9 mg po4 p l and net p uptake 17 8 mg po4 p l in the moderate reactor the high effluent concentrations 1 3 4 0 mg po4 p l observed in all bench scale experiments could be explained by the high influent po4 p literature review revealed that overdosing of vfa may not be good for bio p activities because it may lead to the proliferation of unwanted microbial communities such as gaos 32 however since the parent reactors both cold and moderate temperature reactors were run under low vfa conditions the gao dominance may not be expected in one time high vfa dosing on the bench scale experiment nevertheless if external carbon dosing is required in a full scale wastewater treatment plan the operators are advised to estimate the proper amount of vfa and avoid overdosing to prevent the gaos proliferation 45 these bench scale studies showed that the parent reactors operational conditions could be further optimized in terms of vfa dosing do level and temperature as the effect could originate from a combination of the different operational conditions the influent nh4 n concentration was not adjusted and it was in the range of 38 0 39 1 mg l for cold and 33 8 45 7 mg l for the moderate reactors the sb mbbr operated at 20 c showed 100 nitrification efficiency and nitrogen removal efficiency in the range of 21 2 47 7 the denitrification was inhibited probably due to high oxygen penetration however the cold operated system showed lower nitrification efficiency 62 6 75 8 and higher 41 6 56 7 nitrogen removal efficiency compared to the moderate temperature reactor a previous study suggested that due to low do levels in the activated sludge system the dpaos utilizing the no3 as an electron acceptor in a deeper layer of the bio flocs seemed to contribute to simultaneous nitrification denitrification and bio p removal 15 in the current study this seemed to have happened to a larger extent in the cold reactor than in the moderate reactor it is suggested to optimize aeration to improve the denitrification process in the moderate reactors by reducing the do level in such a way that it does not hinder the nitrification process in the system a study showed that nitrification is the most temperature sensitive step among the biological processes in the wastewater treatment 46 other study has shown that a sudden temperature change can prevent proper functioning of the bacteria protein damage the outer cell membrane and or make it gel like which could result in decreased oxygen transfer rate 47 it is assumed that the cold reactor might have contained relatively higher dpaos compared to the moderate reactor since the estimated nitrogen removal efficiency was relatively higher in the cold reactor this finding suggests the need for further optimization of the operational parameters of the sb mbbr reactors to achieve a better bio p performance efficiency the effluent concentrations of scod po4 p nh4 n no2 n and no3 n of the bench scale kinetic studies are shown in table 5 3 4 kinetics of scod consumption in bench scale experiments the experimental results of scod consumption in the sb mbbr were evaluated using nth order kinetics for both cold and moderate temperature operated reactors the concentration of the scod and hrt were considered as governing parameters for the scod utilization in the reactors it was assumed that the biomass concentration in the system is constant table 2 according to the kinetic studies the kinetic coefficients obtained from anaerobic scod removal from the municipal wastewater strongly fits a reaction with an order of 1 50 table 6 a rate constant of 2 02 mg l day was obtained for the sb mbbr for both cold and moderate temperature conditions table 6 a comparison between the experimental data and the model predicted values are presented in fig 5 and table 6 the r2 values are 0 869 and 0 824 for the reactor operation at moderate and cold temperature conditions respectively however it seems there is some bias in the model at zero and lower vfa dosing where the model describes the experimental data less accurate as it can be seen in fig 5a and b this could be due to the importance of the availability of scod at lower concentrations a quantitative comparison between the model presented in this work and the first and second order model described in borghei et al 28 based on root mean square error rmse is presented in table 6 a lower rmse value for the model with a reaction order 1 50 implies that the fractional order model better explains the scod consumption in the sb mbbr compared to a first or a second order model the higher r2 value for the moderate reactor was also an indication for the model fit table 6 3 5 effect of temperature on bio p removal this study also investigated the effect of short term change of temperature on the behavior of biomass scod consumption p release and uptake the biomass carriers were collected from cold and moderate temperature operated reactors with low vfa dosing 50 mg scod l bench scale experiments were conducted against the temperature of the parent reactors the biomass was collected when the systems were at a stable moderate reactor and semi stable cold reactor performance as illustrated in fig 6 the behavior of paos on p removal was similar to other ebpr study results that showed paos were enriched in both cold and moderate temperature operated systems 11 41 48 the results of the current study have shown that short term exposure of cold adapted biomass to a moderate temperature and the moderate temperature adapted biomass to cold temperature did not affect the po4 p release and uptake behavior of the biomass but slower scod consumption and nitrification rates were observed on the bench scale experiments fig 6a b this means that the moderate reactor biomass exposed to cold temperature still behaves like the parent moderate reactor and the cold reactor biomass exposed to the moderate temperature still behaved like the parent cold reactor the ratio of po4 p released to scod consumed was the same as the parent reactors a better p uptake was observed in a moderate temperature adapted biomass exposed to cold temperature than a cold adapted biomass exposed to moderate temperature the poor and negative po4 p uptake observed in cold adapted biomass exposed to moderate temperature is the same as observed in the parent cold reactor as explained further up in the text to see the relationship between the bio p removal performance of the current and other studies that considered the effect of temperature type and source of external carbon comparative results are shown in table 7 a study shows that temperature influence metabolic activities and the diversity of microorganisms 37 in addition several studies have demonstrated the effect of temperature on bio p and it showed that paos are able to cope at high and low temperature conditions 17 18 37 49 the current finding showed that at cold temperature the paos did not function well in the parent reactor weekdays and poor p removal on bench scale experiments even with vfa supply the finding of this study is somewhat inconsistent with the study of lopez vazquez et al 17 where they indicated that paos have a competitive advantage over gaos at lower temperature condition 10 c and therefore beneficial for capturing surplus po4 p in the wastewater but in the current study the gao pao competition was not studied however such differences in the results could be due to variations in the wastewater composition the type of carbon sources chosen vfa fractions in the wastewater and the development of dense and compact biomass hindering the falling of the biomass due to high eps production under cold operation but also hrt ph and other reactor operational parameters may play a role moreover in an activated sludge system it is important to remove a portion of sludge at certain sludge retention times which is not applicable in the sb mbbr process in the current study the moderate temperature sb mbbr reactor resulted in higher p removal efficiency on weekdays the differences between cold and moderate temperature operation results might originate from environmental stress created due to cold temperatures in the parent reactor mulkerrins et al 42 observed that the specific p release rate decreases clearly with decreasing temperature 20 15 c showing sludge activity being influenced by temperature shift the authors indicated that paos are lower range mesophilic or psychrophilic organisms which proliferate and become predominant only at 20 c or lower 42 their finding agrees with the findings of the current study where the p release at 10 c is much lower than that of 20 c operated reactor the p removal efficiency obtained in this study at moderate temperature is lower than that of the previously mentioned studies table 7 however the sb mbbr bio p reactor showed great flexibility and reliability rapid bio p activities were observed when vfa dosing was commenced no clogging experience no biomass accumulation in the reactors and the samples were easy to filter it has been documented that compared to the activated sludge systems the sb mbbr system showed resistance to shocking volumetric load and huge organic matter loading rate low maintenance requirement high specific biofilm surface area less head loss no backwashing requirement compact system less requirement of final sludge separation no clogging challenges and financial saving in terms of sludge handling and discharge cost 21 50 51 bio p studies have been conducted using different types of vfa which include acetate 20 41 propionate 48 a combination of acetate and propionate 17 as the sole carbon source table 7 the dependency or picky nature of paos on external carbon source made the ebpr process to be inefficient in wastewater treatment processes this is because the p removal is highly dependent on the amount of the pha stored under anaerobic conditions which is directly related to the influent readily biodegradable organic carbon level and sources 17 41 the ratio of influent scod to p is another factor determining the performance of ebpr processes experimental data of pastorelli et al 6 showed that the influent scod p ratio varied between 10 7 and 20 0 for the three experimental phases they have considered in the current study the influent scod p ratio varied between 38 and 36 low scod consumed to po4 p released ratio 9 7 mol c mol po4 p or 0 1 mol p released to c consumed was observed in the moderate reactor the higher scod consumed per po4 p release 23 9 mol scod mol po4 p or 0 04 mol p released c consumed value in the cold system could be due to the low poly p stored in the biomass the p content of the biomass in the moderate reactor was higher than that of the cold reactor table 7 a previous study suggested that poly p storage levels and gao like metabolism are important factors affecting the competition between different pao types in ebpr 54 other study showed that differences in vfa uptake at different operational temperatures were of great importance in determining whether a particular system is pao enriched or not 55 these types of studies were not conducted in our sb mbbr bio p processes and it is recommended to investigate the effect of gaos and paos interaction as the change in pha composition will determine whether the system is pao or gao dominated 54 4 conclusions an average of 81 and 53 p removal at 20 and 10 c respectively were obtained using the sb mbbr bio p process treating industrial influenced diluted municipal wastewater the reactor operated at 20 c showed better long term performance during weekdays and weekends compared to 10 c reactor long term operation of the reactors showed that short term changes in vfa during weekends affected the bio p activities in both 10 and 20 c resulting in lower p removal efficiency high vfa consumption per po4 p release ratio and thick biomass was observed at 10 c which could be linked to high eps production inhibiting paos performance declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

13537,recently electrocoagulation ec has emerged as a promising method to treat contaminated water in this study a novel ec system using stainless steel electrodes was applied to remove arsenate as v in water an operation time of 5 min electrical potential difference of 7 5 v and inter electrode distance of 1 cm were identified as optimal condition for removing as v eliminated 92 of as v from 0 1 mg as v l solution in the batch study using a 9 v rechargeable battery and a small 12 v solar panel the ec reactor removed 93 and 98 of as v from 0 1 mg as v l solution respectively and as v concentration in treated water was lower than that of the drinking water guideline of world health organisation who 0 01 mg l in the continuous water flow study a small cost effective system reactor volume of 1 l cost 15 aud using a small 12 v solar panel could successfully treat 12 l contaminated water per hour during 4 h of continuous testing the system s efficiency in removing as v remained constant at 91 the operation cost for the treatment of as v contaminated water in continuous operation mode is 0 240 aud m3 water for the direct current dc electrical system and 0 262 aud m3 for the solar system in a pilot field study with contaminated groundwater 0 03 mg total as l in hanam province vietnam the ec system using solar energy 12 v was able to reduce as concentration to below the vietnamese and who permissible drinking water limit in 1 min keywords arsenateremoval electrocoagulation stainless steel electrode solar energy water treatment 1 introduction arsenic as is one of the world s most hazardous contaminants it is estimated that more than 200 million people in 100 countries have been affected by drinking as polluted water 1 as being a potential human carcinogen causes many other diseases related to skin lungs etc 2 it is distributed in the environment through natural and anthropogenic processes 3 the two most toxic forms of as are arsenite as iii and arsenate as v and their concentrations are controlled mainly by redox conditions and solubility whilst as iii occurs at low redox potential and its solubility is 10 g 100 ml of water as v appears at a higher redox state and its solubility is up to 66 g 100 ml of water 2 although many technologies have been developed and applied to remove as from drinking water 4 as treatment is still a great challenge for the water industry especially at a small and affordable scale applicable to rural and isolated areas among these methods electrocoagulation ec is a promising method which could eliminate many of the disadvantages of other traditional water treatment techniques 5 6 for example adsorption has the problem of adsorbent regeneration interference from co existing anions and production of toxic exhausted adsorbent waste while chemical precipitation requires large amounts of chemical coagulants and sludge disposal problem some advantages of ec are its simple equipment requirements easy operation no use of chemicals oxidisation of as iii to as v during the process and less sludge production 6 8 however removing as through this method strongly depends on the operational conditions type of electrodes voltage current inter electrode distance operation time solution ph and initial as concentration and an electrical source that can be expensive or unavailable in many rural or isolated regions 9 many kinds of metal can be used as electrodes such as iron fe aluminium al stainless steel copper cu titanium ti and zinc zn 10 among these fe electrodes are the most widely used ucar et al 11 reported that when fe electrodes in monopolar parallel electrode connection mode were employed ec could remove up to 95 as v from 0 5 mg l synthetic water at a current density of 4 5 ma cm2 in a batch experimental process the hybrid electrodes with the combination of fe al or cu were also tested for removing as 12 the removal efficiency of the ec technique on treating as v with the above electrodes was reported to be 75 99 10 the application of stainless steel electrode also produced high as removals 13 15 though fe electrodes are the most popular electrodes used in the ec process they can create a problem of water turning into a yellow colour principally due to the production of fine particles of rust to overcome this challenge stainless steel anodes have been used 16 the main chemical reactions in the ec process and the reactions involving as v removal from the solution are presented in fig 1 17 the two prime mechanisms of as v removal in the ec process are co precipitation of as v with the various fe ion species generated in the ec process and adsorption of as v on the hydroxide precipitates of fe2 and fe3 these are depicted in the last four equations in the solution compartment of fig 1 18 the mechanism of adsorption is mainly inner sphere coordination 12 19 20 song et al 12 has provided an excellent review of the local coordination environment and the short ranged structure of iron and arsenic in terms of fe oxide octahedra corner and edge sharing with the as v tetrahedra to reduce the electricity cost of the ec method a few studies used solar power in ec to remove different contaminants in water an ec system utilising solar power and batteries 60 w capacity was shown to remove 92 of chemical oxygen demand and 49 of total dissolved solids by al electrodes at a distance apart of 1 cm in 20 min 21 in another study an ec system using a 30 2 v solar photovoltaic module containing 12 polycrystalline silicon cells was able to remove 99 9 of lead pb from a solution containing 10 mg pb l in 10 min 22 studies on the application of solar energy in the ec system for removing as from water are limited recently oh et al 23 used an ec system with large solar panels 380 750 w to remove as from groundwater in vietnam although this system obtained a high as removal efficiency 96 6 from a solution containing 0 376 mg l in 10 min and the as concentration in treated water was below the world health organisation who permissible drinking water limit 10 μg l this system was large in size and therefore the initial cost to install it was probably high moreover it can only be installed operated and maintained by qualified technicians and not by local residents instead of this type of large centralised solar energy system a simpler and smaller sized ec unit using smaller solar panels applicable to individual households as and when clean water is required is more suitable and affordable for rural areas in the present study a new ec process using stainless steel electrodes was utilised to remove as v from synthetic water the objectives of the study were i determine the removal efficiency of as v from synthetic solution using an ec system with stainless steel electrodes in both batch and continuous flow mode experiments ii determine the influence of many operating conditions of the ec system on as v removal including voltage current intensity inter electrode distance operation time and solution ph iii compare different power supply sources dc rechargeable battery and solar power on as v removal and their cost of operation iv test the ec system in a pilot field trial with contaminated groundwater collected from a household in vietnam rural area to analyse its practical applicability the pilot trial was conducted in hanam province vietnam while the laboratory studies were conducted in sydney australia if the small sized solar panel is found to be effective at low operational cost this could prove to be attractive for decentralised systems in rural or isolated areas used by individual households 2 material and methods 2 1 feed solution for the laboratory study a stock solution was prepared by dissolving 4 165 mg sodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o in 1 l milli q water to obtain a concentration of 1 mg as v l the stock solution was diluted with distilled water to the desired as v concentrations of 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 mg l for batch studies and 0 1 mg l for continuous flow mode studies in all experiments 1 10 3 m nacl was used as supporting electrolyte the initial solution ph was adjusted to 6 0 8 0 the ph range found to occur in groundwater to study the effect of ph on as v removal and in the other experiments the ph was kept constant at 7 0 0 2 by adding 0 1 m hno3 or 0 1 m naoh for the pilot study a contaminated groundwater sample collected from a household in ly nhan rural district hanam province vietnam was used hanam province is the most as polluted area in the country according to huy et al and nguyen et al 24 25 more than 52 of groundwater in this province is contaminated by as this water had ph tds as fe mn ca and mg concentrations of 7 2 212 mg l 0 03 mg l 0 27 mg l 0 41 mg l 84 mg l and 109 mg l respectively 2 2 ec system 2 2 1 laboratory study a couple of commercial stainless steel plates of grade 316 11 cm 6 cm 0 09 cm were used as anode and cathode the electrodes were hung inside a transparent polypropylene tank size of 10 2 10 2 20 cm by a glass stick in a monopolar parallel connection mode so that the submerged part of the electrodes inside the solution was 8 cm 6 cm 0 09 cm the solution volume was 1 l to maintain a uniform concentration the solution was mixed using a magnetic stirrer rotated at 120 rpm at the bottom of the tank batch and continuous mode experiments with dc electricity and rechargeable battery were conducted using this set up at room temperature of 25 1 c in the batch studies a regulated laboratory dc power supply system model mp 3840 was used to supply an electrical current with predetermined voltages to the electrodes fig 2 a the voltages and generated electrical current supplied by this dc system could be varied through its converter the performance of the ec system on as v removal was investigated at different conditions electric potential difference 3 0 10 v operation time 5 120 min initial as v concentration 0 1 0 5 mg l the distance between electrodes 0 5 4 cm and solution ph 6 8 in each experiment samples were periodically collected filtered through 0 45 μm filters and the filtrates were analysed for as using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms instrument agilent technologies 7900 the experimental scenario which produced an as v concentration smaller than the who s permissible limit for as in drinking water with the lowest energy consumption was considered to be the optimal treatment condition the initial and final ph of the solution in all experiments were measured using a ph meter model hq40d to investigate whether the ph of the solution changed and if so to what extent to evaluate the feasibility of using renewable energies two other experiments were carried out at the optimal condition of the ec system determined in the initial experiments using a 9 v rechargeable battery and a 12 v solar panel separately instead of the dc source of electricity fig 2a the 9 v rechargeable battery was simply connected to electrodes by using clips the small 12 v solar panel powertech was designed with 36 multi crystalline silicon solar cells and a maximum power of 5 w the size of the solar panel was 25 1 cm 20 5 cm 1 8 cm with a weight of 0 7 kg it was fitted with a blocking diode making it suitable for direct connection to the ec system by means of clips without using any intermediate equipment the experiments with the solar panel were conducted outdoors and in the winter season from 10 00 a m to 14 00 pm july and august 2020 australia the voltage and current density of the solar panel were measured using a multimeter voltage sensor model qm1529 it demonstrated that the solar energy during this period was enough for the ec system s operation the operation of the solar panel in general depends on the weather conditions on days when the sunlight is insufficient it is recommended that a simple and low cost rechargeable battery be employed for storing solar energy captured during bright sunny periods and then supply this stored power for the ec system on days with insufficient sunlight to evaluate the sacrifice dissolution rate of the anode in addition to the calculations using faraday s law see section 3 1 2 a chemical analysis was conducted to measure the fe concentration in the ec reactor 1 ml of suspension in the ec reactor at different operation times and currents was sampled and mixed with 5 ml each of 2 m hno3 and 1 m hcl the mixture was then shaken at 50 rpm at room temperature for 1 h filtered and analysed for fe using the icp ms instrument this is a modification of the method utilised by kalaruban et al 5 in the continuous flow mode study both the dc power supply system and the small 12 v solar panel were utilised separately with a small ec reactor containing 1 l of as contaminated water to investigate the as v removal efficiency the system was operated at different flow velocities of 3 6 and 12 l h corresponding to hydraulic retention times hrt of 20 10 and 5 min hrt min reactor volume l flow velocity l h 60 min a schematic diagram of the continuous flow reactor is presented in fig 2b the synthetic feed solution containing 0 1 mg as v l was pumped continuously by a dosing pump masterflex l s into the 1 l reactor at the optimal operating condition determined in the batch study u 7 5 v i 0 030 a ph 7 0 0 2 inter electrode distance 1 cm the treated solution then automatically flows into the 2 l clarifier the effluent samples in the clarifier were collected after 1 2 and 4 h then they were filtered and analysed for as fe nickel ni and chromium cr using icp ms instrument ni and cr were analysed as they are also components of stainless steel 2 2 2 pilot trial in the field with contaminated ground water in vietnam the pilot trial was conducted in hanam province vietnam a small 1 15 l acrylic tank equipped with two commercial 316 stainless steel plates size of 11 cm 10 cm 0 03 cm and a small solar panel 12 v was used as the ec reactor as contaminated groundwater from a household was treated by the same method as used in the laboratory batch study the trial was carried out at different operation times of 1 5 10 15 and 20 min and the inter electrode distance was kept constant at 1 0 cm effluent from the ec system was filtered through 0 45 μm filter and the filtrate was analysed for as and fe using an icp ms instrument agilent technologies 7900 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch study 3 1 1 effect of initial concentration and operation time effect of initial as v concentration co was investigated at three concentrations 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 mg l in this experiment the distance between electrodes initial ph and electrical potential difference u were 1 cm 7 0 and 3 v respectively under these conditions the current produced was very small only 0 007 a samples from the reactor container were collected at 5 10 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min and analysed for as ph and fe fig 3 a depicts the effect of co on the residual as v concentration in water samples as a function of operation time tec min as can be seen from this figure the who permissible limit for as in drinking water cwho 10 μg l 26 was attained after 60 min for co of 0 1 mg l and 90 min for co of 0 25 mg l at co of 0 5 mg l the cwho could not be obtained within the 120 min tested in the experiment since as v concentration of around 0 1 mg l is the typical level reported for as contaminated groundwater in many countries 27 it was chosen for use in the subsequent studies fig 3a also shows that the as v removal rate was fast during the first hour and then decreased slowly with time for all as v concentrations as reported by others 7 13 this decline in the rate of as v removal is due to the decrease in solution concentration of as v which was in equilibrium with the as v adsorbed on the hydrous iron oxide hydroxide precipitates formed from fe dissolution derived from the anode during the ec process when the as v concentration drops so does the maximum loading of as v per mg of fe precipitates in equilibrium 28 these precipitates were formed by the reaction of fe with the oh ions generated at the cathode at the neutral ph of the solution 8 13 it is also possible that at longer ec times the as v concentrations became very small to produce any additional fe as co precipitation mainly because the solubility products of fe as precipitates would not have reached at these low as v concentrations the rate of removal of as v increased with initial as v concentration as reported by others 13 balasubramanian et al 13 reported that the rate of arsenic removal is proportional to the as v concentration and the amount of fe hydroxides formed and described it by pseudo second order kinetics since the generation of ferric hydroxide can be assumed constant for a given current density the rate of removal would follow a pseudo first order kinetics the percentage removal of as v 1 residual as v initial as v x 100 decreased with an increase in the initial as v concentration this is due to the fact that the ratio of hydroxo fe complexes to the initial as v concentration decreased with increase in influent concentration 13 3 1 2 effect of voltage and anode dissolution the effect of voltage was studied by keeping the distance between electrodes co and ph constant at 1 cm 0 1 mg l and 7 0 respectively the voltage of power supply source u was adjusted to 3 5 7 5 and 10 v and the corresponding values of the electrical current i were measured as 0 007 0 018 0 030 and 0 061 a with current densities of 0 11 0 27 0 45 and 0 92 ma cm2 respectively the experiment remained in operation for up to 120 min results showed that cwho could be reached in 15 min at 0 27 ma cm2 u 5 v which is much faster than that at 0 11 ma cm2 u 3 v fig 3b at the higher current densities of 0 45 ma cm2 u 7 5 v and 0 92 ma cm2 u 10 v cwho was reached extremely quickly within 5 min consistent with these data the increase in the electrical current led to rising as v removal efficiency for example at tec of 5 min the removal efficiency e increased from 24 to 58 5 92 and 96 corresponding to the rise of the current values from 0 007 a to 0 018 a 0 030 a and 0 061 a current densities of 0 11 0 27 0 45 and 0 92 ma cm2 respectively the possible reason for this is that at a higher electrical current a larger amount of fe from the anode was dissolved resulting in greater amounts of hydrous iron oxides hydroxides production 8 13 28 this led to the removal of a larger percentage of as v due to as v replacing the increasing number of hydroxyl groups in the iron precipitates 8 it is also possible that at high concentrations of fe larger amount of as is removed by co precipitation with fe 29 other studies also reported that as removal efficiency was proportional to the current density 8 15 28 another reason for the increased as removal with increased current density could be the increased rate of production of hydrogen gas at the cathode which captures the suspended colloidal fe as particles leading to additional removal of as 12 however at very high current density electrode polarization and passivation can occur causing loss of electrical energy which can lead to reduction in as removal fig 3b also shows that the as v removal efficiency significantly increased when tec increased from 5 min to 120 min for example at the current value of 0 018 a u 5 v as v removal efficiency at 5 min was only 58 8 however it increased to 79 7 after 10 min and reached almost 99 at 30 min the increase of tec elevated the amount of dissolved fe as observed for the effect of an increase in current the higher amounts of dissolved fe would have produced abundant fe hydrous oxides hydroxides leading to a greater amount of as v being removed by adsorption greater amounts of as v are also removed by co precipitation with fe at high concentrations of fe 29 to evaluate the sacrifice dissolution rate of the anode the mass of fe generated at the anode mfe mg and the electrode consumption concentration celectrode mg l calculation based on mfe for the as removal from water were calculated using chemical analysis and faraday s law the faraday s law equations are presented below 8 1 m f e i t e c m f e z f 2 c e l e c t r o d e i t e c m f e z f v where i is the current value a mfe is the molecular weight of iron 55 85 mg mol z is the number of electrons involved in the oxidation reduction reaction zfe 2 f is the faraday s constant 1 f 1608 06 a min mol tec is ec operation time min v is the solution volume v 1 l dura and breslin 16 reported that mainly fe2 was produced by the oxidation of stainless steel anode during the ec process they found that the fe2 concentration was 88 of the total dissolved fe produced at the anode lakshmanan et al 14 also stated that fe2 and not fe3 was produced at the fe anode they used for ec therefore the value of 2 was used for zfe in equations 1 and 2 as done by others for fe or stainless steel electrode 8 28 30 fig 3c depicts that the calculated amounts of fe ions generated as well as the weight of the anode lost increased with i and tec for example the fe concentrations calculated from this equation at the end of the experiment tec 120 min at i 0 007 0 018 0 030 and 0 061 a were 14 6 37 5 62 5 and 127 1 mg l respectively however the corresponding concentrations of fe dissolved from the anode measured by chemical analysis were much smaller i e 7 9 10 8 22 6 and 35 2 mg l respectively fig 3d the main reason for this difference is that part of the dissolved fe was precipitated or adsorbed to the anode and this was not included in the chemical analysis another reason is that faraday s law is valid only when all the electrons in the system participate solely in the metal dissolution reaction at the anode which seldom happens also the anode used does not consist of pure fe it is stainless steel which contains other metals such as cr ni and mn in addition to fe this is not taken into consideration in faraday s equation the percentage contents of fe cr ni and mn reported by the manufacturer for grade 316 stainless steel plates used in the study are 66 72 16 18 10 14 and 2 respectively assuming an approximate 69 for the fe content and the current used for the dissolution of each metal is proportionate to the contents of the metals in the electrode the calculated amount of fe dissolved from the electrode would be 69 of the values presented earlier in the paragraph the initial solution ph of 7 0 increased slightly up to a maximum of 8 0 during the ec process the precipitation of fe dissolved from the anode would have reduced ph but the amounts of oh generated at the cathode and oh ions released during as adsorption on the hydrous fe oxide hydroxides would have been more than the h released during fe precipitation these reactions are possible reasons for the slight increase in solution ph according to the above results tec 5 min and the potential of 7 5 v were identified as optimal conditions for as v removal in these conditions cwho can be reached quickly only 5 min compared to 15 and 60 min at the potentials of 3 v and 5 v respectively while ensuring less energy usage than that at the potential value of 10 v therefore these conditions 5 min 7 5 v were chosen for analysis in the subsequent studies 3 1 3 effect of distance between electrodes this study was conducted at co of 0 1 mg l ph of 7 0 tec of 5 min u of 7 5 v and varying electrodes distance apart of 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 cm as can be seen from fig 4 a as v removal efficiency and current values increased when the distance between electrodes was reduced at electrodes distance apart of 0 5 cm the current density and as v removal efficiency reached 1 32 ma cm2 and 99 5 respectively these values fell to 0 45 ma cm2 and 92 respectively at an electrodes distance apart of 1 cm when the electrodes distance apart increased to 2 3 and 4 cm the ec system increasingly proved to be inefficient for removing as v reaching values of less than 20 this decline in removal efficiency can be explained as being caused by the increase in the space between the electrodes which in turn decreased the current generated down to 0 003 a the end result was less fe dissolution from the anode for its interaction with as v ions 5 similar outcomes were reported for the removal of other contaminants from water via the ec process such as removing water hardness using fe rod electrodes 31 mercury using al and fe electrodes 32 and indium ions using fe electrodes 33 song et al 12 reported that water motion turbulence mass transfer size of ec reactor and energy consumption in the ec process can be affected by electrode distance and therefore they can influence as removal efficiency for example with larger distance apart there is a decrease in mass transfer and movement of precipitant species which can lead to a reduction in reaction rate a good discussion on the various factors through which electrode distance affects the ec process was presented by song et al 12 although the inter electrode distance of 0 5 cm produced the best as v removal efficiency the cost of electrical power voltage x current consumed is high due to the high current generated therefore the next shortest inter electrode distance of 1 cm was selected as the optimal distance and applied in subsequent studies moreover this distance is more practical to maintain in the ec installation set up 3 1 4 effect of solution ph the solution ph is one of the important factors influencing contaminants removal in the water treatment process investigation of the effect of solution ph was conducted at ph varying from 6 to 8 because it is a common ph range in most as contaminated groundwater 7 fig 4b shows that as v removal efficiency slightly increased when ph was increased from 6 to 7 and then decreased as the ph is further increased to 8 the decrease in as v removal at lower ph is possibly due to the dissolution of iron hydroxide precipitates that were responsible for adsorbing the added as v 13 the reduction in as removal at the higher ph of 8 could be due to reduced adsorption of the more negatively charged as species on the negatively charged iron hydroxide precipitates 34 it is well known that the negative charges on the surface of fe oxide hydroxide 19 and on the as species increase h 2 a s o 4 to h a s o 4 2 with ph 35 based on the results of all the batch studies conducted it can be concluded that the optimum as v removal at co 0 1 mg l could be achieved at ph of 7 tec of 5 min electric potential of 7 5 v corresponding to the current density value of 0 45 ma cm2 and electrodes distance apart of 1 cm these conditions were therefore considered as the optimal conditions for the ec process and employed in the subsequent studies on the use of alternative power sources and continuous flow mode process 3 1 5 use of alternative power supply sources batch experiments with alternative power supply sources were conducted using either a 12 v solar panel or 9 v rechargeable battery and the as v removal efficiencies were compared with 10 v dc electricity source these experiments can provide vital information on whether renewable energy sources can replace the dc power supply used to treat as v in the ec system fig 5 shows that the as v removal efficiency of both renewable energy sources was approximately the same as that of the dc power supply 93 for rechargeable battery and 98 for solar panel compared with 96 for the dc electrical source the slight differences are due to the differences in voltage this result indicates that renewable energy sources such as a rechargeable battery or a small scale solar energy system can remove as v effectively in miniature portable ec systems that are suitable and affordable for rural households 3 2 continuous flow mode study this study was conducted in two ec systems the first ec system was operated with the 7 5 v dc electrical source which was the optimal voltage found in earlier experiments section 3 1 2 and the second one was with the small 12 v solar panel solution containing 0 1 mg as v l was continuously supplied to the ec reaction chamber at three different flow rates 12 6 3 l h corresponding to hrt of 5 10 and 20 min fig 6 shows that the as v removal efficiency in both systems was maintained at more than 91 during 4 h operation at all 3 flow rates the residual as v concentration in the effluent was always lower than that of the who drinking water guideline the solar energy system s as v treatment efficiency 96 was higher than that of the electrical system 91 at all flow rates due to the higher voltage of the solar panel results also show that the fe concentration average 0 17 mg l was below the who guideline value and the vietnam s water quality standard of 0 3 mg l for drinking water 36 37 the effluent concentration of ni and cr was 0 0132 and 0 0274 mg l respectively these values were also much lower than those of the who s drinking water guideline for these metals 0 07 mg l for ni and 0 05 mg l for cr 38 fig 6 also shows that a decrease of flow rate an increase of hrt increases the efficiency of as v removal this is because at higher hrt as v had longer time to interact with fe hydroxides leading to greater adsorption and co precipitation the results showed that the solar ec system with a flow rate of 12 l h could be chosen for use in decentralised systems in rural or isolated areas to remove as v though lower flow rates 3 l h and 6 l h can remove higher percentages of as v the volume of water treated would be lower however for contaminated water containing very high as concentrations lower flow rates higher hrts may be necessary at the flow rate of 12 l h an ec reactor of a small volume of 1 l could provide 12 l clean water per hour this flow rate is nearly the same as that of many commercial household filters currently being used 39 40 on a normal day the system can produce 48 l of as v free water during a 4 h operation which is enough to meet the drinking water demand of the average family although the solar energy system has many advantages such as simplicity cost effectiveness and non electrical appliance requirements its operation depends on the weather conditions the recommended solution for this issue as stated in section 2 2 is using an appropriate rechargeable battery for storing solar energy during favourable weather conditions and using it when solar energy is limited 3 3 ec operation cost operation cost is one of the most important factors in water treatment technologies because it decides the applicability of the treatment method in real life situations which primarily depends on users budgets the operation cost of the ec system in continuous flow mode was calculated for dc and solar power sources according to eq 3 and presented in table 1 here the price of australian electricity was assumed to be 0 30 aud kwh 0 23 usd kwh 41 3 treatment cost m3 water electricity cost m3 electrode cost m3 reactor cost m3 the lifespan of the anode for the small scale reactor was determined by measuring the amount of fe in solution for a given reactor of 1 l containing an initial as v concentration of 0 1 mg l operated at the optimal conditions ph 7 0 electrode distance 1 cm flow rate 12 l h u 7 5 v for dc power or 12 v for solar energy the sacrifice rate of anode celectrode was measured to be 0 516 mg l for the dc electrical ec system and 0 664 mg l for the solar energy ec system in 5 min in one day the ec system could treat 48 l water for 4 h 1 m3 in 20 83 days at a flow rate of 12 l h see section 3 3 for calculation and consume 24 77 and 31 87 mg of the anode for dc electricity and solar energy system respectively the weight of the submerged part of the selected anode in this reactor was measured as 32 000 mg assuming that the anode can be effectively used until 50 of it is dissolved the anode could be used for 645 32 000 mg 24 77 mg day 50 days using dc electricity source at u 7 5 v or 502 32 000 mg 31 87 mg day 50 days using solar energy at u 12 v the total volume of treated water produced per lifetime of the anode is calculated as 31 0 m3 645 days 20 83 days m3 water using the dc electricity source and 24 1 m3 502 days 20 83 days m3 water using a solar panel source the calculation shows that the dc electricity cost in this study is considerably low 0 00563 aud m3 of treated water while the cost of the solar energy system is zero the cost for the treatment of as contaminated water is 0 240 aud m3 water for the dc electrical ec system and 0 262 aud m3 for the solar ec system the slightly higher cost of the solar energy system is due to its higher voltage which dissolved larger amounts of the anode this resulted in a higher percentage of as removal resulting in as concentration in treated water 0 004 mg l of almost half the value obtained with dc electrical system 0 008 mg l fig 6 such a high percentage of removal is not required for the solution of as concentration 0 1 mg l used here because the final as concentration is well below the who limit 0 01 mg l however for waters containing higher initial as concentrations this is an advantage in comparison with the estimated cost reported in other ec studies the cost estimated in this study is lower this is primarily because other studies used much higher initial concentration of as which required a very high electrical power to bring down the concentration to below 10 μg l for example şık et al 30 reported the electricity and electrode cost as 0 546 usd m3 0 746 aud m3 to reduce the as v concentration from 200 μg l to 10 μg l in 12 min using fe ball anode with 0 3 a current when the inter electrode distance was kept at 7 5 mm thakur and mondal 35 reported treatment cost of 0 357 usd m3 0 488 aud m3 to reduce the initial as iii concentration from 550 μg l to 8 μg l using al electrodes at 1 cm distance apart with 10 a m2 current their treatment cost included cost of electrode chemicals electricity sludge disposal fixed cost both the above two studies used dc electricity for supplying the power whereas in the current study the cost was separately estimated for both dc and solar energy systems the as laden fe oxide hydroxide sludge formed in the ec process needs to be separated before the water can be used for drinking purpose there are many methods of separation of these sludge including settling gravitational sedimentation plus decantation membrane filtration etc these operations incur additional cost and they are discussed elsewhere 18 28 the separated sludge material should be disposed safely without causing any hazards to the environment one of the safe methods of disposal is encapsulation solidification employing cement and using the bricks formed in construction works 18 42 3 4 pilot trial in the field the pilot trial study was conducted under five different tec of 1 5 10 15 and 20 min the results of as removal by the 12 v solar panel ec system are presented in fig 7 at the initial total as concentration in groundwater of 0 030 mg l and tec 1 min the as was removed efficiently 80 0 removal and the treated water had as concentration below the vietnamese and who permissible limit for as in drinking water 0 010 mg l 36 the as removal efficiency increased to 86 7 90 0 93 9 and 94 2 when the tec increased to 5 10 15 and 20 min respectively however at the shortest time of tec 1 min the power usage is the lowest and therefore the cost of operation is the most economical on the other hand if the initial as concentration is high a longer time of operation is required to bring the as concentration in the treated water to below the who limit compared to the results of the laboratory batch study in the pilot trial a shorter time was found to be sufficient to produce as concentration below the safety level this phenomenon can be explained by the lower as concentration in the raw groundwater in comparison with the initial as concentration used in the laboratory study 0 10 mg l the fe concentration in the ec treated water varied slightly 0 18 0 28 mg l in comparison with that in the raw groundwater 0 27 mg l however the fe concentration in the treated water was well below the vietnam and who permissible limit for fe in drinking water 0 3 mg l 36 37 4 conclusions the new small scale household ec system developed with dc power supply using stainless steel electrodes could successfully remove as v from contaminated water and maintain the as concentration below the who recommended safety level in the batch study the ideal scenario for the ec system s operation was determined as ph 7 0 electrodes distance apart of 1 cm voltage of 7 5 v and current density of 0 45 ma cm2 for initial as v concentration of 0 1 mg l the batch study using a rechargeable battery and solar energy confirmed that these renewable energy sources could be used instead of the dc source to remove as v effectively in the ec system in the continuous water flow study both dc electricity and solar energy sources were able to supply the required power for the successful operation of the ec system with a low capital cost of 15 aud and running cost of 0 240 0 262 aud m3 treated water the system with both power sources could remove as v from water at very high rate of efficiency more than 91 96 a small volume ec reactor of 1 l could supply enough drinking water daily for a household and the anode replacement only needs to be done after more than 500 days at a 4 h day of operation the low cost ec system can be used with or without a dc electricity source so it can be implemented in all areas the laboratory study was repeated in a pilot field trial with a solar panel 12 v using groundwater in vietnam 0 030 mg as l and it was found to successfully remove as concentration below the vietnamese and who permissible limit in 1 min operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13537,recently electrocoagulation ec has emerged as a promising method to treat contaminated water in this study a novel ec system using stainless steel electrodes was applied to remove arsenate as v in water an operation time of 5 min electrical potential difference of 7 5 v and inter electrode distance of 1 cm were identified as optimal condition for removing as v eliminated 92 of as v from 0 1 mg as v l solution in the batch study using a 9 v rechargeable battery and a small 12 v solar panel the ec reactor removed 93 and 98 of as v from 0 1 mg as v l solution respectively and as v concentration in treated water was lower than that of the drinking water guideline of world health organisation who 0 01 mg l in the continuous water flow study a small cost effective system reactor volume of 1 l cost 15 aud using a small 12 v solar panel could successfully treat 12 l contaminated water per hour during 4 h of continuous testing the system s efficiency in removing as v remained constant at 91 the operation cost for the treatment of as v contaminated water in continuous operation mode is 0 240 aud m3 water for the direct current dc electrical system and 0 262 aud m3 for the solar system in a pilot field study with contaminated groundwater 0 03 mg total as l in hanam province vietnam the ec system using solar energy 12 v was able to reduce as concentration to below the vietnamese and who permissible drinking water limit in 1 min keywords arsenateremoval electrocoagulation stainless steel electrode solar energy water treatment 1 introduction arsenic as is one of the world s most hazardous contaminants it is estimated that more than 200 million people in 100 countries have been affected by drinking as polluted water 1 as being a potential human carcinogen causes many other diseases related to skin lungs etc 2 it is distributed in the environment through natural and anthropogenic processes 3 the two most toxic forms of as are arsenite as iii and arsenate as v and their concentrations are controlled mainly by redox conditions and solubility whilst as iii occurs at low redox potential and its solubility is 10 g 100 ml of water as v appears at a higher redox state and its solubility is up to 66 g 100 ml of water 2 although many technologies have been developed and applied to remove as from drinking water 4 as treatment is still a great challenge for the water industry especially at a small and affordable scale applicable to rural and isolated areas among these methods electrocoagulation ec is a promising method which could eliminate many of the disadvantages of other traditional water treatment techniques 5 6 for example adsorption has the problem of adsorbent regeneration interference from co existing anions and production of toxic exhausted adsorbent waste while chemical precipitation requires large amounts of chemical coagulants and sludge disposal problem some advantages of ec are its simple equipment requirements easy operation no use of chemicals oxidisation of as iii to as v during the process and less sludge production 6 8 however removing as through this method strongly depends on the operational conditions type of electrodes voltage current inter electrode distance operation time solution ph and initial as concentration and an electrical source that can be expensive or unavailable in many rural or isolated regions 9 many kinds of metal can be used as electrodes such as iron fe aluminium al stainless steel copper cu titanium ti and zinc zn 10 among these fe electrodes are the most widely used ucar et al 11 reported that when fe electrodes in monopolar parallel electrode connection mode were employed ec could remove up to 95 as v from 0 5 mg l synthetic water at a current density of 4 5 ma cm2 in a batch experimental process the hybrid electrodes with the combination of fe al or cu were also tested for removing as 12 the removal efficiency of the ec technique on treating as v with the above electrodes was reported to be 75 99 10 the application of stainless steel electrode also produced high as removals 13 15 though fe electrodes are the most popular electrodes used in the ec process they can create a problem of water turning into a yellow colour principally due to the production of fine particles of rust to overcome this challenge stainless steel anodes have been used 16 the main chemical reactions in the ec process and the reactions involving as v removal from the solution are presented in fig 1 17 the two prime mechanisms of as v removal in the ec process are co precipitation of as v with the various fe ion species generated in the ec process and adsorption of as v on the hydroxide precipitates of fe2 and fe3 these are depicted in the last four equations in the solution compartment of fig 1 18 the mechanism of adsorption is mainly inner sphere coordination 12 19 20 song et al 12 has provided an excellent review of the local coordination environment and the short ranged structure of iron and arsenic in terms of fe oxide octahedra corner and edge sharing with the as v tetrahedra to reduce the electricity cost of the ec method a few studies used solar power in ec to remove different contaminants in water an ec system utilising solar power and batteries 60 w capacity was shown to remove 92 of chemical oxygen demand and 49 of total dissolved solids by al electrodes at a distance apart of 1 cm in 20 min 21 in another study an ec system using a 30 2 v solar photovoltaic module containing 12 polycrystalline silicon cells was able to remove 99 9 of lead pb from a solution containing 10 mg pb l in 10 min 22 studies on the application of solar energy in the ec system for removing as from water are limited recently oh et al 23 used an ec system with large solar panels 380 750 w to remove as from groundwater in vietnam although this system obtained a high as removal efficiency 96 6 from a solution containing 0 376 mg l in 10 min and the as concentration in treated water was below the world health organisation who permissible drinking water limit 10 μg l this system was large in size and therefore the initial cost to install it was probably high moreover it can only be installed operated and maintained by qualified technicians and not by local residents instead of this type of large centralised solar energy system a simpler and smaller sized ec unit using smaller solar panels applicable to individual households as and when clean water is required is more suitable and affordable for rural areas in the present study a new ec process using stainless steel electrodes was utilised to remove as v from synthetic water the objectives of the study were i determine the removal efficiency of as v from synthetic solution using an ec system with stainless steel electrodes in both batch and continuous flow mode experiments ii determine the influence of many operating conditions of the ec system on as v removal including voltage current intensity inter electrode distance operation time and solution ph iii compare different power supply sources dc rechargeable battery and solar power on as v removal and their cost of operation iv test the ec system in a pilot field trial with contaminated groundwater collected from a household in vietnam rural area to analyse its practical applicability the pilot trial was conducted in hanam province vietnam while the laboratory studies were conducted in sydney australia if the small sized solar panel is found to be effective at low operational cost this could prove to be attractive for decentralised systems in rural or isolated areas used by individual households 2 material and methods 2 1 feed solution for the laboratory study a stock solution was prepared by dissolving 4 165 mg sodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o in 1 l milli q water to obtain a concentration of 1 mg as v l the stock solution was diluted with distilled water to the desired as v concentrations of 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 mg l for batch studies and 0 1 mg l for continuous flow mode studies in all experiments 1 10 3 m nacl was used as supporting electrolyte the initial solution ph was adjusted to 6 0 8 0 the ph range found to occur in groundwater to study the effect of ph on as v removal and in the other experiments the ph was kept constant at 7 0 0 2 by adding 0 1 m hno3 or 0 1 m naoh for the pilot study a contaminated groundwater sample collected from a household in ly nhan rural district hanam province vietnam was used hanam province is the most as polluted area in the country according to huy et al and nguyen et al 24 25 more than 52 of groundwater in this province is contaminated by as this water had ph tds as fe mn ca and mg concentrations of 7 2 212 mg l 0 03 mg l 0 27 mg l 0 41 mg l 84 mg l and 109 mg l respectively 2 2 ec system 2 2 1 laboratory study a couple of commercial stainless steel plates of grade 316 11 cm 6 cm 0 09 cm were used as anode and cathode the electrodes were hung inside a transparent polypropylene tank size of 10 2 10 2 20 cm by a glass stick in a monopolar parallel connection mode so that the submerged part of the electrodes inside the solution was 8 cm 6 cm 0 09 cm the solution volume was 1 l to maintain a uniform concentration the solution was mixed using a magnetic stirrer rotated at 120 rpm at the bottom of the tank batch and continuous mode experiments with dc electricity and rechargeable battery were conducted using this set up at room temperature of 25 1 c in the batch studies a regulated laboratory dc power supply system model mp 3840 was used to supply an electrical current with predetermined voltages to the electrodes fig 2 a the voltages and generated electrical current supplied by this dc system could be varied through its converter the performance of the ec system on as v removal was investigated at different conditions electric potential difference 3 0 10 v operation time 5 120 min initial as v concentration 0 1 0 5 mg l the distance between electrodes 0 5 4 cm and solution ph 6 8 in each experiment samples were periodically collected filtered through 0 45 μm filters and the filtrates were analysed for as using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms instrument agilent technologies 7900 the experimental scenario which produced an as v concentration smaller than the who s permissible limit for as in drinking water with the lowest energy consumption was considered to be the optimal treatment condition the initial and final ph of the solution in all experiments were measured using a ph meter model hq40d to investigate whether the ph of the solution changed and if so to what extent to evaluate the feasibility of using renewable energies two other experiments were carried out at the optimal condition of the ec system determined in the initial experiments using a 9 v rechargeable battery and a 12 v solar panel separately instead of the dc source of electricity fig 2a the 9 v rechargeable battery was simply connected to electrodes by using clips the small 12 v solar panel powertech was designed with 36 multi crystalline silicon solar cells and a maximum power of 5 w the size of the solar panel was 25 1 cm 20 5 cm 1 8 cm with a weight of 0 7 kg it was fitted with a blocking diode making it suitable for direct connection to the ec system by means of clips without using any intermediate equipment the experiments with the solar panel were conducted outdoors and in the winter season from 10 00 a m to 14 00 pm july and august 2020 australia the voltage and current density of the solar panel were measured using a multimeter voltage sensor model qm1529 it demonstrated that the solar energy during this period was enough for the ec system s operation the operation of the solar panel in general depends on the weather conditions on days when the sunlight is insufficient it is recommended that a simple and low cost rechargeable battery be employed for storing solar energy captured during bright sunny periods and then supply this stored power for the ec system on days with insufficient sunlight to evaluate the sacrifice dissolution rate of the anode in addition to the calculations using faraday s law see section 3 1 2 a chemical analysis was conducted to measure the fe concentration in the ec reactor 1 ml of suspension in the ec reactor at different operation times and currents was sampled and mixed with 5 ml each of 2 m hno3 and 1 m hcl the mixture was then shaken at 50 rpm at room temperature for 1 h filtered and analysed for fe using the icp ms instrument this is a modification of the method utilised by kalaruban et al 5 in the continuous flow mode study both the dc power supply system and the small 12 v solar panel were utilised separately with a small ec reactor containing 1 l of as contaminated water to investigate the as v removal efficiency the system was operated at different flow velocities of 3 6 and 12 l h corresponding to hydraulic retention times hrt of 20 10 and 5 min hrt min reactor volume l flow velocity l h 60 min a schematic diagram of the continuous flow reactor is presented in fig 2b the synthetic feed solution containing 0 1 mg as v l was pumped continuously by a dosing pump masterflex l s into the 1 l reactor at the optimal operating condition determined in the batch study u 7 5 v i 0 030 a ph 7 0 0 2 inter electrode distance 1 cm the treated solution then automatically flows into the 2 l clarifier the effluent samples in the clarifier were collected after 1 2 and 4 h then they were filtered and analysed for as fe nickel ni and chromium cr using icp ms instrument ni and cr were analysed as they are also components of stainless steel 2 2 2 pilot trial in the field with contaminated ground water in vietnam the pilot trial was conducted in hanam province vietnam a small 1 15 l acrylic tank equipped with two commercial 316 stainless steel plates size of 11 cm 10 cm 0 03 cm and a small solar panel 12 v was used as the ec reactor as contaminated groundwater from a household was treated by the same method as used in the laboratory batch study the trial was carried out at different operation times of 1 5 10 15 and 20 min and the inter electrode distance was kept constant at 1 0 cm effluent from the ec system was filtered through 0 45 μm filter and the filtrate was analysed for as and fe using an icp ms instrument agilent technologies 7900 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch study 3 1 1 effect of initial concentration and operation time effect of initial as v concentration co was investigated at three concentrations 0 1 0 25 and 0 5 mg l in this experiment the distance between electrodes initial ph and electrical potential difference u were 1 cm 7 0 and 3 v respectively under these conditions the current produced was very small only 0 007 a samples from the reactor container were collected at 5 10 15 30 45 60 90 and 120 min and analysed for as ph and fe fig 3 a depicts the effect of co on the residual as v concentration in water samples as a function of operation time tec min as can be seen from this figure the who permissible limit for as in drinking water cwho 10 μg l 26 was attained after 60 min for co of 0 1 mg l and 90 min for co of 0 25 mg l at co of 0 5 mg l the cwho could not be obtained within the 120 min tested in the experiment since as v concentration of around 0 1 mg l is the typical level reported for as contaminated groundwater in many countries 27 it was chosen for use in the subsequent studies fig 3a also shows that the as v removal rate was fast during the first hour and then decreased slowly with time for all as v concentrations as reported by others 7 13 this decline in the rate of as v removal is due to the decrease in solution concentration of as v which was in equilibrium with the as v adsorbed on the hydrous iron oxide hydroxide precipitates formed from fe dissolution derived from the anode during the ec process when the as v concentration drops so does the maximum loading of as v per mg of fe precipitates in equilibrium 28 these precipitates were formed by the reaction of fe with the oh ions generated at the cathode at the neutral ph of the solution 8 13 it is also possible that at longer ec times the as v concentrations became very small to produce any additional fe as co precipitation mainly because the solubility products of fe as precipitates would not have reached at these low as v concentrations the rate of removal of as v increased with initial as v concentration as reported by others 13 balasubramanian et al 13 reported that the rate of arsenic removal is proportional to the as v concentration and the amount of fe hydroxides formed and described it by pseudo second order kinetics since the generation of ferric hydroxide can be assumed constant for a given current density the rate of removal would follow a pseudo first order kinetics the percentage removal of as v 1 residual as v initial as v x 100 decreased with an increase in the initial as v concentration this is due to the fact that the ratio of hydroxo fe complexes to the initial as v concentration decreased with increase in influent concentration 13 3 1 2 effect of voltage and anode dissolution the effect of voltage was studied by keeping the distance between electrodes co and ph constant at 1 cm 0 1 mg l and 7 0 respectively the voltage of power supply source u was adjusted to 3 5 7 5 and 10 v and the corresponding values of the electrical current i were measured as 0 007 0 018 0 030 and 0 061 a with current densities of 0 11 0 27 0 45 and 0 92 ma cm2 respectively the experiment remained in operation for up to 120 min results showed that cwho could be reached in 15 min at 0 27 ma cm2 u 5 v which is much faster than that at 0 11 ma cm2 u 3 v fig 3b at the higher current densities of 0 45 ma cm2 u 7 5 v and 0 92 ma cm2 u 10 v cwho was reached extremely quickly within 5 min consistent with these data the increase in the electrical current led to rising as v removal efficiency for example at tec of 5 min the removal efficiency e increased from 24 to 58 5 92 and 96 corresponding to the rise of the current values from 0 007 a to 0 018 a 0 030 a and 0 061 a current densities of 0 11 0 27 0 45 and 0 92 ma cm2 respectively the possible reason for this is that at a higher electrical current a larger amount of fe from the anode was dissolved resulting in greater amounts of hydrous iron oxides hydroxides production 8 13 28 this led to the removal of a larger percentage of as v due to as v replacing the increasing number of hydroxyl groups in the iron precipitates 8 it is also possible that at high concentrations of fe larger amount of as is removed by co precipitation with fe 29 other studies also reported that as removal efficiency was proportional to the current density 8 15 28 another reason for the increased as removal with increased current density could be the increased rate of production of hydrogen gas at the cathode which captures the suspended colloidal fe as particles leading to additional removal of as 12 however at very high current density electrode polarization and passivation can occur causing loss of electrical energy which can lead to reduction in as removal fig 3b also shows that the as v removal efficiency significantly increased when tec increased from 5 min to 120 min for example at the current value of 0 018 a u 5 v as v removal efficiency at 5 min was only 58 8 however it increased to 79 7 after 10 min and reached almost 99 at 30 min the increase of tec elevated the amount of dissolved fe as observed for the effect of an increase in current the higher amounts of dissolved fe would have produced abundant fe hydrous oxides hydroxides leading to a greater amount of as v being removed by adsorption greater amounts of as v are also removed by co precipitation with fe at high concentrations of fe 29 to evaluate the sacrifice dissolution rate of the anode the mass of fe generated at the anode mfe mg and the electrode consumption concentration celectrode mg l calculation based on mfe for the as removal from water were calculated using chemical analysis and faraday s law the faraday s law equations are presented below 8 1 m f e i t e c m f e z f 2 c e l e c t r o d e i t e c m f e z f v where i is the current value a mfe is the molecular weight of iron 55 85 mg mol z is the number of electrons involved in the oxidation reduction reaction zfe 2 f is the faraday s constant 1 f 1608 06 a min mol tec is ec operation time min v is the solution volume v 1 l dura and breslin 16 reported that mainly fe2 was produced by the oxidation of stainless steel anode during the ec process they found that the fe2 concentration was 88 of the total dissolved fe produced at the anode lakshmanan et al 14 also stated that fe2 and not fe3 was produced at the fe anode they used for ec therefore the value of 2 was used for zfe in equations 1 and 2 as done by others for fe or stainless steel electrode 8 28 30 fig 3c depicts that the calculated amounts of fe ions generated as well as the weight of the anode lost increased with i and tec for example the fe concentrations calculated from this equation at the end of the experiment tec 120 min at i 0 007 0 018 0 030 and 0 061 a were 14 6 37 5 62 5 and 127 1 mg l respectively however the corresponding concentrations of fe dissolved from the anode measured by chemical analysis were much smaller i e 7 9 10 8 22 6 and 35 2 mg l respectively fig 3d the main reason for this difference is that part of the dissolved fe was precipitated or adsorbed to the anode and this was not included in the chemical analysis another reason is that faraday s law is valid only when all the electrons in the system participate solely in the metal dissolution reaction at the anode which seldom happens also the anode used does not consist of pure fe it is stainless steel which contains other metals such as cr ni and mn in addition to fe this is not taken into consideration in faraday s equation the percentage contents of fe cr ni and mn reported by the manufacturer for grade 316 stainless steel plates used in the study are 66 72 16 18 10 14 and 2 respectively assuming an approximate 69 for the fe content and the current used for the dissolution of each metal is proportionate to the contents of the metals in the electrode the calculated amount of fe dissolved from the electrode would be 69 of the values presented earlier in the paragraph the initial solution ph of 7 0 increased slightly up to a maximum of 8 0 during the ec process the precipitation of fe dissolved from the anode would have reduced ph but the amounts of oh generated at the cathode and oh ions released during as adsorption on the hydrous fe oxide hydroxides would have been more than the h released during fe precipitation these reactions are possible reasons for the slight increase in solution ph according to the above results tec 5 min and the potential of 7 5 v were identified as optimal conditions for as v removal in these conditions cwho can be reached quickly only 5 min compared to 15 and 60 min at the potentials of 3 v and 5 v respectively while ensuring less energy usage than that at the potential value of 10 v therefore these conditions 5 min 7 5 v were chosen for analysis in the subsequent studies 3 1 3 effect of distance between electrodes this study was conducted at co of 0 1 mg l ph of 7 0 tec of 5 min u of 7 5 v and varying electrodes distance apart of 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 cm as can be seen from fig 4 a as v removal efficiency and current values increased when the distance between electrodes was reduced at electrodes distance apart of 0 5 cm the current density and as v removal efficiency reached 1 32 ma cm2 and 99 5 respectively these values fell to 0 45 ma cm2 and 92 respectively at an electrodes distance apart of 1 cm when the electrodes distance apart increased to 2 3 and 4 cm the ec system increasingly proved to be inefficient for removing as v reaching values of less than 20 this decline in removal efficiency can be explained as being caused by the increase in the space between the electrodes which in turn decreased the current generated down to 0 003 a the end result was less fe dissolution from the anode for its interaction with as v ions 5 similar outcomes were reported for the removal of other contaminants from water via the ec process such as removing water hardness using fe rod electrodes 31 mercury using al and fe electrodes 32 and indium ions using fe electrodes 33 song et al 12 reported that water motion turbulence mass transfer size of ec reactor and energy consumption in the ec process can be affected by electrode distance and therefore they can influence as removal efficiency for example with larger distance apart there is a decrease in mass transfer and movement of precipitant species which can lead to a reduction in reaction rate a good discussion on the various factors through which electrode distance affects the ec process was presented by song et al 12 although the inter electrode distance of 0 5 cm produced the best as v removal efficiency the cost of electrical power voltage x current consumed is high due to the high current generated therefore the next shortest inter electrode distance of 1 cm was selected as the optimal distance and applied in subsequent studies moreover this distance is more practical to maintain in the ec installation set up 3 1 4 effect of solution ph the solution ph is one of the important factors influencing contaminants removal in the water treatment process investigation of the effect of solution ph was conducted at ph varying from 6 to 8 because it is a common ph range in most as contaminated groundwater 7 fig 4b shows that as v removal efficiency slightly increased when ph was increased from 6 to 7 and then decreased as the ph is further increased to 8 the decrease in as v removal at lower ph is possibly due to the dissolution of iron hydroxide precipitates that were responsible for adsorbing the added as v 13 the reduction in as removal at the higher ph of 8 could be due to reduced adsorption of the more negatively charged as species on the negatively charged iron hydroxide precipitates 34 it is well known that the negative charges on the surface of fe oxide hydroxide 19 and on the as species increase h 2 a s o 4 to h a s o 4 2 with ph 35 based on the results of all the batch studies conducted it can be concluded that the optimum as v removal at co 0 1 mg l could be achieved at ph of 7 tec of 5 min electric potential of 7 5 v corresponding to the current density value of 0 45 ma cm2 and electrodes distance apart of 1 cm these conditions were therefore considered as the optimal conditions for the ec process and employed in the subsequent studies on the use of alternative power sources and continuous flow mode process 3 1 5 use of alternative power supply sources batch experiments with alternative power supply sources were conducted using either a 12 v solar panel or 9 v rechargeable battery and the as v removal efficiencies were compared with 10 v dc electricity source these experiments can provide vital information on whether renewable energy sources can replace the dc power supply used to treat as v in the ec system fig 5 shows that the as v removal efficiency of both renewable energy sources was approximately the same as that of the dc power supply 93 for rechargeable battery and 98 for solar panel compared with 96 for the dc electrical source the slight differences are due to the differences in voltage this result indicates that renewable energy sources such as a rechargeable battery or a small scale solar energy system can remove as v effectively in miniature portable ec systems that are suitable and affordable for rural households 3 2 continuous flow mode study this study was conducted in two ec systems the first ec system was operated with the 7 5 v dc electrical source which was the optimal voltage found in earlier experiments section 3 1 2 and the second one was with the small 12 v solar panel solution containing 0 1 mg as v l was continuously supplied to the ec reaction chamber at three different flow rates 12 6 3 l h corresponding to hrt of 5 10 and 20 min fig 6 shows that the as v removal efficiency in both systems was maintained at more than 91 during 4 h operation at all 3 flow rates the residual as v concentration in the effluent was always lower than that of the who drinking water guideline the solar energy system s as v treatment efficiency 96 was higher than that of the electrical system 91 at all flow rates due to the higher voltage of the solar panel results also show that the fe concentration average 0 17 mg l was below the who guideline value and the vietnam s water quality standard of 0 3 mg l for drinking water 36 37 the effluent concentration of ni and cr was 0 0132 and 0 0274 mg l respectively these values were also much lower than those of the who s drinking water guideline for these metals 0 07 mg l for ni and 0 05 mg l for cr 38 fig 6 also shows that a decrease of flow rate an increase of hrt increases the efficiency of as v removal this is because at higher hrt as v had longer time to interact with fe hydroxides leading to greater adsorption and co precipitation the results showed that the solar ec system with a flow rate of 12 l h could be chosen for use in decentralised systems in rural or isolated areas to remove as v though lower flow rates 3 l h and 6 l h can remove higher percentages of as v the volume of water treated would be lower however for contaminated water containing very high as concentrations lower flow rates higher hrts may be necessary at the flow rate of 12 l h an ec reactor of a small volume of 1 l could provide 12 l clean water per hour this flow rate is nearly the same as that of many commercial household filters currently being used 39 40 on a normal day the system can produce 48 l of as v free water during a 4 h operation which is enough to meet the drinking water demand of the average family although the solar energy system has many advantages such as simplicity cost effectiveness and non electrical appliance requirements its operation depends on the weather conditions the recommended solution for this issue as stated in section 2 2 is using an appropriate rechargeable battery for storing solar energy during favourable weather conditions and using it when solar energy is limited 3 3 ec operation cost operation cost is one of the most important factors in water treatment technologies because it decides the applicability of the treatment method in real life situations which primarily depends on users budgets the operation cost of the ec system in continuous flow mode was calculated for dc and solar power sources according to eq 3 and presented in table 1 here the price of australian electricity was assumed to be 0 30 aud kwh 0 23 usd kwh 41 3 treatment cost m3 water electricity cost m3 electrode cost m3 reactor cost m3 the lifespan of the anode for the small scale reactor was determined by measuring the amount of fe in solution for a given reactor of 1 l containing an initial as v concentration of 0 1 mg l operated at the optimal conditions ph 7 0 electrode distance 1 cm flow rate 12 l h u 7 5 v for dc power or 12 v for solar energy the sacrifice rate of anode celectrode was measured to be 0 516 mg l for the dc electrical ec system and 0 664 mg l for the solar energy ec system in 5 min in one day the ec system could treat 48 l water for 4 h 1 m3 in 20 83 days at a flow rate of 12 l h see section 3 3 for calculation and consume 24 77 and 31 87 mg of the anode for dc electricity and solar energy system respectively the weight of the submerged part of the selected anode in this reactor was measured as 32 000 mg assuming that the anode can be effectively used until 50 of it is dissolved the anode could be used for 645 32 000 mg 24 77 mg day 50 days using dc electricity source at u 7 5 v or 502 32 000 mg 31 87 mg day 50 days using solar energy at u 12 v the total volume of treated water produced per lifetime of the anode is calculated as 31 0 m3 645 days 20 83 days m3 water using the dc electricity source and 24 1 m3 502 days 20 83 days m3 water using a solar panel source the calculation shows that the dc electricity cost in this study is considerably low 0 00563 aud m3 of treated water while the cost of the solar energy system is zero the cost for the treatment of as contaminated water is 0 240 aud m3 water for the dc electrical ec system and 0 262 aud m3 for the solar ec system the slightly higher cost of the solar energy system is due to its higher voltage which dissolved larger amounts of the anode this resulted in a higher percentage of as removal resulting in as concentration in treated water 0 004 mg l of almost half the value obtained with dc electrical system 0 008 mg l fig 6 such a high percentage of removal is not required for the solution of as concentration 0 1 mg l used here because the final as concentration is well below the who limit 0 01 mg l however for waters containing higher initial as concentrations this is an advantage in comparison with the estimated cost reported in other ec studies the cost estimated in this study is lower this is primarily because other studies used much higher initial concentration of as which required a very high electrical power to bring down the concentration to below 10 μg l for example şık et al 30 reported the electricity and electrode cost as 0 546 usd m3 0 746 aud m3 to reduce the as v concentration from 200 μg l to 10 μg l in 12 min using fe ball anode with 0 3 a current when the inter electrode distance was kept at 7 5 mm thakur and mondal 35 reported treatment cost of 0 357 usd m3 0 488 aud m3 to reduce the initial as iii concentration from 550 μg l to 8 μg l using al electrodes at 1 cm distance apart with 10 a m2 current their treatment cost included cost of electrode chemicals electricity sludge disposal fixed cost both the above two studies used dc electricity for supplying the power whereas in the current study the cost was separately estimated for both dc and solar energy systems the as laden fe oxide hydroxide sludge formed in the ec process needs to be separated before the water can be used for drinking purpose there are many methods of separation of these sludge including settling gravitational sedimentation plus decantation membrane filtration etc these operations incur additional cost and they are discussed elsewhere 18 28 the separated sludge material should be disposed safely without causing any hazards to the environment one of the safe methods of disposal is encapsulation solidification employing cement and using the bricks formed in construction works 18 42 3 4 pilot trial in the field the pilot trial study was conducted under five different tec of 1 5 10 15 and 20 min the results of as removal by the 12 v solar panel ec system are presented in fig 7 at the initial total as concentration in groundwater of 0 030 mg l and tec 1 min the as was removed efficiently 80 0 removal and the treated water had as concentration below the vietnamese and who permissible limit for as in drinking water 0 010 mg l 36 the as removal efficiency increased to 86 7 90 0 93 9 and 94 2 when the tec increased to 5 10 15 and 20 min respectively however at the shortest time of tec 1 min the power usage is the lowest and therefore the cost of operation is the most economical on the other hand if the initial as concentration is high a longer time of operation is required to bring the as concentration in the treated water to below the who limit compared to the results of the laboratory batch study in the pilot trial a shorter time was found to be sufficient to produce as concentration below the safety level this phenomenon can be explained by the lower as concentration in the raw groundwater in comparison with the initial as concentration used in the laboratory study 0 10 mg l the fe concentration in the ec treated water varied slightly 0 18 0 28 mg l in comparison with that in the raw groundwater 0 27 mg l however the fe concentration in the treated water was well below the vietnam and who permissible limit for fe in drinking water 0 3 mg l 36 37 4 conclusions the new small scale household ec system developed with dc power supply using stainless steel electrodes could successfully remove as v from contaminated water and maintain the as concentration below the who recommended safety level in the batch study the ideal scenario for the ec system s operation was determined as ph 7 0 electrodes distance apart of 1 cm voltage of 7 5 v and current density of 0 45 ma cm2 for initial as v concentration of 0 1 mg l the batch study using a rechargeable battery and solar energy confirmed that these renewable energy sources could be used instead of the dc source to remove as v effectively in the ec system in the continuous water flow study both dc electricity and solar energy sources were able to supply the required power for the successful operation of the ec system with a low capital cost of 15 aud and running cost of 0 240 0 262 aud m3 treated water the system with both power sources could remove as v from water at very high rate of efficiency more than 91 96 a small volume ec reactor of 1 l could supply enough drinking water daily for a household and the anode replacement only needs to be done after more than 500 days at a 4 h day of operation the low cost ec system can be used with or without a dc electricity source so it can be implemented in all areas the laboratory study was repeated in a pilot field trial with a solar panel 12 v using groundwater in vietnam 0 030 mg as l and it was found to successfully remove as concentration below the vietnamese and who permissible limit in 1 min operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

reduced to the standard level before discharging wastewater to the environment 1 2 total nitrogen tn is primarily presented in wastewater as ammonia nitrite nitrate and organically bonded nitrogen 3 monitoring the tn from the influent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps plays a significant role in the performance of nutrient removal systems controlling sludge production and operation of different parts of wastewater treatment processes 4 wastewater parameters especially nutrient compounds are really important for engineers to understand and calculate at the beginning and end of treatment 5 to obtain the necessary information the operator should determine the characteristics of the raw wastewater by receiving data from sensors or collecting samples and analyzing the influent effluent flow of the plant insufficiently treated wastewater which is one of the nutrient sources can cause many health problems by entering into the water bodies like groundwater systems 6 however many facilities have been upgraded by wwtps to progress in the removal of nutrient pollutants which resulting in a drastic decrease in the discharged nutrients from wwtps 7 8 artificial intelligent ai technics mostly used to predict natural or artificial processes in various disciplines machine learning ml as a subset of ai is a process of recognizing a special pattern based on the given data for prediction or classification purposes 9 recently modeling and prediction of environmental phenomena using ai technics are rapidly increased due to their high accuracy rather than mechanistic models 10 these algorithms can learn sophisticated relations more efficiently than statistical methods 11 13 a fully connected neural network known as ann model acts as a universal function estimator and each neuron in the network contains learnable parameters weight and bias a feed forward ann can be used for wwtps influent and or effluent quality prediction 14 15 many studies have been addressed to model the influent or effluent wastewater parameters for instance ann models are employed to estimate the methane production in a biogas optimization scenario while having r2 0 87 16 also another similar modeling was conducted to follow the correlation of supplements membrane bioreactor of wwtp 17 ansari et al integrated a hybrid genetic algorithm with fuzzy logic ga fis model to increase the prediction of missing value in the wastewater parameters record like cod bod and nh4 n and compared it with fuzzy logic anfis model results presented that integrated ga fis had lower errors in contrast to anfis prediction 18 in another study abba et al studied an extreme learning machine elm model combined with kernel principal component analysis kpca for prediction of ph turbidity total dissolved solids and hardness which had the highest accuracy for almost all predicted components r2 0 95 19 random forest rf and gradient boosting machine gbm are other state of the art and powerful

process is utilized in the pre processing section for increasing the speed of training and enhancing the prediction precision as well as simplifying the models 24 although there have been many different fs methods most forecasting studies just use correlation models like the pearson correlation method hence a comparative evaluation of the fs effect on enhancing the accuracy of simulation for wwtps components is still required also prediction of wwtp components with rf and gbm is less used in comparison to other ml techniques i e ann svm etc 23 25 26 this study aims to investigate the effect of various feature selection methods for enhancing the prediction performance of tn in the wwtps the specific objectives of this paper are i defining scenarios according to the different fs suggestions and compare together ii create ml models by using algorithms such as ann rf and gbm for comparing scenarios and find the best tn forecasting model and iii evaluate the potential of using a state of the art gbm algorithm as a new ml model for tn prediction and compared with the conventional methods rf and ann 2 methodology 2 1 case study of wwtp and data description in this research a data set from north torbat wwtp for nutrients removal which is located in the north of iran was investigated this wwtp is designed for a population of 350 000 pe with a mean daily influent flow of 71 500 m3 d the wwtp consists of a primary sedimentation tank anaerobic aerobic reactors and a clarifier the ph and do are monitored using online sensors and the rest of the influent characteristics are recorded using sampling and analysis based on the standard for wastewater analysis method 27 a data set consisting of 800 records almost 2 5 years between 2015 2017 daily recording of total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh n biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss ph dissolved oxygen do for the training of models also 30 days from the last data set was selected for the test of models unseen data furthermore for obtaining an accurate model the data set should be normalized and unnecessary redundant features should be eliminated feature selection to avoid overfitting issues 28 29 one of the main points of this study is to compare different applicable feature selection methods and their effects on model precision tn was selected as a target of prediction in this study due to the level of importance in the wwtps as a critical influent quality index and the rest of parameters were selected as input data based on feature selection ranking 2 2 feature selection fs the main goal of feature selection fs is to obtain the most relevant input data from a dataset considering a dataset with m features then 2 m subsets of features are available and the fs methods are responsible for introducing the best subset in each method related to the criterion and application of the model several functions are responsible to optimize and evaluate the subset the fs methods are divided into three major categories filters wrappers and embedded methods 30 32 filter methods emphasize on characteristics of each feature and they evaluate the features based on the properties without employing any clustering algorithm to guide the search 30 wrapper methods use clustering algorithms if the introduced subset increased the accuracy of the clustering algorithms then the subset earns a higher score 30 embedded techniques combine all the advantages of wrappers and filters they construct an ml algorithm and it performs feature selection while training the model 33 in this study variance threshold 34 analysis of variance anova 35 mutual information mi 36 37 pearson correlation pc 38 backward elimination be 39 random forest rf 40 and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso were used 41 42 the details of each method can be found in supplementary information 2 3 modeling approaches 2 3 1 artificial neural networks anns an artificial neural network ann is a fully connected multilayer perceptron mlp with three layers input hidden and output fig 1 the network may have several hidden layers concerning the level of complexity of the data set 43 44 in this study the number of input neurons of the model is equal to the number of input features which depends on the scenario considered subset also two hidden layers with 15 and 10 neurons are designed to capture the complexity of the model for having a smooth and accurate connection between layers we used the relu activation function for the hidden layers finally there is a single neuron in the output layer to predict the target variable tn the optimization process was performed by adam s algorithm concerning the mean squared error mse as a loss function with 100 epochs 2 3 2 random forest rf ensemble learning is a technique that combines the prediction results of multiple algorithms to obtain a better final result random forest rf is an ensemble method that uses bootstrap aggregation to generate decision trees the final output of the model is an aggregation of the prediction based on the decision trees fig 2 this method helps to consider all potential features fairly and prevents trees to become highly correlated 45 in this study after many trials and errors a random forest tree was developed considering 400 trees in the forest a maximum depth of 70 for each tree minimum of 4 samples at a leaf and a minimum number of 10 samples required to split 2 3 3 gradient boosting machine gbm gradient boosting machine is a decision tree based ml algorithm similar to rf but it has a different constructive strategy of the ensemble formation in a boosting approach we add new trees to the ensemble sequentially according to the error of the whole ensemble prediction as we add new trees with a constant learning rate the estimation error regarding the dependent variable shrinks continuously until reaching the maximum possible precision due to the nature of gbm hyper parameters justification is extremely important 46 in the current research after many trials we used a gradient boosting machine with considering the learning rate of 0 05 for training 2000 trees in the forest subsampling of a total of 0 8 a min sample leaf of 50 a tree depth of 6 and 600 as minimum split samples 2 4 model construction the total data set was divided into two groups train data almost 90 of total data set and test data 10 of the total data set as unseen data followed by applying to preprocess and feature selection methods furthermore four scenarios were defined to compare the feature selection methods also for the prediction of the target tn three prediction models containing fully connected artificial neural network ann random forest rf and state of the art gradient boosting machine gbm were selected and applied for all sub data sets the normalized data were used as input data for training and testing all models after defining different scenarios and model structures the tn concentration was forecasted by noted models then the predicted values were compared to the real data to evaluate the model accuracy fig 3 2 5 model evaluation to measure the quality and performance of a model several model metrics can be employed depending on the model task data types and scenarios in this article models are scored based on the coefficient of determination r2 eq 1 root mean square error rmse eq 2 and mean absolute error mae eq 3 47 1 r 2 1 a i p i 2 a i μ a 2 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n a i p i 2 3 m a e 1 n i 1 n a i p i where i 1 2 n is the number of observations and n is the total number of records considering a i for output p i as real values and μ a as mean value 3 results and discussion 3 1 data statistical information a brief demonstration of primary statistical properties min mean max and standard deviation is represented in table 1 3 2 summary of selected feature procedure each fs method has a particular subset suggestion as described in table 2 the variance threshold revealed the redundant features filter methods anova and mi suggesting very similar subsets and pc is indicating nh4 n with the highest correlation to the target variable tn as the target of the prediction displayed a strong correlation with nh4 n cod and bod respectively and a weak correlation with ph and do as can be seen in the pearson correlation result supplementary file fig s6 the highest correlation 1 0 among input parameters belonged to mlss and mlvss and the lowest value was related to bod and ph generally fs algorithms are pointing at nh4 n cod and bod as the best possible subset while lasso is showing a different result besides four scenarios as shown in table 3 were grouped based on fs suggestions and they were compared with ann rf and gbm techniques to introduce the best scenario details for the result of each fs process can be found in the supplementary information file 3 3 prediction results after training the models in various scenarios the whole dataset was predicted by models fig 4 then model metrics were calculated r2 rmse and mae for both training and test dataset the model metrics of each scenario are described in both data sets table 4 according to scenario i with only one feature nh4 n rf has the best performance on the training set but its performance dropped significantly on the test data set which shows serious overfitting issues similarly ann and gbm lost their precision but with a lower difference these two models with r2 0 52 had a better outcome for this scenario on the test data set in scenario ii although more features were introduced to the models and accuracy on the training set was increased the performance on the test data set was decreased this result is indicating the introduced subset is not adding precision to the models but it is causing overfitting issues for these features gbm has the best result on the test dataset with r2 0 52 in scenario iii the rf has the highest accuracy on the training dataset and the lowest performance on the test dataset in this scenario ann performance was increased slightly so it is showing that this subset has a better outcome than the subset in scenario ii for neural network algorithms while it is causing overfitting issues for decision tree algorithms gbm and rf the last scenario iv showed better results compared to previous scenarios as indicated in table 4 the rmse of test data of this subset is 0 092 0 095 and 0 095 for gbm rf and ann respectively in this scenario rf had less overfitting ann performance was increased and gbm had the best performance both on training set r2 0 88 and test data set r2 0 58 gbm has the highest precision followed by rf and ann in scenario iv also among fs methods mutual information has better performance because it was the only technique that considered do as effective variable the results revealed that how sensitive is ann to selecting the wrong features in scenario ii and scenario iii with adding more features to the subset the ann metrics decreased on the test dataset similarly rf with very high performance on the training dataset suffered from more overfitting issues due to introducing inefficient subsets in scenario ii and scenario iii in contrast gbm showed a more robust model introducing wrong features to gbm didn t change the model performance considerably and more or less it kept the performance level similar to previous subsets but with introducing the best subset scenario iv gbm showed an exceptional improvement in model evaluation so generally it can be said that decision tree algorithms rf and gbm showed better performance than the neural network model ann according to table 4 and fig 4 comparing scenario i with scenario ii and iii the accuracy of models on capturing the complexity of the training dataset was increased while the model performance on the test dataset was not improved this means that the model learned the training dataset very well but not able to generalize the patterns perfectly among all models rf has had the best match with real data on the training data set and faced more with overfitting issues in scenario iv gbm showed the best matching with real data as well as a great improvement in generalizing the patterns for the unseen dataset prediction of critical characteristics like tn in the wwtp influent is a topic in which many researchers attempt to propose various methods to enhance precision in recent approaches with ml methods and data driven decision techniques better results are demonstrated table 4 it is noticeable that due to the sophisticated nature of different processes in wwtps there is no single adequate model for all types of similar issues consequently this matter has required the improvement of more solid and effective models utilizing accessible information 48 52 table 5 shows the summarized information of recently tn prediction studies in various wwtps based on table 5 guo et al 48 utilized svm support vector machine and ann to predict tn concentration in a wwtp the models have trained 200 records and tested during the 90 days the model performance indicated the coefficient of determination 0 46 and 0 47 for svm and ann respectively in a different approach tomperi 5 firstly performed extensive feature selection methods such as stepwise selection forward selection and genetic algorithms then they developed a k fold model to predict tn with r2 0 69 without testing on unseen data also yaqub et al 49 proposed a prediction method for tn by developing a two layered stacked long short term memory lstm network on a large data set 6000 training and 1876 testing with a low average model error mse 0 015 in addition to that hybrid simulation can be helpful for accurate prediction of tn for example hvala et al 50 designed a parallel serial hybrid model machine learning and mechanistic models on a data set 400 train and 250 test data set with high accuracy r2 0 81 combining external biological simulation mechanistic modeling to ml algorithm caused high model precision hence considering based on standalone ml prediction the proposed model by this study is a high accuracy model for tn prediction among recent similar studies 4 conclusions in the present study the importance of using suitable fs as a booster of prediction was evaluated also the following conclusions were derived from this study as follows selecting a suitable feature selection for obtaining the best possible input data increases the prediction precision up to 20 considering the outcome of recent literature for tn prediction in the influent effluent flow of wwtp this study demonstrated high precision prediction by mutual information fs model and gbm prediction algorithm scenarios iii and iv declared a more reliable performance of the model predictions which means that the wrapper feature selections anova random forest backward elimination and mi can select the level of features importance better than commonly used filter methods decision tree algorithms rf and gbm revealed better performance results in comparison to neural network algorithm ann and gbm has the highest accuracy r2 0 58 rmse 0 092 and mae 0 017 for the test dataset respectively followed by rf and ann in the best scenario iv gbm is less sensitive to add or remove features to the subset in contrast ann accuracy drops significantly if redundant features are added declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of

model precision tn was selected as a target of prediction in this study due to the level of importance in the wwtps as a critical influent quality index and the rest of parameters were selected as input data based on feature selection ranking 2 2 feature selection fs the main goal of feature selection fs is to obtain the most relevant input data from a dataset considering a dataset with m features then 2 m subsets of features are available and the fs methods are responsible for introducing the best subset in each method related to the criterion and application of the model several functions are responsible to optimize and evaluate the subset the fs methods are divided into three major categories filters wrappers and embedded methods 30 32 filter methods emphasize on characteristics of each feature and they evaluate the features based on the properties without employing any clustering algorithm to guide the search 30 wrapper methods use clustering algorithms if the introduced subset increased the accuracy of the clustering algorithms then the subset earns a higher score 30 embedded techniques combine all the advantages of wrappers and filters they construct an ml algorithm and it performs feature selection while training the model 33 in this study variance threshold 34 analysis of variance anova 35 mutual information mi 36 37 pearson correlation pc 38 backward elimination be 39 random forest rf 40 and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso were used 41 42 the details of each method can be found in supplementary information 2 3 modeling approaches 2 3 1 artificial neural networks anns an artificial neural network ann is a fully connected multilayer perceptron mlp with three layers input hidden and output fig 1 the network may have several hidden layers concerning the level of complexity of the data set 43 44 in this study the number of input neurons of the model is equal to the number of input features which depends on the scenario considered subset also two hidden layers with 15 and 10 neurons are designed to capture the complexity of the model for having a smooth and accurate connection between layers we used the relu activation function for the hidden layers finally there is a single neuron in the output layer to predict the target variable tn the optimization process was performed by adam s algorithm concerning the mean squared error mse as a loss function with 100 epochs 2 3 2 random forest rf ensemble learning is a technique that combines the prediction results of multiple algorithms to obtain a better final result random forest rf is an ensemble method that uses bootstrap aggregation to generate decision trees the final output of the model is an aggregation of the prediction based on the decision trees fig 2 this method helps to consider all potential features fairly and prevents trees to become highly correlated 45 in this study after many trials and errors a random forest tree was developed considering 400 trees in the forest a maximum depth of 70 for each tree minimum of 4 samples at a leaf and a minimum number of 10 samples required to split 2 3 3 gradient boosting machine gbm gradient boosting machine is a decision tree based ml algorithm similar to rf but it has a different constructive strategy of the ensemble formation in a boosting approach we add new trees to the ensemble sequentially according to the error of the whole ensemble prediction as we add new trees with a constant learning rate the estimation error regarding the dependent variable shrinks continuously until reaching the maximum possible precision due to the nature of gbm hyper parameters justification is extremely important 46 in the current research after many trials we used a gradient boosting machine with considering the learning rate of 0 05 for training 2000 trees in the forest subsampling of a total of 0 8 a min sample leaf of 50 a tree depth of 6 and 600 as minimum split samples 2 4 model construction the total data set was divided into two groups train data almost 90 of total data set and test data 10 of the total data set as unseen data followed by applying to preprocess and feature selection methods furthermore four scenarios were defined to compare the feature selection methods also for the prediction of the target tn three prediction models containing fully connected artificial neural network ann random forest rf and state of the art gradient boosting machine gbm were selected and applied for all sub data sets the normalized data were used as input data for training and testing all models after defining different scenarios and model structures the tn concentration was forecasted by noted models then the predicted values were compared to the real data to evaluate the model accuracy fig 3 2 5 model evaluation to measure the quality and performance of a model several model metrics can be employed depending on the model task data types and scenarios in this article models are scored based on the coefficient of determination r2 eq 1 root mean square error rmse eq 2 and mean absolute error mae eq 3 47 1 r 2 1 a i p i 2 a i μ a 2 2 r m s e 1 n i 1 n a i p i 2 3 m a e 1 n i 1 n a i p i where i 1 2 n is the number of observations and n is the total number of records considering a i for output p i as real values and μ a as mean value 3 results and discussion 3 1 data statistical information a brief demonstration of primary statistical properties min mean max and standard deviation is represented in table 1 3 2 summary of selected feature procedure each fs method has a particular subset suggestion as described in table 2 the variance threshold revealed the redundant features filter methods anova and mi suggesting very similar subsets and pc is indicating nh4 n with the highest correlation to the target variable tn as the target of the prediction displayed a strong correlation with nh4 n cod and bod respectively and a weak correlation with ph and do as can be seen in the pearson correlation result supplementary file fig s6 the highest correlation 1 0 among input parameters belonged to mlss and mlvss and the lowest value was related to bod and ph generally fs algorithms are pointing at nh4 n cod and bod as the best possible subset while lasso is showing a different result besides four scenarios as shown in table 3 were grouped based on fs suggestions and they were compared with ann rf and gbm techniques to introduce the best scenario details for the result of each fs process can be found in the supplementary information file 3 3 prediction results after training the models in various scenarios the whole dataset was predicted by models fig 4 then model metrics were calculated r2 rmse and mae for both training and test dataset the model metrics of each scenario are described in both data sets table 4 according to scenario i with only one feature nh4 n rf has the best performance on the training set but its performance dropped significantly on the test data set which shows serious overfitting issues similarly ann and gbm lost their precision but with a lower difference these two models with r2 0 52 had a better outcome for this scenario on the test data set in scenario ii although more features were introduced to the models and accuracy on the training set was increased the performance on the test data set was decreased this result is indicating the introduced subset is not adding precision to the models but it is causing overfitting issues for these features gbm has the best result on the test dataset with r2 0 52 in scenario iii the rf has the highest accuracy on the training dataset and the lowest performance on the test dataset in this scenario ann performance was increased slightly so it is showing that this subset has a better outcome than the subset in scenario ii for neural network algorithms while it is causing overfitting issues for decision tree algorithms gbm and rf the last scenario iv showed better results compared to previous scenarios as indicated in table 4 the rmse of test data of this subset is 0 092 0 095 and 0 095 for gbm rf and ann respectively in this scenario rf had less overfitting ann performance was increased and gbm had the best performance both on training set r2 0 88 and test data set r2 0 58 gbm has the highest precision followed by rf and ann in scenario iv also among fs methods mutual information has better performance because it was the only technique that considered do as effective variable the results revealed that how sensitive is ann to selecting the wrong features in scenario ii and scenario iii with adding more features to the subset the ann metrics decreased on the test dataset similarly rf with very high performance on the training dataset suffered from more overfitting issues due to introducing inefficient subsets in scenario ii and scenario iii in contrast gbm showed a more robust model introducing wrong features to gbm didn t change the model performance considerably and more or less it kept the performance level similar to previous subsets but with introducing the best subset scenario iv gbm showed an exceptional improvement in model evaluation so generally it can be said that decision tree algorithms rf and gbm showed better performance than the neural network model ann according to table 4 and fig 4 comparing scenario i with scenario ii and iii the accuracy of models on capturing the complexity of the training dataset was increased while the model performance on the test dataset was not improved this means that the model learned the training dataset very well but not able to generalize the patterns perfectly among all models rf has had the best match with real data on the training data set and faced more with overfitting issues in scenario iv gbm showed the best matching with real data as well as a great improvement in generalizing the patterns for the unseen dataset prediction of critical characteristics like tn in the wwtp influent is a topic in which many researchers attempt to propose various methods to enhance precision in recent approaches with ml methods and data driven decision techniques better results are demonstrated table 4 it is noticeable that due to the sophisticated nature of different processes in wwtps there is no single adequate model for all types of similar issues consequently this matter has required the improvement of more solid and effective models utilizing accessible information 48 52 table 5 shows the summarized information of recently tn prediction studies in various wwtps based on table 5 guo et al 48 utilized svm support vector machine and ann to predict tn concentration in a wwtp the models have trained 200 records and tested during the 90 days the model performance indicated the coefficient of determination 0 46 and 0 47 for svm and ann respectively in a different approach tomperi 5 firstly performed extensive feature selection methods such as stepwise selection forward selection and genetic algorithms then they developed a k fold model to predict tn with r2 0 69 without testing on unseen data also yaqub et al 49 proposed a prediction method for tn by developing a two layered stacked long short term memory lstm network on a large data set 6000 training and 1876 testing with a low average model error mse 0 015 in addition to that hybrid simulation can be helpful for accurate prediction of tn for example hvala et al 50 designed a parallel serial hybrid model machine learning and mechanistic models on a data set 400 train and 250 test data set with high accuracy r2 0 81 combining external biological simulation mechanistic modeling to ml algorithm caused high model precision hence considering based on standalone ml prediction the proposed model by this study is a high accuracy model for tn prediction among recent similar studies 4 conclusions in the present study the importance of using suitable fs as a booster of prediction was evaluated also the following conclusions were derived from this study as follows selecting a suitable feature selection for obtaining the best possible input data increases the prediction precision up to 20 considering the outcome of recent literature for tn prediction in the influent effluent flow of wwtp this study demonstrated high precision prediction by mutual information fs model and gbm prediction algorithm scenarios iii and iv declared a more reliable performance of the model predictions which means that the wrapper feature selections anova random forest backward elimination and mi can select the level of features importance better than commonly used filter methods decision tree algorithms rf and gbm revealed better performance results in comparison to neural network algorithm ann and gbm has the highest accuracy r2 0 58 rmse 0 092 and mae 0 017 for the test dataset respectively followed by rf and ann in the best scenario iv gbm is less sensitive to add or remove features to the subset in contrast ann accuracy drops significantly if redundant features are added declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of

13539,pre ozonation is often used before ultrafiltration uf to control membrane fouling usually by supplying ozone into water or wastewater via aeration however the role of aeration in pre ozonation for mitigation of membrane fouling has not been well elucidated hence in this study bovine serum albumin bsa was used as a protein type foulant in experiments on the outcomes and underlying mechanisms of pre ozonation the change in the membrane fouling behavior the transformation of bsa and the fouling layer properties were investigated after pre ozonation with and without aeration the results showed that the membrane fouling notably declined after pre ozonation which mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between ozone oxidation and aeration ozone oxidation unfolded the bsa molecules and exposed their hydrophobic groups and these unfolded bsa aggregated and adhered to the surface of the microbubbles produced by aeration this induced bsa foaming and aggregation in the ozonated suspension with pre ozonation for a short contact time of 5 min small bsa aggregates in water were retained on the uf membrane surface to form a highly porous deposition layer with a low filtration resistance with pre ozonation for a contact time of 10 min or longer bsa foaming led to the formation of large aggregates that were efficiently removed from water in the ozone reactor which greatly reduced the foulant loading of the water and its subsequent membrane fouling rate in contrast when quantitative and quiescent ozonation was performed without aeration ozone oxidation alone worsened the membrane fouling propensity of the bsa solution keywords ultrafiltration membrane fouling pre ozonation synergistic effect ozone oxidation aeration 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf membranes are widely used for water and wastewater treatment owing to advantages including high effluent quality pathogen and bacteria removal a small footprint and a lack of secondary pollution 1 3 however membrane fouling which greatly increases the treatment cost and decreases membrane permeability and lifespan remains a major obstacle to the more widespread application of uf technologies many techniques to mitigate fouling have been developed in recent decades among which pre oxidation of the feed water with an oxidant ozone chlorine hydrogen peroxide etc is considered to be a simple and effective method 4 5 ozone a powerful oxidizing agent with oxidation potential of 2 07 v has attracted much attention for the pretreatment of feed water before membrane filtration 6 7 some research has been carried out to investigate the effects of pre ozonation on membrane fouling behavior and in most cases it was reported that pre ozonation could mitigate membrane fouling significantly 8 10 however contradictory experimental findings have also been reported for instance liang s group investigated the fouling behavior of the uf membrane filtration of several model organic foulants and natural surface waters before and after pre ozonation 11 they found that for humic acid sodium alginate and natural surface water membrane fouling was noticeably lessened after pre ozonation but for protein like foulants membrane fouling was not reduced by pre ozonation moreover yu et al reported that protein fouling of uf membranes increased considerably after pre ozonation which they suggested was caused by ozone induced protein aggregation 12 it appears that pre ozonation could have an adverse effect on membrane fouling control for protein like foulants in water however for bovine serum albumin bsa the same model protein foulant studied by yu et al yin et al found that the membrane fouling rate and irreversible fouling were effectively reduced by pre ozonation 13 14 they attributed this result to the increase in net charge and hydrophilicity of bsa after ozonation which increased the electrostatic repulsion and reduced the hydrophobic interaction force between bsa and the membrane moreover song et al found that at a low ozone dosage membrane fouling was mitigated by pre ozonation whereas a further increase in the ozone dosage resulted in severe membrane fouling 15 they proposed that the membrane fouling at a high ozone dosage was caused by the oligomerization and agglomeration of bsa before membrane filtration to date no unified explanation or predictive model has been proposed for the effect of pre ozonation on the protein fouling of uf membranes most researchers used the relative size between the foulants and membrane pores altered by ozonation to explain the resulting changes in membrane fouling behavior 4 however one interesting phenomenon was observed in certain previous studies pre ozonation can promote the agglomeration of protein foulants to form relatively large aggregates in water 12 15 in particular song s group found that a large amount of foam was produced on the surface of the protein solution during pre ozonation with numerous visible and sticky bsa flocs protein aggregation has been suggested as an important factor in relation to membrane fouling and its control 15 moreover the bsa aggregation and accumulation in water during pre ozonation appear visibly rather similar to the scum formation that occurs during air flotation in most cases ozone is supplied via aeration with a vast number of bubbles injected into the aqueous solution 16 given that proteins are a typical amphiphilic substance with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups the ozone gas bubbles could easily adhere to the hydrophobic sites of the proteins 17 18 taken together the action of aeration during ozonation may play a crucial role in protein aggregation that is aeration may be another key factor for the control of protein fouling of membranes 19 20 however the role of aeration in protein aggregation during the pre ozonation treatment and the interaction between ozone oxidation and aeration for the control of membrane fouling remain to be investigated in this study bsa was selected to represent the protein like foulants in water or wastewater for membrane filtration pre ozonation of the bsa solution via ozone aeration pre ozonation for short was performed as a pretreatment for control of membrane fouling for comparison separate experiments of only aeration without ozone and quantitative ozonation without aeration were also conducted on the bsa solution polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membranes were used for filtration experiments on the bsa solutions before and after the comparative pretreatments the membrane fouling behavior during the filtration of the bsa solutions was tested the formation of aggregate flocs and membrane fouling layers under the various pretreatment conditions was also investigated to reveal the mechanism of pre ozonation for the control of protein fouling during membrane filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 bsa working solutions and pvdf uf membranes bsa 98 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa who specified its isoelectric point and molecular weight as ph 4 7 and 67 kda respectively the bsa stock solution 1 0 g l was prepared by dissolving 1 0 g bsa in 1 l milli q water and was stored in sterilized glass bottles at 4 c 21 the bsa working solution with a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 10 mg l ph 7 0 0 2 was freshly prepared by diluting the bsa stock solution with deionized water flat sheet pvdf uf membranes were used for the experimental study on membrane filtration the uf membranes were prepared in the laboratory by the phase inversion method following previously described procedures 22 the main materials for making the uf membranes were pvdf solef 1015 solvay advanced polymers usa and n n dimethylacetamide dmac tianjin fucheng chemical reagent china the pure water flux of the as prepared uf membrane at 0 10 mpa was 250 20 l m 2 h 1 and bsa molecules had a rejection ratio of 93 by the membrane the average contact angle surface roughness and surface zeta potential of the membranes were 70 4 0 nm and 19 mv ph 7 0 respectively 2 2 pretreatment of the bsa working solution the bsa solution was pretreated before filtration by i pre ozonation ozonation by aeration of the ozone gas ii aeration only by oxygen gas without ozone and iii quantitative and quiescent ozonation by the ozone solution without aeration the schematic diagram of pre ozonation is shown in fig 1 including an oxygen cylinder an ozone generator 3s t3 beijing tonglin technology china and an ozone reactor containing 2 l of the bsa working solution or water a 5 μm titanium alloy aerator was installed at the bottom of the reactor to diffuse the gaseous ozone or ultrapure oxygen into the bsa working solutions or water for pre ozonation gaseous ozone a mixture of ultrapure oxygen and ozone was produced at a flow rate of 0 5 l min and bubbled into the bsa working solution the ozone contact times were set to 5 10 and 20 min the gaseous ozone concentration and the amount of ozone supply were determined by iodine stoichiometric titration 11 23 after pre ozonation the concentration of residual ozone in the working solution was also measured before blowing it off with pure n2 for quantitative ozonation by ozone solution 2 l ice water was added into the reactor and gaseous ozone was continuously supplied at a flow rate of 1 l min after 15 min the ice in water melted and a concentrated ozone solution was obtained with a dissolved ozone concentration of 30 40 mg l the ozone solution was added at different amounts into the bsa working solutions corresponding to ozone dosing concentrations of 0 1 5 3 0 and 4 5 mg l whereas the resulting doc concentration of the bsa solutions was kept constant at 10 mg l the bsa solutions with the predetermined ozone concentrations were kept in airproof and dark conditions for 30 min the residual ozone in the ozonated solutions was then measured before its removal by n2 blowing for aeration only the process was the same as pre ozonation but the ozone generator was turned off and only ultrapure oxygen was bubbled into the bsa solution in the reactor the flow rate of oxygen was 0 5 l min and aeration was conducted for 10 min ultrapure oxygen was used as the gas source for ozone production and the pretreatment processes the ozone concentration in the ozone solution was determined by iodine stoichiometric titration and the residual ozone concentrations in the ozone treated bsa working solutions were measured by a palintest rw7 multiparameter water quality analyzer pth 071cn palintest ltd tyne wear uk the uf membrane fouling experiments with the bsa working solutions were performed immediately after each of the pretreatments 2 3 uf membrane filtration and flux recovery experiments all uf membrane filtration experiments were carried out using a stirred dead end filtration system consisting of a pressurized membrane cell a feed tank and a data acquisition system as described previously 24 in brief before each filtration experiment a clean pvdf membrane was compacted and conditioned at a pressure of 0 15 mpa until the permeate flux was stabilized then at 0 10 mpa the pure water flux j 0 of the membrane was measured with deionized water as the feed water afterwards at 0 10 mpa the bsa working solution after a specific pretreatment was fed into the membrane cell for filtration for 120 min while the permeate flux j was recorded continuously the normalized permeate flux j j 0 was used to evaluate the flux decline of the uf membrane during filtration of the bsa solutions after the different pretreatments the fouled membrane was retrieved and cleaned using a physical method and the recovery of the pure water flux of the fouled membrane was determined the fouled membrane was removed gently from the membrane cell and placed immediately into 400 ml of deionized water in a beaker the beaker was placed on a vibrating table for 2 min to clean the membrane afterwards the clean water flux j r of the cleaned membrane was measured at 0 10 mpa and the flux recovery ratio j r j 0 of the membrane was calculated for each pretreatment condition the filtration and cleaning experiments were conducted at least six times and the average values with standard deviations when needed of the experimental data are reported 2 4 examination of the bsa fouling layers a scanning electron microscope gemini sem30 carl zeiss ag germany was used to examine the fouling layers on the surface of the fouled membranes after the filtration experiment the fouled membrane was removed from the filtration cell and frozen at 15 for 12 h the frozen membrane sample was then dried in a vacuum freeze dryer 50 c 27 pa fd 1a 50 boyi kang experimental instrument china for 24 h the freeze dried membrane was fixed on a copper sheet and sputtered with gold for the sem examination 2 5 other analytical methods the doc concentrations of the bsa working solutions before and after the pretreatment were measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the size of the bsa molecules and aggregates was determined with a zetasizer nano instrument delsa nano c beckman coulter usa the turbidity of the bsa working solutions was measured with a turbidimeter 2100 n hach usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pre ozonation on the membrane fouling behavior the fouling behavior of the pvdf uf membrane during filtration of the bsa working solution as the feed water before and after pre ozonation was investigated the curves of normalized permeate flux decline for the different ozone contact times are presented in fig 2 along with the corresponding flux recovery ratios of the fouled membranes as shown in fig 2 a in the 120 min filtration test the bsa solution without any pretreatment exhibited the most rapid and serious membrane fouling with a flux decline of 73 pre ozonation effectively decreased the membrane fouling potential of the feeding bsa solution for a short ozone contact time of only 5 min the flux decline rate and extent began to decrease when the ozone contact time was increased to 10 and 20 min the reduction of membrane fouling became more significant moreover when the ozone contact time was increased from 0 to 20 min the flux recovery ratio of the fouled membrane after cleaning also increased markedly from 37 1 to over 50 it is apparent that the physical irreversible fouling of the uf membrane was progressively reduced by pre ozonation of the bsa solution with increasing ozone contact time the membrane filtration results indicated that the membrane fouling by bsa was mitigated by pre ozonation of the feeding water this is in accordance with the results of some previous studies into the effect of pre ozonation on membrane fouling control 8 10 however it is in contrast with several other studies that suggest pre ozonation could worsen the membrane fouling by protein like substances 11 15 as described previously no unified theory has been formulated to explain the observation that protein fouling of uf membranes can be mitigated or worsened by pre ozonation for which further investigations are needed 3 2 aggregate formation during pre ozonation and fouling layer analysis during the pre ozonation of the bsa working solutions a remarkable amount of foam was rapidly generated on the surface of the solution fig 3 a presented the foaming situation at ozone contact time of 1 min this could have arisen from the foamability of protein like substances 25 however for a short ozone contact time of 5 min the foam disappeared almost immediately after the ozone aeration ceased and a few small aggregates were observed in the bsa working solution with the prolonged aeration and ozone contact times of 10 and 20 min the foam was gradually transformed into large aggregate flocs floating on the water fig 3 b at ozone contact time of 10 min most of these aggregates adhered firmly to the cover and walls of the ozone reactor after pre ozonation which caused them not to flow with the water into the uf membrane cell as shown in fig 3 c these observations in combination with the decrease of the doc concentration in the bsa working solutions and the analysis of the membrane fouling layers may be able to explain the effect of pre ozonation on the membrane fouling behavior the bsa working solution had an aqueous doc concentration of approximately 10 mg l before any pretreatment when pre ozonation was applied for 5 min the doc concentration of the solution slightly decreased to 8 8 mg l when the ozone contact time was extended to 10 and 20 min the doc concentration of the bsa solution decreased greatly by 51 and 69 to 4 9 and 3 1 mg l respectively thus bsa could be effectively removed by the pre ozonation treatment and the removal efficiency increased with the ozone contact time it should be noted however that for macromolecular organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides the removal of doc from water by ozone oxidation is negligible 26 27 in other words the bsa in the solution could not have been mineralized by ozone oxidation this can be confirmed by the results of quantitative ozonation of the bsa solutions with an ozone solution reported below in section 3 3 2 see table 1 thus an obvious conclusion arises at the ozone contact times of 10 and 20 min the aggregates of bsa that attached to the cover and walls of the reactor after pre ozonation were the main cause of the significant doc decrease in the solution the large decrease in the aqueous doc concentration in the feeding solution reduced the loading of foulants on the uf membrane leading to a reduced membrane fouling rate the effect of the foulant load on the membrane fouling rate was also tested as shown in fig 5 filtration of the bsa working solution with a doc concentration of 10 mg l induced more rapid membrane fouling than that with a doc of 5 mg l indeed it would generally be anticipated that membrane fouling would be lessened with a decrease of the bsa concentration in the feeding solution therefore combining the results of figs 2 and 4 it can be concluded that after pre ozonation especially for the ozone contact times of 10 and 20 min the decrease of the foulant loading in the feed solution into the membrane cell was among the main reasons for the reduced membrane fouling rate it may be noted that the area of the surface which the foulant flocs would attach to can be limited in actual ozonation systems however with suitable apparatuses such as using skimming plates large floc like aggregates that float on the water surface can be readily removed during the pre ozonation process in contrast to the cases of ozone contact times of 10 and 20 min at an ozone contact time of 5 min with aeration few or no aggregates were observed or remained in the reactor however as shown in fig 6 b numerous bubble like aggregates formed on the membrane surface after water filtration whose size ranged from 600 to 800 nm these depositions were much larger than the pore size of the membrane and appeared to not only reduce the risk of pore blocking but also form a porous deposition layer protecting the membrane surface 28 29 when the ozone contact time was increased to 10 min the bubble like deposition on the membrane surface became less apparent and smaller 200 400 nm especially for an ozone aeration time of 20 min the membrane surface appeared rather similar to that without any pretreatment with few bubble like aggregates on the surface the comparison suggests that 5 min was not long enough to produce large aggregate flocs and hence only relatively small bsa clusters formed in the water that entered the uf cell for filtration with the prolonged ozonation and aeration time the small aggregates grew continuously into floc like aggregates which were removed from water in the ozone reactor and did not enter the uf cell therefore few aggregates were retained on the surface of the membrane for the long ozone contact time 20 min the comparison also suggests that the size of bsa aggregates formed during pre ozonation was closely related to the ozone contact time the analysis of the fouling layer and its relationship with the foaming and aggregation of the bsa solution indicated that pre ozonation for the short ozone aeration time of 5 min promoted the formation of small bsa clusters and aggregates the small aggregates in water were retained on the membrane surface forming a loose and highly porous fouling layer with a low filtration resistance with the increase of the ozone aeration time to 10 and 20 min these small aggregates grew into large aggregate flocs most of which would remain in the reactor on the water surface and on the reactor walls and would not enter the uf cell as a result the amount of foulants in the water was greatly reduced leading to a decrease in the membrane fouling rate it can be readily supposed that the primary cause of the reduced membrane fouling after pre ozonation was the formation and removal of bsa aggregates during the ozonation with aeration 3 3 influencing factors on membrane fouling of the bsa solution after pre ozonation during the pre ozonation treatment both aeration and ozone oxidation occurred almost simultaneously and it was unclear which effect was predominantly responsible for the aggregation and removal of bsa from the solution thus pretreatment of the bsa solution with i aeration only and ii quiescent ozone oxidation only without aeration were conducted and the fouling behavior during membrane filtration of the solution before and after the different pretreatments was studied 3 3 1 effect of aeration only on membrane fouling ultra pure oxygen was provided as the gas source which bypassed the ozone generator to aerate the bsa working solution for 10 min the filtration experiment with the uf membrane was then carried out on the bsa solution after aeration similar to the pre ozonation tests a large amount of gas bubbles and foam formed on the water surface during aeration however unlike in the case of pre ozonation treatment the foam disappeared soon after aeration was stopped more importantly no bsa aggregation in the reactor and no attachment of foam and aggregates to the reactor walls were observed based on the doc measurement the bsa concentration of the solution did not change during aeration clearly therefore aeration was not the sole reason for the formation and removal of large bsa aggregate flocs during pre ozonation of the solution fig 7 shows the curves of permeate flux decline for the filtration of the bsa solutions with and without aeration during the uf tests the two curves of flux decline for the bsa working solution before and after aeration nearly completely overlapped the similarity of these fouling behavior further confirmed that aeration alone had little effect on the fouling propensity of the bsa solution in other words aeration was not the main cause for the reduced membrane fouling of the bsa solution after pre ozonation 3 3 2 effect of quantitative ozone oxidation only on membrane fouling the ozone consumption during pre ozonation was determined by iodine stoichiometric titration for the ozone contact times of 5 10 and 20 min the ozone consumption lay in the ranges of 1 5 3 3 3 1 4 1 and 4 5 7 6 mg l respectively to investigate the effect of ozone oxidation of the bsa solution on the membrane fouling behavior quantitative ozonation of the bsa solution by ozonated water was conducted at ozone dosages of 0 1 5 3 0 and 4 5 mg l that is the bsa working solution was pretreated by ozone oxidation only without aeration table 1 summarizes the doc turbidity and particle sizes of the bsa solution after ozonation with the different ozone dosages throughout the dosage range tested the doc concentration of the bsa solution did not decrease as the ozone dosage was increased which is consistent with the results obtained by liang s group 11 which indicated that the bsa could not be substantially mineralized by ozonation as expected the doc of the bsa solutions also remained unchanged after aeration thus it can be confirmed that the formation and removal of bsa aggregates during the pre ozonation with aeration was the vital reason for the decrease in the doc concentration in the bsa solutions fig 4 meanwhile the turbidity and particle size in the bsa solution increased as the ozone dosage increased however neither bsa aggregate formation nor attachment of aggregate flocs on the reactor walls was observed during ozonation without aeration this may be because the ozone oxidation could destabilize the bsa molecules which caused the bsa molecules to unfold and for more hydrophobic groups to be exposed 30 31 these unfolded bsa molecules could bond to each other to form small bsa clusters via hydrophobic forces 32 the micro bubbles formed during the pre ozonation process could further bridge these small bsa clusters together to form larger aggregate flocs which quantitative ozonation alone could not achieve even more surprisingly as shown in fig 8 the membrane fouling became worse for the bsa solution after ozone oxidation in fact the membrane fouling rate increased as the ozone dosage increased which implies that ozonation alone was unlikely a suitable approach to resolve membrane fouling by protein like foulants this contrasts with the results of membrane fouling control by pre ozonation with aeration whereas ozone oxidation alone of the feeding solution worsened the membrane fouling pre ozonation with aeration mitigated the problem it can therefore be deduced that similar to the case of pretreatment by aeration alone ozone oxidation alone was not the root cause of the reduction of membrane fouling achieved by pre ozonation of the bsa solution 3 3 3 synergistic effect of ozone oxidation and aeration on membrane fouling mitigation the above investigations indicate that pretreatment by aeration alone or ozone oxidation alone of the bsa solution could not effectively mitigate membrane fouling more specifically pretreatment by aeration alone or by ozonation without aeration did not result in visible bsa aggregation and removal however treatment by pre ozonation with ozone aeration did effectively reduce the membrane fouling rate of the bsa solution the results imply a synergistic effect of ozone oxidation and aeration that destabilized the bsa molecules to facilitate

13539,pre ozonation is often used before ultrafiltration uf to control membrane fouling usually by supplying ozone into water or wastewater via aeration however the role of aeration in pre ozonation for mitigation of membrane fouling has not been well elucidated hence in this study bovine serum albumin bsa was used as a protein type foulant in experiments on the outcomes and underlying mechanisms of pre ozonation the change in the membrane fouling behavior the transformation of bsa and the fouling layer properties were investigated after pre ozonation with and without aeration the results showed that the membrane fouling notably declined after pre ozonation which mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between ozone oxidation and aeration ozone oxidation unfolded the bsa molecules and exposed their hydrophobic groups and these unfolded bsa aggregated and adhered to the surface of the microbubbles produced by aeration this induced bsa foaming and aggregation in the ozonated suspension with pre ozonation for a short contact time of 5 min small bsa aggregates in water were retained on the uf membrane surface to form a highly porous deposition layer with a low filtration resistance with pre ozonation for a contact time of 10 min or longer bsa foaming led to the formation of large aggregates that were efficiently removed from water in the ozone reactor which greatly reduced the foulant loading of the water and its subsequent membrane fouling rate in contrast when quantitative and quiescent ozonation was performed without aeration ozone oxidation alone worsened the membrane fouling propensity of the bsa solution keywords ultrafiltration membrane fouling pre ozonation synergistic effect ozone oxidation aeration 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf membranes are widely used for water and wastewater treatment owing to advantages including high effluent quality pathogen and bacteria removal a small footprint and a lack of secondary pollution 1 3 however membrane fouling which greatly increases the treatment cost and decreases membrane permeability and lifespan remains a major obstacle to the more widespread application of uf technologies many techniques to mitigate fouling have been developed in recent decades among which pre oxidation of the feed water with an oxidant ozone chlorine hydrogen peroxide etc is considered to be a simple and effective method 4 5 ozone a powerful oxidizing agent with oxidation potential of 2 07 v has attracted much attention for the pretreatment of feed water before membrane filtration 6 7 some research has been carried out to investigate the effects of pre ozonation on membrane fouling behavior and in most cases it was reported that pre ozonation could mitigate membrane fouling significantly 8 10 however contradictory experimental findings have also been reported for instance liang s group investigated the fouling behavior of the uf membrane filtration of several model organic foulants and natural surface waters before and after pre ozonation 11 they found that for humic acid sodium alginate and natural surface water membrane fouling was noticeably lessened after pre ozonation but for protein like foulants membrane fouling was not reduced by pre ozonation moreover yu et al reported that protein fouling of uf membranes increased considerably after pre ozonation which they suggested was caused by ozone induced protein aggregation 12 it appears that pre ozonation could have an adverse effect on membrane fouling control for protein like foulants in water however for bovine serum albumin bsa the same model protein foulant studied by yu et al yin et al found that the membrane fouling rate and irreversible fouling were effectively reduced by pre ozonation 13 14 they attributed this result to the increase in net charge and hydrophilicity of bsa after ozonation which increased the electrostatic repulsion and reduced the hydrophobic interaction force between bsa and the membrane moreover song et al found that at a low ozone dosage membrane fouling was mitigated by pre ozonation whereas a further increase in the ozone dosage resulted in severe membrane fouling 15 they proposed that the membrane fouling at a high ozone dosage was caused by the oligomerization and agglomeration of bsa before membrane filtration to date no unified explanation or predictive model has been proposed for the effect of pre ozonation on the protein fouling of uf membranes most researchers used the relative size between the foulants and membrane pores altered by ozonation to explain the resulting changes in membrane fouling behavior 4 however one interesting phenomenon was observed in certain previous studies pre ozonation can promote the agglomeration of protein foulants to form relatively large aggregates in water 12 15 in particular song s group found that a large amount of foam was produced on the surface of the protein solution during pre ozonation with numerous visible and sticky bsa flocs protein aggregation has been suggested as an important factor in relation to membrane fouling and its control 15 moreover the bsa aggregation and accumulation in water during pre ozonation appear visibly rather similar to the scum formation that occurs during air flotation in most cases ozone is supplied via aeration with a vast number of bubbles injected into the aqueous solution 16 given that proteins are a typical amphiphilic substance with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups the ozone gas bubbles could easily adhere to the hydrophobic sites of the proteins 17 18 taken together the action of aeration during ozonation may play a crucial role in protein aggregation that is aeration may be another key factor for the control of protein fouling of membranes 19 20 however the role of aeration in protein aggregation during the pre ozonation treatment and the interaction between ozone oxidation and aeration for the control of membrane fouling remain to be investigated in this study bsa was selected to represent the protein like foulants in water or wastewater for membrane filtration pre ozonation of the bsa solution via ozone aeration pre ozonation for short was performed as a pretreatment for control of membrane fouling for comparison separate experiments of only aeration without ozone and quantitative ozonation without aeration were also conducted on the bsa solution polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membranes were used for filtration experiments on the bsa solutions before and after the comparative pretreatments the membrane fouling behavior during the filtration of the bsa solutions was tested the formation of aggregate flocs and membrane fouling layers under the various pretreatment conditions was also investigated to reveal the mechanism of pre ozonation for the control of protein fouling during membrane filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 bsa working solutions and pvdf uf membranes bsa 98 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa who specified its isoelectric point and molecular weight as ph 4 7 and 67 kda respectively the bsa stock solution 1 0 g l was prepared by dissolving 1 0 g bsa in 1 l milli q water and was stored in sterilized glass bottles at 4 c 21 the bsa working solution with a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 10 mg l ph 7 0 0 2 was freshly prepared by diluting the bsa stock solution with deionized water flat sheet pvdf uf membranes were used for the experimental study on membrane filtration the uf membranes were prepared in the laboratory by the phase inversion method following previously described procedures 22 the main materials for making the uf membranes were pvdf solef 1015 solvay advanced polymers usa and n n dimethylacetamide dmac tianjin fucheng chemical reagent china the pure water flux of the as prepared uf membrane at 0 10 mpa was 250 20 l m 2 h 1 and bsa molecules had a rejection ratio of 93 by the membrane the average contact angle surface roughness and surface zeta potential of the membranes were 70 4 0 nm and 19 mv ph 7 0 respectively 2 2 pretreatment of the bsa working solution the bsa solution was pretreated before filtration by i pre ozonation ozonation by aeration of the ozone gas ii aeration only by oxygen gas without ozone and iii quantitative and quiescent ozonation by the ozone solution without aeration the schematic diagram of pre ozonation is shown in fig 1 including an oxygen cylinder an ozone generator 3s t3 beijing tonglin technology china and an ozone reactor containing 2 l of the bsa working solution or water a 5 μm titanium alloy aerator was installed at the bottom of the reactor to diffuse the gaseous ozone or ultrapure oxygen into the bsa working solutions or water for pre ozonation gaseous ozone a mixture of ultrapure oxygen and ozone was produced at a flow rate of 0 5 l min and bubbled into the bsa working solution the ozone contact times were set to 5 10 and 20 min the gaseous ozone concentration and the amount of ozone supply were determined by iodine stoichiometric titration 11 23 after pre ozonation the concentration of residual ozone in the working solution was also measured before blowing it off with pure n2 for quantitative ozonation by ozone solution 2 l ice water was added into the reactor and gaseous ozone was continuously supplied at a flow rate of 1 l min after 15 min the ice in water melted and a concentrated ozone solution was obtained with a dissolved ozone concentration of 30 40 mg l the ozone solution was added at different amounts into the bsa working solutions corresponding to ozone dosing concentrations of 0 1 5 3 0 and 4 5 mg l whereas the resulting doc concentration of the bsa solutions was kept constant at 10 mg l the bsa solutions with the predetermined ozone concentrations were kept in airproof and dark conditions for 30 min the residual ozone in the ozonated solutions was then measured before its removal by n2 blowing for aeration only the process was the same as pre ozonation but the ozone generator was turned off and only ultrapure oxygen was bubbled into the bsa solution in the reactor the flow rate of oxygen was 0 5 l min and aeration was conducted for 10 min ultrapure oxygen was used as the gas source for ozone production and the pretreatment processes the ozone concentration in the ozone solution was determined by iodine stoichiometric titration and the residual ozone concentrations in the ozone treated bsa working solutions were measured by a palintest rw7 multiparameter water quality analyzer pth 071cn palintest ltd tyne wear uk the uf membrane fouling experiments with the bsa working solutions were performed immediately after each of the pretreatments 2 3 uf membrane filtration and flux recovery experiments all uf membrane filtration experiments were carried out using a stirred dead end filtration system consisting of a pressurized membrane cell a feed tank and a data acquisition system as described previously 24 in brief before each filtration experiment a clean pvdf membrane was compacted and conditioned at a pressure of 0 15 mpa until the permeate flux was stabilized then at 0 10 mpa the pure water flux j 0 of the membrane was measured with deionized water as the feed water afterwards at 0 10 mpa the bsa working solution after a specific pretreatment was fed into the membrane cell for filtration for 120 min while the permeate flux j was recorded continuously the normalized permeate flux j j 0 was used to evaluate the flux decline of the uf membrane during filtration of the bsa solutions after the different pretreatments the fouled membrane was retrieved and cleaned using a physical method and the recovery of the pure water flux of the fouled membrane was determined the fouled membrane was removed gently from the membrane cell and placed immediately into 400 ml of deionized water in a beaker the beaker was placed on a vibrating table for 2 min to clean the membrane afterwards the clean water flux j r of the cleaned membrane was measured at 0 10 mpa and the flux recovery ratio j r j 0 of the membrane was calculated for each pretreatment condition the filtration and cleaning experiments were conducted at least six times and the average values with standard deviations when needed of the experimental data are reported 2 4 examination of the bsa fouling layers a scanning electron microscope gemini sem30 carl zeiss ag germany was used to examine the fouling layers on the surface of the fouled membranes after the filtration experiment the fouled membrane was removed from the filtration cell and frozen at 15 for 12 h the frozen membrane sample was then dried in a vacuum freeze dryer 50 c 27 pa fd 1a 50 boyi kang experimental instrument china for 24 h the freeze dried membrane was fixed on a copper sheet and sputtered with gold for the sem examination 2 5 other analytical methods the doc concentrations of the bsa working solutions before and after the pretreatment were measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the size of the bsa molecules and aggregates was determined with a zetasizer nano instrument delsa nano c beckman coulter usa the turbidity of the bsa working solutions was measured with a turbidimeter 2100 n hach usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pre ozonation on the membrane fouling behavior the fouling behavior of the pvdf uf membrane during filtration of the bsa working solution as the feed water before and after pre ozonation was investigated the curves of normalized permeate flux decline for the different ozone contact times are presented in fig 2 along with the corresponding flux recovery ratios of the fouled membranes as shown in fig 2 a in the 120 min filtration test the bsa solution without any pretreatment exhibited the most rapid and serious membrane fouling with a flux decline of 73 pre ozonation effectively decreased the membrane fouling potential of the feeding bsa solution for a short ozone contact time of only 5 min the flux decline rate and extent began to decrease when the ozone contact time was increased to 10 and 20 min the reduction of membrane fouling became more significant moreover when the ozone contact time was increased from 0 to 20 min the flux recovery ratio of the fouled membrane after cleaning also increased markedly from 37 1 to over 50 it is apparent that the physical irreversible fouling of the uf membrane was progressively reduced by pre ozonation of the bsa solution with increasing ozone contact time the membrane filtration results indicated that the membrane fouling by bsa was mitigated by pre ozonation of the feeding water this is in accordance with the results of some previous studies into the effect of pre ozonation on membrane fouling control 8 10 however it is in contrast with several other studies that suggest pre ozonation could worsen the membrane fouling by protein like substances 11 15 as described previously no unified theory has been formulated to explain the observation that protein fouling of uf membranes can be mitigated or worsened by pre ozonation for which further investigations are needed 3 2 aggregate formation during pre ozonation and fouling layer analysis during the pre ozonation of the bsa working solutions a remarkable amount of foam was rapidly generated on the surface of the solution fig 3 a presented the foaming situation at ozone contact time of 1 min this could have arisen from the foamability of protein like substances 25 however for a short ozone contact time of 5 min the foam disappeared almost immediately after the ozone aeration ceased and a few small aggregates were observed in the bsa working solution with the prolonged aeration and ozone contact times of 10 and 20 min the foam was gradually transformed into large aggregate flocs floating on the water fig 3 b at ozone contact time of 10 min most of these aggregates adhered firmly to the cover and walls of the ozone reactor after pre ozonation which caused them not to flow with the water into the uf membrane cell as shown in fig 3 c these observations in combination with the decrease of the doc concentration in the bsa working solutions and the analysis of the membrane fouling layers may be able to explain the effect of pre ozonation on the membrane fouling behavior the bsa working solution had an aqueous doc concentration of approximately 10 mg l before any pretreatment when pre ozonation was applied for 5 min the doc concentration of the solution slightly decreased to 8 8 mg l when the ozone contact time was extended to 10 and 20 min the doc concentration of the bsa solution decreased greatly by 51 and 69 to 4 9 and 3 1 mg l respectively thus bsa could be effectively removed by the pre ozonation treatment and the removal efficiency increased with the ozone contact time it should be noted however that for macromolecular organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides the removal of doc from water by ozone oxidation is negligible 26 27 in other words the bsa in the solution could not have been mineralized by ozone oxidation this can be confirmed by the results of quantitative ozonation of the bsa solutions with an ozone solution reported below in section 3 3 2 see table 1 thus an obvious conclusion arises at the ozone contact times of 10 and 20 min the aggregates of bsa that attached to the cover and walls of the reactor after pre ozonation were the main cause of the significant doc decrease in the solution the large decrease in the aqueous doc concentration in the feeding solution reduced the loading of foulants on the uf membrane leading to a reduced membrane fouling rate the effect of the foulant load on the membrane fouling rate was also tested as shown in fig 5 filtration of the bsa working solution with a doc concentration of 10 mg l induced more rapid membrane fouling than that with a doc of 5 mg l indeed it would generally be anticipated that membrane fouling would be lessened with a decrease of the bsa concentration in the feeding solution therefore combining the results of figs 2 and 4 it can be concluded that after pre ozonation especially for the ozone contact times of 10 and 20 min the decrease of the foulant loading in the feed solution into the membrane cell was among the main reasons for the reduced membrane fouling rate it may be noted that the area of the surface which the foulant flocs would attach to can be limited in actual ozonation systems however with suitable apparatuses such as using skimming plates large floc like aggregates that float on the water surface can be readily removed during the pre ozonation process in contrast to the cases of ozone contact times of 10 and 20 min at an ozone contact time of 5 min with aeration few or no aggregates were observed or remained in the reactor however as shown in fig 6 b numerous bubble like aggregates formed on the membrane surface after water filtration whose size ranged from 600 to 800 nm these depositions were much larger than the pore size of the membrane and appeared to not only reduce the risk of pore blocking but also form a porous deposition layer protecting the membrane surface 28 29 when the ozone contact time was increased to 10 min the bubble like deposition on the membrane surface became less apparent and smaller 200 400 nm especially for an ozone aeration time of 20 min the membrane surface appeared rather similar to that without any pretreatment with few bubble like aggregates on the surface the comparison suggests that 5 min was not long enough to produce large aggregate flocs and hence only relatively small bsa clusters formed in the water that entered the uf cell for filtration with the prolonged ozonation and aeration time the small aggregates grew continuously into floc like aggregates which were removed from water in the ozone reactor and did not enter the uf cell therefore few aggregates were retained on the surface of the membrane for the long ozone contact time 20 min the comparison also suggests that the size of bsa aggregates formed during pre ozonation was closely related to the ozone contact time the analysis of the fouling layer and its relationship with the foaming and aggregation of the bsa solution indicated that pre ozonation for the short ozone aeration time of 5 min promoted the formation of small bsa clusters and aggregates the small aggregates in water were retained on the membrane surface forming a loose and highly porous fouling layer with a low filtration resistance with the increase of the ozone aeration time to 10 and 20 min these small aggregates grew into large aggregate flocs most of which would remain in the reactor on the water surface and on the reactor walls and would not enter the uf cell as a result the amount of foulants in the water was greatly reduced leading to a decrease in the membrane fouling rate it can be readily supposed that the primary cause of the reduced membrane fouling after pre ozonation was the formation and removal of bsa aggregates during the ozonation with aeration 3 3 influencing factors on membrane fouling of the bsa solution after pre ozonation during the pre ozonation treatment both aeration and ozone oxidation occurred almost simultaneously and it was unclear which effect was predominantly responsible for the aggregation and removal of bsa from the solution thus pretreatment of the bsa solution with i aeration only and ii quiescent ozone oxidation only without aeration were conducted and the fouling behavior during membrane filtration of the solution before and after the different pretreatments was studied 3 3 1 effect of aeration only on membrane fouling ultra pure oxygen was provided as the gas source which bypassed the ozone generator to aerate the bsa working solution for 10 min the filtration experiment with the uf membrane was then carried out on the bsa solution after aeration similar to the pre ozonation tests a large amount of gas bubbles and foam formed on the water surface during aeration however unlike in the case of pre ozonation treatment the foam disappeared soon after aeration was stopped more importantly no bsa aggregation in the reactor and no attachment of foam and aggregates to the reactor walls were observed based on the doc measurement the bsa concentration of the solution did not change during aeration clearly therefore aeration was not the sole reason for the formation and removal of large bsa aggregate flocs during pre ozonation of the solution fig 7 shows the curves of permeate flux decline for the filtration of the bsa solutions with and without aeration during the uf tests the two curves of flux decline for the bsa working solution before and after aeration nearly completely overlapped the similarity of these fouling behavior further confirmed that aeration alone had little effect on the fouling propensity of the bsa solution in other words aeration was not the main cause for the reduced membrane fouling of the bsa solution after pre ozonation 3 3 2 effect of quantitative ozone oxidation only on membrane fouling the ozone consumption during pre ozonation was determined by iodine stoichiometric titration for the ozone contact times of 5 10 and 20 min the ozone consumption lay in the ranges of 1 5 3 3 3 1 4 1 and 4 5 7 6 mg l respectively to investigate the effect of ozone oxidation of the bsa solution on the membrane fouling behavior quantitative ozonation of the bsa solution by ozonated water was conducted at ozone dosages of 0 1 5 3 0 and 4 5 mg l that is the bsa working solution was pretreated by ozone oxidation only without aeration table 1 summarizes the doc turbidity and particle sizes of the bsa solution after ozonation with the different ozone dosages throughout the dosage range tested the doc concentration of the bsa solution did not decrease as the ozone dosage was increased which is consistent with the results obtained by liang s group 11 which indicated that the bsa could not be substantially mineralized by ozonation as expected the doc of the bsa solutions also remained unchanged after aeration thus it can be confirmed that the formation and removal of bsa aggregates during the pre ozonation with aeration was the vital reason for the decrease in the doc concentration in the bsa solutions fig 4 meanwhile the turbidity and particle size in the bsa solution increased as the ozone dosage increased however neither bsa aggregate formation nor attachment of aggregate flocs on the reactor walls was observed during ozonation without aeration this may be because the ozone oxidation could destabilize the bsa molecules which caused the bsa molecules to unfold and for more hydrophobic groups to be exposed 30 31 these unfolded bsa molecules could bond to each other to form small bsa clusters via hydrophobic forces 32 the micro bubbles formed during the pre ozonation process could further bridge these small bsa clusters together to form larger aggregate flocs which quantitative ozonation alone could not achieve even more surprisingly as shown in fig 8 the membrane fouling became worse for the bsa solution after ozone oxidation in fact the membrane fouling rate increased as the ozone dosage increased which implies that ozonation alone was unlikely a suitable approach to resolve membrane fouling by protein like foulants this contrasts with the results of membrane fouling control by pre ozonation with aeration whereas ozone oxidation alone of the feeding solution worsened the membrane fouling pre ozonation with aeration mitigated the problem it can therefore be deduced that similar to the case of pretreatment by aeration alone ozone oxidation alone was not the root cause of the reduction of membrane fouling achieved by pre ozonation of the bsa solution 3 3 3 synergistic effect of ozone oxidation and aeration on membrane fouling mitigation the above investigations indicate that pretreatment by aeration alone or ozone oxidation alone of the bsa solution could not effectively mitigate membrane fouling more specifically pretreatment by aeration alone or by ozonation without aeration did not result in visible bsa aggregation and removal however treatment by pre ozonation with ozone aeration did effectively reduce the membrane fouling rate of the bsa solution the results imply a synergistic effect of ozone oxidation and aeration that destabilized the bsa molecules to facilitate their aggregation and removal leading to a reduced membrane fouling rate of the bsa solution during pre ozonation ozone with its strong oxidizing capability can destabilize and unfold the bsa molecules thus exposing some of the hydrophobic groups to the exterior environment of the molecules 30 31 these unfolded bsa molecules might aggregate to form small bsa clusters via hydrophobic forces 32 moreover the hydrophobic groups also have a strong affinity to the micro bubbles that are provided by continuous aeration 33 thus the micro bubbles would bridge these small bsa clusters together to form larger aggregate flocs in the suspension at the same time the large quantity of gas bubbles in the floc like aggregates would force the aggregates to float to the surface of the water column or attach to the walls of the reactor 19 in short during the pre ozonation process it was the synergistic effect between ozone oxidation and aeration that promoted the formation and removal of large size aggregations from the ozonated solution as a result the amount of bsa as a foulant decreased in the water solution flowing into the uf cell leading to a reduced membrane fouling rate 4 conclusions
