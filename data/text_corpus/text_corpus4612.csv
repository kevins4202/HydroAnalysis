23060,the residual ultimate strength of ship hull plates under uniaxial cyclic load is studied by numerical analysis using nonlinear finite element method strength behaviors of plate under cyclic loading are obtained and analyzed the crack propagation from the low cycle fatigue damage is considered in present study three cyclic load cases are firstly analyzed and discussed in the assumption that fatigue crack propagation will not happen then accumulated residual stress and strain at the crack tip duo to cyclic loads are studied when the fatigue crack is taken into consideration the crack propagation rate is treated by a simple method based on the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip to improve computational efficiency in the numerical analysis a typical relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles is established through the crack length from the numerical results some significant conclusions are drawn to the residual ultimate strength of plates under uniaxial cyclic loads keywords residual ultimate strength cyclic load fatigue damage nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction the ultimate load bearing capacity of ship hull structure has very important significance on the ship security and survivability ship hull plates are the basic structure components of ship hulls the most common working conditions of ship hulls are subjected to alternative hogging and sagging bending moments plates at the deck and bottom of ship hulls mainly bear the maximum in plane tension compression load in the two loading conditions the main load on these plates is uniaxial cyclic load when ship hulls are under longitudinal bending moment so the residual ultimate strength of plates under uniaxial cyclic load is of great practical value to be studied at present most of the evaluation methods for ultimate strength of ship hull plates are built on the basis of the ultimate strength concept under monotonic loads that is the plate collapse is the result of external one off extreme uniaxial loads the fact is that the collapses of ship plates are mostly the consequence of accumulated incremental plastic damage and fatigue damage under repeated extreme loads in rough sea the high level of cyclic loads will cause a continuous reduction of the load bearing capacity of the plate and may eventually led to the collapse of plate under a load value less than the so called ultimate strength under monotonic load therefore the residual ultimate strength criteria under uniaxial cyclic load can more accurately forecasting ultimate bearing capacity of ship hull plates there have been many research work about the ultimate strength of ship hull structures under monotonic load guedes soares 1992 1996 provided a review of simple design methods for plate elements under uniaxial compression and present a method to estimate the ultimate moment based on a simplified approach to predict the collapse strength of beam columns rahman and chowdhury 1996 made an estimation of ultimate longitudinal bending moment of ships and box girders paik et al 1998 2008a 2008b 2008c conducted a series of studies on the ultimate strength of ships and ship shaped offshore structures xu and guedes soares 2013 made a comparison of calculations with experiments on the ultimate strength of wide stiffened panels pei et al 2015 used the idealized structural unit method in the simulation on progressive collapse behavior of whole ship model under extreme waves it is more reasonable to consider the cyclic load on ship hull structures in their lifetime on actual sea conditions researches on the mechanic performance and residual ultimate strength of ship hull structures under cyclic loads are quite rare and some of them are conducted in the civil engineering field yao and nikolov 1990 dealt with buckling plastic collapse behavior and the ultimate strength of plates under cyclic loading huang 1994 1996a b obtained some useful conclusions from theoretical and experimental investigations of the load bearing capacity of plates under in plane cyclic loading xu et al 2012 conducted an experiment to evaluate the post ultimate strength behavior of a ship hull girder in waves by using the specimens in their experiment under cyclic bending fukumoto and kusama 1982 1983 1985a 1985b 1985c analyzed the non elastic deformation of welded box structure under cyclic loading and discovered that the ultimate strength of plates decreases with an increasing number of cycles other literature about the effect of slenderness ratio initial imperfection buckling mode on strength behaviors and energy dissipation capacity as well as hysteretic performance of structures during cyclic loads are discussed in lee and noh 2010 cheng et al 2013 yang et al 2014 fujita et al 1984 usami and ge 1998 cyclic loads from the waves on the sea are likely to cause fatigue damage the most common fatigue damage is cracks crack damages are certain to affect the strength behaviors of ship hull structures paik et al 2004 2005 2009 had carried out a series of experimental and numerical studies on the ultimate strength of cracked plates xu et al 2014 made an assessment of the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with fixed cracks it is concluded from their researches that the projected length perpendicular to the direction of the external load is the key factor to determine the ultimate strength of cracked plates wang et al 2012 studied the strength behaviors of steel plates with multiple crack damage saad eldeen et al 2016 made an experimental investigation on the force displacement relationships dissipated energies strength strain relationships resilience toughness and collapse modes of plate specimen with without different locked cracks up to now most of the ultimate strength assessments are based on the concept of the ultimate strength under monotonic load condition although some researchers paik et al 2004 2005 2009 xu et al 2014 wang et al 2012 saad eldeen et al 2016 have introduced cracks into the ultimate strength assessment the crack propagations under cyclic loads are still not taken into consideration in literature yao and nikolov 1990 huang 1994 1996a b xu et al 2012 fukumoto and kusama 1982 1983 1985a 1985b 1985c lee and noh 2010 cheng et al 2013 yang et al 2014 fujita et al 1984 usami and ge 1998 cyclic loads are taken into account but load levels are usually over the one off ultimate strength of structures and fatigue cracks are ignored that is not the real working condition of ship structures so residual ultimate strength of plates considering accumulated plastic damages and fatigue damages under cyclic loads needs to be studied to explain overall destruction phenomenon of ship hull structure under extreme sea conditions and provide more reliable analysis for correctly predicting the ultimate bearing capacity of ship hull structures the present paper aims at seeking insights into the residual compressive ultimate strength behavior of ship hull plates under cyclic loads the cracks are presumed to be located in transverse direction at the mid span of one longitudinal edge of the plates the residual stress and strain as well as crack propagation during cyclic loads application are all considered in this paper it is concluded that the crack length is the key factor to affect the residual ultimate strength of plates a simple method based on the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip is proposed to calculate the crack propagation rate which can be used to simplify the computation a relationship between the crack length and number of cycles under a typical working condition during crack stable growth stage is built therefore the residual ultimate strength of plates can be derived through the crack length as long as the number of cycles is known 2 finite element models 2 1 geometric and material properties the adopted plate dimension is a b t 2550 850 11 mm here a b and t are the length breadth and thickness of the plate respectively this dimension of the plate is from issc 2012 benchmark study 2012 it was concluded by xu et al 2014 that the crack projected length to the transverse direction is a main parameter to predict the ultimate strength of cracked plates hence the crack propagation path is set in the transverse direction at the present paper it is found out from a numerical analysis that the strain values at the mid span of longitudinal edges are the maximum in the plate when the plate is under axial loads in the longitudinal direction therefore the initial crack is most likely to appear at the mid span of one longitudinal edge as shown in fig 1 the length and breadth of the crack are expressed as c and w and the initial crack width w is 2 3 mm according to the mesh size it is assumed that all the cracks are through thickness the material adopted in the finite element models is high tensile strength steel with yield stress σ y 313 6 mpa young s modulus e 205800 mpa and poisson s ratio ν 0 3 the elastic perfectly plastic material model is used for conservative ultimate strength assessment 2 2 boundary and loading conditions the boundary condition of plates is simply supported the four edges of the plate are kept straight to simulate the effect of adjacent structures nodes at the midpoint of four edges are constrained in relevant directions to prevent rigid body movement the axial loads are applied as uniform displacements at loading edges the boundary and loading conditions are illustrated in fig 2 2 3 initial imperfections initial imperfections duo to fabrication include initial deflections and residual stresses paik 2012 proved that effect of residual stresses is small for hull thin plates it is concluded that welding residual stresses are more likely contribute to the expansion of plasticity in addition to geometrical nonlinearity due to buckling the effect of residual stresses tends to be more serious for thicker plates and less serious in thinner plates it is known from the calculation data in that paper that the effect of welded induced residual stresses are less than 4 3 for the slenderness ratio β 2 64 while in present paper β 3 02 is adopted moreover the welding induced residual stresses will fade during the process of cyclic loads therefore the effect of welding induced residual stresses can be negligible it is also concluded in the authors previous work xia 2018 that initial deflections have much larger effects on the strength behavior of plates than that of residual stresses when the two kinds of initial imperfections are considered together so for simplicity only initial deflections are accounted for in the analysis for rectangle plate the initial deflection can be defined by 1 w 0 k 1 m w 0 b 0 k sin k π x a sin π y b where w 0 is the amplitude of initial deflection w 0 is set as an average level of 0 1β 2 t in present paper m is the number of items b 0k is the coefficients x and y are the locations in the longitudinal and transverse direction β b t σ y e is the plate slenderness ratio in many studies only one term where k m b0k 1 is adopted for simplifications m is the buckling half wave number defined as the minimum integer and satisfying the condition bellow 2 a b m m 1 that happens to be the lowest buckling mode of plates paik et al 2004 conducted investigations on effect of initial deflection shape on the ultimate strength behavior of welded steel plates under biaxial compressive loads it is concluded that an initial deflection shape that approximates the buckling mode with its maximum amplitude selected to be the same as the measured maximum initial deflection is a good representation for the purposes of somewhat pessimistic evaluation of the ultimate strength of plating between stiffeners under biaxial compression as well as under uniaxial compression for more precise investigations more items of eq 1 need to be considered four typical initial deflection patterns are introduced here the values of coefficients b0k for the initial deflection shape are given in table 1 by taking m 11 those parameters are taken from the study of paik et al 2004 the ultimate strength of the plate with the four initial deflections is obtained from finite element analysis and compared with that of the lowest buckling mode in table 2 the ultimate strength is denoted by the average stress on the load edges the differences of the ultimate strengths from the lowest buckling mode initial deflection and the specified initial deflection are shown in table 2 it is known that the plate ultimate strength behavior is affected by the plate initial deflection shape as well as its magnitude among other factors as the actual initial deflection is very complex to simulate the ultimate strength of plates with lowest buckling mode initial deflection is not only close and pessimistic prediction but also easy to adopt in engineering practice demands there are several buckling modes for a plate the lowest buckling mode is the most stable buckling mode and the easiest to be attained as the potential energy of this buckling mode is the lowest therefore the initial deflection pattern of the lowest buckling mode of plates is reasonable and adopted in the present paper 2 4 adopted element and mesh convergence study shell181 of ansys ansys 2007 is adopted for nonlinear finite element analysis it is a four node element with six degrees of freedom at each node i e translations in the x y and z directions and rotations about the x y and z axes both geometric and material nonlinearities can be taken into account in this kind of element shell181 is suitable to simulate thin to moderate thick plates in ship hull structures there are two kinds of meshing strategies here for the ultimate strength study with and without considering fatigue damage as shown in fig 2 the minimum propagation length of cracks is set as 1 166 mm according to the minimum element dimension dense mesh is generated at the mid span of plates to simulate the propagation path of cracks in fig 2b xu et al 2014 found that the ultimate strength values are almost unchanged with the increase of the number of elements near the crack only meshes away from the crack are considered for convergence study in present paper all meshing strategies are listed in table 1 nx and ny are the number of elements along longitudinal and transverse edges respectively an analysis of various meshing strategies as shown in table 3 has been undertaken some results are shown in fig 3 as average stress average strain curves for an intact plate the ultimate strength values of the 6 meshing strategies in table 3 are shown in table 4 it can be seen from fig 3 that there is little difference of the ultimate strength between the 6 meshing strategies of models with and without the mesh of cracks propagation path it is a common sense that coarse mesh may not show the stress distribution precisely while refined mesh will take more computational time middle mesh is adopted in present paper to get a balance between accuracy and computational time middle mesh strategy is also employed in the region away from the crack in fig 2b it is also concluded from table 4 and fig 3 that the ultimate strengths of intact plates are almost the same regardless of the mesh of crack propagation path the results from the nonlinear finite element method are compared with the ultimate strength values predicted by the faulkner 1975 and fujikubo et al 2005 empirical formulas as eqs 3 and 4 it is observed from fig 3 that the ultimate strength obtained from nlfem is very close to that of empirical formulas 3 σ u σ y 2 β 1 β 2 β 1 0 4 σ u σ y 2 4 β 1 4 β 2 β 1 0 where σ u σ y is the non dimensional ultimate strength σ σ y is non dimensional average stress and ε ε y is non dimensional average strain eq 3 based on test results tends to give a relatively safe side estimate of the ultimate strength while eq 4 based on the numerical analysis of a continuous plate assuming hungry horse mode of deflection tends to give the estimate that is larger than eq 3 the numerical results shown in fig 4 are reasonable in this sense 3 numerical results and discussions the residual ultimate strength of a plate under uniaxial cyclic loads is investigated by ansys the solving procedure adopted in the present study is newton raphson nr method 3 1 residual ultimate strength of intact plate under cyclic loads the ultimate strength σ u of an intact plate the plate dimensions refer to subsection 2 1 and the mesh of plate model refer to fig 2a under monotonic compressive loading has been studied as shown in fig 3 for cyclic loading situation since tensile load will promote the compressive residual ultimate strength here only compressive cyclic loads are adopted for conservative results and simplicity three amplitudes of cyclic compressive loads are included i e 0 7σ u 0 8σ u and 0 9σ u which are just below σ u the history of load path and unload path is illustrated in fig 4 where the ordinate is denoted by average stresses applied on the edges of plates σ m is the amplitude of cyclic loads here the abscissa is not the real time but the load step or time step in real loading condition the plates are firstly applied prescribed cycles of uniaxial load with the amplitude σ m like the load path from time 0 to 10 then a monotonic increasing load is applied to obtain the residual ultimate strength like the load path from time 10 to 11 three numbers of cycles namely 5 10 and 15 are investigated in this section the results of 9 cases are shown in fig 5 together with monotonic loading the residual ultimate strengths of plates are almost the same if only σ m is less than σ u regardless of the amplitude of cyclic loads and number of cycles as shown in fig 5 only the stiffness of plate is slightly reduced when σ m is as high as 0 9σ u it is recognized from the reference paik 2012 saad eldeen et al 2012 that the residual stress and deformation arose under cyclic loads should be the cause to influence the strength behaviors of the plates fig 6 shows the residual stresses in the plate after subjected to three amplitudes of cyclic loads the maximum residual axial displacements and deflections after applying prescribed cyclic loads are shown in table 3 where ra and rd stand for maximum residual axial displacements and deflections respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that the level of residual stresses increases and the distribution of residual stresses changes as the amplitude of cyclic load increases the residual deformations after cyclic loads as shown in table 5 have the similar trend as the residual stresses when the amplitude of cyclic load and or number of cycles increase the residual axial displacements and deflections shown in table 5 are relatively very small compared with the initial deflection of the plate the levels of residual stresses after cyclic loads are also very low compared with the yield stress σ y until the amplitude of cyclic loads approach σ u it is inferred that cyclic loads with the amplitude less than ultimate strength σ u will contribute little to the residual deformation and stress in the plates therefore the initial deflection is almost unchanged after cyclic loads that means uniaxial cyclic loads have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of plates as long as the amplitude of applied cyclic load are less than the ultimate strength σ u 3 2 fatigue damages during applying cyclic loads 3 2 1 applied cyclic loads and simulating method of crack propagation fatigue cracks are the typical damages of plates under cyclic loads although the effect of cracks on the residual ultimate strength of ship plates has been studied by many researchers paik et al 2004 2005 2009 xu et al 2014 wang et al 2012 saad eldeen et al 2016 the cracks in most literature are preset and the loads adopted are monotonic loads tian and ji 2011 introduced a damage variable d to measure the ultimate strength reduction caused by low cycle fatigue damages in their study the fatigue damages due to cyclic loads are simplified as deterioration of materials and the true detailed process of the crack propagation was not discussed the effect of fatigue cracks and crack propagations on the residual ultimate strength of plates under cyclic loads is investigated in this paper it is concluded in section 3 1 that uniaxial cyclic loads with the amplitude less than the ultimate strength of plates under monotonic loading have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of plates therefore only one amplitude of cyclic loads adopted in section 3 1 is adopted here to inspect the effect of fatigue crack propagation on the residual ultimate strength of plates under cyclic loads σ m 0 7σ u is adopted in section 3 2 so as to avoid misconvergence of numerical calculation due to severe nonlinearity from large loads and cracks crack propagation will happen when tensile loads are included in cyclic loads so bi directional cyclic load i e both tensile loads and compressive loads are included is considered as illustrated in fig 7 as the compressive residual ultimate strength behavior of ship hull plates under cyclic loads is the main research objectives and the material adopted here is ductile material the exact crack propagation path and fracture toughness are not discussed here so the crack propagation path is set as described in section 2 1 for the residual ultimate strength study though it may be a little different from the actual crack propagation path when a crack propagates the strains at the areas near the crack tips are slightly greater than the material rupture strain in the ultimate strength analysis attention is paid to the whole mechanical capability of structural elements rather than that of the crack tip therefore material rupture strain can be used as crack propagation criteria hu et al 2004 the process of crack propagation is simulated in this paper by using dead live element method of ansys software those elements will be killed and become dead when their tensile strains reach the material fracture strain the stiffness matrix of a dead element is zero and it has no capability to bear load the material rupture strain of steel is about 0 2 0 3 in real practice which is related to the material property the value of material rupture strain is often obtained by the material tensile tests to make the crack propagation easier to happen relatively small strain of 0 2 is adopted as threshold value to judge the living or death of the elements for simplification and fundamental research it should be pointed out that the fracture strain used in the paper is an artificial setting as a simplified judgment of crack propagation without considering the effect of crack tip mesh size and other fatigue related factors the crack propagation happens with the increasing number of dead elements the minimum length of crack propagation is the length of a dead element in the crack propagation path the maximum tensile strains in x direction of both intact and cracked plates under monotonic load σ m with different crack lengths are presented in table 6 where the crack lengths are the number of dead elements along the crack propagation path it is seen from table 6 that the maximum strains of intact plate and plate with relatively short cracks are too small compared with the threshold value 0 2 so it will take large number of cycles to arise crack propagation and that will also take much computation time hence the plate with a preset crack length of 243 elements about 283 3 mm is adopted for analysis in order to avoid time consuming 3 2 2 analysis of the plate with a preset crack the crack propagation in the cracked plate is shown in fig 8 the stress distribution at uls ultimate limit state near crack area is presented for the cracked plate after firstly applying some cycles of cyclic loads and then monotonic loading only local areas of propagated lengths of the crack are shown in fig 8 to make the process of crack propagation more obvious to be observed accumulated incremental plastic damages will lead to failure of elements near the crack tip different from the case in section 3 1 the residual stress and residual strain under cyclic loads near the crack tip cannot be ignored due to the stress concentration the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates under monotonic loading is also presented here for comparison the preset crack lengths and width are the same with that of the crack in the process of crack propagation the non dimensional residual ultimate strength σ u σ y of these cracked plates is shown in table 7 where difference1 is the deviation between the results of cyclic loads and monotonic loads in present study difference2 is the deviation between the results of cyclic loads in present study and those under monotonic loads by cui et al 2016 the 5 crack lengths in table 7 are taken from the process of crack propagation under 5 times of cyclic loads in fig 8 respectively fig 9 shows a typical preset crack which has the same crack length with the cracked plate after 19 cycles of cyclic loads it can be concluded from table 7 that the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates under cyclic loading decreases as the number of cycles increase it is also seen that there is little difference between the residual ultimate strengths of cracked plates under cyclic loads and monotonic loads if the crack length is the same it reveals that local residual stress and residual strain under cyclic loads near the crack tip have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of the cracked plate the crack length which reduces the bearing section area is the key factor to affect the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates under cyclic loads the buckling modes and equivalent stress distribution of the cracked plates under cyclic loads and monotonic loads at uls ultimate limit state are shown in fig 10 it is observed from figs 10a and b that the high level stress area moves with the movement of the crack tip when the crack propagate under cyclic loads the similarity of equivalent stress distribution between figs 10b and c verifies that the local residual stress and residual strain under cyclic loads near the crack tip barely affect the equivalent stress distribution of cracked plates at uls meanwhile the failure modes are still the same with the lowest buckling mode and not influenced by the crack propagation the preset crack can be regarded as an initial crack in the process of the crack propagation therefore the number of cycles before the propagation of preset crack starts could be ignored when calculating the crack propagation rate it is shown in fig 11 that the maximum strain at the crack tip after 3 cycles of cyclic loads has reached 0 2 hence the preset crack begins to propagate at the 4th cycle so the first three cycles are not taken into account in the propagation rate the propagated lengths of the preset crack after different cycles of loads are recorded in table 7 it is observed from table 8 that the propagated length of preset crack varies almost linearly with the number of cycles similar phenomenon is also found in the preset crack of 162 element edge length 188 9 mm as shown in table 9 the propagation rates of the two preset crack are remarkable and keep stable within a certain range the crack propagation is in crack stable growth stage for the crack length therefore the propagation rates of the crack length 283 3 mm and 188 9 mm can be estimated as the average propagation rates from the data in tables 8 and 9 the propagation rate is 8 16 mm cycle and 6 34 mm cycle respectively 3 2 3 crack propagation rate it is concluded from table 6 in section 3 2 1 that the rate of accumulated element strain at the crack tip is relatively small for intact plate and the plate with relatively short cracks that means it will take large number of cycles for the crack propagation to happen the crack propagation rate of these plates should be very small therefore the change rate of residual ultimate strength will also be very small these incremental crack lengths are not necessary to be included when evaluating the residual ultimate strength an approximate method of calculating the propagation rate is introduced here to verify the assumption and improve computational efficiency the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip will not affect the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates directly however it will influence the propagation rate of the crack then it can affect the residual ultimate strength of the cracked plate this fact is more obvious when the preset crack length is relatively short and the accumulated residual strain in each cycle is relatively small for the crack to propagate after small number of cycles fig 12 presents the accumulated strain at the crack tip in the plate with a preset crack of 81 element edge length after 1 cycle and 19 cycles of cyclic loads it is found that there is no crack propagation after 19 cycles of cyclic loads and the element strains at the crack tip at 1 cycle and after 19 cycles are ε 0 0 028818 and ε 19 0 199327 respectively that is to say the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip is not enough less than the fracture strain 0 2 for the crack to propagate here the average accumulated strain in each cycle is defined as dε ε n ε 0 n n 19 hence the strain at the crack tip after 20 cycles will be ε 20 ε 19 dε 0 2083 which is greater than the threshold value of fracture strain 0 2 therefore the crack will begin to propagate at the 21st cycle this assumption is verified in fig 13 a and fig 13b it has been mentioned above that the number of cycles before crack propagation may not be taken into consideration when calculating the propagation rate so further propagation needs to be obtained the strain of the element adjacent to the crack tip in the propagation path in figs 12a and b are ε 0 0 012648 and ε 19 0 062081 the average accumulated strain of that element in each cycle is defined as dε ε n ε 0 n here n 19 the element adjacent to the crack tip will become the next crack tip as the element at the crack tip in fig 12b is killed after 20 cycles of cyclic loads and it will gain extra strain ε 0 for becoming the crack tip hence the strain of the element adjacent to the crack tip after 20 cycles of cyclic loads should be ε n dε ε 0 here n 19 and the accumulated strain of that element in each cycle will change to dε the number of cycles when the next propagation happens can be defined as the minimum integer satisfying the inequality equation as bellow 5 i 0 2 ε n d ε ε 0 d ε 1 here i 13 n 19 the next propagation happens after 20 i 33 cycles of cyclic loads as shown in fig 13c and d therefore the propagation rate of the preset crack of 81 element edge length about 94 4 mm under cyclic load is 1 i 0 077 mm cycle the propagation rate of other cracked plates with different preset crack lengths listed in table 4 can also be obtained by eq 5 as shown in table 10 3 2 4 relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles it is concluded in section 3 2 2 and reference 25 30 that the crack length is the key factor to affect the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates under cyclic loads however the crack lengths in ship hull structures are not easy to measure so it may be more reasonable to establish a relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles or service time when ship plates are under severe cyclic loads it is seen from table 10 that the propagation rate before the crack length reaches 188 9 mm is very small this stage of crack propagation can be regarded as the process of micro crack initiation the crack length increases very slowly at this stage the reduction of residual ultimate strength is also at a low level hence the effect of this stage on the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates can be ignored since crack length during stable growth stage is very important therefore the number of cycles is recorded after the crack length 188 9 mm about 0 22b on account of the fact that the residual ultimate strength is seriously influenced by crack length a relationship between crack length and number of cycles is established based on tables 6 and 7 as shown in fig 14 it is seen from fig 14 that the curve obtained from finite element simulation is very close to the approximate curve therefore the relationship between crack lengths and number of cycles can be approximately expressed as 6 c 6 6 n 180 6 where n is the number of cycles recorded after the crack length 188 9 mm about 0 22b 6 6 is the average propagation rate in the range of crack length from 188 9 mm about 0 22b to 413 9 mm about 0 49b then crack propagation may enter instable propagation stage after the crack length reaches half of the breadth of the plate and the plates may fracture quickly the crack length over 413 9 mm about 0 49b is not considered in present paper the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates with different crack lengths can be obtained from the nonlinear finite element calculation as shown in table 4 then the relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles can be derived in fig 15 the propagation rate is very remarkable after the crack length reaches 188 9 mm about 0 22b then residual ultimate strength decreases rapidly with the increasing number of cycles as shown in fig 15 an approximate straight line is also drawn in fig 15 it can be seen that the data points in actual curves are around the approximate curve and very close to it therefore it is reasonable to use this straight line to approximately describe the relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles as 7 σ u σ y 0 003 n 0 463 where σ u σ y is the non dimensional residual ultimate strength n is the number of cycles recorded after the crack length 188 9 mm about 0 22b 0 003 is the average non dimensional reduction rate of residual ultimate strength the number of cycles may be converted into the service time of the ship plates in severe loading condition then relationship between the residual ultimate strength of plates and its life time after crack appear can be obtained 4 conclusions the present paper aims at investigating the residual ultimate strength behavior of ship hull plates under uniaxial cyclic load by numerical analysis a series of elasto plastic large deflection analyses have been carried out with varying the amplitude of cyclic loads the fatigue cracks and crack propagation are considered in the analysis for determining the residual ultimate strength of ship plates under cyclic loads the crack propagation is simulated by a simply method using dead live element technique of ansys software both global and local residual stress and residual strain arose from cyclic load and crack propagation are analyzed to make the residual ultimate strength investigation more practical than previous studies for monotonic loads based on the nonlinear numerical results from present study the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 when the amplitude of cyclic loads is less than the ultimate strength of monotonic increasing loading the global residual stress and residual deformation duo to cyclic loads will be too low to affect the residual ultimate strength of plates 2 local residual stress and residual strain near the crack tip have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of cracked plate under cyclic loads but they will lead to crack propagation the crack length which determines the bearing section area is the key factor to affect the residual ultimate strength of plates under cyclic loads high level stress area moves with the movement of the crack tip when the crack propagates under cyclic loads the failure modes and global stress distributions of plates are not influenced by the crack propagation 3 a simple method is proposed to calculate the crack propagation rate based on the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip which can be used to simplify the computation the crack lengths with low levels of the propagation rate are not taken into account in the computation of the residual ultimate strength the relationship between the residual ultimate strength of cracked plate and the number of cycle is presented to predict the residual ultimate strength of the plate after certain crack length in crack stable growth stage 4 the findings from the present study can reveal insights for better understanding of residual ultimate strength behaviors of cracked plates under cyclic loads although they have to be verified by other studies and experiments the work provides a pioneer effort for further investigation on the residual ultimate strength of plates or stiffened plates with other dimensions and under other different kind of cyclic loads acknowledgement the present study was conducted with financial support from the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51779198 the support is

plates under uniaxial cyclic loads keywords residual ultimate strength cyclic load fatigue damage nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction the ultimate load bearing capacity of ship hull structure has very important significance on the ship security and survivability ship hull plates are the basic structure components of ship hulls the most common working conditions of ship hulls are subjected to alternative hogging and sagging bending moments plates at the deck and bottom of ship hulls mainly bear the maximum in plane tension compression load in the two loading conditions the main load on these plates is uniaxial cyclic load when ship hulls are under longitudinal bending moment so the residual ultimate strength of plates under uniaxial cyclic load is of great practical value to be studied at present most of the evaluation methods for ultimate strength of ship hull plates are built on the basis of the ultimate strength concept under monotonic loads that is the plate collapse is the result of external one off extreme uniaxial loads the fact is that the collapses of ship plates are mostly the consequence of accumulated incremental plastic damage and fatigue damage under repeated extreme loads in rough sea the high level of cyclic loads will cause a continuous reduction of the load bearing capacity of the plate and may eventually led to the collapse of plate under a load value less than the so called ultimate strength under monotonic load therefore the residual ultimate strength criteria under uniaxial cyclic load can more accurately forecasting ultimate bearing capacity of ship hull plates there have been many research work about the ultimate strength of ship hull structures under monotonic load guedes soares 1992 1996 provided a review of simple design methods for plate elements under uniaxial compression and present a method to estimate the ultimate moment based on a simplified approach to predict the collapse strength of beam columns rahman and chowdhury 1996 made an estimation of ultimate longitudinal bending moment of ships and box girders paik et al 1998 2008a 2008b 2008c conducted a series of studies on the ultimate strength of ships and ship shaped offshore structures xu and guedes soares 2013 made a comparison of calculations with experiments on the ultimate strength of wide stiffened panels pei et al 2015 used the idealized structural unit method in the simulation on progressive collapse behavior of whole ship model under extreme waves it is more reasonable to consider the cyclic load on ship hull structures in their lifetime on actual sea conditions researches on the mechanic performance and residual ultimate strength of ship hull structures under cyclic loads are quite rare and some of them are conducted in the civil engineering field yao and nikolov 1990 dealt with buckling plastic collapse behavior and the ultimate strength of plates under cyclic loading huang 1994 1996a b obtained some useful conclusions from theoretical and experimental investigations of the load bearing capacity of plates under in plane cyclic loading xu et al 2012 conducted an experiment to evaluate the post ultimate strength behavior of a ship hull girder in waves by using the specimens in their experiment under cyclic bending fukumoto and kusama 1982 1983 1985a 1985b 1985c analyzed the non elastic deformation of welded box structure under cyclic loading and discovered that the ultimate strength of plates decreases with an increasing number of cycles other literature about the effect of slenderness ratio initial imperfection buckling mode on strength behaviors and energy dissipation capacity as well as hysteretic performance of structures during cyclic loads are discussed in lee and noh 2010 cheng et al 2013 yang et al 2014 fujita et al 1984 usami and ge 1998 cyclic loads from the waves on the sea are likely to cause fatigue damage the most common fatigue damage is cracks crack damages are certain to affect the strength behaviors of ship hull structures paik et al 2004 2005 2009 had carried out a series of experimental and numerical studies on the ultimate strength of cracked plates xu et al 2014 made an assessment of the ultimate strength of stiffened plates with fixed cracks it is concluded from their researches that the projected length perpendicular to the direction of the external load is the key factor to determine the ultimate strength of cracked plates wang et al 2012 studied the strength behaviors of steel plates with multiple crack damage saad eldeen et al 2016 made an experimental investigation on the force displacement relationships dissipated energies strength strain relationships resilience toughness and collapse modes of plate specimen with without different locked cracks up to now most of the ultimate strength assessments are based on the concept of the ultimate strength under monotonic load condition although some researchers paik et al 2004 2005 2009 xu et al 2014 wang et al 2012 saad eldeen et al 2016 have introduced cracks into the ultimate strength assessment the crack propagations under cyclic loads are still not taken into consideration in literature yao and nikolov 1990 huang 1994 1996a b xu et al 2012 fukumoto and kusama 1982 1983 1985a 1985b 1985c lee and noh 2010 cheng et al 2013 yang et al 2014 fujita et al 1984 usami and ge 1998 cyclic loads are taken into account but load levels are usually over the one off ultimate strength of structures and fatigue cracks are ignored that is not the real working condition of ship structures so residual ultimate strength of plates considering accumulated plastic damages and fatigue damages under cyclic loads needs to be studied to explain overall destruction phenomenon of ship hull structure under extreme sea conditions and provide more reliable analysis for correctly predicting the ultimate bearing capacity of ship hull structures the present paper aims at seeking insights into the residual compressive ultimate strength behavior of ship hull plates under cyclic loads the cracks are presumed to be located in transverse direction at the mid span of one longitudinal edge of the plates the residual stress and strain as well as crack propagation during cyclic loads application are all considered in this paper it is concluded that the crack length is the key factor to affect the residual ultimate strength of plates a simple method based on the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip is proposed to calculate the crack propagation rate which can be used to simplify the computation a relationship between the crack length and number of cycles under a typical working condition during crack stable growth stage is built therefore the residual ultimate strength of plates can be derived through the crack length as long as the number of cycles is known 2 finite element models 2 1 geometric and material properties the adopted plate dimension is a b t 2550 850 11 mm here a b and t are the length breadth and thickness of the plate respectively this dimension of the plate is from issc 2012 benchmark study 2012 it was concluded by xu et al 2014 that the crack projected length to the transverse direction is a main parameter to predict the ultimate strength of cracked plates hence the crack propagation path is set in the transverse direction at the present paper it is found out from a numerical analysis that the strain values at the mid span of longitudinal edges are the maximum in the plate when the plate is under axial loads in the longitudinal direction therefore the initial crack is most likely to appear at the mid span of one longitudinal edge as shown in fig 1 the length and breadth of the crack are expressed as c and w and the initial crack width w is 2 3 mm according to the mesh size it is assumed that all the cracks are through thickness the material adopted in the finite element models is high tensile strength steel with yield stress σ y 313 6 mpa young s modulus e 205800 mpa and poisson s ratio ν 0 3 the elastic perfectly plastic material model is used for conservative ultimate strength assessment 2 2 boundary and loading conditions the boundary condition of plates is simply supported the four edges of the plate are kept straight to simulate the effect of adjacent structures nodes at the midpoint of four edges are constrained in relevant directions to prevent rigid body movement the axial loads are applied as uniform displacements at loading edges the boundary and loading conditions are illustrated in fig 2 2 3 initial imperfections initial imperfections duo to fabrication include initial deflections and residual stresses paik 2012 proved that effect of residual stresses is small for hull thin plates it is concluded that welding residual stresses are more likely contribute to the expansion of plasticity in addition to geometrical nonlinearity due to buckling the effect of residual stresses tends to be more serious for thicker plates and less serious in thinner plates it is known from the calculation data in that paper that the effect of welded induced residual stresses are less than 4 3 for the slenderness ratio β 2 64 while in present paper β 3 02 is adopted moreover the welding induced residual stresses will fade during the process of cyclic loads therefore the effect of welding induced residual stresses can be negligible it is also concluded in the authors previous work xia 2018 that initial deflections have much larger effects on the strength behavior of plates than that of residual stresses when the two kinds of initial imperfections are considered together so for simplicity only initial deflections are accounted for in the analysis for rectangle plate the initial deflection can be defined by 1 w 0 k 1 m w 0 b 0 k sin k π x a sin π y b where w 0 is the amplitude of initial deflection w 0 is set as an average level of 0 1β 2 t in present paper m is the number of items b 0k is the coefficients x and y are the locations in the longitudinal and transverse direction β b t σ y e is the plate slenderness ratio in many studies only one term where k m b0k 1 is adopted for simplifications m is the buckling half wave number defined as the minimum integer and satisfying the condition bellow 2 a b m m 1 that happens to be the lowest buckling mode of plates paik et al 2004 conducted investigations on effect of initial deflection shape on the ultimate strength behavior of welded steel plates under biaxial compressive loads it is concluded that an initial deflection shape that approximates the buckling mode with its maximum amplitude selected to be the same as the measured maximum initial deflection is a good representation for the purposes of somewhat pessimistic evaluation of the ultimate strength of plating between stiffeners under biaxial compression as well as under uniaxial compression for more precise investigations more items of eq 1 need to be considered four typical initial deflection patterns are introduced here the values of coefficients b0k for the initial deflection shape are given in table 1 by taking m 11 those parameters are taken from the study of paik et al 2004 the ultimate strength of the plate with the four initial deflections is obtained from finite element analysis and compared with that of the lowest buckling mode in table 2 the ultimate strength is denoted by the average stress on the load edges the differences of the ultimate strengths from the lowest buckling mode initial deflection and the specified initial deflection are shown in table 2 it is known that the plate ultimate strength behavior is affected by the plate initial deflection shape as well as its magnitude among other factors as the actual initial deflection is very complex to simulate the ultimate strength of plates with lowest buckling mode initial deflection is not only close and pessimistic prediction but also easy to adopt in engineering practice demands there are several buckling modes for a plate the lowest buckling mode is the most stable buckling mode and the easiest to be attained as the potential energy of this buckling mode is the lowest therefore the initial deflection pattern of the lowest buckling mode of plates is reasonable and adopted in the present paper 2 4 adopted element and mesh convergence study shell181 of ansys ansys 2007 is adopted for nonlinear finite element analysis it is a four node element with six degrees of freedom at each node i e translations in the x y and z directions and rotations about the x y and z axes both geometric and material nonlinearities can be taken into account in this kind of element shell181 is suitable to simulate thin to moderate thick plates in ship hull structures there are two kinds of meshing strategies here for the ultimate strength study with and without considering fatigue damage as shown in fig 2 the minimum propagation length of cracks is set as 1 166 mm according to the minimum element dimension dense mesh is generated at the mid span of plates to simulate the propagation path of cracks in fig 2b xu et al 2014 found that the ultimate strength values are almost unchanged with the increase of the number of elements near the crack only meshes away from the crack are considered for convergence study in present paper all meshing strategies are listed in table 1 nx and ny are the number of elements along longitudinal and transverse edges respectively an analysis of various meshing strategies as shown in table 3 has been undertaken some results are shown in fig 3 as average stress average strain curves for an intact plate the ultimate strength values of the 6 meshing strategies in table 3 are shown in table 4 it can be seen from fig 3 that there is little difference of the ultimate strength between the 6 meshing strategies of models with and without the mesh of cracks propagation path it is a common sense that coarse mesh may not show the stress distribution precisely while refined mesh will take more computational time middle mesh is adopted in present paper to get a balance between accuracy and computational time middle mesh strategy is also employed in the region away from the crack in fig 2b it is also concluded from table 4 and fig 3 that the ultimate strengths of intact plates are almost the same regardless of the mesh of crack propagation path the results from the nonlinear finite element method are compared with the ultimate strength values predicted by the faulkner 1975 and fujikubo et al 2005 empirical formulas as eqs 3 and 4 it is observed from fig 3 that the ultimate strength obtained from nlfem is very close to that of empirical formulas 3 σ u σ y 2 β 1 β 2 β 1 0 4 σ u σ y 2 4 β 1 4 β 2 β 1 0 where σ u σ y is the non dimensional ultimate strength σ σ y is non dimensional average stress and ε ε y is non dimensional average strain eq 3 based on test results tends to give a relatively safe side estimate of the ultimate strength while eq 4 based on the numerical analysis of a continuous plate assuming hungry horse mode of deflection tends to give the estimate that is larger than eq 3 the numerical results shown in fig 4 are reasonable in this sense 3 numerical results and discussions the residual ultimate strength of a plate under uniaxial cyclic loads is investigated by ansys the solving procedure adopted in the present study is newton raphson nr method 3 1 residual ultimate strength of intact plate under cyclic loads the ultimate strength σ u of an intact plate the plate dimensions refer to subsection 2 1 and the mesh of plate model refer to fig 2a under monotonic compressive loading has been studied as shown in fig 3 for cyclic loading situation since tensile load will promote the compressive residual ultimate strength here only compressive cyclic loads are adopted for conservative results and simplicity three amplitudes of cyclic compressive loads are included i e 0 7σ u 0 8σ u and 0 9σ u which are just below σ u the history of load path and unload path is illustrated in fig 4 where the ordinate is denoted by average stresses applied on the edges of plates σ m is the amplitude of cyclic loads here the abscissa is not the real time but the load step or time step in real loading condition the plates are firstly applied prescribed cycles of uniaxial load with the amplitude σ m like the load path from time 0 to 10 then a monotonic increasing load is applied to obtain the residual ultimate strength like the load path from time 10 to 11 three numbers of cycles namely 5 10 and 15 are investigated in this section the results of 9 cases are shown in fig 5 together with monotonic loading the residual ultimate strengths of plates are almost the same if only σ m is less than σ u regardless of the amplitude of cyclic loads and number of cycles as shown in fig 5 only the stiffness of plate is slightly reduced when σ m is as high as 0 9σ u it is recognized from the reference paik 2012 saad eldeen et al 2012 that the residual stress and deformation arose under cyclic loads should be the cause to influence the strength behaviors of the plates fig 6 shows the residual stresses in the plate after subjected to three amplitudes of cyclic loads the maximum residual axial displacements and deflections after applying prescribed cyclic loads are shown in table 3 where ra and rd stand for maximum residual axial displacements and deflections respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that the level of residual stresses increases and the distribution of residual stresses changes as the amplitude of cyclic load increases the residual deformations after cyclic loads as shown in table 5 have the similar trend as the residual stresses when the amplitude of cyclic load and or number of cycles increase the residual axial displacements and deflections shown in table 5 are relatively very small compared with the initial deflection of the plate the levels of residual stresses after cyclic loads are also very low compared with the yield stress σ y until the amplitude of cyclic loads approach σ u it is inferred that cyclic loads with the amplitude less than ultimate strength σ u will contribute little to the residual deformation and stress in the plates therefore the initial deflection is almost unchanged after cyclic loads that means uniaxial cyclic loads have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of plates as long as the amplitude of applied cyclic load are less than the ultimate strength σ u 3 2 fatigue damages during applying cyclic loads 3 2 1 applied cyclic loads and simulating method of crack propagation fatigue cracks are the typical damages of plates under cyclic loads although the effect of cracks on the residual ultimate strength of ship plates has been studied by many researchers paik et al 2004 2005 2009 xu et al 2014 wang et al 2012 saad eldeen et al 2016 the cracks in most literature are preset and the loads adopted are monotonic loads tian and ji 2011 introduced a damage variable d to measure the ultimate strength reduction caused by low cycle fatigue damages in their study the fatigue damages due to cyclic loads are simplified as deterioration of materials and the true detailed process of the crack propagation was not discussed the effect of fatigue cracks and crack propagations on the residual ultimate strength of plates under cyclic loads is investigated in this paper it is concluded in section 3 1 that uniaxial cyclic loads with the amplitude less than the ultimate strength of plates under monotonic loading have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of plates therefore only one amplitude of cyclic loads adopted in section 3 1 is adopted here to inspect the effect of fatigue crack propagation on the residual ultimate strength of plates under cyclic loads σ m 0 7σ u is adopted in section 3 2 so as to avoid misconvergence of numerical calculation due to severe nonlinearity from large loads and cracks crack propagation will happen when tensile loads are included in cyclic loads so bi directional cyclic load i e both tensile loads and compressive loads are included is considered as illustrated in fig 7 as the compressive residual ultimate strength behavior of ship hull plates under cyclic loads is the main research objectives and the material adopted here is ductile material the exact crack propagation path and fracture toughness are not discussed here so the crack propagation path is set as described in section 2 1 for the residual ultimate strength study though it may be a little different from the actual crack propagation path when a crack propagates the strains at the areas near the crack tips are slightly greater than the material rupture strain in the ultimate strength analysis attention is paid to the whole mechanical capability of structural elements rather than that of the crack tip therefore material rupture strain can be used as crack propagation criteria hu et al 2004 the process of crack propagation is simulated in this paper by using dead live element method of ansys software those elements will be killed and become dead when their tensile strains reach the material fracture strain the stiffness matrix of a dead element is zero and it has no capability to bear load the material rupture strain of steel is about 0 2 0 3 in real practice which is related to the material property the value of material rupture strain is often obtained by the material tensile tests to make the crack propagation easier to happen relatively small strain of 0 2 is adopted as threshold value to judge the living or death of the elements for simplification and fundamental research it should be pointed out that the fracture strain used in the paper is an artificial setting as a simplified judgment of crack propagation without considering the effect of crack tip mesh size and other fatigue related factors the crack propagation happens with the increasing number of dead elements the minimum length of crack propagation is the length of a dead element in the crack propagation path the maximum tensile strains in x direction of both intact and cracked plates under monotonic load σ m with different crack lengths are presented in table 6 where the crack lengths are the number of dead elements along the crack propagation path it is seen from table 6 that the maximum strains of intact plate and plate with relatively short cracks are too small compared with the threshold value 0 2 so it will take large number of cycles to arise crack propagation and that will also take much computation time hence the plate with a preset crack length of 243 elements about 283 3 mm is adopted for analysis in order to avoid time consuming 3 2 2 analysis of the plate with a preset crack the crack propagation in the cracked plate is shown in fig 8 the stress distribution at uls ultimate limit state near crack area is presented for the cracked plate after firstly applying some cycles of cyclic loads and then monotonic loading only local areas of propagated lengths of the crack are shown in fig 8 to make the process of crack propagation more obvious to be observed accumulated incremental plastic damages will lead to failure of elements near the crack tip different from the case in section 3 1 the residual stress and residual strain under cyclic loads near the crack tip cannot be ignored due to the stress concentration the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates under monotonic loading is also presented here for comparison the preset crack lengths and width are the same with that of the crack in the process of crack propagation the non dimensional residual ultimate strength σ u σ y of these cracked plates is shown in table 7 where difference1 is the deviation between the results of cyclic loads and monotonic loads in present study difference2 is the deviation between the results of cyclic loads in present study and those under monotonic loads by cui et al 2016 the 5 crack lengths in table 7 are taken from the process of crack propagation under 5 times of cyclic loads in fig 8 respectively fig 9 shows a typical preset crack which has the same crack length with the cracked plate after 19 cycles of cyclic loads it can be concluded from table 7 that the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates under cyclic loading decreases as the number of cycles increase it is also seen that there is little difference between the residual ultimate strengths of cracked plates under cyclic loads and monotonic loads if the crack length is the same it reveals that local residual stress and residual strain under cyclic loads near the crack tip have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of the cracked plate the crack length which reduces the bearing section area is the key factor to affect the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates under cyclic loads the buckling modes and equivalent stress distribution of the cracked plates under cyclic loads and monotonic loads at uls ultimate limit state are shown in fig 10 it is observed from figs 10a and b that the high level stress area moves with the movement of the crack tip when the crack propagate under cyclic loads the similarity of equivalent stress distribution between figs 10b and c verifies that the local residual stress and residual strain under cyclic loads near the crack tip barely affect the equivalent stress distribution of cracked plates at uls meanwhile the failure modes are still the same with the lowest buckling mode and not influenced by the crack propagation the preset crack can be regarded as an initial crack in the process of the crack propagation therefore the number of cycles before the propagation of preset crack starts could be ignored when calculating the crack propagation rate it is shown in fig 11 that the maximum strain at the crack tip after 3 cycles of cyclic loads has reached 0 2 hence the preset crack begins to propagate at the 4th cycle so the first three cycles are not taken into account in the propagation rate the propagated lengths of the preset crack after different cycles of loads are recorded in table 7 it is observed from table 8 that the propagated length of preset crack varies almost linearly with the number of cycles similar phenomenon is also found in the preset crack of 162 element edge length 188 9 mm as shown in table 9 the propagation rates of the two preset crack are remarkable and keep stable within a certain range the crack propagation is in crack stable growth stage for the crack length therefore the propagation rates of the crack length 283 3 mm and 188 9 mm can be estimated as the average propagation rates from the data in tables 8 and 9 the propagation rate is 8 16 mm cycle and 6 34 mm cycle respectively 3 2 3 crack propagation rate it is concluded from table 6 in section 3 2 1 that the rate of accumulated element strain at the crack tip is relatively small for intact plate and the plate with relatively short cracks that means it will take large number of cycles for the crack propagation to happen the crack propagation rate of these plates should be very small therefore the change rate of residual ultimate strength will also be very small these incremental crack lengths are not necessary to be included when evaluating the residual ultimate strength an approximate method of calculating the propagation rate is introduced here to verify the assumption and improve computational efficiency the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip will not affect the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates directly however it will influence the propagation rate of the crack then it can affect the residual ultimate strength of the cracked plate this fact is more obvious when the preset crack length is relatively short and the accumulated residual strain in each cycle is relatively small for the crack to propagate after small number of cycles fig 12 presents the accumulated strain at the crack tip in the plate with a preset crack of 81 element edge length after 1 cycle and 19 cycles of cyclic loads it is found that there is no crack propagation after 19 cycles of cyclic loads and the element strains at the crack tip at 1 cycle and after 19 cycles are ε 0 0 028818 and ε 19 0 199327 respectively that is to say the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip is not enough less than the fracture strain 0 2 for the crack to propagate here the average accumulated strain in each cycle is defined as dε ε n ε 0 n n 19 hence the strain at the crack tip after 20 cycles will be ε 20 ε 19 dε 0 2083 which is greater than the threshold value of fracture strain 0 2 therefore the crack will begin to propagate at the 21st cycle this assumption is verified in fig 13 a and fig 13b it has been mentioned above that the number of cycles before crack propagation may not be taken into consideration when calculating the propagation rate so further propagation needs to be obtained the strain of the element adjacent to the crack tip in the propagation path in figs 12a and b are ε 0 0 012648 and ε 19 0 062081 the average accumulated strain of that element in each cycle is defined as dε ε n ε 0 n here n 19 the element adjacent to the crack tip will become the next crack tip as the element at the crack tip in fig 12b is killed after 20 cycles of cyclic loads and it will gain extra strain ε 0 for becoming the crack tip hence the strain of the element adjacent to the crack tip after 20 cycles of cyclic loads should be ε n dε ε 0 here n 19 and the accumulated strain of that element in each cycle will change to dε the number of cycles when the next propagation happens can be defined as the minimum integer satisfying the inequality equation as bellow 5 i 0 2 ε n d ε ε 0 d ε 1 here i 13 n 19 the next propagation happens after 20 i 33 cycles of cyclic loads as shown in fig 13c and d therefore the propagation rate of the preset crack of 81 element edge length about 94 4 mm under cyclic load is 1 i 0 077 mm cycle the propagation rate of other cracked plates with different preset crack lengths listed in table 4 can also be obtained by eq 5 as shown in table 10 3 2 4 relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles it is concluded in section 3 2 2 and reference 25 30 that the crack length is the key factor to affect the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates under cyclic loads however the crack lengths in ship hull structures are not easy to measure so it may be more reasonable to establish a relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles or service time when ship plates are under severe cyclic loads it is seen from table 10 that the propagation rate before the crack length reaches 188 9 mm is very small this stage of crack propagation can be regarded as the process of micro crack initiation the crack length increases very slowly at this stage the reduction of residual ultimate strength is also at a low level hence the effect of this stage on the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates can be ignored since crack length during stable growth stage is very important therefore the number of cycles is recorded after the crack length 188 9 mm about 0 22b on account of the fact that the residual ultimate strength is seriously influenced by crack length a relationship between crack length and number of cycles is established based on tables 6 and 7 as shown in fig 14 it is seen from fig 14 that the curve obtained from finite element simulation is very close to the approximate curve therefore the relationship between crack lengths and number of cycles can be approximately expressed as 6 c 6 6 n 180 6 where n is the number of cycles recorded after the crack length 188 9 mm about 0 22b 6 6 is the average propagation rate in the range of crack length from 188 9 mm about 0 22b to 413 9 mm about 0 49b then crack propagation may enter instable propagation stage after the crack length reaches half of the breadth of the plate and the plates may fracture quickly the crack length over 413 9 mm about 0 49b is not considered in present paper the residual ultimate strength of cracked plates with different crack lengths can be obtained from the nonlinear finite element calculation as shown in table 4 then the relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles can be derived in fig 15 the propagation rate is very remarkable after the crack length reaches 188 9 mm about 0 22b then residual ultimate strength decreases rapidly with the increasing number of cycles as shown in fig 15 an approximate straight line is also drawn in fig 15 it can be seen that the data points in actual curves are around the approximate curve and very close to it therefore it is reasonable to use this straight line to approximately describe the relationship between the residual ultimate strength and number of cycles as 7 σ u σ y 0 003 n 0 463 where σ u σ y is the non dimensional residual ultimate strength n is the number of cycles recorded after the crack length 188 9 mm about 0 22b 0 003 is the average non dimensional reduction rate of residual ultimate strength the number of cycles may be converted into the service time of the ship plates in severe loading condition then relationship between the residual ultimate strength of plates and its life time after crack appear can be obtained 4 conclusions the present paper aims at investigating the residual ultimate strength behavior of ship hull plates under uniaxial cyclic load by numerical analysis a series of elasto plastic large deflection analyses have been carried out with varying the amplitude of cyclic loads the fatigue cracks and crack propagation are considered in the analysis for determining the residual ultimate strength of ship plates under cyclic loads the crack propagation is simulated by a simply method using dead live element technique of ansys software both global and local residual stress and residual strain arose from cyclic load and crack propagation are analyzed to make the residual ultimate strength investigation more practical than previous studies for monotonic loads based on the nonlinear numerical results from present study the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 when the amplitude of cyclic loads is less than the ultimate strength of monotonic increasing loading the global residual stress and residual deformation duo to cyclic loads will be too low to affect the residual ultimate strength of plates 2 local residual stress and residual strain near the crack tip have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of cracked plate under cyclic loads but they will lead to crack propagation the crack length which determines the bearing section area is the key factor to affect the residual ultimate strength of plates under cyclic loads high level stress area moves with the movement of the crack tip when the crack propagates under cyclic loads the failure modes and global stress distributions of plates are not influenced by the crack propagation 3 a simple method is proposed to calculate the crack propagation rate based on the accumulated residual strain at the crack tip which can be used to simplify the computation the crack lengths with low levels of the propagation rate are not taken into account in the computation of the residual ultimate strength the relationship between the residual ultimate strength of cracked plate and the number of cycle is presented to predict the residual ultimate strength of the plate after certain crack length in crack stable growth stage 4 the findings from the present study can reveal insights for better understanding of residual ultimate strength behaviors of cracked plates under cyclic loads although they have to be verified by other studies and experiments the work provides a pioneer effort for further investigation on the residual ultimate strength of plates or stiffened plates with other dimensions and under other different kind of cyclic loads acknowledgement the present study was conducted with financial support from the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51779198 the support is

23061,two dimensional freely floating body motion responses induced by wave and current are investigated in seabed conditions this problem is solved by boundary integral method which is formulated by a combination of steady diffraction radiation and reflection potential problems accounting for current incoming wave and seabed effects respectively all the three potential problems are solved using a boundary element model involving a continuous rankine source method subject to appropriate boundary conditions the presence of incoming wave current and seabed causes an asymmetric fluid domain numerical simulations show that water depth seabed slope angle current speed current direction and cross coupling effects are significantly important for surge heave and roll motion responses keywords freely floating body wave and current seabed effect boundary integral method 1 introduction many offshore structures are operated in open coastal waters or harbours in real ocean environment these structures are subject to waves current and variable seabed profiles the accurate predictions of their motion responses are of importance for design and operation as well as academic research the investigation of hydrodynamic responses of rigid body subject to wave current and seabed requires a complicated mathematic model and numerical algorithm yu and ursell 1961 tuck 1970 andersen 1979 yeung 1981 and feng et al 2016 pointed out the importance of water depth on the hydrodynamic responses of offshore structure in the absence of current the numerical approaches describing the flat seabed case are not directly applicable to sloping bottom contours as sloping seabed generates reflection wave moving towards the floating body buchner 2006 ferreira and newman 2009 and de hauteclocque et al 2009 developed second body model to describe the sloping seabed profile and found a sloping seabed substantially influences the magnitudes of the cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients however this method suffers a clear wiggle in motion response amplitude operator rao profile belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 belibassakis 2008 and pinkster 2011 adopted a multi domain approach to divide the fluid domain into an interior domain of variable water depth and an exterior domain of constant depth the incident wave potential is modified so that it satisfies the seabed condition on the sloping part of the seabed the numerical predictions of belibassakis 2005 and belibassakis 2008 show that the sloping seabed significantly effects the body motion rao kim and kim 2013 and ding et al 2017 proposed rankine source model coupled to the boussinesq equation the latter supplied all the relevant information concerning the fluid domain including incoming wave and reflection wave kim and kim 2013 found that the peak frequency of the exciting forces and motion responses shifted ahead due to the sloping seabed effects for the deep water situation in the presence of a current newman 1965 inglis and price 1981 wu and eatock taylor 1988 and grue and palm 1985 investigated wave radiation and diffraction problems by developing a forward speed green function generally significant computational difficulties arise due to the complexity in evaluating the forward speed green function sen 2002 zhao and faltinsen 1988 combined the rankine source model in the near field with a multipole expansion in the far field to analyse the coexistence of wave and current in the frequency domain the numerical prediction of zhao and faltinsen 1988 shows that current has limited effects on the hydrodynamic coefficients but noticeably changes the wave diffraction force these conclusions are further confirmed by nossen et al 1991 who derived the green function for small forward speed in terms of the zero speed green function and its derivatives based on a rankine source model in the whole fluid field isaacson and cheung 1993 lin and hsiao 1994 cheung et al 1996 and büchmann et al 1998 separated the boundary integral problem into a steady current problem with a rigid wall condition applied at the still water surface and an unsteady wave problem with modified free surface boundary conditions accounting for the disturbed wave field caused by current kinoshita and bao 1996 and mazarakos and mavrakos 2013 demonstrated the importance of hydrodynamic effects caused by combination of small current and flat seabed feng et al 2017 introduced a wave reflection potential to satisfy the wave reflection caused by the sloping seabed based on rankine source model feng and price 2018 further developed a mathematical model allowing investigations of wave current seabed interaction problems this is achieved by constructing three boundary element equations using rankine source integral formulations the first equation deals with the steady problem accounting for only a current flowing pass a fixed body in finite water depth the second describes the wave diffraction problem with the free surface boundary conditions modified to include current effects and the seabed environment the final equation accounts for wave reflection arising from the sloping seabed the superposition of these three wave potential problems constructs the mathematical model to examine the hydrodynamic responses of a body interacting with the wave current and various seabed profiles however the cross coupling effects between different body motion modes are ignored in that study feng and price 2018 tasai 1965 studied the freely floating body motions in deep water condition without current and seabed effects by comparing both coupled and uncoupled models tasai 1965 found that the uncoupled model generally predicts the body motions fairly well as the coupling effects are very small vugts 1968 investigated the flat seabed effect on the freely body responses and concluded that the coupling effects from roll into sway become important for shallow water case salvesen et al 1970 confirmed the findings of tasai 1965 vugts 1968 and pointed out that these phenomena can be explained by the facts that added mass and damping are either 0 or very small due to symmetry nature of fluid domain the presence of incoming wave current and sloping seabed forms an asymmetry nature of the fluid domain and therefore produces noticeable cross coupling effects between different motion modes for freely floating structure this paper aims to investigate the freely floating body motion responses induced by a combination of wave current and seabed with emphasis of the cross coupling effects between different motion modes a radiation potential is introduced to evaluate the diagonal and cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients both coupled and uncoupled models are developed based on the body motion equations and the cross coupling effects are presented and discussed by comparing these two models 2 problem formulation 2 1 fluid motion equations fig 1 illustrates a coordinate frame of reference o x z with origin o at the centre of a two dimensional body floating in a fluid domain of finite water depth the fluid domain ω is bounded by a free surface s f body surface s b seabed surface s 0 and an enclosing surface at infinity s the fluid flow is assumed irrotational and is described by the velocity potential ϕ satisfying the laplace equation 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 in the fluid domain ω the velocity potential ϕ can be divided into a steady velocity potential ϕ s created by the steady incoming current and an unsteady velocity potential ϕ u accounting for the combined effects of wave and current within the seabed environment the total velocity potential ϕ is therefore further expressed as 2 ϕ x z t ϕ s x z ϕ u x z t to account for wave reflections from the sloping seabed a reflection wave potential ϕ r e is introduced to satisfy the sloping seabed boundary condition and therefore for freely floating body experiencing induced motions by incoming wave we have 3 ϕ u x z t ϕ i x z t ϕ d x z t ϕ r x z t ϕ r e x z t here ϕ i ϕ d and ϕ r represent incident wave potential diffraction potential and radiation potential respectively 2 2 steady potential problem the steady potential ϕ s x z accounts for the interaction between the fixed body and the steady current the current speed u is variable in the x direction and assumed uniform in the z direction in present study in constant water depth it is assumed constant u with designation u x in the sloping seabed fluid region the steady potential ϕ s x z is expressed as the superposition of the current u x and steady disturbance potential ϕ b due to the presence of body in the current this gives 4 ϕ s u x x ϕ b for a semi circular cylinder in deep water a mirror image approach allows determination of an analytical expression for the steady potential as applied in the work of isaacson and cheung 1993 and cheung et al 1996 however this technique is invalid in the presence of a sloping seabed the steady potential ϕ b satisfies the laplace equation described in equation 1 and the steady potential boundary conditions on s b s f and s 0 expressed in the forms 5 ϕ b n b u x n b on s b 6 ϕ b n f 0 on s f 7 ϕ b n 0 0 on s 0 where n b n f and n 0 denote the normal vectors on the body free and seabed surfaces and n b n f n 0 represent the derivative in the direction of the normal vectors n b n f and n 0 respectively laplace equation 1 together with boundary conditions 5 6 and 7 constructs a closed boundary equation system for the steady potential ϕ s for arbitrary body shape and seabed conditions as the steady potential is independent of time it is only necessary to calculate it once at the initial time in the whole numerical simulation in the present study the seabed slope is mild and therefore it is assumed that no current is reflected by the sloping seabed that is all the current coming from left hand side moves towards the right hand side the far field boundary condition for ϕ b requires the current moves towards infinity and does not reflect backward a similar boundary condition approach is applied for the unsteady potential in present study both the free and seabed surfaces are divided into inner and outer domains the free surface panels are distributed in an ever increasing method in the outer domain the distance between the centers of neighbouring source panels are distributed in an exponentially increasing manner this provides a large covering of the free surface and seabed surface and therefore the incoming wave and current move towards the far filed without experiencing reflection 2 3 diffraction radiation potential problems the diffraction potential ϕ d x z t describes the time dependent fluid field caused by the coupled effects of incoming wave and current within the seabed environment for an incoming progressive linear wave with wave amplitude a in finite water depth h the velocity potential ϕ i and wave elevation η i are expressed as 8 ϕ i g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h sin k x ω e t 9 η i a cos k x ω e t here g ω e and k denote gravitational acceleration wave encounter frequency and wave number respectively the encounter frequency ω e is given as 10 ω e ω k u as no fluid penetrates the rigid body surface and seabed surface the boundary conditions applicable on the body and flat seabed are respectively 11 ϕ d n b ϕ i n b on s b 12 ϕ d n 0 0 on s 0 the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions including the influence of current are given respectively as 13 ϕ d z η d t η d x ϕ s x η i x ϕ b x on s f 14 ϕ d t g η d ϕ d x ϕ s x ϕ i x ϕ b x on s f here η d refers to the wave elevation caused by wave diffraction only and the terms on the right hand side of equations 13 and 14 describe the coupled effects between incoming wave and current the radiation potential ϕ r x z t accounts for the time dependent fluid field caused by the body motion coupled with current within the seabed environment non permeable boundary condition is applicable for the body and seabed conditions which gives 15 ϕ r n b v b n b on s b 16 ϕ r n 0 0 on s 0 here v b denotes the body experiencing forced harmonic motion the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions for radiation potential ϕ r x z t are 17 ϕ r z η t η x ϕ s x η 2 ϕ s z 2 on s f 18 ϕ r t g η ϕ r x ϕ s x on s f when the current velocity u 0 all the terms on the right hand side of equations 13 14 17 and 18 reduce to zero from equations 4 and 5 in this situation these free surface boundary conditions reduce to those when no current is considered in proposed method the free surface is divided into inner and outer domain in the outer domain the source panel is displaced in an exponentially increasing manner this allows the encompassment of a very large free surface and therefore the generated wave can move towards the far field of this enlarged computational domain without experiencing wave reflections by this numerical technique the radiation condition is well satisfied without the introduction of artificial damping the interested reader can find detailed information of this rankine source panel distribution approach in the previous study by feng et al 2016 2 4 wave reflection potential problem the presence of a sloping seabed causes wave reflections into the fluid domain in this investigation a wave reflection potential ϕ r e is introduced satisfying the laplace equation 1 and its solution is determined by solving the following boundary value equations 19 ϕ r e n b 0 on s b 20 ϕ r e z η r e t η r e x ϕ s x on s f 21 ϕ r e t g η r e ϕ r e x ϕ s x on s f 22 ϕ r e n 0 ϕ i n 0 the boundary element equation is analogous to the description of the wave diffraction around a secondary body by this treatment the unsteady potential ϕ u is regarded as the total potential caused by the interactions of incoming wave with floating body the first body and the sloping seabed the second body located at a constant water depth equation 22 describes the sloping seabed boundary condition whereas in equations 7 and 12 the constant water depth refers to the deeper water depth on the left hand side of the sloping seabed if the seabed is completely flat the reflection potential ϕ r e disappears the reflected wave from the sloping seabed travels into the fluid domain and its interaction with the current as observed on the free surface are described by the right hand sides of equations 20 and 21 in this scenario the reflected wave moves towards the left hand side of the fluid domain and travels into the far field as the proposed source distribution method covers a very large free surface and seabed surface areas on both the left and right hand sides of the body this generated free surface wave will not reflect backwards to provide an additional interaction within the fluid domain 3 rankine source boundary integral equation the continuous rankine source method is applied in all the boundary element equations describing steady potential diffraction radiation potential and reflection potential respectively the fluid domain surfaces are discretized into continuous panels and the raqnkine source integral is analytically calculated as discussed by feng et al 2016 2017 3 1 boundary integral equation by utilizing the gauss divergence theorem and through the application of the dirichlet boundary value problem lamb 1945 pp 59 60 expresses the velocity potential ϕ as a boundary integral of rankine sources distributed on the fluid boundary s s b s f s 0 let the integral domain boundary surfaces s b s f and s 0 be approximated as the sums of n b n f and n 0 panels respectively such that s b i 1 n b s i b s f j 1 n f s j f and s 0 k 1 n 0 s k 0 the velocity potential ϕ x t is discretized as 23 ϕ x t i 1 n b σ i

source strength σ f σ x t seabed source strength σ 0 σ x t and variable of integration d s x the discretization form of boundary element equation for the wave diffraction radiation and reflection problems can be formulated uniformly in one manner the interested reader can find detailed information of numerical discretization of these unsteady potentials in a previous study by feng et al 2017 3

free surface boundary condition applicable to this steady situation is also called solid wall condition isaacson and cheung 1993 cheung et al 1996 the subscript f remains for the purpose of presentation the boundary condition for this steady potential is neumann boundary condition and there is no problem of numerical divergence at the intersection point of the free surface and body surface once σ b σ f and σ 0 are determined the velocity potential ϕ b can be calculated by equation 23 for any source panel on the fluid domain surfaces the value of the velocity potential ϕ b only needs to be calculated once at the initial time and used at each following time step 3 3 hydrodynamic force and moment with source strengths σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 determined by the boundary integral equations applicable to steady and unsteady problems the velocity potentials ϕ x i b t on the body surface s b can be expressed in the form 27 ϕ x i b t i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f ln x i b x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 ln x i b x k d s x the dynamic pressure p p x i b t on the body surface is determined from the bernoulli equation written in the form 28 p x i b t ρ ϕ x i b t t 1 2 ϕ x i b t 2 bearing in mind that ϕ x i b t ϕ s x i b t ϕ u x i b t the first order dynamic pressure p p x i b t can be given explicitly as 29 p x i b t ρ ϕ u x i b t t ϕ s x i b ϕ u x i b t ϕ u x i b t t ϕ s x i b x ϕ u x i b t x ϕ s x i b z ϕ u x i b t z with 30 ϕ s x i b x u x x u x x ϕ b x i b x and 31 ϕ s x i b z ϕ b x i b z the dynamic force f t and moment m t applied on the body surface is determined by integrating the dynamic pressure p x i b t over the body surface as given by 32 f t s b p x i b t n b d s 33 m t s b p x i b t r n b d s where r is the position vector of the body surface d s 3 4 equations of motion describing the dynamics of the body for a freely floating body the position and velocity of body vary at every time step and these variations influence the whole fluid domain newman 1977 pp 307 311 expressed the motion equation for a freely floating body subject to a regular incoming wave in the form 34 j 1 3 m i j a i j ξ j t b i j ξ j t c i j ξ j t f i t i 1 2 3 here m i j denotes body mass matrix whereas a i j b i j and c i j represent the coefficients matrix of added mass fluid damping and hydrostatics respectively the motions of acceleration velocity and displacement of the body are expressed by terms ξ t ξ t and ξ t respectively i j 1 2 3 stand for surge heave and roll motion respectively the frequency domain added mass a i j and damping b i j are calculated by applying fourier series to the dynamic force f t or m t the interested reader can find detailed information of mathematical expression for a i j and b i j in a previous study by feng et al 2017 the added mass matrix a i j and damping matrix b i j are defined as 35 a i j a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 b i j b 11 b 12 b 13 b 21 b 22 b 23 b 31 b 32 b 33 the off diagonal hydrodynamic coefficients a i j and b i j i j reflect the cross coupling effect between different motion modes most of these coefficients are either 0 or negligibly small for symmetry body subject to incoming wave in deep water due to symmetry nature salvesen et al 1970 the presence of current and sloping seabed alters this symmetry and generates large value of off diagonal added mass coefficient a i j and damping coefficient b i j and therefore the cross coupling effects become important for the freely floating body responses in such fluid field the body motion equation 34 can be further formulated as one equation system 36 m 11 a 11 ξ 1 t b 11 ξ 1 t c 11 ξ 1 t a 12 ξ 2 t b 12 ξ 2 t a 13 ξ 3 t b 13 ξ 3 t f 1 t m 22 a 22 ξ 2 t b 22 ξ 2 t c 22 ξ 2 t a 21 ξ 1 t b 21 ξ 1 t a 23 ξ 3 t b 23 ξ 3 t f 2 t m 33 a 33 ξ 3 t b 33 ξ 3 t c 33 ξ 3 t a 31 ξ 1 t b 31 ξ 1 t a 32 ξ 2 t b 32 ξ 2 t f 3 t the solution of this equation system accounts for the cross coupling effect between surge heave and roll motions and therefore it is defined as coupled model in present study by ignoring this coupled effects between different motions body motion equation 34 can be formulated separately as 37 m 11 a 11 ξ 1 t b 11 ξ 1 t c 11 ξ 1 t f 1 t 38 m 22 a 22 ξ 2 t b 22 ξ 2 t c 22 ξ 2 t f 2 t 39 m 33 a 33 ξ 3 t b 33 ξ 3 t c 33 ξ 3 t f 3 t the floating body moves independent of other motion modes and can be obtained solving equations 37 39 separately in contrast to the coupled model this method is therefore named as uncoupled model in present investigation in this investigation the added mass a i j damping b i j and amplitude of diffraction force f i are obtained by solving radiation and diffraction problems separately and then the freely body motion equation 34 is solved in frequency domain it should be noticed that the radiation and diffraction potential can be combined as the scattered potential and the boundary element equation can be solved only once theoretically these two methods produce same results for freely body motion problem in linear model the authors have established the radiation and diffraction problem models in previous research and the freely body motion equation is therefore solved in frequency domain for convenience one advantage is this methodology can switch from coupled model to uncoupled model very easily in the numerical code implementation for coupled model all the items in the matrix are switched on and the cross coupling items are switched off for uncoupled model also this method can give detailed information of added mass damping and diffraction force in the body motion equation 34 and authors can always check the coupling effects by just looking into these items 4 numerical results and discussions 4 1 numerical convergence test numerical convergence tests were performed to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model for reflection potential problem feng and price 2018 in our previous research in this investigation numerical simulation is further performed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model to investigate freely floating body motion responses fig 2 illustrates the problem and associated parameters under investigation here l x denotes the length of the slope in the x direction and l z the height of the slope in the z direction the sloping seabed is divided into three regions h 1 h 2 x and h 3 the constants h 1 and h 3 correspond to the constant depth flat portions on the left and right hand sides of the sloping seabed whereas the variable h 2 x represents the depth of water in the sloping region the presence of the sloping seabed causes changes to the current speed above it this study assumes that no current reflects from the sloping seabed as discussed in section 2 2 for simplicity it is assumed that current speeds u 1 and u 3 are constant on the left hand side x l x 2 and the right hand side x l x 2 of the slope whereas u 2 x is variable in this sloping region l x 2 x l x 2 by the principle of mass conservation it follows that 40 u 1 h l z 2 u 2 x h x tan β u 3 h l z 2 a rectangular cylinder with breadth b to draft d ratio b d 2 is selected as freely floating body this body is located in mean water depth h 2 d four different free body and seabed surface panel number group are tested and detailed information about surface discretization is presented in table 1 fig 3 shows comparisons of heave motion r a o ω 22 between proposed method results by surface discretization group 1 2 3 and 4 and numerical data by software hydrostar the software hydrostar is based on free surface green method bv 2017 it is observed that the proposed model prediction becomes closer to the numerical data by hydrostar as the panel number increases the proposed model based on group 1 and 2 meshing produces excellent agreement with the data by hydrostar and group 2 surface discretization is applied in the following numerical simulations this comparison also demonstrates good numerical convergence of the proposed model to investigate freely floating body motion responses it should be noticed that the coupled model and uncoupled model generate almost same results as there are very limited cross coupling effects for heave motion numerical simulations are performed to investigate the surge and roll motion in deep water conditions without current effects included fig 4 shows comparisons of surge motion r a o ω 11 between numerical results by hydrostar numerical data of vugts 1968 and proposed coupled model results fig 5 demonstrates comparisons of roll motion r a o ω 33 between numerical results by hydrostar numerical data of salvesen et al 1970 and proposed coupled model results the proposed coupled model data shows a reasonable agreement with other published data for both surge and roll motions there is a sudden hump and dip in the surge motion at roll resonance frequency k d 0 58 as shown in fig 4 and unrealistic roll motion at this frequency as shown in fig 5 the overestimation of roll motion at resonance frequency can be explained by the exclusion of viscous effect within potential flow frame salvesen et al 1970 and this overestimation generates the sudden hump and dip in the surge motion in proposed coupled model vugts 1968 in present study the empirical expression method faltinsen 1993 is applied to consider roll viscous damping effect numerical simulations show that the roll motion r a o is largely reduced and the hump and dip are noticeably flattened for surge motion r a o 4 2 seabed effects without current included numerical simulations are performed to investigate the seabed effects without current included based on coupled model fig 6 shows comparisons of surge motion r a o ω 11 a and roll motion r a o ω 33 b between mean water depth h 2 d h 3 d and h 4 d it is noticed that the seabed increases both the surge and roll motions when frequency k d 0 8 the seabed has very limited effect on the body motions when frequency k d 0 8 a sloping seabed will form asymmetry nature of the fluid domain and coupled effects between different motion modes are expected to be produced fig 7 shows comparison of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c for a rectangular cylinder above mean water depth h 2 d with slope angle tan β 1 4 tan β 1 5 and tan β 1 6 it is noticed that the seabed inclination has noticeable effects on the motion responses larger slope angle increases motion r a o in lower frequency range k d 0 6 but has little effects when frequency k d 0 6 4 3 seabed effects with current included in present study current speed is defined by froude number f r u 1 g d and a positive or negative quantity indicates the current direction that is a positive sign indicates a current flowing in the same direction as incoming wave and a negative sign against it due to the presence of current encounter frequency ω e is applied to replace wave frequency ω in the numerical simulation fig 8 shows comparisons of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c between uncoupled model and coupled model for a rectangular cylinder above flat seabed in water depth h 2 d h 4 d in current f r 0 064 the water depth has noticeable effects on the three motion modes both the surge and roll motion r a o increases across the frequency range as water depth decreases for heave motion r a o 22 the shallower water depth shifts the peak motion responses towards lower frequency and reduces motion amplitude it is evident that uncoupled model and coupled model produce obvious differences for all the three body motion results the cross coupling effects become more noticeable than the cases without current considered the coupled model produces a hump for surge motion r a o ω 11 at frequency range 0 45 k d 0 6 these are the combinations of cross coupling effects of heave and roll into surge the coupled model generates smaller heave motion r a o ω 22 for both flat seabed conditions h 2 d and h 4 d across the whole frequency range significant changes are observed for roll motion r a o ω 33 due to cross coupling effects from surge and heave motions the motion amplitudes are largely reduced and nature frequency are noticeably increased instead of smooth curve there are dips appearing at frequency range 0 4 k d 0 5 and these values are approximately corresponding to the heave motion nature frequencies the coupling effects are more obvious for seabed condition h 2 d than h 4 d for both surge and heave motion but less for roll motion for example the differences are about 8 and 14 for water depth h 4 d and h 2 d at frequency k d 0 55 for r a o ω 11 for heave motion the cross coupling effects produces about 6 average difference for h 2 d and 2 for h 4 d case much more differences are observed for roll motion between different water depth the peak motion amplitude is reduced about 70 for h 4 d but 25 for h 2 d fig 9 demonstrates comparison of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c between uncoupled model and coupled model for the rectangular cylinder above sloping seabed with slope angle tan β 1 4 and tan β 1 10 in current f r 0 064 the seabed inclination also has noticeable effects on the motion responses especially in peak response range for all the three motion modes the differences between uncoupled and coupled models are noticeable generally the coupled model produces less motion amplitudes for the three motions except the sudden hump in surge motion it is interesting to notice that the roll motion r a o ω 33 is almost 0 at around frequency k d 0 4 due to the coupling effects from surge and heave motions 4 4 current effects the current can largely change the characteristic of fluid domain and therefore has significant effects on the body motion responses fig 10 shows comparison of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c between uncoupled model and coupled model for this rectangular cylinder above flat seabed with h 2 d in current f r 0 064 and f r 0 064 the current direction significantly effects the motion responses compared with positive current direction negative current increases the response dramatically especially at roll motion peak responses range the negative current also produces a hump and dip for surge motion which implies the importance of coupling effects it is noticed that all the three motion amplitudes are more significantly effected by the cross coupling effects for negative current speed than positive one a significant increasing in roll motion r a o ω 33 at natural frequency is observed further study shows that the cross coupling heave into roll damping coefficients are negative values these values are in the same level as that for roll damping coefficient and reduce the absolute values of roll damping coefficient in other words the total roll wave damping becomes much smaller for coupled model and therefore the roll r a o ω 33 is dramatically increased at nature frequency range fig 11 shows comparison of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c between uncoupled model and coupled model for the rectangular cylinder above sloping seabed with slope angle tan β 1 5 in current f r 0 064 and f r 0 064 similar as flat seabed condition the negative current speed produces large motion responses for all the three motion modes the current speed directions also have similar effects for this sloping seabed condition as for flat seabed case considering the cross coupling effects it is also noticed that there is a dramatic increasing in roll motion r a o ω 33 at nature frequency range and this can also be accounted for by the fact that the heave into roll motion damping decreases the absolute value of roll damping the current shifts the pressure distribution pattern which is generated by incident wave towards the direction of current this effect forms large asymmetry of pressure distribution around body surface and generates large coupling effects between different motion modes it should be noticed that the current reflection is ignored because the current speed is relatively small and the sloping seabed is very long and slope angle is small in the proposed model 5 conclusions the wave and current induced surge heave and roll motion responses of a two dimensional freely floating body over various seabed conditions are investigated by developing boundary integral model this model comprises three boundary integral equations accounting for the associated steady wave diffraction radiation and reflection problems the first one features a neumann boundary condition whereas the other two are constructed as mixed neumann dirichlet boundary conditions these boundary integral equations are formulated using continuous rankine source panels and the rankine source integral is analytically evaluated both coupled and uncoupled body motion models are developed with the aim to emphasize the cross coupling effects between different motion modes caused in this complicated fluid domain the former model considers the cross coupling effects between different motion modes while the latter ignores these effects a numerical convergence test was performed for the freely heave motion of a rectangular cylinder to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed mathematical model an empirical expression for roll viscous damping is interpolated into the model and comparisons with published data about freely surge and roll motions further validated the proposed model for prediction of any degrees of freedom motions water depth seabed slope angle current speed and current direction significantly effect the three body motion responses generally shallower water depth higher slope angle larger current speed and negative current direction generate larger motion responses especially in lower frequency range numerical predictions show that cross coupling effects for surge motion are noticeable for surge motion amplitude curve for all the cases presented in this study the roll into surge motion dominates this coupling effects when there is no current presented for deep water flat and sloping seabed conditions whereas roll into surge and heave into surge effects jointly shape the surge motion r a o ω 11 at roll and heave natural frequency ranges for various seabed conditions the cross coupling effects for heave motion r a o ω 22 is little for deep water and flat seabed conditions without current considered but these effects arise for sloping seabed condition and becomes obvious when current is included for both flat and sloping seabed conditions the surge into roll coupling effects are noticeable for all the cases presented here and heave into roll effects only become important when current are considered for the current moving in opposite direction as incoming wave the heave into roll motion largely reduces the roll damping and significantly increases the roll motion r a o ω 33 for both flat and sloping seabed conditions generally the coupling effects become more obvious for shallower water depth more sloping seabed condition and bigger current speed numerical predictions also show that negative speed has more effects on these coupling effects than positive speed when the speed values are same acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support

23061,two dimensional freely floating body motion responses induced by wave and current are investigated in seabed conditions this problem is solved by boundary integral method which is formulated by a combination of steady diffraction radiation and reflection potential problems accounting for current incoming wave and seabed effects respectively all the three potential problems are solved using a boundary element model involving a continuous rankine source method subject to appropriate boundary conditions the presence of incoming wave current and seabed causes an asymmetric fluid domain numerical simulations show that water depth seabed slope angle current speed current direction and cross coupling effects are significantly important for surge heave and roll motion responses keywords freely floating body wave and current seabed effect boundary integral method 1 introduction many offshore structures are operated in open coastal waters or harbours in real ocean environment these structures are subject to waves current and variable seabed profiles the accurate predictions of their motion responses are of importance for design and operation as well as academic research the investigation of hydrodynamic responses of rigid body subject to wave current and seabed requires a complicated mathematic model and numerical algorithm yu and ursell 1961 tuck 1970 andersen 1979 yeung 1981 and feng et al 2016 pointed out the importance of water depth on the hydrodynamic responses of offshore structure in the absence of current the numerical approaches describing the flat seabed case are not directly applicable to sloping bottom contours as sloping seabed generates reflection wave moving towards the floating body buchner 2006 ferreira and newman 2009 and de hauteclocque et al 2009 developed second body model to describe the sloping seabed profile and found a sloping seabed substantially influences the magnitudes of the cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients however this method suffers a clear wiggle in motion response amplitude operator rao profile belibassakis and athanassoulis 2004 belibassakis 2008 and pinkster 2011 adopted a multi domain approach to divide the fluid domain into an interior domain of variable water depth and an exterior domain of constant depth the incident wave potential is modified so that it satisfies the seabed condition on the sloping part of the seabed the numerical predictions of belibassakis 2005 and belibassakis 2008 show that the sloping seabed significantly effects the body motion rao kim and kim 2013 and ding et al 2017 proposed rankine source model coupled to the boussinesq equation the latter supplied all the relevant information concerning the fluid domain including incoming wave and reflection wave kim and kim 2013 found that the peak frequency of the exciting forces and motion responses shifted ahead due to the sloping seabed effects for the deep water situation in the presence of a current newman 1965 inglis and price 1981 wu and eatock taylor 1988 and grue and palm 1985 investigated wave radiation and diffraction problems by developing a forward speed green function generally significant computational difficulties arise due to the complexity in evaluating the forward speed green function sen 2002 zhao and faltinsen 1988 combined the rankine source model in the near field with a multipole expansion in the far field to analyse the coexistence of wave and current in the frequency domain the numerical prediction of zhao and faltinsen 1988 shows that current has limited effects on the hydrodynamic coefficients but noticeably changes the wave diffraction force these conclusions are further confirmed by nossen et al 1991 who derived the green function for small forward speed in terms of the zero speed green function and its derivatives based on a rankine source model in the whole fluid field isaacson and cheung 1993 lin and hsiao 1994 cheung et al 1996 and büchmann et al 1998 separated the boundary integral problem into a steady current problem with a rigid wall condition applied at the still water surface and an unsteady wave problem with modified free surface boundary conditions accounting for the disturbed wave field caused by current kinoshita and bao 1996 and mazarakos and mavrakos 2013 demonstrated the importance of hydrodynamic effects caused by combination of small current and flat seabed feng et al 2017 introduced a wave reflection potential to satisfy the wave reflection caused by the sloping seabed based on rankine source model feng and price 2018 further developed a mathematical model allowing investigations of wave current seabed interaction problems this is achieved by constructing three boundary element equations using rankine source integral formulations the first equation deals with the steady problem accounting for only a current flowing pass a fixed body in finite water depth the second describes the wave diffraction problem with the free surface boundary conditions modified to include current effects and the seabed environment the final equation accounts for wave reflection arising from the sloping seabed the superposition of these three wave potential problems constructs the mathematical model to examine the hydrodynamic responses of a body interacting with the wave current and various seabed profiles however the cross coupling effects between different body motion modes are ignored in that study feng and price 2018 tasai 1965 studied the freely floating body motions in deep water condition without current and seabed effects by comparing both coupled and uncoupled models tasai 1965 found that the uncoupled model generally predicts the body motions fairly well as the coupling effects are very small vugts 1968 investigated the flat seabed effect on the freely body responses and concluded that the coupling effects from roll into sway become important for shallow water case salvesen et al 1970 confirmed the findings of tasai 1965 vugts 1968 and pointed out that these phenomena can be explained by the facts that added mass and damping are either 0 or very small due to symmetry nature of fluid domain the presence of incoming wave current and sloping seabed forms an asymmetry nature of the fluid domain and therefore produces noticeable cross coupling effects between different motion modes for freely floating structure this paper aims to investigate the freely floating body motion responses induced by a combination of wave current and seabed with emphasis of the cross coupling effects between different motion modes a radiation potential is introduced to evaluate the diagonal and cross coupling hydrodynamic coefficients both coupled and uncoupled models are developed based on the body motion equations and the cross coupling effects are presented and discussed by comparing these two models 2 problem formulation 2 1 fluid motion equations fig 1 illustrates a coordinate frame of reference o x z with origin o at the centre of a two dimensional body floating in a fluid domain of finite water depth the fluid domain ω is bounded by a free surface s f body surface s b seabed surface s 0 and an enclosing surface at infinity s the fluid flow is assumed irrotational and is described by the velocity potential ϕ satisfying the laplace equation 1 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ z 2 0 in the fluid domain ω the velocity potential ϕ can be divided into a steady velocity potential ϕ s created by the steady incoming current and an unsteady velocity potential ϕ u accounting for the combined effects of wave and current within the seabed environment the total velocity potential ϕ is therefore further expressed as 2 ϕ x z t ϕ s x z ϕ u x z t to account for wave reflections from the sloping seabed a reflection wave potential ϕ r e is introduced to satisfy the sloping seabed boundary condition and therefore for freely floating body experiencing induced motions by incoming wave we have 3 ϕ u x z t ϕ i x z t ϕ d x z t ϕ r x z t ϕ r e x z t here ϕ i ϕ d and ϕ r represent incident wave potential diffraction potential and radiation potential respectively 2 2 steady potential problem the steady potential ϕ s x z accounts for the interaction between the fixed body and the steady current the current speed u is variable in the x direction and assumed uniform in the z direction in present study in constant water depth it is assumed constant u with designation u x in the sloping seabed fluid region the steady potential ϕ s x z is expressed as the superposition of the current u x and steady disturbance potential ϕ b due to the presence of body in the current this gives 4 ϕ s u x x ϕ b for a semi circular cylinder in deep water a mirror image approach allows determination of an analytical expression for the steady potential as applied in the work of isaacson and cheung 1993 and cheung et al 1996 however this technique is invalid in the presence of a sloping seabed the steady potential ϕ b satisfies the laplace equation described in equation 1 and the steady potential boundary conditions on s b s f and s 0 expressed in the forms 5 ϕ b n b u x n b on s b 6 ϕ b n f 0 on s f 7 ϕ b n 0 0 on s 0 where n b n f and n 0 denote the normal vectors on the body free and seabed surfaces and n b n f n 0 represent the derivative in the direction of the normal vectors n b n f and n 0 respectively laplace equation 1 together with boundary conditions 5 6 and 7 constructs a closed boundary equation system for the steady potential ϕ s for arbitrary body shape and seabed conditions as the steady potential is independent of time it is only necessary to calculate it once at the initial time in the whole numerical simulation in the present study the seabed slope is mild and therefore it is assumed that no current is reflected by the sloping seabed that is all the current coming from left hand side moves towards the right hand side the far field boundary condition for ϕ b requires the current moves towards infinity and does not reflect backward a similar boundary condition approach is applied for the unsteady potential in present study both the free and seabed surfaces are divided into inner and outer domains the free surface panels are distributed in an ever increasing method in the outer domain the distance between the centers of neighbouring source panels are distributed in an exponentially increasing manner this provides a large covering of the free surface and seabed surface and therefore the incoming wave and current move towards the far filed without experiencing reflection 2 3 diffraction radiation potential problems the diffraction potential ϕ d x z t describes the time dependent fluid field caused by the coupled effects of incoming wave and current within the seabed environment for an incoming progressive linear wave with wave amplitude a in finite water depth h the velocity potential ϕ i and wave elevation η i are expressed as 8 ϕ i g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h sin k x ω e t 9 η i a cos k x ω e t here g ω e and k denote gravitational acceleration wave encounter frequency and wave number respectively the encounter frequency ω e is given as 10 ω e ω k u as no fluid penetrates the rigid body surface and seabed surface the boundary conditions applicable on the body and flat seabed are respectively 11 ϕ d n b ϕ i n b on s b 12 ϕ d n 0 0 on s 0 the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions including the influence of current are given respectively as 13 ϕ d z η d t η d x ϕ s x η i x ϕ b x on s f 14 ϕ d t g η d ϕ d x ϕ s x ϕ i x ϕ b x on s f here η d refers to the wave elevation caused by wave diffraction only and the terms on the right hand side of equations 13 and 14 describe the coupled effects between incoming wave and current the radiation potential ϕ r x z t accounts for the time dependent fluid field caused by the body motion coupled with current within the seabed environment non permeable boundary condition is applicable for the body and seabed conditions which gives 15 ϕ r n b v b n b on s b 16 ϕ r n 0 0 on s 0 here v b denotes the body experiencing forced harmonic motion the linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions for radiation potential ϕ r x z t are 17 ϕ r z η t η x ϕ s x η 2 ϕ s z 2 on s f 18 ϕ r t g η ϕ r x ϕ s x on s f when the current velocity u 0 all the terms on the right hand side of equations 13 14 17 and 18 reduce to zero from equations 4 and 5 in this situation these free surface boundary conditions reduce to those when no current is considered in proposed method the free surface is divided into inner and outer domain in the outer domain the source panel is displaced in an exponentially increasing manner this allows the encompassment of a very large free surface and therefore the generated wave can move towards the far field of this enlarged computational domain without experiencing wave reflections by this numerical technique the radiation condition is well satisfied without the introduction of artificial damping the interested reader can find detailed information of this rankine source panel distribution approach in the previous study by feng et al 2016 2 4 wave reflection potential problem the presence of a sloping seabed causes wave reflections into the fluid domain in this investigation a wave reflection potential ϕ r e is introduced satisfying the laplace equation 1 and its solution is determined by solving the following boundary value equations 19 ϕ r e n b 0 on s b 20 ϕ r e z η r e t η r e x ϕ s x on s f 21 ϕ r e t g η r e ϕ r e x ϕ s x on s f 22 ϕ r e n 0 ϕ i n 0 the boundary element equation is analogous to the description of the wave diffraction around a secondary body by this treatment the unsteady potential ϕ u is regarded as the total potential caused by the interactions of incoming wave with floating body the first body and the sloping seabed the second body located at a constant water depth equation 22 describes the sloping seabed boundary condition whereas in equations 7 and 12 the constant water depth refers to the deeper water depth on the left hand side of the sloping seabed if the seabed is completely flat the reflection potential ϕ r e disappears the reflected wave from the sloping seabed travels into the fluid domain and its interaction with the current as observed on the free surface are described by the right hand sides of equations 20 and 21 in this scenario the reflected wave moves towards the left hand side of the fluid domain and travels into the far field as the proposed source distribution method covers a very large free surface and seabed surface areas on both the left and right hand sides of the body this generated free surface wave will not reflect backwards to provide an additional interaction within the fluid domain 3 rankine source boundary integral equation the continuous rankine source method is applied in all the boundary element equations describing steady potential diffraction radiation potential and reflection potential respectively the fluid domain surfaces are discretized into continuous panels and the raqnkine source integral is analytically calculated as discussed by feng et al 2016 2017 3 1 boundary integral equation by utilizing the gauss divergence theorem and through the application of the dirichlet boundary value problem lamb 1945 pp 59 60 expresses the velocity potential ϕ as a boundary integral of rankine sources distributed on the fluid boundary s s b s f s 0 let the integral domain boundary surfaces s b s f and s 0 be approximated as the sums of n b n f and n 0 panels respectively such that s b i 1 n b s i b s f j 1 n f s j f and s 0 k 1 n 0 s k 0 the velocity potential ϕ x t is discretized as 23 ϕ x t i 1 n b σ i

source strength σ f σ x t seabed source strength σ 0 σ x t and variable of integration d s x the discretization form of boundary element equation for the wave diffraction radiation and reflection problems can be formulated uniformly in one manner the interested reader can find detailed information of numerical discretization of these unsteady potentials in a previous study by feng et al 2017 3

free surface boundary condition applicable to this steady situation is also called solid wall condition isaacson and cheung 1993 cheung et al 1996 the subscript f remains for the purpose of presentation the boundary condition for this steady potential is neumann boundary condition and there is no problem of numerical divergence at the intersection point of the free surface and body surface once σ b σ f and σ 0 are determined the velocity potential ϕ b can be calculated by equation 23 for any source panel on the fluid domain surfaces the value of the velocity potential ϕ b only needs to be calculated once at the initial time and used at each following time step 3 3 hydrodynamic force and moment with source strengths σ i b σ j f and σ k 0 determined by the boundary integral equations applicable to steady and unsteady problems the velocity potentials ϕ x i b t on the body surface s b can be expressed in the form 27 ϕ x i b t i 1 n b σ i b s i b ln x i b x i d s x j 1 n f σ j f s j f ln x i b x j d s x k 1 n 0 σ k 0 s k 0 ln x i b x k d s x the dynamic pressure p p x i b t on the body surface is determined from the bernoulli equation written in the form 28 p x i b t ρ ϕ x i b t t 1 2 ϕ x i b t 2 bearing in mind that ϕ x i b t ϕ s x i b t ϕ u x i b t the first order dynamic pressure p p x i b t can be given explicitly as 29 p x i b t ρ ϕ u x i b t t ϕ s x i b ϕ u x i b t ϕ u x i b t t ϕ s x i b x ϕ u x i b t x ϕ s x i b z ϕ u x i b t z with 30 ϕ s x i b x u x x u x x ϕ b x i b x and 31 ϕ s x i b z ϕ b x i b z the dynamic force f t and moment m t applied on the body surface is determined by integrating the dynamic pressure p x i b t over the body surface as given by 32 f t s b p x i b t n b d s 33 m t s b p x i b t r n b d s where r is the position vector of the body surface d s 3 4 equations of motion describing the dynamics of the body for a freely floating body the position and velocity of body vary at every time step and these variations influence the whole fluid domain newman 1977 pp 307 311 expressed the motion equation for a freely floating body subject to a regular incoming wave in the form 34 j 1 3 m i j a i j ξ j t b i j ξ j t c i j ξ j t f i t i 1 2 3 here m i j denotes body mass matrix whereas a i j b i j and c i j represent the coefficients matrix of added mass fluid damping and hydrostatics respectively the motions of acceleration velocity and displacement of the body are expressed by terms ξ t ξ t and ξ t respectively i j 1 2 3 stand for surge heave and roll motion respectively the frequency domain added mass a i j and damping b i j are calculated by applying fourier series to the dynamic force f t or m t the interested reader can find detailed information of mathematical expression for a i j and b i j in a previous study by feng et al 2017 the added mass matrix a i j and damping matrix b i j are defined as 35 a i j a 11 a 12 a 13 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33 b i j b 11 b 12 b 13 b 21 b 22 b 23 b 31 b 32 b 33 the off diagonal hydrodynamic coefficients a i j and b i j i j reflect the cross coupling effect between different motion modes most of these coefficients are either 0 or negligibly small for symmetry body subject to incoming wave in deep water due to symmetry nature salvesen et al 1970 the presence of current and sloping seabed alters this symmetry and generates large value of off diagonal added mass coefficient a i j and damping coefficient b i j and therefore the cross coupling effects become important for the freely floating body responses in such fluid field the body motion equation 34 can be further formulated as one equation system 36 m 11 a 11 ξ 1 t b 11 ξ 1 t c 11 ξ 1 t a 12 ξ 2 t b 12 ξ 2 t a 13 ξ 3 t b 13 ξ 3 t f 1 t m 22 a 22 ξ 2 t b 22 ξ 2 t c 22 ξ 2 t a 21 ξ 1 t b 21 ξ 1 t a 23 ξ 3 t b 23 ξ 3 t f 2 t m 33 a 33 ξ 3 t b 33 ξ 3 t c 33 ξ 3 t a 31 ξ 1 t b 31 ξ 1 t a 32 ξ 2 t b 32 ξ 2 t f 3 t the solution of this equation system accounts for the cross coupling effect between surge heave and roll motions and therefore it is defined as coupled model in present study by ignoring this coupled effects between different motions body motion equation 34 can be formulated separately as 37 m 11 a 11 ξ 1 t b 11 ξ 1 t c 11 ξ 1 t f 1 t 38 m 22 a 22 ξ 2 t b 22 ξ 2 t c 22 ξ 2 t f 2 t 39 m 33 a 33 ξ 3 t b 33 ξ 3 t c 33 ξ 3 t f 3 t the floating body moves independent of other motion modes and can be obtained solving equations 37 39 separately in contrast to the coupled model this method is therefore named as uncoupled model in present investigation in this investigation the added mass a i j damping b i j and amplitude of diffraction force f i are obtained by solving radiation and diffraction problems separately and then the freely body motion equation 34 is solved in frequency domain it should be noticed that the radiation and diffraction potential can be combined as the scattered potential and the boundary element equation can be solved only once theoretically these two methods produce same results for freely body motion problem in linear model the authors have established the radiation and diffraction problem models in previous research and the freely body motion equation is therefore solved in frequency domain for convenience one advantage is this methodology can switch from coupled model to uncoupled model very easily in the numerical code implementation for coupled model all the items in the matrix are switched on and the cross coupling items are switched off for uncoupled model also this method can give detailed information of added mass damping and diffraction force in the body motion equation 34 and authors can always check the coupling effects by just looking into these items 4 numerical results and discussions 4 1 numerical convergence test numerical convergence tests were performed to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model for reflection potential problem feng and price 2018 in our previous research in this investigation numerical simulation is further performed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model to investigate freely floating body motion responses fig 2 illustrates the problem and associated parameters under investigation here l x denotes the length of the slope in the x direction and l z the height of the slope in the z direction the sloping seabed is divided into three regions h 1 h 2 x and h 3 the constants h 1 and h 3 correspond to the constant depth flat portions on the left and right hand sides of the sloping seabed whereas the variable h 2 x represents the depth of water in the sloping region the presence of the sloping seabed causes changes to the current speed above it this study assumes that no current reflects from the sloping seabed as discussed in section 2 2 for simplicity it is assumed that current speeds u 1 and u 3 are constant on the left hand side x l x 2 and the right hand side x l x 2 of the slope whereas u 2 x is variable in this sloping region l x 2 x l x 2 by the principle of mass conservation it follows that 40 u 1 h l z 2 u 2 x h x tan β u 3 h l z 2 a rectangular cylinder with breadth b to draft d ratio b d 2 is selected as freely floating body this body is located in mean water depth h 2 d four different free body and seabed surface panel number group are tested and detailed information about surface discretization is presented in table 1 fig 3 shows comparisons of heave motion r a o ω 22 between proposed method results by surface discretization group 1 2 3 and 4 and numerical data by software hydrostar the software hydrostar is based on free surface green method bv 2017 it is observed that the proposed model prediction becomes closer to the numerical data by hydrostar as the panel number increases the proposed model based on group 1 and 2 meshing produces excellent agreement with the data by hydrostar and group 2 surface discretization is applied in the following numerical simulations this comparison also demonstrates good numerical convergence of the proposed model to investigate freely floating body motion responses it should be noticed that the coupled model and uncoupled model generate almost same results as there are very limited cross coupling effects for heave motion numerical simulations are performed to investigate the surge and roll motion in deep water conditions without current effects included fig 4 shows comparisons of surge motion r a o ω 11 between numerical results by hydrostar numerical data of vugts 1968 and proposed coupled model results fig 5 demonstrates comparisons of roll motion r a o ω 33 between numerical results by hydrostar numerical data of salvesen et al 1970 and proposed coupled model results the proposed coupled model data shows a reasonable agreement with other published data for both surge and roll motions there is a sudden hump and dip in the surge motion at roll resonance frequency k d 0 58 as shown in fig 4 and unrealistic roll motion at this frequency as shown in fig 5 the overestimation of roll motion at resonance frequency can be explained by the exclusion of viscous effect within potential flow frame salvesen et al 1970 and this overestimation generates the sudden hump and dip in the surge motion in proposed coupled model vugts 1968 in present study the empirical expression method faltinsen 1993 is applied to consider roll viscous damping effect numerical simulations show that the roll motion r a o is largely reduced and the hump and dip are noticeably flattened for surge motion r a o 4 2 seabed effects without current included numerical simulations are performed to investigate the seabed effects without current included based on coupled model fig 6 shows comparisons of surge motion r a o ω 11 a and roll motion r a o ω 33 b between mean water depth h 2 d h 3 d and h 4 d it is noticed that the seabed increases both the surge and roll motions when frequency k d 0 8 the seabed has very limited effect on the body motions when frequency k d 0 8 a sloping seabed will form asymmetry nature of the fluid domain and coupled effects between different motion modes are expected to be produced fig 7 shows comparison of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c for a rectangular cylinder above mean water depth h 2 d with slope angle tan β 1 4 tan β 1 5 and tan β 1 6 it is noticed that the seabed inclination has noticeable effects on the motion responses larger slope angle increases motion r a o in lower frequency range k d 0 6 but has little effects when frequency k d 0 6 4 3 seabed effects with current included in present study current speed is defined by froude number f r u 1 g d and a positive or negative quantity indicates the current direction that is a positive sign indicates a current flowing in the same direction as incoming wave and a negative sign against it due to the presence of current encounter frequency ω e is applied to replace wave frequency ω in the numerical simulation fig 8 shows comparisons of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c between uncoupled model and coupled model for a rectangular cylinder above flat seabed in water depth h 2 d h 4 d in current f r 0 064 the water depth has noticeable effects on the three motion modes both the surge and roll motion r a o increases across the frequency range as water depth decreases for heave motion r a o 22 the shallower water depth shifts the peak motion responses towards lower frequency and reduces motion amplitude it is evident that uncoupled model and coupled model produce obvious differences for all the three body motion results the cross coupling effects become more noticeable than the cases without current considered the coupled model produces a hump for surge motion r a o ω 11 at frequency range 0 45 k d 0 6 these are the combinations of cross coupling effects of heave and roll into surge the coupled model generates smaller heave motion r a o ω 22 for both flat seabed conditions h 2 d and h 4 d across the whole frequency range significant changes are observed for roll motion r a o ω 33 due to cross coupling effects from surge and heave motions the motion amplitudes are largely reduced and nature frequency are noticeably increased instead of smooth curve there are dips appearing at frequency range 0 4 k d 0 5 and these values are approximately corresponding to the heave motion nature frequencies the coupling effects are more obvious for seabed condition h 2 d than h 4 d for both surge and heave motion but less for roll motion for example the differences are about 8 and 14 for water depth h 4 d and h 2 d at frequency k d 0 55 for r a o ω 11 for heave motion the cross coupling effects produces about 6 average difference for h 2 d and 2 for h 4 d case much more differences are observed for roll motion between different water depth the peak motion amplitude is reduced about 70 for h 4 d but 25 for h 2 d fig 9 demonstrates comparison of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c between uncoupled model and coupled model for the rectangular cylinder above sloping seabed with slope angle tan β 1 4 and tan β 1 10 in current f r 0 064 the seabed inclination also has noticeable effects on the motion responses especially in peak response range for all the three motion modes the differences between uncoupled and coupled models are noticeable generally the coupled model produces less motion amplitudes for the three motions except the sudden hump in surge motion it is interesting to notice that the roll motion r a o ω 33 is almost 0 at around frequency k d 0 4 due to the coupling effects from surge and heave motions 4 4 current effects the current can largely change the characteristic of fluid domain and therefore has significant effects on the body motion responses fig 10 shows comparison of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c between uncoupled model and coupled model for this rectangular cylinder above flat seabed with h 2 d in current f r 0 064 and f r 0 064 the current direction significantly effects the motion responses compared with positive current direction negative current increases the response dramatically especially at roll motion peak responses range the negative current also produces a hump and dip for surge motion which implies the importance of coupling effects it is noticed that all the three motion amplitudes are more significantly effected by the cross coupling effects for negative current speed than positive one a significant increasing in roll motion r a o ω 33 at natural frequency is observed further study shows that the cross coupling heave into roll damping coefficients are negative values these values are in the same level as that for roll damping coefficient and reduce the absolute values of roll damping coefficient in other words the total roll wave damping becomes much smaller for coupled model and therefore the roll r a o ω 33 is dramatically increased at nature frequency range fig 11 shows comparison of surge motion r a o ω 11 a heave motion r a o ω 22 b and roll motion r a o ω 33 c between uncoupled model and coupled model for the rectangular cylinder above sloping seabed with slope angle tan β 1 5 in current f r 0 064 and f r 0 064 similar as flat seabed condition the negative current speed produces large motion responses for all the three motion modes the current speed directions also have similar effects for this sloping seabed condition as for flat seabed case considering the cross coupling effects it is also noticed that there is a dramatic increasing in roll motion r a o ω 33 at nature frequency range and this can also be accounted for by the fact that the heave into roll motion damping decreases the absolute value of roll damping the current shifts the pressure distribution pattern which is generated by incident wave towards the direction of current this effect forms large asymmetry of pressure distribution around body surface and generates large coupling effects between different motion modes it should be noticed that the current reflection is ignored because the current speed is relatively small and the sloping seabed is very long and slope angle is small in the proposed model 5 conclusions the wave and current induced surge heave and roll motion responses of a two dimensional freely floating body over various seabed conditions are investigated by developing boundary integral model this model comprises three boundary integral equations accounting for the associated steady wave diffraction radiation and reflection problems the first one features a neumann boundary condition whereas the other two are constructed as mixed neumann dirichlet boundary conditions these boundary integral equations are formulated using continuous rankine source panels and the rankine source integral is analytically evaluated both coupled and uncoupled body motion models are developed with the aim to emphasize the cross coupling effects between different motion modes caused in this complicated fluid domain the former model considers the cross coupling effects between different motion modes while the latter ignores these effects a numerical convergence test was performed for the freely heave motion of a rectangular cylinder to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed mathematical model an empirical expression for roll viscous damping is interpolated into the model and comparisons with published data about freely surge and roll motions further validated the proposed model for prediction of any degrees of freedom motions water depth seabed slope angle current speed and current direction significantly effect the three body motion responses generally shallower water depth higher slope angle larger current speed and negative current direction generate larger motion responses especially in lower frequency range numerical predictions show that cross coupling effects for surge motion are noticeable for surge motion amplitude curve for all the cases presented in this study the roll into surge motion dominates this coupling effects when there is no current presented for deep water flat and sloping seabed conditions whereas roll into surge and heave into surge effects jointly shape the surge motion r a o ω 11 at roll and heave natural frequency ranges for various seabed conditions the cross coupling effects for heave motion r a o ω 22 is little for deep water and flat seabed conditions without current considered but these effects arise for sloping seabed condition and becomes obvious when current is included for both flat and sloping seabed conditions the surge into roll coupling effects are noticeable for all the cases presented here and heave into roll effects only become important when current are considered for the current moving in opposite direction as incoming wave the heave into roll motion largely reduces the roll damping and significantly increases the roll motion r a o ω 33 for both flat and sloping seabed conditions generally the coupling effects become more obvious for shallower water depth more sloping seabed condition and bigger current speed numerical predictions also show that negative speed has more effects on these coupling effects than positive speed when the speed values are same acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support

wave energy converter wec hydroelastic response connection design multi objective optimization differential evolution de 1 introduction in recent years pontoon type very large floating structures vlfss have been shown to be one promising solution for creating artificial land on the ocean lamas pardo et al 2015 suzuki 2005 wang et al 2007 watanabe et al 2004 when using vlfs for applications that demand stringent serviceability requirements such as floating aeroplane runways floating container terminals and floating residential estates it is important to have an effective vlfs design to reduce the hydroelastic response i e the vertical deflection of the vlfs to within permissible limits one effective solution for reducing hydroelastic response is by using an auxiliary floating structure attached to the vlfs for example by considering a longish vlfs modelled as a floating beam khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 found that a significant reduction in the beam s hydroelastic response is observed when an auxiliary floating beam is connected to the fore end of the floating beam with a hinge kim et al 2005 then studied the use of an auxiliary floating plate for reducing hydroelastic response of a floating plate as vlfss usually consist of several units another common way to reduce hydroelastic response of vlfs is to design connections between these units by investigating two floating beams connected via a connection riyansyah et al 2010 found that hydroelastic response of the system is affected by both location and stiffness of the connection the effect of location of a flexible connection on hydroelastic response of vlfs made up of two floating mindlin plates was then studied by gao et al 2011 recently yoon et al 2014 conducted both experimental and numerical studies for vlfs with multiple hinge connections and found that hydroelastic response of vlfs is considerably affected by the number of hinge connections considering not only connection stiffness but also the number and layout of connections michailides et al 2013 proposed a numerical framework for obtaining the optimal values of these parameters for minimizing hydroelastic response of modular floating structures another interesting approach to reduce hydroelastic response of vlfs is to absorb a portion of incident wave energy for energy production by using oscillating water column owc wave energy converters wecs for example maeda et al 2000 studied the reduction in hydroelastic response of vlfs where the fore and the aft of the vlfs are equipped with owc wecs hong et al 2006 2007 investigated the reduction in hydroelastic response of vlfs protected by a owc floating breakwater placed at a distance in front of the vlfs or connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges recently ikoma et al 2015 presented the estimation of energy production for a vlfs equipped with owc wecs motivated by the idea to extract wave energy while reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs and the high energy conversion efficiency of the raft wec consisting of two pontoons liu et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 tay 2019 proposed a device here called a raft wec type attachment comprising a single wide pontoon e g 60 m in width connected to the fore edge of vlfs with hinges and linear power take off pto systems in this design concept the relative motion between the pontoon and the fore of the vlfs is converted into power however one limitation of this design is that the power produced decreases significantly with respect to the incident wave angle if the wavelength is small when compared to the pontoon width tay 2019 another limitation is that the large size of the auxiliary pontoon may result in high costs for manufacturing and installation these two limitations have been discussed in detail for the bottom hinged flap type wec comprising a single wide vertical flap connected to the foundation at the seabed with hinges and pto systems wilkinson et al 2017 to overcome these limitations of the bottom hinged flap type wec with a single wide vertical flap the single wide flap was proposed to be replaced by a modular flap comprising multiple independent narrow modules sarkar et al 2016b wilkinson et al 2017 the bottom hinged flap type wec with the modular flap possesses several advantages over the one with the single wide flap including i flexibility for expansion and downsizing ii higher redundancy in the system iii lower manufacturing and installation costs and iv more power produced in oblique waves wilkinson et al 2017 adopting the modular concept for the bottom hinged flap type wec nguyen et al 2018b proposed a modular raft wec type attachment for extracting wave energy while reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs in this study the single wide pontoon of the raft wec type attachment is replaced by multiple independent pontoons to obtain economically effective designs many researchers have studied optimization of wecs sarkar et al 2016a zheng and zhang 2017 as well as vlfss michailides and angelides 2015 nguyen et al 2018a for vlfs with a raft wec type attachment if it is designed for one objective maximizing the power produced or the hydroelastic response reduction another objective is generally not achieved tay 2019 the optimization problem of vlfs with a raft wec type attachment hence consists of two conflicting objectives and may be referred to as a bi objective optimization problem for such a bi objective optimization problem it is important to find the set of optimal solutions i e pareto set deb 2009 price et al 2005 these optimal solutions are not dominated by any other possible solutions for the maximization problem where all objective functions need to be maximized a solution is called to dominate another if and only if at least one of its objective function values is higher and none of its objective function values is smaller the line comprising objective function values of optimal solutions in the objective function space is called pareto front i e the trade off curve the pareto front provides information on how much improving one objective worsens another among different optimization methods evolutionary algorithms including genetic algorithms ga and differential evolution de have been shown to be very effective global optimizers in many areas deb 2009 price et al 2005 ga and de have been widely used for optimization of wecs and vlfss with a single objective michailides et al 2013 nguyen et al 2018a sarkar et al 2016a compared to ga de has been proved to be more efficient in terms of both the convergence rate and the quality of the solution hegerty et al 2009 differential evolution algorithm is also well suited for multi objective optimization problems as it is able to give multiple optimal solutions i e pareto set in a single run deb 2009 pedroso et al 2017 this paper presents optimization of a modular raft wec type attachment to vlfs and connections between floating modules of the vlfs for maximizing wave energy production and reduction in hydroelastic response of the vlfs the modular raft wec type attachment consists of multiple independent auxiliary pontoons connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges and linear power take off pto systems an optimization process based on differential evolution is proposed a numerical analysis framework is presented for determining the power capture factor as well as the hydroelastic response reduction in the numerical analysis the vlfs and multiple auxiliary pontoons are modelled as floating mindlin plates while the linear wave theory is adopted for modelling fluid motions tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 the pto systems are modelled as linear dampers michailides and angelides 2015 the hybrid finite element boundary element fe be method is employed to perform the analysis in the frequency domain tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 the effects of the design variables including pto damping coefficient pontoon length the number of connections and connection stiffness on the pareto front are examined in addition the maximum power capture factor and the hydroelastic response reduction for vlfs with a wec type attachment are investigated for various regular and irregular waves note that in next sections the term modular attachment is used for the modular raft wec type attachment for the sake of brevity 2 vlfs with modular attachment consider the cartesian coordinate systems with its origin at the mid centre of the fore edge of the vlfs that is modelled as a floating mindlin plate with length l width b thickness h mass density ρ young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν as shown in fig 1 the horizontal motions of vlfs are constrained by the mooring dolphin rubber fender system the vlfs

rotational spring stiffness i e connection stiffness per unit length is denoted by k r a modular attachment consists of n a independent auxiliary pontoons connected to the fore edge of vlfs with hinges modelled as a mindlin plate each pontoon has length l a width b a and thickness h and have the same material properties as the vlfs the gap between the vlfs and the pontoons is denoted by s 1 while the gap between pontoons is denoted by s 2 the edge gaps are s 2 2 as shown in fig 1 note that n a s 2 b a b there are n p n p n a linear pto systems placed along the central axis parallel to the ox axis of each pontoon each linear pto system comprises a pair of hydraulic cylinders i e linear dampers placed at levels z r p the linear damping coefficient of each damper is c p 2 the vlfs

of linear dampers which are related to r p unless specified hereafter the design variables in the optimization problem are the pontoon length l a the number of connections n c the connection stiffness k r and the pto damping coefficient c p these design variables can be categorised into two types continuous design variables k r and c p and discrete design variables l a and n c note that here the pontoon length is considered as a discrete design variable instead of a continuous design variable for faster computation see sec 5 the objectives of the optimization problem are to maximize i the reduction in the maximum hydroelastic response of vlfs denoted by f 1 and ii the power capture factor denoted by f 2 this bi objective optimization problem may be expressed as 1 maximize f 1 φ f 2 φ 2 subject to φ φ l φ u where φ l a n c k r c p is the vector of the design variables φ l and φ u are the vectors consisting of the lower and upper bounds of the design variables for a given vector of design variables the two objective function values f 1 and f 2 for regular waves or irregular waves may be determined by using the numerical analysis framework described in sec 4 4 numerical analysis framework the numerical analysis framework for calculating f 1 and f 2 is based on the hydroelastic analysis of vlfs using the hybrid fe be method in the frequency domain tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 4 1 fe be method for hydroelastic analysis of vlfs with modular attachment in the fe be method tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 the plate is first discretised into plate elements the displacement vector at an arbitrary point w w ψ x ψ y t as well as the velocity potential vector ϕ ϕ 0 0 t can be expressed in terms of the vector of displacements w ˆ and the vector of velocity potential ϕ ˆ at the nodes of the plate respectively note that w is the vertical deflection i e hydroelastic response ψ x ψ y are two rotations about y axis and x axis respectively ϕ is the velocity potential and the superscript t denotes the transpose of a vector by applying the finite element method procedure the equation of motion for plate may be written in the global matrix form as 3 k ω 2 m i ω c p w ˆ f w where i is the imaginary unit i e i 2 1 ω the wave frequency k the global stiffness matrix accounting for the presence of the connections between vlfs modules gao et al 2011 and the hinge connection between the vlfs and auxiliary pontoons m the global mass matrix c p the global pto damping vector liu et al 2017 and f w the global vector of water pressure acting on the plate as the water pressure consists of the hydrostatic pressure and the hydrodynamic pressure the vector f w can be written as the summation of these two parts as follows 4 f w k rf w ˆ i ω ρ w k i ϕ ˆ where ρ w is the water density g the gravitational acceleration k rf the global restoring force matrix k i k rf ρ w g and ϕ ˆ the global vector of nodal velocity potentials the velocity potential must satisfy the laplace equation and the boundary conditions on the boundary surfaces of the fluid domain faltinsen 1990 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 by applying the boundary element method bem to the laplace equation and the boundary conditions one obtains the following global matrix form tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 5 k i ϕ ˆ k i ϕ ˆ in ω 2 g g ϕ ˆ i ω g w ˆ where ϕ ˆ in is the global vector of the nodal incident velocity potentials and g is the global matrix of the free surface green s function by substituting ϕ ˆ from eq 5 into eq 4 and then f w from eq 4 to eq 3 we arrive at 6 k k rf ω 2 m ω 2 ρ w k i k i ω 2 g g 1 g i ω c p w ˆ i ω ρ w k i k i ω 2 g g 1 k i ϕ ˆ in the modal expansion method based on the eigenvectors for the free vibration of vlfs with modular attachment is then employed to reduce the size of the linear equation system given by eq 6 kim et al 2013 tay et al 2007 the global nodal displacement vector w ˆ may be approximated by the eigenvectors for the free vibration of vlfs with modular attachment as 7 w ˆ ς 1 s 1 ς 2 s 2 ς n e s n e s ς where s i ς i are respectively the eigenvector and the amplitude corresponding to the ith degree of freedom n e is the number of eigenvectors considered for accurate approximation s s 1 s 2 s ne and ς ς 1 ς 2 ς ne t eq 6 can be rewritten as 8 s t a k ω 2 m i ω c p s ς s t b where 9 a k rf ω 2 ρ w k i k i ω 2 g g 1 g 10 b i ω ρ w k i k i ω 2 g g 1 k i ϕ ˆ in eq 8 is to be solved for the amplitude vector which is then used to compute the nodal displacement vector by using eq 7 note that when the pontoon length l a or the number of connections n c is varied the matrices a b k m c p in eq 8 need to be recalculated as the total degrees of freedom are changed with respect to l a or n c however when c p and k r are varied only c p and k need to be updated respectively the other matrices i e a b m are unchanged with respect to c p and k r 4 2 calculation of objective function values for regular waves for vlfs with modular attachment subjected to regular waves the hydroelastic response reduction and the power capture factor are given by 11 f 1 1 w max w 0 max 12 f 2 p av p in where w max is the maximum hydroelastic response of the vlfs with modular attachment w 0 max is the maximum hydroelastic response of the vlfs without modular attachment p av is the total power produced and p in is the incident wave power the power produced may be determined based on the relative rotation at the hinge connection between the auxiliary pontoons and the fore edge of the vlfs as follows liu et al 2017 13 p av n 1 n p 1 2 ω 2 r p 2 c p δ ψ ˆ x n 2 where δ ψ ˆ x n is the relative rotation amplitude about the y axis between the two nodes that are connected via the nth linear pto system the incident wave power p

for irregular waves an irregular wave given by the bretschneider spectrum s ω bretschneider 1959 may be expressed in terms of n ω regular wave components as follows 15 s ω i 5 π 4 h s 2 t p 4 ω i 5 exp 20 π 4 t p 4 ω i 4 i 1 2 n ω where ω i is the wave frequency of the ith regular wave component as shown in fig 2 the frequency step is δω ω u ω l n ω where ω l and ω u are respectively the lower and upper bounds of wave frequencies where the wave spectrum value almost vanishes the ith regular wave component has the amplitude a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω for vlfs with modular attachment subjected to irregular waves the hydroelastic response reduction and the power capture factor are given by 16 f 1 1 w max m w 0 max m 17 f 2 p av m p in m where the subscript m denotes the mean values in irregular waves in detail the mean maximum hydroelastic responses of the vlfs with and without modular attachment are given by miyajima et al 2003 18 w max m 2 i 1 n ω w ω i max a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω 19 w 0 max m 2 i 1 n ω w 0 ω i max a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω where w ω i max a ω i is the maximum normalized hydroelastic response amplitude of vlfs with modular attachment under action of a regular wave with frequency ω i w 0 ω i max a ω i is the maximum normalized hydroelastic response amplitude of vlfs without attachment under action of a regular wave with frequency ω i these values are calculated as in sec 4 2 for the wave frequency ω i the mean power produced is defined as sheng and lewis 2012 20 p av m 2 i 1 n ω p av ω i a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω where p av ω i a ω i 2 is the normalized power produced calculated as in sec 4 2 for the wave frequency ω i the mean incident wave power is calculated in the same manner as follows 21 p in m 2 i 1 n ω p in ω i a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω where p in ω i a ω i 2 is the normalized incident wave power calculated as in sec 4 2 for the wave frequency ω i 5 optimization process the optimization process consists of two stages as shown in fig 3 the purpose of the first stage is to determine the pareto set by using differential evolution price et al 2005 the second stage is to select only one solution within the pareto set to be as the final optimal solution using the global criterion method hwang et al 1980 michailides and angelides 2015 in the first stage of the optimization process see figs 3 and 4 the bounds of design variables are first used to generate the initial random population consisting of np vectors of design variables φ i 0 where i 1 2 np and subscript 0 denotes the initial generation each vector of design variables is a possible solution of the optimization problem after generating the initial population the mutation and crossover phases of de are employed to generate other np possible vectors of design variables u i g where the subscript g denotes the current generation the details on generation of the initial population as well as the mutation and crossover phases can be found in price et al 2005 the population for the next generation including np vectors of design variables φ i g 1 is then selected from u i g and φ i g in the selection phase based on the following criteria 22 φ i g 1 u i g if u i g dominates φ i g φ i g if φ i g dominates u i g r a n d o m φ i g u i g otherwise here a vector of design variables is called to dominate another if and only if at least one of its objective function values is higher and none of its objective function values is smaller if the vectors u i g and φ i g are not dominated by each other the vector φ i g 1 for the next generation is randomly selected within u i g and φ i g using the function random when the selection phase finishes if the current generation g is smaller than the maximum number of generation g max the mutation crossover and selection phases are employed again to create a new population otherwise the first stage of the optimization process is terminated and the population of the g max th generation is considered as the pareto set it can be seen that the selection phase requires the evaluation of the objective functions conventionally the evaluation can be done by using directly the numerical analysis framework for any possible solutions however it is well known that the hydroelastic analysis of vlfs is time consuming mainly due to the computation of the densely populated matrix g and its related inversion in eq 6 kashiwagi 1998 utsunomiya and watanabe 2006 wang et al 1997 or a and b in eq 8 the optimization process using this conventional approach is hence very time consuming because the matrices a and b need to be calculated for any possible solutions i e for np g max 1 solutions pedroso et al 2017 for a regular wave to speed up the optimization process it is suggested to precalculate the matrices a and b in eq 8 before implementing the de operations see fig 4 note that these two matrices are constant with respect to k r and c p but they are dependent on the pontoon length l a and the number of connections n c as discussed in sec 4 thus these matrices just need to be computed for the allowable discrete values of l a and n c in other words the matrices a and b are required to be computed for n 1 n 2 solutions for a regular wave where n 1 is the number of permissible discrete values for l a and n 2 is the number of permissible discrete values for n c for multi objective optimization problems as np and g max are usually large e g see pedroso et al 2017 n 1 n 2 is generally smaller than np g max 1 this results in the computational time for the optimization process using this approach decreases as compared with that using the conventional one note that if the pontoon length is considered as a continuous design variable the matrices a and b need to be computed for np g max 1 solutions for a regular wave it is also suggested that the corresponding n 1 n 2 sets of k m are precalculated for certain as the mass matrix m is constant with respect to k r and c p this approach is preferred for reducing computational time as discussed above for the matrix k the precalculation e g for k r 0 contributes to decreasing the computational time as well this is because for different values of k r only a small number of components in k that are related to the connections need to be updated gao et al 2011 here the matrix c p is not precalculated as its non zero components are changed for different values of c p liu et al 2017 in order to evaluate objective functions of a possible solution in the selection phase for a regular wave the set of precalculated matrices a b k m is selected within the n 1 n 2 precalculated sets based on the values of l a and n c in the possible solution then the matrix k is updated based on k r gao et al 2011 the matrix c p is created based on c p liu et al 2017 after that the matrices k the one that has been updated and m are used to calculate the eigenvector s for the free vibration of vlfs with modular attachment eq 7 eq 8 and the numerical analysis framework given in sec 4 2 are then used to obtain the objective function values for a regular wave if irregular waves are considered the numerical analysis framework given in sec 4 3 is employed in this case the set of matrices a b needs to be precalculated for n 1 n 2 n ω solutions because these two matrices are related to the free surface green s function which is dependent on the wave frequency of the regular wave component of wave spectrum however the set of matrices k m only needs to be predetermined for n 1 n 2 solutions as these matrices are insensitive to the wave frequency note that if the pontoon length is considered as a continuous design variable the matrices a and b need to be computed for np g max 1 n ω solutions for an irregular wave in the second stage of the optimization process the final optimal solution can be obtained within the pareto set by using the global criterion method hwang et al 1980 that selects the one having the smallest distance l p φ defined as 23 minimize l p φ i 1 2 f i φ z i p 1 p subject to φ pareto set where p 1 is a constant in the method and can be set equal to 2 for the bi objective optimization problem michailides and angelides 2015 z z 1 z 2 where z 1 z 2 0 1 are the user defined values for the corresponding objective functions f i φ ranging from zero to one are the normalized objective function values and are given by michailides and angelides 2015 24 f i φ f i in φ f i o f i n f i o i 1 2 where f i o are the maximum objective function values within the pareto front f i n are the minimum objective function values within the pareto front and f i in φ are the objective function values of a solution within the pareto set in the objective function space f i o is the ideal point and f i n is the nadir point see fig 3 based on eq 23 and eq 24 it can be seen that z 0 1 corresponds to the case where only f 1 is maximized and z 1 0 corresponds to the case where only f 2 is maximized 6 results and discussions numerical studies are carried out for the given parameters of vlfs and modular attachment as shown in table 1 the considered dimensions and material properties of the vlfs are similar to those used in the previous studies nguyen et al 2018a yoon et al 2014 the properties of regular and irregular waves as well as the water depth are also given in table 1 the range of peak period t p 5 15 s is adopted as it is within the typical one for vlfs kim et al 2014 as well as wec babarit et al 2012 note that based on the formulation in sec 4 it can be seen that the objective function values are insensitive to the wave amplitude a or the significant wave height h s thus these two values are not given in table 1 however it should be stressed that the wave amplitude a for regular waves or the significant wave height h s for irregular waves is small where the linear wave theory may be used to model the fluid motions unless specified hereafter the pontoon length pto damping coefficient the number of connections and connection stiffness are design variables in the optimization problem the pontoon length l a is selected from the discrete set 5 10 15 40 m i e n 1 8 zheng et al 2015 the number of connections n c is chosen within the set 1 2 3 i e n 2 3 yoon et al 2014 see fig 5 note that the vlfs without connections n c 0 considered in the previous study tay 2019 is also examined for comparison with the vlfs with connections in this study the search space for connection stiffness is 0 8e9 nm rad m fu et al 2007 and that for pto damping coefficient is 1e5 4e8 kg s babarit et al 2011 to obtain accurate hydroelastic response of vlfs under action of regular waves the vlfs is discretised into the 8 node linear serendipity elements nguyen et al 2018a where their size is smaller than λ 4 wang et al 2007 the number of eigenvectors should be sufficiently large for accurate approximation of displacements and it is taken as 30 for numerical examples in this study for vlfs under action of irregular waves convergence studies are carried out for each peak period of wave spectrum to ensure that the number of regular wave components n ω is sufficiently large for accurate interpretation of the continuous wave spectrum a sufficiently large number of vectors of the initial population np e g np 200 for most cases in this study are chosen for wide diversity of the pareto set the maximum number of generation g max is set to a large value e g g max is set to 300 to ensure that the population of the g max th generation is the pareto set 6 1 effects of design variables on pareto front the effects of design variables on the pareto front are first investigated a regular wave with wavelength λ 60 m and incident wave angle θ 0 is considered 6 1 1 effect of pto damping coefficient the effect of pto damping coefficient on the pareto front is first studied for this purpose only pto damping coefficient is a design variable l a 10 20 30 m and n c 0 fig 6 shows the pareto fronts and objective function values of three reference final optimal solutions see table 2 it can be seen that the pareto fronts are bounded in narrow ranges of the hydroelastic response reduction and the power capture factor this may be because of two reasons firstly the incident wave energy absorbed is transformed into i the motions of the vlfs and the pontoons and ii the usable energy secondly as the other properties of vlfs and pontoons e g dimensions of the vlfs and pontoons and properties of module connections are kept constant the total amount of incident wave energy absorbed by the structure may not be changed much with respect to the pto damping coefficient c p thus when the power produced increases or decreases the responses of the pontoons and the vlfs should correspondingly decrease or increase leading to an increase or decrease in the hydroelastic response reduction in other words in this case the power produced is generally proportional to the reduction in the hydroelastic response of the vlfs 6 1 2 effect of pontoon length the effect of pontoon length on pareto front is next examined by considering the pontoon length as a design variable in addition to pto damping coefficient fig 7 shows the pareto front and objective function values of three reference final optimal solutions see table 2 for n c 0 it can be seen that the pareto front is discontinuous and it consists of several discrete local fronts where each local front is for a constant pontoon length it is important to note that the pareto front is bounded in wide ranges of both the power capture factor and hydroelastic response reduction this is expected because while a long pontoon e g l a 35 m is usually preferred for reducing hydroelastic response of the vlfs a shorter pontoon e g l a 20 m is usually better for wave energy production 6 1 3 effects of number of connections and connection stiffness the effects of number of connections and connection stiffness on pareto front are examined for various cases firstly the case where only pto damping coefficient is a design variable is considered for n c 3 l a 20 m fig 8 shows three pareto fronts for three values of connection stiffness k r 8e9 nm rad m rigid connections k r 8e7 nm rad m semi rigid connections and k r 0 hinge connections it can be seen in fig 8 that the pareto fronts are significantly different for three values of connection stiffness the significant effect of connection stiffness on the hydroelastic response of the vlfs can also be seen in fig 9 in view of the considerable effect of connection stiffness on pareto front both connection stiffness and pto damping coefficient are now considered as design variables fig 10 shows three pareto fronts for l a 10 20 30 m and n c 3 it can be seen that the pareto fronts are bounded in a fairly narrow range of the hydroelastic response reduction and in a wide range of the power capture factor each pareto front is discontinuous and consists of two local fronts one is for the connection stiffness that is preferred for reducing hydroelastic response of the vlfs e g k r 8e9 n m rad m and another is for the connection stiffness that is favoured for wave energy extraction e g k r 0 it may be expected to see that the connection stiffness preferred for extracting wave energy is smaller than that for reducing hydroelastic response this is because for small connection stiffness the fore of the vlfs may rotate easily about the y axis leading to large relative rotation between the auxiliary pontoons and the fore of the vlfs fig 11 a presents the pareto front and objective function values of three reference final optimal solutions see table 2 for the case where pto damping coefficient pontoon length and connection stiffness are design variables n c 3 fig 11b shows the pareto fronts and objective function values of three reference final optimal solutions see table 2 for various cases it can be seen that the pareto front is significantly affected by the number of connections for the considered parameters the maximum attainable reductions in hydroelastic response are almost the same for different numbers of connections but the maximum attainable power capture factor may increase significantly by adjusting the number of connections e g n c 3 instead of n c 1 this may be because the flexibility of the fore of the vlfs in rotating about the y axis is affected by not only the connection stiffness but also the number of connections 6 2 maximum power capture factor and response reduction for regular waves the maximum power capture factor as well as the maximum hydroelastic response reduction for the vlfs with modular attachment are examined for various regular waves the effects of connections on these maximum values are also investigated for various regular waves 6 2 1 effects of wavelength and connections fig 12 presents the variations of the hydroelastic response reduction and the power capture factor with respect to wavelength for three reference final optimal solutions see table a1 and table a2 it can be seen from fig 12a for the vlfs without connections that both the maximum attainable response reduction z 0 1 and the maximum attainable power capture factor z 1 0 decrease significantly as the wavelength increases and they become very small for very large wavelengths e g for λ 240 m f 1 0 f 2 0 07 this observation is similar to that for the corresponding attachment with a single wide pontoon as given by tay 2019 however when connections in between floating modules are considered see fig 12b while the decrease in the maximum attainable response reduction with respect to wavelength is almost the same as that shown in fig 12a the decrease in the maximum attainable power capture factor is more gradual for example for large wavelengths such as λ 150 m the power capture factor can still reach 0 6 while this value is only about 0 3 for the case where n c 0 this is because the power capture factor may increase significantly by adjusting the number of connections and connection stiffness as can be seen in sec 6 1 3 regarding the gap between objective function values for z 0 1 and z 1 0 i e the shaded area it can be seen from fig 12a that the gaps for both the power capture factor and the reduction in hydroelastic response are only wide for small wavelengths e g λ 60 m and they become narrow for larger wavelengths for such quite large wavelengths e g λ 90 m the considered range of pontoon length i e 5 40 m may be small as compared to the wavelength hence the preferred pontoon length for reducing hydroelastic response and the favoured pontoon length for wave energy extraction i e the pontoon lengths that correspond to z 0 1 and z 1 0 respectively are both small as compared to the wavelength thus the hydroelastic responses for these two pontoon lengths are expected to be quite similar to each other leading to the narrow gaps between the objective function values as can be seen in fig 12a this important finding implies that for the vlfs without connections subjected to long waves it is possible to design the modular attachment for maximizing one objective without significantly compromising another when the connections between floating modules are considered see fig 12b the gaps for both the power capture factor and the reduction in hydroelastic response are big for most considered wavelengths the gap for the power capture factor is big mainly because of the big improvement in the maximum attainable power capture factor this big improvement however worsens significantly the corresponding hydroelastic response reduction leading to a big gap for the reduction in hydroelastic response this finding shows clearly that if the modular attachment and the connections are designed for only one objective another objective is compromised significantly in this case a design that balances the two objectives e g z 0 0 may be preferable note that the hydroelastic response of the vlfs with attachment may be larger than that of the vlfs without attachment when the design aims for maximizing only the power capture factor i e z 1 0 as can be seen in fig 13 6 2 2 effect of incident wave angle fig 14 presents the variations of the hydroelastic response reduction and the power capture factor with respect to incident wave angle for three reference final optimal solutions see table a3 it is understandable to see from fig 14 that the maximum attainable response reduction decreases as the incident wave angle increases and it becomes almost zero when θ 90 similarly the maximum attainable power capture factor generally decreases with respect to incident wave angle however it should be stressed that the maximum attainable power capture factor for large incident wave angles e g θ 90 is still comparable with that in the head sea e g about 50 for λ 30 m when the vlfs is subjected to short waves e g λ 90 m this may be because the relative rotation between the auxiliary pontoons and the fore edge of the vlfs is still considerable for short waves see fig 15 a note that for long waves e g λ 150 this relative rotation is small see fig 15b the gap between the response reductions for z 0 1 and z 1 0 i e the shaded area is quite wide for θ 0 this gap generally decreases with respect to incident wave angle and it becomes almost zero when θ 90 because the response reductions for z 0 1 and z 1 0 are both negligible for θ 90 the gap between the power capture factors for the two cases is big for most incident wave angles however for long waves the gap is small for large incident waves for example the gap is almost zero when λ 150 m and θ 90 based on these observations it can be seen that both the two objectives should be considered in the design of modular attachment and module connections for oblique waves as improving one objective generally worsens another significantly however for a special case where the wavelength is small e g λ 90 m and the incident wave angle is very large e g θ 60 a priority should be given to maximizing the power capture factor this is because by adjusting the design of modular attachment and module connections the power capture factor may be improved considerably without significantly compromising the hydroelastic response reduction 6 3 maximum power capture factor and response reduction for irregular waves the maximum power capture factor as well as the maximum response reduction for the vlfs are now investigated for irregular waves fig 16 shows the variations of the objective function values with respect to peak period of wave spectrum for three reference final optimal solutions see table a4 and for θ 0 it can be seen from fig 16 that the maximum attainable response reduction and the maximum attainable power capture factor decrease with respect to the peak period of the wave spectrum this is expected as these two values decrease as the wavelength increases as discussed in sec 6 2 1 the decreases in these values are however only gradual and these values are both still considerable for large peak periods of wave spectrum for example for t p 15 s the maximum attainable hydroelastic response reduction and the maximum attainable power capture factor are 0 27 and 0 33 respectively it can also be seen from fig 16 that there is a big gap between objective function values for z 0 1 and z 1 0 for all peak periods while the gap for the response reduction is kept almost constant with respect to peak period of wave spectrum the gap for power capture factor decreases only slightly this finding for irregular waves agrees with that for regular waves where if the modular attachment and the connections are designed for only one objective another objective is compromised significantly the difference between the hydroelastic responses for z 0 1 and z 1 0 can be seen in fig 17 which shows mean normalized hydroelastic response amplitudes of the vlfs with and without modular attachment for t p 10 s note that the mean hydroelastic response amplitude w m is calculated using the same approach as presented for calculating the mean value of the maximum hydroelastic response amplitude w max m as given in sec 4 3 7 conclusions this paper presents optimization of modular raft wec type attachment to vlfs and connections between floating modules of the vlfs the modular raft wec type attachment comprises multiple independent auxiliary pontoons connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges and linear power take off pto the optimization exercise aims to maximize the reduction in hydroelastic response and wave energy production a bi objective optimization process based on differential evolution de is proposed a numerical analysis framework based on the finite element boundary element fe be method is given for calculating the power capture factor as well as the hydroelastic response reduction for regular and irregular waves based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn the power capture factor may increase significantly by adjusting the number of connections and connection stiffness when only pto damping coefficient is a design variable in the optimization the pareto front is bounded in narrow ranges of the power capture factor and the hydroelastic response reduction when pontoon length is also a design variable in addition to pto damping coefficient the bounded ranges of the power capture factor and the hydroelastic response reduction are wide for short waves but they are narrow for long waves when pontoon length pto damping coefficient the number of connections and connection stiffness are design variables if the modular attachment and module connections are designed for only one objective another objective is generally compromised significantly thus the design that balances the two objectives may be preferable however for a special case where the wavelength is small and the incident wave angle is very large a priority should be given to maximizing the power capture factor as the power capture factor may be improved considerably without significantly

23062,this paper presents optimization of modular raft wec type attachment to vlfs and connections between floating modules of the vlfs for regular and irregular waves the modular raft wec type

wave energy converter wec hydroelastic response connection design multi objective optimization differential evolution de 1 introduction in recent years pontoon type very large floating structures vlfss have been shown to be one promising solution for creating artificial land on the ocean lamas pardo et al 2015 suzuki 2005 wang et al 2007 watanabe et al 2004 when using vlfs for applications that demand stringent serviceability requirements such as floating aeroplane runways floating container terminals and floating residential estates it is important to have an effective vlfs design to reduce the hydroelastic response i e the vertical deflection of the vlfs to within permissible limits one effective solution for reducing hydroelastic response is by using an auxiliary floating structure attached to the vlfs for example by considering a longish vlfs modelled as a floating beam khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 found that a significant reduction in the beam s hydroelastic response is observed when an auxiliary floating beam is connected to the fore end of the floating beam with a hinge kim et al 2005 then studied the use of an auxiliary floating plate for reducing hydroelastic response of a floating plate as vlfss usually consist of several units another common way to reduce hydroelastic response of vlfs is to design connections between these units by investigating two floating beams connected via a connection riyansyah et al 2010 found that hydroelastic response of the system is affected by both location and stiffness of the connection the effect of location of a flexible connection on hydroelastic response of vlfs made up of two floating mindlin plates was then studied by gao et al 2011 recently yoon et al 2014 conducted both experimental and numerical studies for vlfs with multiple hinge connections and found that hydroelastic response of vlfs is considerably affected by the number of hinge connections considering not only connection stiffness but also the number and layout of connections michailides et al 2013 proposed a numerical framework for obtaining the optimal values of these parameters for minimizing hydroelastic response of modular floating structures another interesting approach to reduce hydroelastic response of vlfs is to absorb a portion of incident wave energy for energy production by using oscillating water column owc wave energy converters wecs for example maeda et al 2000 studied the reduction in hydroelastic response of vlfs where the fore and the aft of the vlfs are equipped with owc wecs hong et al 2006 2007 investigated the reduction in hydroelastic response of vlfs protected by a owc floating breakwater placed at a distance in front of the vlfs or connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges recently ikoma et al 2015 presented the estimation of energy production for a vlfs equipped with owc wecs motivated by the idea to extract wave energy while reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs and the high energy conversion efficiency of the raft wec consisting of two pontoons liu et al 2017 zheng et al 2015 tay 2019 proposed a device here called a raft wec type attachment comprising a single wide pontoon e g 60 m in width connected to the fore edge of vlfs with hinges and linear power take off pto systems in this design concept the relative motion between the pontoon and the fore of the vlfs is converted into power however one limitation of this design is that the power produced decreases significantly with respect to the incident wave angle if the wavelength is small when compared to the pontoon width tay 2019 another limitation is that the large size of the auxiliary pontoon may result in high costs for manufacturing and installation these two limitations have been discussed in detail for the bottom hinged flap type wec comprising a single wide vertical flap connected to the foundation at the seabed with hinges and pto systems wilkinson et al 2017 to overcome these limitations of the bottom hinged flap type wec with a single wide vertical flap the single wide flap was proposed to be replaced by a modular flap comprising multiple independent narrow modules sarkar et al 2016b wilkinson et al 2017 the bottom hinged flap type wec with the modular flap possesses several advantages over the one with the single wide flap including i flexibility for expansion and downsizing ii higher redundancy in the system iii lower manufacturing and installation costs and iv more power produced in oblique waves wilkinson et al 2017 adopting the modular concept for the bottom hinged flap type wec nguyen et al 2018b proposed a modular raft wec type attachment for extracting wave energy while reducing hydroelastic response of vlfs in this study the single wide pontoon of the raft wec type attachment is replaced by multiple independent pontoons to obtain economically effective designs many researchers have studied optimization of wecs sarkar et al 2016a zheng and zhang 2017 as well as vlfss michailides and angelides 2015 nguyen et al 2018a for vlfs with a raft wec type attachment if it is designed for one objective maximizing the power produced or the hydroelastic response reduction another objective is generally not achieved tay 2019 the optimization problem of vlfs with a raft wec type attachment hence consists of two conflicting objectives and may be referred to as a bi objective optimization problem for such a bi objective optimization problem it is important to find the set of optimal solutions i e pareto set deb 2009 price et al 2005 these optimal solutions are not dominated by any other possible solutions for the maximization problem where all objective functions need to be maximized a solution is called to dominate another if and only if at least one of its objective function values is higher and none of its objective function values is smaller the line comprising objective function values of optimal solutions in the objective function space is called pareto front i e the trade off curve the pareto front provides information on how much improving one objective worsens another among different optimization methods evolutionary algorithms including genetic algorithms ga and differential evolution de have been shown to be very effective global optimizers in many areas deb 2009 price et al 2005 ga and de have been widely used for optimization of wecs and vlfss with a single objective michailides et al 2013 nguyen et al 2018a sarkar et al 2016a compared to ga de has been proved to be more efficient in terms of both the convergence rate and the quality of the solution hegerty et al 2009 differential evolution algorithm is also well suited for multi objective optimization problems as it is able to give multiple optimal solutions i e pareto set in a single run deb 2009 pedroso et al 2017 this paper presents optimization of a modular raft wec type attachment to vlfs and connections between floating modules of the vlfs for maximizing wave energy production and reduction in hydroelastic response of the vlfs the modular raft wec type attachment consists of multiple independent auxiliary pontoons connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges and linear power take off pto systems an optimization process based on differential evolution is proposed a numerical analysis framework is presented for determining the power capture factor as well as the hydroelastic response reduction in the numerical analysis the vlfs and multiple auxiliary pontoons are modelled as floating mindlin plates while the linear wave theory is adopted for modelling fluid motions tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 the pto systems are modelled as linear dampers michailides and angelides 2015 the hybrid finite element boundary element fe be method is employed to perform the analysis in the frequency domain tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 the effects of the design variables including pto damping coefficient pontoon length the number of connections and connection stiffness on the pareto front are examined in addition the maximum power capture factor and the hydroelastic response reduction for vlfs with a wec type attachment are investigated for various regular and irregular waves note that in next sections the term modular attachment is used for the modular raft wec type attachment for the sake of brevity 2 vlfs with modular attachment consider the cartesian coordinate systems with its origin at the mid centre of the fore edge of the vlfs that is modelled as a floating mindlin plate with length

pontoon length is considered as a discrete design variable instead of a continuous design variable for faster computation see sec 5 the objectives of the optimization problem are to maximize i the

subject to φ φ l φ u where φ l a n c k r c p is the vector of the design variables φ l and φ u are the vectors consisting of the lower and upper bounds of the design variables for a given vector of design variables the two objective function values f 1 and f 2 for regular waves or irregular waves may be determined by using the numerical analysis framework described in sec 4 4 numerical analysis framework the numerical analysis framework for calculating f 1 and f 2 is based on the hydroelastic analysis of vlfs using the hybrid fe be method in the frequency domain tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 4 1 fe be method for hydroelastic analysis of vlfs with modular attachment in the fe be method tay et al 2007 wang and wang 2008 the plate is first discretised into plate elements the displacement vector at an arbitrary point w w ψ x ψ y t as well as the velocity potential vector ϕ ϕ 0 0 t can be expressed in terms of the vector of displacements w ˆ and the vector of velocity

the wave frequency ω i the mean power produced is defined as sheng and lewis 2012 20 p av m 2 i 1 n ω p av ω i a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω where p av ω i a ω i 2 is the normalized power produced calculated as in sec 4 2 for the wave frequency ω i the mean incident wave power is calculated in the same manner as follows 21 p in m 2 i 1 n ω p in ω i a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω where p in ω i a ω i 2 is the normalized incident wave power calculated as in sec 4 2 for the wave frequency ω i 5 optimization process the optimization process consists of two stages as shown in fig 3 the purpose of the first stage is to determine the pareto set by using differential evolution price et al 2005 the second stage is to select only one solution within the pareto set to be as the final optimal solution using the global criterion method hwang et al 1980 michailides and angelides 2015 in the first stage of the optimization process see figs 3 and 4 the bounds of design variables are first used to generate the initial random population consisting of np vectors of design variables φ i 0 where i 1 2 np and subscript 0 denotes the initial generation each vector of design variables is a possible solution of the optimization problem after generating the initial population the mutation and crossover phases of de are employed to generate other np possible vectors of design variables u i g where the subscript g denotes the current generation the details on generation of the initial population as well as the mutation and crossover phases can be found in price et al 2005 the population for the next generation including np vectors of design variables φ i g 1 is then selected from u i g and φ i g in the selection phase based on the following criteria 22 φ i g 1 u i g if u i g dominates φ i g φ i g if φ i g dominates u i g r a n d o m φ i g u i g otherwise here a vector of design variables is called to dominate another if and only if at least one of its objective function values is higher and none of its objective function values is smaller if the vectors u i g and φ i g are not dominated by each other the vector φ i g 1 for the next generation is randomly selected within u i g and φ i g using the function random when the selection phase finishes if the current generation g is smaller than the maximum number of generation g max the mutation crossover and selection phases are employed again to create a new population otherwise the first stage of the optimization process is terminated and the population of the g max th generation is considered as the pareto set it can be seen that the selection phase requires the evaluation of the objective functions conventionally the evaluation can be done by using directly the numerical analysis framework for any possible solutions however it is well known that the hydroelastic analysis of vlfs is time consuming mainly due to the computation of the densely populated matrix g and its related inversion in eq 6 kashiwagi 1998 utsunomiya and watanabe 2006 wang et al 1997 or a and b in eq 8 the optimization process using this conventional approach is hence very time consuming because the matrices a and b need to be calculated for any possible solutions i e for np g max 1 solutions pedroso et al 2017 for a regular wave to speed up the optimization process it is suggested to precalculate the matrices a and b in eq 8 before implementing the de operations see fig 4 note that these two matrices are constant with respect to k r and c p but they are dependent on the pontoon length l a and the number of connections n c as discussed in sec 4 thus these matrices just need to be computed for the allowable discrete values of l a and n c in other words the matrices a and b are required to be computed for n 1 n 2 solutions for a regular wave where n 1 is the number of permissible discrete values for l a and n 2 is the number of permissible discrete values for n c for multi objective optimization problems as np and g max are usually large e g see pedroso et al 2017 n 1 n 2 is generally smaller than np g max 1 this results in the computational time for the optimization process using this approach decreases as compared with that using the conventional one note that if the pontoon length is considered as a continuous design variable the matrices a and b need to be computed for np g max 1 solutions for a regular wave it is also suggested that the corresponding n 1 n 2 sets of k m are precalculated for certain as the mass matrix m is constant with respect to k r and c p this approach is preferred for reducing computational time as discussed above for the matrix k the precalculation e g for k r 0 contributes to decreasing the computational time as well this is because for different values of k r only a small number of components in k that are related to the connections need to be updated gao et al 2011 here the matrix c p is not precalculated as its non zero components are changed for different values of c p liu et al 2017 in order to evaluate objective functions of a possible solution in the selection phase for a regular wave the set of precalculated matrices a b k m is selected within the n 1 n 2 precalculated sets based on the values of l a and n c in the possible solution then the matrix k is updated based on k r gao et al 2011 the matrix c p is created based on c p liu et al 2017 after that the matrices k the one that has been updated and m are used to calculate the eigenvector s for the free vibration of vlfs with modular attachment eq 7 eq 8 and the numerical analysis framework given in sec 4 2 are then used to obtain the objective function values for a regular wave if irregular waves are considered the numerical analysis framework given in sec 4 3 is employed in this case the set of matrices a b needs to be precalculated for n 1 n 2 n ω solutions because these two matrices are related to the free surface green s function which is dependent on the wave frequency of the regular wave component of wave spectrum however the set of matrices k m only needs to be predetermined for n 1 n 2 solutions as these matrices are insensitive to the wave frequency note that if the pontoon length is considered as a continuous design variable the matrices a and b need to be computed for np g max 1 n ω solutions for an irregular wave in the second stage of the optimization process the final optimal solution can be obtained within the pareto set by using the global criterion method hwang et al 1980 that selects the one having the smallest distance l p φ defined as 23 minimize l p φ i 1 2 f i φ z i p 1 p subject to φ pareto set where p 1 is a constant in the method and can be set equal to 2 for the bi objective optimization problem michailides and angelides 2015 z z 1 z 2 where z 1 z 2 0 1 are the user defined values for the corresponding objective functions f i φ ranging from zero to one are the normalized objective function values and are given by michailides and angelides 2015 24 f i φ f i in φ f i o f i n f i o i 1 2 where f i o are the maximum objective function values within the pareto front f i n are the minimum objective function values within the pareto front and f i in φ are the objective function values of a solution within the pareto set in the objective function space f i o is the ideal point and f i n is the nadir point see fig 3 based on eq 23 and eq 24 it can be seen that z 0 1 corresponds to the case where only f 1 is maximized and z 1 0 corresponds to the case where only f 2 is maximized 6 results and discussions numerical studies are carried out for the given parameters of vlfs and modular attachment as shown in table 1 the considered dimensions and material properties of the vlfs are similar to those used in the previous studies nguyen et al 2018a yoon et al 2014 the properties of regular and irregular waves as well as the water depth are also given in table 1 the range of peak period t p 5 15 s is adopted as it is within the typical one for vlfs kim et al 2014 as well as wec babarit et al 2012 note that based on the formulation in sec 4 it can be seen that the objective function values are insensitive to the wave amplitude a or the significant wave height h s thus these two values are not given in table 1 however it should be stressed that the wave amplitude a for regular waves or the significant wave height h s for irregular waves is small where the linear wave theory may be used to model the fluid motions unless specified hereafter the pontoon length pto damping coefficient the number of connections and connection stiffness are design variables in the optimization problem the pontoon length l a is selected from the discrete set 5 10 15 40 m i e n 1 8 zheng et al 2015 the number of connections n c is chosen within the set 1 2 3 i e n 2 3 yoon et al 2014 see fig 5 note that the vlfs without connections n c 0 considered in the previous study tay 2019 is also examined for comparison with the vlfs with connections in this study the search space for connection stiffness is 0 8e9 nm rad m fu et al 2007 and that for pto damping coefficient is 1e5 4e8 kg s babarit et al 2011 to obtain accurate hydroelastic response of vlfs under action of regular waves the vlfs is discretised into the 8 node linear serendipity elements nguyen et al 2018a where their size is smaller than λ 4 wang et al 2007 the number of eigenvectors should be sufficiently large for accurate approximation of displacements and it is taken as 30 for numerical examples in this study for vlfs under action of irregular waves convergence studies are carried out for each peak period of wave spectrum to ensure that the number of regular wave components n ω is sufficiently large for accurate interpretation of the continuous wave spectrum a sufficiently large number of vectors of the initial population np e g np 200 for most cases in this study are chosen for wide diversity of the pareto set the maximum number of generation g max is set to a large value e g g max is set to 300 to ensure that the population of the g max th generation is the pareto set 6 1 effects of design variables on pareto front the effects of design variables on the pareto front are first investigated a regular wave with wavelength λ 60 m and incident wave angle θ 0 is considered 6 1 1 effect of pto damping coefficient the effect of pto damping coefficient on the pareto front is first studied for this purpose only pto damping coefficient is a design variable l a 10 20 30 m and n c 0 fig 6 shows the pareto fronts and objective function values of three reference final optimal solutions see table 2 it can be seen that the pareto fronts are bounded in narrow ranges of the hydroelastic response reduction and the power capture factor this may be because of two reasons firstly the incident wave energy absorbed is transformed into i the motions of the vlfs and the pontoons and ii the usable energy secondly as the other properties of vlfs and pontoons e g dimensions of the vlfs and pontoons and properties of module connections are kept constant the total amount of incident wave energy absorbed by the structure may not be changed much with respect to the pto damping coefficient c p thus when the power produced increases or decreases the responses of the pontoons and the vlfs should correspondingly decrease or increase leading to an increase or decrease in the hydroelastic response reduction in other words in this case the power produced is generally proportional to the reduction in the hydroelastic response of the vlfs 6 1 2 effect of pontoon length the effect of pontoon length on pareto front is next examined by considering the pontoon length as a design variable in addition to pto damping coefficient fig 7 shows the pareto front and objective function values of three reference final optimal solutions see table 2 for n c 0 it can be seen that the pareto front is discontinuous and it consists of several discrete local fronts where each local front is for a constant pontoon length it is important to note that the pareto front is bounded in wide ranges of both the power capture factor and hydroelastic response reduction this is expected because while a long pontoon e g l a 35 m is usually preferred for reducing hydroelastic response of the vlfs a shorter pontoon e g l a 20 m is usually better for wave energy production 6 1 3 effects of number of connections and connection stiffness the effects of number of connections and connection stiffness on pareto front are examined for various cases firstly the case where only pto damping coefficient is a design variable is considered for n c 3 l a 20 m fig 8 shows three pareto fronts for three values of connection stiffness k r 8e9 nm rad m rigid connections k r 8e7 nm rad m semi rigid connections and k r 0 hinge connections it can be seen in fig 8 that the pareto fronts are significantly different for three values of connection stiffness the significant effect of connection stiffness on the hydroelastic response of the vlfs can also be seen in fig 9 in view of the considerable effect of connection stiffness on pareto front both connection stiffness and pto damping coefficient are now considered as design variables fig 10 shows three pareto fronts for l a 10 20 30 m and n c 3 it can be seen that the pareto fronts are bounded in a fairly narrow range of the hydroelastic response reduction and in a wide range of the power capture factor each pareto front is discontinuous and consists of two local fronts one is for the connection stiffness that is preferred for reducing hydroelastic response of the vlfs e g k r 8e9 n m rad m and another is for the connection stiffness that is favoured for wave energy extraction e g k r 0 it may be expected to see that the connection stiffness preferred for extracting wave energy is smaller than that for reducing hydroelastic response this is because for small connection stiffness the fore of the vlfs may rotate easily about the y axis leading to large relative rotation between the auxiliary pontoons and the fore of the vlfs fig 11 a presents the pareto front and objective function values of three reference final optimal solutions see table 2 for the case where pto damping coefficient pontoon length and connection stiffness are design variables n c 3 fig 11b shows the pareto fronts and objective function values of three reference final optimal solutions see table 2 for various cases it can be seen that the pareto front is significantly affected by the number of connections for the considered parameters the maximum attainable reductions in hydroelastic response are almost the same for different numbers of connections but the maximum attainable power capture factor may increase significantly by adjusting the number of connections e g n c 3 instead of n c 1 this may be because the flexibility of the fore of the vlfs in rotating about the y axis is affected by not only the connection stiffness but also the number of connections 6 2 maximum power capture factor and response reduction for regular waves the maximum power capture factor as well as the maximum hydroelastic response reduction for the vlfs with modular attachment are examined for various regular waves the effects of connections on these maximum values are also investigated for various regular waves 6 2 1 effects of wavelength and connections fig 12 presents the variations of the hydroelastic response reduction and the power capture factor with respect to wavelength for three reference final optimal solutions see table a1 and table a2 it can be seen from fig 12a for the vlfs without connections that both the maximum attainable response reduction z 0 1 and the maximum attainable power capture factor z 1 0 decrease significantly as the wavelength increases and they become very small for very large wavelengths e g for λ 240 m f 1 0 f 2 0 07 this observation is similar to that for the corresponding attachment with a single wide pontoon as given by tay 2019 however when connections in between floating modules are considered see fig 12b while the decrease in the maximum attainable response reduction with respect to wavelength is almost the same as that shown in fig 12a the decrease in the maximum attainable power capture factor is more gradual for example for large wavelengths such as λ 150 m the power capture factor can still reach 0 6 while this value is only about 0 3 for the case where n c 0 this is because the power capture factor may increase significantly by adjusting the number of connections and connection stiffness as can be seen in sec 6 1 3 regarding the gap between objective function values for z 0 1 and z 1 0 i e the shaded area it can be seen from fig 12a that the gaps for both the power capture factor and the reduction in hydroelastic response are only wide for small wavelengths e g λ 60 m and they become narrow for larger wavelengths for such quite large wavelengths e g λ 90 m the considered range of pontoon length i e 5 40 m may be small as compared to the wavelength hence the preferred pontoon length for reducing hydroelastic response and the favoured pontoon length for wave energy extraction i e the pontoon lengths that correspond to z 0 1 and z 1 0 respectively are both small as compared to the wavelength thus the hydroelastic responses for these two pontoon lengths are expected to be quite similar to each other leading to the narrow gaps between the objective function values as can be seen in fig 12a this important finding implies that for the vlfs without connections subjected to long waves it is possible to design the modular attachment for maximizing one objective without significantly compromising another when the connections between floating modules are considered see fig 12b the gaps for both the power capture factor and the reduction in hydroelastic response are big for most considered wavelengths the gap for the power capture factor is big mainly because of the big improvement in the maximum attainable power capture factor this big improvement however worsens significantly the corresponding hydroelastic response reduction leading to a big gap for the reduction in hydroelastic response this finding shows clearly that if the modular attachment and the connections are designed for only one objective another objective is compromised significantly in this case a design that balances the two objectives e g z 0 0 may be preferable note that the hydroelastic response of the vlfs with attachment may be larger than that of the vlfs without attachment when the design aims for maximizing only the power capture factor i e z 1 0 as can be seen in fig 13 6 2 2 effect of incident wave angle fig 14 presents the variations of the hydroelastic response reduction and the power capture factor with respect to incident wave angle for three reference final optimal solutions see table a3 it is understandable to see from fig 14 that the maximum attainable response reduction decreases as the incident wave angle increases and it becomes almost zero when θ 90 similarly the maximum attainable power capture factor generally decreases with respect to incident wave angle however it should be stressed that the maximum attainable power capture factor for large incident wave angles e g θ 90 is still comparable with that in the head sea e g about 50 for λ 30 m when the vlfs is subjected to short waves e g λ 90 m this may be because the relative rotation between the auxiliary pontoons and the fore edge of the vlfs is still considerable for short waves see fig 15 a note that for long waves e g λ 150 this relative rotation is small see fig 15b the gap between the response reductions for z 0 1 and z 1 0 i e the shaded area is quite wide for θ 0 this gap generally decreases with respect to incident wave angle and it becomes almost zero when θ 90 because the response reductions for z 0 1 and z 1 0 are both negligible for θ 90 the gap between the power capture factors for the two cases is big for most incident wave angles however for long waves the gap is small for large incident waves for example the gap is almost zero when λ 150 m and θ 90 based on these observations it can be seen that both the two objectives should be considered in the design of modular attachment and module connections for oblique waves as improving one objective generally worsens another significantly however for a special case where the wavelength is small e g λ 90 m and the incident wave angle is very large e g θ 60 a priority should be given to maximizing the power capture factor this is because by adjusting the design of modular attachment and module connections the power capture factor may be improved considerably without significantly compromising the hydroelastic response reduction 6 3 maximum power capture factor and response reduction for irregular waves the maximum power capture factor as well as the maximum response reduction for the vlfs are now investigated for irregular waves fig 16 shows the variations of the objective function values with respect to peak period of wave spectrum for three reference final optimal solutions see table a4 and for θ 0 it can be seen from fig 16 that the maximum attainable response reduction and the maximum attainable power capture factor decrease with respect to the peak period of the wave spectrum this is expected as these two values decrease as the wavelength increases as discussed in sec 6 2 1 the decreases in these values are however only gradual and these values are both still considerable for large peak periods of wave spectrum for example for t p 15 s the maximum attainable hydroelastic response reduction and the maximum attainable power capture factor are 0 27 and 0 33 respectively it can also be seen from fig 16 that there is a big gap between objective function values for z 0 1 and z 1 0 for all peak periods while the gap for the response reduction is kept almost constant with respect to peak period of wave spectrum the gap for power capture factor decreases only slightly this finding for irregular waves agrees with that for regular waves where if the modular attachment and the connections are designed for only one objective another objective is compromised significantly the difference between the hydroelastic responses for z 0 1 and z 1 0 can be seen in fig 17 which shows mean normalized hydroelastic response amplitudes of the vlfs with and without modular attachment for t p 10 s note that the mean hydroelastic response amplitude w m is calculated using the same approach as presented for calculating the mean value of the maximum hydroelastic response amplitude w max m as given in sec 4 3 7 conclusions this paper presents optimization of modular raft wec type attachment to vlfs and connections between floating modules of the vlfs the modular raft wec type attachment comprises multiple independent auxiliary pontoons connected to the fore edge of the vlfs with hinges and linear power take off pto the optimization exercise aims to maximize the reduction in hydroelastic response and wave energy production a bi objective optimization process based on differential evolution de is proposed a numerical analysis framework based on the finite element boundary element fe be method is given for calculating the power capture factor as well as the hydroelastic response reduction for regular and irregular waves based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn the power capture factor may increase significantly by adjusting the number of connections and connection stiffness when only pto damping coefficient is a design variable in the optimization the pareto front is bounded in narrow ranges of the power capture factor and the hydroelastic response reduction when pontoon length is also a design variable in addition to pto damping coefficient the bounded ranges of the power capture factor and the hydroelastic response reduction are wide for short waves but they are narrow for long waves when pontoon length pto damping coefficient the number of connections and connection stiffness are design variables if the modular attachment and module connections are designed for only one objective another objective is generally compromised significantly thus the design that balances the two objectives may be preferable however for a special case where the wavelength is small and the incident wave angle is very large a priority should be given to maximizing the power capture factor as the power capture factor may be improved considerably without significantly compromising the hydroelastic response reduction appendix solutions of optimization problems table a1 solutions of optimization problem for vlfs without connections for various wavelengths θ 0 table

23063,this paper investigates the short term extreme value distribution of the tension on mooring lines and the reliability of grid mooring system for fish cage under ultimate limit state the generalized probability density evolution method gpdem is employed to determine the evolution of the probability information of mooring tension the short term extreme tension distribution of mooring lines is evaluated through the combination of the gpdem and the virtual stochastic process model and the reliability analysis under ultimate limit state is conducted based on the extreme tension distribution of mooring components in grid mooring system in addition the equivalent extreme value event method is adopted to perform the reliability analysis of grid mooring system for fish cage the results indicate that the equivalent extreme value event method has a significant advantage over the narrow bound approach in accurately predicting the system reliability and a large uncertainty of the random allowable strength largely affects the system reliability of grid mooring system therefore it is of vital importance to perform the uncertainty quantification of the allowable strength for accurately conducting the system reliability analysis in order to ensure the safety of offshore net cage structures keywords extreme tension distribution system reliability mooring system fish cage 1 introduction reliability based design for mooring system under ultimate limit state is becoming more and more popular for offshore floating structures since the fish cage structures utilized in remote offshore areas need to keep position in spite of weather conditions the grid mooring system for fish cage should have an overall acceptable reliability to provide assurance for the integrity of net cage system and the extreme value distribution of the dynamic response is of paramount importance in the reliability assessment and risk analysis the norwegian technical standard ns 9415 standard norge 2009 was introduced for specifying the requirements for the design of floaters net cages and mooring systems to cope with environmental loads in norway jensen et al 2010 and several researches for the design of sea cage farms based on ns 9415 were conducted berstad et al 2004 thomasson and leira 2005 2011 berstad and heimstad 2017 efforts have been made to perform the structural and hydrodynamic analysis of the net floater and moorings however there are few studies about the extreme value distribution of the response for floating fish farm thus this study focuses on the extreme tension distribution and the reliability of grid mooring system for gravity net cage under ultimate limit state which could prompt the designs for the integrity of grid mooring system to be more robust than the present designs the short term extreme response distribution of offshore structures is of great importance to estimate the characteristic design value of the response in the short term wave design approach two primary methods are generally presented to predict the extreme tension distribution of mooring line for offshore structures one is based on the level crossing rate method which is usually combined with the poisson s assumption or vanmarcke s assumption of the level crossings event low 2008 provided the procedure of calculating the mean up crossing rates based on the time history of low frequency response and the spectral moments of the wave frequency response for predicting the extreme mooring line tensions of a deepwater floating system sagrilo et al 2012 conducted a short term coupled analysis of a turret moored fpso based on the average conditional exceedance rate of peaks and investigated the extreme response of the top tension on the most loaded mooring line the other is based on the distribution fitting method which is the most straight and recommended approach to calculate the characteristic extreme value of the response the probability distribution of the extreme response is usually approximated based on the asymptotic extreme value distributions mathisen and hørte 2014 derived the gumbel distribution of the extreme tension in short term for a large semi submersible mobile drilling unit and evaluated the uncertainty in the parameters of annual extreme value distribution of mooring line tension by response surface method hsu et al 2015 conducted numerical simulation of the moored floating offshore wind turbines in a 3 h storm and extracted the tension maxima to be fitted to the weibull and generalized extreme value distribution hsu et al 2017 employed a composite weibull probability distribution for the estimation of the extreme tension on mooring lines in a mooring system for the floating offshore wind turbine however the validity of the assumptions for the level crossing events in the level crossing rate method significantly affects the evaluation of the extreme value distribution while the accuracy of the distribution fitting method obviously depends on the goodness of fit for the asymptotical distributions as a permanent floating structures installed in the open sea it is essential to perform the reliability analysis of mooring lines for the floating structure several researches were conducted in order to analyze the level of reliability of mooring lines choi 2007 conducted reliability analysis of mooring lines and foundations using representative probabilistic descriptions of the extreme met ocean conditions hurricanes and loop currents montes iturrizaga et al 2011 presented a formulation for the nested reliability analysis of mooring lines designed for fpso systems where the probability distribution parameters of the maximum dynamic line tension is described by response

analyzed the effect of parameter uncertainty on the reliability index of mooring lines for floating structures under loading from extreme sea states through approximating the dynamic tension force on mooring line as a gaussian process unfortunately most of these methods could only provide an approximate and empirically dependent reliability evaluation due to the corresponding approximations or assumptions in the early part of this century the principle of preservation of probability li and chen 2008 provided a unified logic foundation to investigate the randomness propagation in the stochastic dynamical system li and chen 2006 the generalized probability density evolution method gpdem proposed by li and chen 2009 makes it possible to capture the instantaneous probability density function pdf and the evolution of the probability of the response considering the random parameters in the nonlinear dynamic systems and this is becoming more and more popular in the application of different engineering disciplines such as the civil engineering wind engineering mechanical engineering geological engineering and aerospace engineering e g pang et al 2018 tao et al 2018 liu and liu 2018 huang et al 2018 yang et al 2017 previously many researches were carried out to analyze the mooring system for fish cage structures e g tsukrov et al 2005 fredriksson et al 2007 huang et al 2010 xu et al 2013 berstad et al 2014 ito et al 2014 kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 huang et al 2016 he et al 2018 however the probability distribution of the extreme tension on grid mooring system for fish cages is rarely analyzed and it is difficult to ensure the accuracy of the widely used methods for the estimation of the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines previously few investigations on the system reliability of the mooring system for offshore structures were done under ultimate limit state thus it is essential to extend the knowledge of the system reliability of mooring system for fish cage however the difficulty for evaluating the system reliability of offshore structures is how to deal with the correlation information among different components failure therefore a robust method is necessary to estimate the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines and obtain the system reliability of grid mooring system for fish cage under ultimate limit state the purpose of this study is to estimate the short term extreme tension distribution of grid mooring system for fish cage without any assumptions or asymptotic distributions furthermore the reliability of grid mooring system is predicted by appropriately dealing with the correlation information among the components failure the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a description of mooring system for net cage and section 3 provides the environmental loading section 4 describes the evaluation of the extreme value distribution of tension force on mooring system and the reliability estimation of mooring system is given in section 5 in section 6 a case study is conducted and some results and discussion are provided finally some conclusions can be summarized in section 7 2 net cage and mooring system the full dynamic analysis is performed for grid mooring system of net cage in the open sea the net cage and mooring system consists of a gravity cage and a submerged mooring grid as shown in fig 1 the fish cage is composed of the float collar net pen and sinkers the detailed parameters of the fish cage and grid mooring system are given in table 1 the

pretension squared grid platform 40 m 40 m in the horizontal plane the mooring system includes bridle lines grid lines buoy lines and anchor lines the lengths of bridle lines grid lines buoy lines and anchor lines are 20 86 m 40 0 m 4 0 m and 58 8 m respectively the gravity cage located at the middle of each grid square is connected to the submerged mooring grid by four bridle lines the submerged square grid platform is anchored to the sea bottom using eight anchor lines the floating buoy is connected to the submerged grid platform through the buoy line the material of the mooring line is polypropylene pp according to wilson 1967 the stiffness of the mooring line can be given by 1 t d 2 c e δ l l n where t is the tension force kn d is the diameter of mooring line ce and n are the unknown parameters δl l is the rate of deformation the relationship between the mooring line tension force and the elongation is determined by fitting the average elongation of pp rope under different loads gerhard 1983 xu 2014 and it is given as follows 2 t 562 δ l l 1 132 where t is the tension force on the fiber rope with the unit of kn δl is the elongation of the mooring line l is the initial length of the mooring line 3 environmental loading following our previous work xu et al 2011 this study analyzes the tension force on mooring line for fish cage by the self developed numerical model based on the lumped mass method and the rigid body kinematics principle the numerical model has been validated by physical model test in our previous research a brief description of numerical model is given here 3 1 description of wave field wave force is the main environmental load acting on the fish cage structure in the open sea the environmental load due to the wind load can be ignored here because a small part of floating fish cage is exposed in the air the modified jonswap spectrum is used as the input wave spectrum as follows 3 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp f f p 1 2

mooring system is divided into numerous elements that are subjected to wave loadings as shown in figs 3 and 4 a local coordinate system τ η ξ is defined to describe the direction of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structural elements concerning the local coordinate system τ η ξ the η axis lies on the plane that includes the τ axis and v and the velocity vector of the water particle at the mid point of the element can be divided into τ tangential and η normal components based on the lumped mass method the external forces on each element of the net pen and mooring line are calculated firstly and then evenly distributed to the corresponding nodes the force on the floating collar can be calculated by summing the force on each element of floating collar the scattering effect of the net twine on the flow field can be neglected because the diameter of net twine is relatively small compared with the characteristic wave length thus it is appropriate to calculate the wave loads on the net using the modified morison equation considering the relative motion between net element and flow field 9 f τ 1 2 c d τ ρ a τ u τ r τ u τ r τ ρ v 0 u τ c m τ ρ v 0 u τ r τ f η 1 2 c d η ρ a η u

extreme value distribution of tension force on the grid mooring system for fish cage according to the principle of preservation of probability which is similar to the conservation equation in fluid mechanics 4 1 gpdem equation in this section the physical quantity of interest x is deemed as the tension force on mooring line or the extreme value variable considering the random vector θ θ 1 θ 2 in eq 6 the stochastic tension response analysis of mooring system for fish cage is translated into a set of deterministic numerical simulations according to the gpdem referring to li 2016 the time varying joint probability density function p x θ x θ t of the augmented state vector x θ can be calculated through solving the gpdem equation 12 p x θ x θ t t x θ t p x θ x θ t x 0 the initial condition is given as follows 13 p x θ x θ t t 0 δ x x 0 p θ θ the probability density function of x t can be obtained by 14 p x x t ω θ p x θ x θ t d θ 4 2 solving the gpdem equation the flowchart of the gpdem is shown in fig 5 firstly the representative points in random space are selected by the number theoretical method which is of deterministic convergence with the deterministic error estimation zaremba 1972 hua and wang 1981 schroeder 1984 and extensively used in the probability density evolution analysis li and chen 2007 secondly the tension response of mooring system for fish cage is calculated by the deterministic analysis associated with the representative points in random space then the tvd scheme is applied to solve the probability density evolution equation for each representative point li and chen 2004 finally the numerical integration is conducted to obtain the probability information of the tension response 4 3 virtual stochastic process model the evaluation of the extreme value distribution for the tension response of mooring system is conducted based on a virtual stochastic process model proposed by chen and li 2007 a brief description on the virtual stochastic process model is presented as follows the extreme value of the response x t which depends on the random vector θ and the duration length t is denoted as 15 x ext θ t ext t 0 t x θ t a virtual stochastic process is assumed as 16 y τ x ext θ t τ where y τ is the virtual stochastic process τ is called as virtual time as the counterpart of eq 12 the gpdem equation used to predict the pdf of y τ can be written as 17 p y θ y θ τ τ y θ τ p y θ y θ τ y 0 substituting eq 16 into eq 17 there is 18 p y θ y θ τ τ x ext θ t p y θ y θ τ y 0 the initial condition is given as follows 19 p y θ y θ τ τ 0 δ y p θ θ solving the initial problem in eq 18 combined with eq 19 the pdf of y τ can be calculated by 20 p y y τ ω θ p y θ y θ τ d θ since the value of the virtual stochastic process y τ at the virtual time τ 1 is the extreme value x ext the pdf of the extreme value x ext is presented as follows 21 p e x t x p y y τ τ 1 y x therefore a virtual stochastic process model can be constructed to achieve the extreme value distribution of the tension force on mooring system for net cage without introducing any approximations or assumptions 5 failure probability analysis theory the failure probability of the mooring components in the grid mooring system for fish cage is estimated based on the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines which can be obtained by the combination of the gpdem and the virtual stochastic process model and the equivalent extreme value event method proposed by li et al 2007a is employed to predict the reliability of the grid mooring system for fish cage under ultimate limit state 5 1 failure probability of mooring line reliability is defined as the probability of a performance function z x greater than zero i e pr z x 0 this means that the reliability is the probability that the random vector x is in the safe region that is defined by z x 0 thus the failure probability can be defined as the probability pr z x 0 if the joint probability density function of x is f x the failure probability is calculated as follows 22 p f pr z x 0 z x 0 f x d x the reliability is then calculated by 23 r 1 p f pr z x 0 z x 0 f x d x the reliability index β is equivalent to the reliability and can be obtained as follows 24 β φ 1 1 p f where φ 1 is denoted as the inverse transformation of the standard normal distribution considering the random vector θ θ 1 θ 2 in eq 6 the ultimate limit state function z θ can be written as 25 z θ x lim x ext θ where x lim is the allowable strength of mooring line and x ext is the extreme tension on mooring line since the extreme value distribution p x ext x has been obtained by the gpdem the failure probability in eq 22 can be evaluated through 26 p f pr z θ 0 x lim p x ext x d x if the allowable strength of mooring line is considered as a random variable with the pdf p x lim x lim the failure probability is then calculated as 27 p f pr z θ 0 ω x lim x lim p x ext x p x lim x lim d x d x lim where ω x lim is the distribution domain of x lim 5 2 failure probability of mooring system the reliability of the grid mooring system under ultimate limit state is evaluated after obtaining a set of the maximum tension of each mooring line the grid mooring system for net cage structure includes 20 mooring lines as shown in fig 6 if one mooring line is failure the whole mooring system is considered to be failure in this study the equivalent extreme value event method is employed to predict the system reliability of the grid mooring system the equivalent extreme value event method can retain the total information of the correlation among different components failure the failure probability of mooring system can be calculated using the equivalent extreme value event method 28 pr j 1 m x j x lim pr x max x lim where x j is the tension force on the jth mooring line x max is the maximum tension force for the whole mooring system and denoted as an equivalent extreme value variable x max max j 1 2 m x j x lim is the deterministic allowable strength which is uniform for the components of the mooring system if the deterministic allowable strength is different for different components of the mooring system the failure probability of the mooring system can be calculated by equivalently transforming the inequality 29 pr j 1 m x j x j lim pr x max 1 where x max max j 1 2 m x j x j lim is an equivalent extreme value variable when different random variables for the allowable strength of different components of the mooring system are considered the transformation from the prescribed distribution to the standard normal distribution can be used the failure probability of the mooring system can thus be calculated by 30 pr j 1 m x j x j lim pr j 1 m x j t r a n s x n o r m pr x max x n o r m where x max max j 1 2 m x j t r a n s is an equivalent extreme value variable x norm is the standard normal distributed variable x jtrans is the new variable for the jth mooring line after an appropriate transformation considering that the random allowable strengths follow the lognormal distribution the transformation from the tension response x j to the new variable x jtrans can be shown as 31 x j t r a n s log x j μ j σ j where μ j and σ j are the mean value and standard deviation of the allowable strength of the jth mooring line respectively although it is difficult to analytically obtain the probability distribution of the above mentioned equivalent extreme value variable the combination of the gpdem and the virtual stochastic process model makes it convenient and effective to predict the pdf of the equivalent extreme value variable in addition the environmental conditions have significant influence on the allowable strength of mooring lines for fish cage such as the temperature microorganism density biofouling condition and nutrient concentration thus two random variables with respect to the allowable strength are considered for predicting the system reliability one is for the upper layer mooring lines bridle lines buoy lines and grid lines and the other is for the lower layer mooring lines anchor lines the failure probability of the grid mooring system can be obtained by 32 pr j 1 m x j x j lim pr x max x n o r m ω x n o r m x n o r m p x max x p x n o r m x n o r m d x d x n o r m 6 case study the water depth for the fish cage system is 20 0 m and the sea state is characterized using a jonswap wave spectrum with significant wave height of 3 54 m and wave period of 7 0 s as a case study in this study 233 representative points generated by the number theoretical method are picked up to obtain a set of the representative wave loads associated with the representative points a series of numerical simulations with the duration of 3 h are carried out to calculate the tension history of each mooring line the extreme tension distribution of each mooring line is estimated by combining the gpdem with the virtual stochastic process model the reliability of the grid mooring system under ultimate limit state is investigated based on the equivalent extreme value event method 6 1 stochastic dynamic tension response the probability information of the stochastic dynamic tension response can be calculated using the gpdem the typical time history of the tension force on the anchor line l 4 is shown in fig 7 fig 8 shows the typical time histories of the mean value and standard deviation of the tension force on the anchor line l 4 it demonstrates that the mean value and standard deviation of the tension force on the anchor line evolve irregularly against the time and can be denoted as the random processes fig 9 presents the instantaneous pdf of the tension response at several time instants which indicates that the pdfs of the tension force on the anchor line are evolving with the time and are quite different at different time instants in addition the tail of the pdf of the tension force on the anchor line l 4 obtained from the gpdem is obviously different from the widely used distributions such as the normal distribution the lognormal distribution and the weibull distribution the corresponding evolution processes of the probability distribution of the tension force on mooring line in a certain time period including the pdf evolution surface and the corresponding contour are presented in figs 10 and 11 the results demonstrate that the pdf evolution surface of the tension force on mooring line seems like the mountains stretching along the time axis the pdf contour in the region of the medium tension has several eddies similar to the turbulence flow while the pdf contour in the large and small tension region along the time axis stretches like the parallel lines and has much in common with the laminar flow near the wall surface which is analogous to the turbulence decay downstream of the pipes in kühnen et al 2018 the time variant pdf of mooring tension provides evidence that the gpdem makes it possible to calculate the time variant reliability directly at any instantaneous instants using the classical reliability approach melchers and beck 2018 this study focuses on the calculation of the extreme tension distribution and the reliability of the grid mooring system under ultimate limit state 6 2 extreme value distribution of extreme tension on mooring lines the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines is investigated by combining the gpdem with the virtual stochastic process model numerical simulations with the duration of 3 h are employed to predict the extreme tension on mooring lines figs 12 13 present the pdf and cdf cumulative distribution function results of the extreme tension on mooring line l 4 which are determined by the gpdem the classical extreme value theory and the empirical extreme tension distribution for the classical extreme value theory the classical asymptotic distributions including the weibull distribution the gumbel distribution and the generalized extreme value gev distribution are employed to fit the maximum tension force obtained from a series of numerical simulations fig 12 indicates that the classical asymptotic distributions of the extreme tension do not agree well with the empirical pdf the extreme tension distribution estimated by the classical asymptotic distributions causes a smaller tension on mooring line at the same probability of failure lower than 0 03 which leads to the non conservative design value of the tension on mooring line it is still difficult to select an appropriate asymptotic distribution for other mooring components and to predict the distribution parameters accurately due to the statistical uncertainty which strongly depends on the experience of the researcher thus the classical asymptotic distributions may not always be suitable to calculate the extreme tension distribution accurately generally speaking both the main body and the tail of the extreme tension distribution obtained from the gpdem agree well with the histogram of the maximum tension on mooring line the cdf of extreme tension calculated by the gpdem also agrees with the empirical cdf perfectly it may be attributed to the uniform contribution of each sample of the maximum tension to the extreme tension distribution in the gpdem thus the gpdem provides the accuracy and flexibility in the analysis of the extreme value distribution and can be adopted as a uniform method without much experience of the researcher different from the classical asymptotic distributions the pdf of the extreme tension obtained from the gpdem has several peaks fig 13 also indicates that the extreme tension distribution estimated using the gpdem has a heavier tail than the classical asymptotic distributions meaning that the extreme tension events on the mooring line for gpdem are more likely than that for the classical asymptotic distributions in addition it is convenient to predict the reliability of mooring lines under ultimate state by numerical integration method due to the full knowledge of the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines therefore the gpdem is robust to predict the extreme value distribution of the tension force on mooring line from a stochastic point of view without including any approximations or introducing any unnecessary statistical uncertainty the probability distribution of the extreme tension for the grid mooring system is calculated by the gpdem the pdfs and cdfs of the extreme tension on mooring lines l 1 l 11 are shown in figs 14 17 due to the symmetrical arrangement of the grid mooring system the results indicate that there is a large discrepancy of the pdf and cdf of the extreme tension between different mooring lines for the grid mooring system the extreme tension distribution of the upstream anchor lines covers a much wider range than that of the downstream anchor lines the extreme tension distribution range for the anchor line from the downstream to the upstream tends to move towards the side of a larger tension at the same failure probability the upstream bridle lines and buoy lines experience a larger tension than the downstream bridle lines and buoy lines respectively the characteristic tension force on the grid lines perpendicular to waves which is associated to the most probable value or to a fractile level of the extreme tension distribution is larger than that on the grid lines parallel to waves the most probable values mpv of the extreme tension distribution of the mooring lines l 1 l 11 are presented in table 2 the mpv of the extreme tension distribution for the mooring line l 6 is the largest and thus the mooring line l 6 is considered to be the most loaded mooring line for the grid mooring system for estimating the failure probability of the mooring line below 6 3 failure probability of mooring line the failure probability of the mooring line for the net cage and mooring system is predicted based on the probability information of the extreme tension on the mooring line obtained from the gpdem fig 18 shows the reliability and the failure probability of the mooring line l 6 versus the cov coefficient of variation for the allowable strength the allowable strength of the mooring line l 6 is deterministic and random when the cov is zero and nonzero respectively for the deterministic allowable strength cov 0 the reliability index of the mooring line l 6 increases nonlinearly with the increasing allowable strength it can be explained by the local characteristic of the cdf of the extreme tension force on the mooring line l 6 in fig 15 considering the deterministic allowable strength as the threshold it clearly demonstrates that the local information of the probability distribution of the extreme tension is important for the reliability of mooring lines for the random allowable strength cov 0 0 the reliability index of the mooring line l 6 increases almost linearly with the increasing mean value of allowable strength the difference in the reliability of the mooring line l 6 between the random allowable strength with a small cov and the deterministic allowable strength is small when the mean value of the random allowable strength is equal to the deterministic allowable strength however the reliability of the mooring line l 6 decreases significantly with the increasing cov indicating that a larger uncertainty of the allowable strength of the mooring line leads to a more conservative reliability of the mooring line the random allowable strength of mooring line will cause a large failure probability of mooring line compared with the deterministic allowable strength indicating that it is conservative to consider the random allowable strength for predicting the failure probability of mooring lines it is because the randomness of the allowable strength of mooring line results in a large integral region of the extreme tension distribution when calculating the failure probability of mooring line thus only the random allowable strength of mooring lines is considered to estimate the reliability of mooring system the failure probability results of the mooring lines l 1 l 11 are shown in table 3 when the mean value and the cov of the random allowable strength of mooring lines are 15 0 kn and 0 05 respectively it indicates that the downstream mooring lines have a higher reliability than the corresponding upstream mooring lines the grid lines parallel to waves have a higher reliability than the grid lines perpendicular to waves the results also demonstrate that the mooring line l 6 which has the largest mpv of the extreme tension distribution is more prone to be failure when the same allowable strength of each mooring line of the whole mooring system is considered 6 4 failure probability of mooring system if the failure of one mooring line occurs the grid mooring system is considered to be failure the failure probability of the grid mooring system for net cage structure under ultimate limit state can be achieved based on the equivalent extreme value event method as described in section 5 2 the main advantage of the equivalent extreme value event method is that the total correlation information among the components failure is inherent and retained in comparison to the classical bounding method for simplicity the mean value and the cov of the allowable strength for the upper layer lines including bridle lines buoy lines and grid lines are different for different hypothetical cases while the allowable strength of the lower layer lines anchor lines with the mean value of 15 0 kn and the cov of 0 05 remains unchanged fig 19 presents the pdf and cdf of the equivalent extreme value variable x max in eq 30 for different mean values of allowable strength t lim of the upper layer lines with the cov of 0 05 the failure probability of the mooring system is 0 156 0 033 0 0083 and 0 0073 when the mean value of the allowable strength of the upper layer mooring lines is 15 0 kn 18 0 kn 21 0 kn and 24 0 kn the results indicate that the failure probability of the mooring system dramatically increases with the decrease of the mean value of allowable strength for upper layer mooring lines as the mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines increases the equivalent extreme value variable tends to decrease and its distribution ranges have almost the same width as shown in fig 19 while the allowable limit of the equivalent extreme value variable always follow the standard normal distribution it means that the smaller failure probability of mooring system can be obtained for a larger mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines however the cdfs of the equivalent extreme value variable have a small difference for the mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines between 21 0 kn and 24 0 kn which leads to a negligible difference in the failure probability of mooring system this implies that the main contributor to the system reliability of the grid mooring system is the failure probability of the lower layer mooring lines when the mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines is larger than 21 0 kn fig 20 shows the pdf and the cdf for the equivalent extreme value variable x max for different covs of the allowable strength of the upper layer mooring lines with the mean value of 21 0 kn the distribution ranges of the equivalent extreme value variable become narrow gradually and move towards the direction of positive value with the increasing cov of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines the reliability index of the mooring system is 2 416 2 358 2 211 2 018 and 1 812 for the covs of the allowable strength varying from 0 04 to 0 20 with a constant increment of 0 04 for the upper layer mooring lines it demonstrates that the larger cov of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines results in a narrower distribution range and a larger failure probability of the mooring system therefore the uncertainty of the allowable strength of the mooring lines is of great importance to accurately predict the system reliability of the grid mooring system for comparison the failure probability of mooring system is estimated by the narrow bound method according to ditlevsen 1979 and garbatov and guedes soares 2011 the detailed formulas for the upper and lower bounds of the failure probability of mooring system are shown in hou et al 2018 based on the reliability information of the components in the grid mooring system in section 6 3 the system reliability of the whole mooring system for net cage is evaluated accounting for different correlation coefficients between the components failure fig 21 shows the failure probability of the mooring system obtained by the narrow bound method when the mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines varies from 15 0 kn to 24 0 kn with the cov of 0 05 when the mean value is 21 0 kn and the cov varies from 0 04 to 0 16 with an increment of 0 04 for the allowable strength of the upper layer mooring lines the failure probability of the mooring system is shown in fig 22 as a function of the correlation coefficient between the components failure of the mooring system the results indicate that the failure probability of the mooring system under ultimate limit state dramatically increases with the decreasing mean value and the increasing cov of allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines which is consistent with the results calculated from the equivalent extreme value event method the system reliability is insensitive to the correlation coefficient when the correlation coefficient is lower than 0 3 however the failure probability for the mooring system decreases rapidly when the correlation coefficient is around 0 8 and the full dependent relationship for the failure of the mooring components will give a non conservative result for the reliability of the mooring system for the net cage structure under ultimate limit state however the overly conservative estimation of the system reliability by the independent relationship of the components failure may result in the unnecessary maintenance and renewal of mooring lines it is found that the failure probability of the mooring system calculated based on the equivalent extreme value event method is between the bounds intervals obtained by the narrow bound approach the detailed correlation information between the components failure is necessary in the narrow bound method while the correlation information is inherent and is not required a priori in the equivalent extreme value event method and the failure probability calculated by the equivalent extreme value event method can make it possible to obtain the upper and lower bounds of the correlation coefficient between the components failure however even including the correct total correlation information the narrow bound technique may provide a wide bound for the reliability of mooring system which makes it difficult to accurately obtain the system reliability with respect to the calculation of the system reliability both the failure probability of each component and the correlation coefficient between the components failure affect the failure probability of mooring system in the narrow bound approach however the equivalent extreme value event method focuses on the tension response of mooring system instead of the failure probability of the components in mooring system therefore the equivalent extreme value event method is suggested to predict the system reliability without the detailed correlation information among the failure probability of the components 7 conclusions a set of numerical simulations associated with the representative wave loads are conducted to obtain the time histories of the tension on mooring lines for net cage the extreme tension distribution of the grid mooring system for fish cage is determined by combining the generalized probability density evolution method gpdem with the virtual stochastic process model and the system reliability of the grid mooring system under ultimate limit state is evaluated through the equivalent extreme value event method several conclusions can be drawn as follows the extreme tension distribution which is calculated by the gpdem from a stochastic point of view agrees very well with the empirical pdf rather than the classical asymptotic distributions the mooring line l 6 is the most loaded among the grid mooring system and is more prone to be failure considering the same allowable strength of mooring components in addition the failure probability of the grid mooring system calculated by the equivalent extreme value event method is between the intervals obtained from the narrow bound approach the equivalent extreme value event method focuses on the response of the mooring system and retains the correlation information among the components failure without dealing with the components failure probability thus the equivalent extreme value event method has a significant advantage over the narrow bound approach in accurately estimating the reliability of the grid mooring system the larger uncertainty of random allowable strength leads to a significantly larger failure probability of mooring system since the larger integral region of the extreme value distribution is included during the calculation of the failure probability in the future work the uncertainty quantification of the allowable strength is worth investigating to predict the system reliability of the grid mooring system precisely and the calibration of safety factor is necessary to be conducted for the net cage system to provide the assurance

results indicate that the equivalent extreme value event method has a significant advantage over the narrow bound approach in accurately predicting the system reliability and a large uncertainty of the random allowable strength largely affects the system reliability of grid mooring system therefore it is of vital importance to perform the uncertainty quantification of the allowable strength for accurately conducting the system reliability analysis in order to ensure the safety of offshore net cage structures keywords extreme tension distribution system reliability mooring system fish cage 1 introduction reliability based design for mooring system under ultimate limit state is becoming more and more popular for offshore floating structures since the fish cage structures utilized in remote offshore areas need to keep position in spite of weather conditions the grid mooring system for fish cage should have an overall acceptable reliability to provide assurance for the integrity of net cage system and the extreme value distribution of the dynamic response is of paramount importance in the reliability assessment and risk analysis the norwegian technical standard ns 9415 standard norge 2009 was introduced for specifying the requirements for the design of floaters net cages and mooring systems to cope with environmental loads in norway jensen et al 2010 and several researches for the design of sea cage farms based on ns 9415 were conducted berstad et al 2004 thomasson and leira 2005 2011 berstad and heimstad 2017 efforts have been made to perform the structural and hydrodynamic analysis of the net floater and moorings however there are few studies about the extreme value distribution of the response for floating fish farm thus this study focuses on the extreme tension distribution and the reliability of grid mooring system for gravity net cage under ultimate limit state which could prompt the designs for the integrity of grid mooring system to be more robust than the present designs the short term extreme response distribution of offshore structures is of great importance to estimate the characteristic design value of the response in the short term wave design approach two primary methods are generally presented to predict the extreme tension distribution of mooring line for offshore structures one is based on the level crossing rate method which is usually combined with the poisson s assumption or vanmarcke s assumption of the level crossings event low 2008 provided the procedure of calculating the mean up crossing rates based on the time history of low frequency response and the spectral moments of the wave frequency response for predicting the extreme mooring line tensions of a deepwater floating system sagrilo et al 2012 conducted a short term coupled analysis of a turret moored fpso based on the average conditional exceedance rate of peaks and investigated the extreme response of the top tension on the most loaded mooring line the other is based on the distribution fitting method which is the most straight and recommended approach to calculate the characteristic extreme value of the response the probability distribution of the extreme response is usually approximated based on the asymptotic extreme value distributions mathisen and hørte 2014 derived the gumbel distribution of the extreme tension in short term for a large semi submersible mobile drilling unit and evaluated the uncertainty in the parameters of annual extreme value distribution of mooring line tension by response surface method hsu et al 2015 conducted numerical simulation of the moored floating offshore wind turbines in a 3 h storm and extracted the tension maxima to be fitted to the weibull and generalized extreme value distribution hsu et al 2017 employed a composite weibull probability distribution for the estimation of the extreme tension on mooring lines in a mooring system for the floating offshore wind turbine however the validity of the assumptions for the level crossing events in the level crossing rate method significantly affects the evaluation of the extreme value distribution while the accuracy of the distribution fitting method obviously depends on the goodness of fit for the asymptotical distributions as a permanent floating structures installed in the open sea it is essential to perform the reliability analysis of mooring lines for the floating structure several researches were conducted in order to analyze the level of reliability of mooring lines choi 2007 conducted reliability analysis of mooring lines and foundations using representative probabilistic descriptions of the extreme met ocean conditions hurricanes and loop currents montes iturrizaga et al 2011 presented a formulation for the nested reliability analysis of mooring lines designed for fpso systems where the probability distribution parameters of the maximum dynamic line tension is described by response surface as functions of the environmental variables gurumurthy et al 2012 conducted reliability analysis of a critically loaded mooring line for a deep water classical spar floater under extreme environmental loads using environmental contour approach fontaine et al 2013 assessed the level of reliability of the mooring system of an existing floating production storage and offloading fpso unit in west africa using the first order reliability method combined with response surface model silva gonzález et al 2013 presented a detailed study on the reliability of suction caissons by means of the response surfaces for the mooring tension of the catenary and the taut leg mooring systems and a probability model for caisson capacities of floating systems rendón conde and heredia zavoni 2015 analyzed the effect of parameter uncertainty on the reliability index of mooring lines for floating structures under loading from extreme sea states through approximating the dynamic tension force on mooring line as a gaussian process unfortunately most of these methods could only provide an approximate and empirically dependent reliability evaluation due to the corresponding approximations or assumptions in the early part of this century the principle of preservation of probability li and chen 2008 provided a unified logic foundation to investigate the randomness propagation in the stochastic dynamical system li and chen 2006 the generalized probability density evolution method gpdem proposed by li and chen 2009 makes it possible to capture the instantaneous probability density function pdf and the evolution of the probability of the response considering the random parameters in the nonlinear dynamic systems and this is becoming more and more popular in the application of different engineering disciplines such as the civil engineering wind engineering mechanical engineering geological engineering and aerospace engineering e g pang et al 2018 tao et al 2018 liu and liu 2018 huang et al 2018 yang et al 2017 previously many researches were carried out to analyze the mooring system for fish cage structures e g tsukrov et al 2005 fredriksson et al 2007 huang et al 2010 xu et al 2013 berstad et al 2014 ito et al 2014 kristiansen and faltinsen 2015 huang et al 2016 he et al 2018 however the probability distribution of the extreme tension on grid mooring system for fish cages is rarely analyzed and it is difficult to ensure the accuracy of the widely used methods for the estimation of the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines previously few investigations on the system reliability of the mooring system for offshore structures were done under ultimate limit state thus it is essential to extend the knowledge of the system reliability of mooring system for fish cage however the difficulty for evaluating the system reliability of offshore structures is how to deal with the correlation information among different components failure therefore a robust method is necessary to estimate the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines and obtain the system reliability of grid mooring system for fish cage under ultimate limit state the purpose of this study is to estimate the short term extreme tension distribution of grid mooring system for fish cage without any assumptions or asymptotic distributions furthermore the reliability of grid mooring system is predicted by appropriately dealing with the correlation information among the components failure the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a description of mooring system for net cage and section 3 provides the environmental loading section 4 describes the evaluation of the extreme value distribution of tension force on mooring system and the reliability estimation of mooring system is given in section 5 in section 6 a case study is conducted and some results and discussion are provided finally some conclusions can be summarized in section 7 2 net cage and mooring system the full dynamic analysis is performed for grid mooring system of net cage in the open sea the net cage and mooring system consists of a gravity cage and a submerged mooring grid as shown in fig 1 the fish cage is composed of the float collar net pen and sinkers the detailed parameters of the fish cage and grid mooring system are given in table 1 the knotless net of the fish cage is made of pe with the density of 953 kg m3 the net mesh numbers along the circumferential direction and the depth direction are 1800 and 240 respectively the mesh size of the net is 46 8 mm and the twine thickness is 1 44 mm the nets mounted as diamond meshes form an open vertical cylinder with a diameter of 15 92 m and a height of 9 m there are 15 spherical sinkers

pretension squared grid platform 40 m 40 m in the horizontal plane the mooring system includes bridle lines grid lines buoy lines and anchor lines the lengths of bridle lines grid lines buoy lines and anchor lines are 20 86 m 40 0 m 4 0 m and 58 8 m respectively the gravity cage located at the middle of each grid square is connected to the submerged mooring grid by four bridle lines the submerged square grid platform is anchored to the sea bottom using eight anchor lines the floating buoy is connected to the submerged grid platform through the buoy line the material of the mooring line is polypropylene pp according to wilson 1967 the stiffness of the mooring line can be given by 1 t d 2 c e δ l l n where t is the tension force kn d is the diameter of mooring line ce and n are the unknown parameters δl l is the rate of deformation the relationship between the mooring line tension force and the elongation is determined by fitting the average elongation of pp rope under different loads gerhard 1983 xu 2014 and it is given as follows 2 t 562 δ l l 1 132 where t is the tension force on the fiber rope with the unit of kn δl is the elongation of the mooring line l is the initial length of the mooring line 3 environmental loading following our previous work xu et al 2011 this study analyzes the tension force on mooring line for fish cage by the self developed numerical model based on the lumped mass method and the rigid body kinematics principle the numerical model has been validated by physical model test in our previous research a brief description of numerical model is given here 3 1 description of wave field wave force is the main environmental load acting on the fish cage structure in the open sea the environmental load due to the wind load can be ignored here because a small part of floating fish cage is exposed in the air the modified jonswap spectrum is used as the input wave spectrum as follows 3 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp f f p 1 2

mooring system is divided into numerous elements that are subjected to wave loadings as shown in figs 3 and 4 a local coordinate system τ η ξ is defined to describe the direction of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structural elements concerning the local coordinate system τ η ξ the η axis lies on the plane that includes the τ axis and v and the velocity vector of the water particle at the mid point of the element can be divided into τ tangential and η normal components based on the lumped mass method the external forces on each element of the net pen and mooring line are calculated firstly and then evenly distributed to the corresponding nodes the force on the floating collar can be calculated by summing the force on each element of floating collar the scattering effect of the net twine on the flow field can be neglected because the diameter of net twine is relatively small compared with the characteristic wave length thus it is appropriate to calculate the wave loads on the net using the modified morison equation considering the relative motion between net element and flow field 9 f τ 1 2 c d τ ρ a τ u τ r τ u τ r τ ρ v 0 u τ c m τ ρ v 0 u τ r τ f η 1 2 c d η ρ a η u

extreme value distribution of tension force on the grid mooring system for fish cage according to the principle of preservation of probability which is similar to the conservation equation in fluid mechanics 4 1 gpdem equation in this section the physical quantity of interest x is deemed as the tension force on mooring line or the extreme value variable considering the random vector θ θ 1 θ 2 in eq 6 the stochastic tension response analysis of mooring system for fish cage is translated into a set of deterministic numerical simulations according to the gpdem referring to li 2016 the time varying joint probability density function p x θ x θ t of the augmented state vector x θ can be calculated through solving the gpdem equation 12 p x θ x θ t t x θ t p x θ x θ t x 0 the initial condition is given as follows 13 p x θ x θ t t 0 δ x x 0 p θ θ the probability density function of x t can be obtained by 14 p x x t ω θ p x θ x θ t d θ 4 2 solving the gpdem equation the flowchart of the gpdem is shown in fig 5 firstly the representative points in random space are selected by the number theoretical method which is of deterministic convergence with the deterministic error estimation zaremba 1972 hua and wang 1981 schroeder 1984 and extensively used in the probability density evolution analysis li and chen 2007 secondly the tension response of mooring system for fish cage is calculated by the deterministic analysis associated with the representative points in random space then the tvd scheme is applied to solve the probability density evolution equation for each representative point li and chen 2004 finally the numerical integration is conducted to obtain the probability information of the tension response 4 3 virtual stochastic process model the evaluation of the extreme value distribution for the tension response of mooring system is conducted based on a virtual stochastic process model proposed by chen and li 2007 a brief description on the virtual stochastic process model is presented as follows the extreme value of the response x t which depends on the random vector θ and the duration length t is denoted as 15 x ext θ t ext t 0 t x θ t a virtual stochastic process is assumed as 16 y τ x ext θ t τ where y τ is the virtual stochastic process τ is called as virtual time as the counterpart of eq 12 the gpdem equation used to predict the pdf of y τ can be written as 17 p y θ y θ τ τ y θ τ p y θ y θ τ y 0 substituting eq 16 into eq 17 there is 18 p y θ y θ τ τ x ext θ t p y θ y θ τ y 0 the initial condition is given as follows 19 p y θ y θ τ τ 0 δ y p θ θ solving the initial problem in eq 18 combined with eq 19 the pdf of y τ can be calculated by 20 p y y τ ω θ p y θ y θ τ d θ since the value of the virtual stochastic process y τ at the virtual time τ 1 is the extreme value x ext the pdf of the extreme value x ext is presented as follows 21 p e x t x p y y τ τ 1 y x therefore a virtual stochastic process model can be constructed to achieve the extreme value distribution of the tension force on mooring system for net cage without introducing any approximations or assumptions 5 failure probability analysis theory the failure probability of the mooring components in the grid mooring system for fish cage is estimated based on the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines which can be obtained by the combination of the gpdem and the virtual stochastic process model and the equivalent extreme value event method proposed by li et al 2007a is employed to predict the reliability of the grid mooring system for fish cage under ultimate limit state 5 1 failure probability of mooring line reliability is defined as the probability of a performance function z x greater than zero i e pr z x 0 this means that the reliability is the probability that the random vector x is in the safe region that is defined by z x 0 thus the failure probability can be defined as the probability pr z x 0 if the joint probability density function of x is f x the failure probability is calculated as follows 22 p f pr z x 0 z x 0 f x d x the reliability is then calculated by 23 r 1 p f pr z x 0 z x 0 f x d x the reliability index β is equivalent to the reliability and can be obtained as follows 24 β φ 1 1 p f where φ 1 is denoted as the inverse transformation of the standard normal distribution considering the random vector θ θ 1 θ 2 in eq 6 the ultimate limit state function z θ can be written as 25 z θ x lim x ext θ where x lim is the allowable strength of mooring line and x ext is the extreme tension on mooring line since the extreme value distribution p x ext x has been obtained by the gpdem the failure probability in eq 22 can be evaluated through 26 p f pr z θ 0 x lim p x ext x d x if the allowable strength of mooring line is considered as a random variable with the pdf p x lim x lim the failure probability is then calculated as 27 p f pr z θ 0 ω x lim x lim p x ext x p x lim x lim d x d x lim where ω x lim is the distribution domain of x lim 5 2 failure probability of mooring system the reliability of the grid mooring system under ultimate limit state is evaluated after obtaining a set of the maximum tension of each mooring line the grid mooring system for net cage structure includes 20 mooring lines as shown in fig 6 if one mooring line is failure the whole mooring system is considered to be failure in this study the equivalent extreme value event method is employed to predict the system reliability of the grid mooring system the equivalent extreme value event method can retain the total information of the correlation among different components failure the failure probability of mooring system can be calculated using the equivalent extreme value event method 28 pr j 1 m x j x lim pr x max x lim where x j is the tension force on the jth mooring line x max is the maximum tension force for the whole mooring system and denoted as an equivalent extreme value variable x max max j 1 2 m x j x lim is the deterministic allowable strength which is uniform for the components of the mooring system if the deterministic allowable strength is different for different components of the mooring system the failure probability of the mooring system can be calculated by equivalently transforming the inequality 29 pr j 1 m x j x j lim pr x max 1 where x max max j 1 2 m x j x j lim is an equivalent extreme value variable when different random variables for the allowable strength of different components of the mooring system are considered the transformation from the prescribed distribution to the standard normal distribution can be used the failure probability of the mooring system can thus be calculated by 30 pr j 1 m x j x j lim pr j 1 m x j t r a n s x n o r m pr x max x n o r m where x max max j 1 2 m x j t r a n s is an equivalent extreme value variable x norm is the standard normal distributed variable x jtrans is the new variable for the jth mooring line after an appropriate transformation considering that the random allowable strengths follow the lognormal distribution the transformation from the tension response x j to the new variable x jtrans can be shown as 31 x j t r a n s log x j μ j σ j where μ j and σ j are the mean value and standard deviation of the allowable strength of the jth mooring line respectively although it is difficult to analytically obtain the probability distribution of the above mentioned equivalent extreme value variable the combination of the gpdem and the virtual stochastic process model makes it convenient and effective to predict the pdf of the equivalent extreme value variable in addition the environmental conditions have significant influence on the allowable strength of mooring lines for fish cage such as the temperature microorganism density biofouling condition and nutrient concentration thus two random variables with respect to the allowable strength are considered for predicting the system reliability one is for the upper layer mooring lines bridle lines buoy lines and grid lines and the other is for the lower layer mooring lines anchor lines the failure probability of the grid mooring system can be obtained by 32 pr j 1 m x j x j lim pr x max x n o r m ω x n o r m x n o r m p x max x p x n o r m x n o r m d x d x n o r m 6 case study the water depth for the fish cage system is 20 0 m and the sea state is characterized using a jonswap wave spectrum with significant wave height of 3 54 m and wave period of 7 0 s as a case study in this study 233 representative points generated by the number theoretical method are picked up to obtain a set of the representative wave loads associated with the representative points a series of numerical simulations with the duration of 3 h are carried out to calculate the tension history of each mooring line the extreme tension distribution of each mooring line is estimated by combining the gpdem with the virtual stochastic process model the reliability of the grid mooring system under ultimate limit state is investigated based on the equivalent extreme value event method 6 1 stochastic dynamic tension response the probability information of the stochastic dynamic tension response can be calculated using the gpdem the typical time history of the tension force on the anchor line l 4 is shown in fig 7 fig 8 shows the typical time histories of the mean value and standard deviation of the tension force on the anchor line l 4 it demonstrates that the mean value and standard deviation of the tension force on the anchor line evolve irregularly against the time and can be denoted as the random processes fig 9 presents the instantaneous pdf of the tension response at several time instants which indicates that the pdfs of the tension force on the anchor line are evolving with the time and are quite different at different time instants in addition the tail of the pdf of the tension force on the anchor line l 4 obtained from the gpdem is obviously different from the widely used distributions such as the normal distribution the lognormal distribution and the weibull distribution the corresponding evolution processes of the probability distribution of the tension force on mooring line in a certain time period including the pdf evolution surface and the corresponding contour are presented in figs 10 and 11 the results demonstrate that the pdf evolution surface of the tension force on mooring line seems like the mountains stretching along the time axis the pdf contour in the region of the medium tension has several eddies similar to the turbulence flow while the pdf contour in the large and small tension region along the time axis stretches like the parallel lines and has much in common with the laminar flow near the wall surface which is analogous to the turbulence decay downstream of the pipes in kühnen et al 2018 the time variant pdf of mooring tension provides evidence that the gpdem makes it possible to calculate the time variant reliability directly at any instantaneous instants using the classical reliability approach melchers and beck 2018 this study focuses on the calculation of the extreme tension distribution and the reliability of the grid mooring system under ultimate limit state 6 2 extreme value distribution of extreme tension on mooring lines the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines is investigated by combining the gpdem with the virtual stochastic process model numerical simulations with the duration of 3 h are employed to predict the extreme tension on mooring lines figs 12 13 present the pdf and cdf cumulative distribution function results of the extreme tension on mooring line l 4 which are determined by the gpdem the classical extreme value theory and the empirical extreme tension distribution for the classical extreme value theory the classical asymptotic distributions including the weibull distribution the gumbel distribution and the generalized extreme value gev distribution are employed to fit the maximum tension force obtained from a series of numerical simulations fig 12 indicates that the classical asymptotic distributions of the extreme tension do not agree well with the empirical pdf the extreme tension distribution estimated by the classical asymptotic distributions causes a smaller tension on mooring line at the same probability of failure lower than 0 03 which leads to the non conservative design value of the tension on mooring line it is still difficult to select an appropriate asymptotic distribution for other mooring components and to predict the distribution parameters accurately due to the statistical uncertainty which strongly depends on the experience of the researcher thus the classical asymptotic distributions may not always be suitable to calculate the extreme tension distribution accurately generally speaking both the main body and the tail of the extreme tension distribution obtained from the gpdem agree well with the histogram of the maximum tension on mooring line the cdf of extreme tension calculated by the gpdem also agrees with the empirical cdf perfectly it may be attributed to the uniform contribution of each sample of the maximum tension to the extreme tension distribution in the gpdem thus the gpdem provides the accuracy and flexibility in the analysis of the extreme value distribution and can be adopted as a uniform method without much experience of the researcher different from the classical asymptotic distributions the pdf of the extreme tension obtained from the gpdem has several peaks fig 13 also indicates that the extreme tension distribution estimated using the gpdem has a heavier tail than the classical asymptotic distributions meaning that the extreme tension events on the mooring line for gpdem are more likely than that for the classical asymptotic distributions in addition it is convenient to predict the reliability of mooring lines under ultimate state by numerical integration method due to the full knowledge of the extreme tension distribution of mooring lines therefore the gpdem is robust to predict the extreme value distribution of the tension force on mooring line from a stochastic point of view without including any approximations or introducing any unnecessary statistical uncertainty the probability distribution of the extreme tension for the grid mooring system is calculated by the gpdem the pdfs and cdfs of the extreme tension on mooring lines l 1 l 11 are shown in figs 14 17 due to the symmetrical arrangement of the grid mooring system the results indicate that there is a large discrepancy of the pdf and cdf of the extreme tension between different mooring lines for the grid mooring system the extreme tension distribution of the upstream anchor lines covers a much wider range than that of the downstream anchor lines the extreme tension distribution range for the anchor line from the downstream to the upstream tends to move towards the side of a larger tension at the same failure probability the upstream bridle lines and buoy lines experience a larger tension than the downstream bridle lines and buoy lines respectively the characteristic tension force on the grid lines perpendicular to waves which is associated to the most probable value or to a fractile level of the extreme tension distribution is larger than that on the grid lines parallel to waves the most probable values mpv of the extreme tension distribution of the mooring lines l 1 l 11 are presented in table 2 the mpv of the extreme tension distribution for the mooring line l 6 is the largest and thus the mooring line l 6 is considered to be the most loaded mooring line for the grid mooring system for estimating the failure probability of the mooring line below 6 3 failure probability of mooring line the failure probability of the mooring line for the net cage and mooring system is predicted based on the probability information of the extreme tension on the mooring line obtained from the gpdem fig 18 shows the reliability and the failure probability of the mooring line l 6 versus the cov coefficient of variation for the allowable strength the allowable strength of the mooring line l 6 is deterministic and random when the cov is zero and nonzero respectively for the deterministic allowable strength cov 0 the reliability index of the mooring line l 6 increases nonlinearly with the increasing allowable strength it can be explained by the local characteristic of the cdf of the extreme tension force on the mooring line l 6 in fig 15 considering the deterministic allowable strength as the threshold it clearly demonstrates that the local information of the probability distribution of the extreme tension is important for the reliability of mooring lines for the random allowable strength cov 0 0 the reliability index of the mooring line l 6 increases almost linearly with the increasing mean value of allowable strength the difference in the reliability of the mooring line l 6 between the random allowable strength with a small cov and the deterministic allowable strength is small when the mean value of the random allowable strength is equal to the deterministic allowable strength however the reliability of the mooring line l 6 decreases significantly with the increasing cov indicating that a larger uncertainty of the allowable strength of the mooring line leads to a more conservative reliability of the mooring line the random allowable strength of mooring line will cause a large failure probability of mooring line compared with the deterministic allowable strength indicating that it is conservative to consider the random allowable strength for predicting the failure probability of mooring lines it is because the randomness of the allowable strength of mooring line results in a large integral region of the extreme tension distribution when calculating the failure probability of mooring line thus only the random allowable strength of mooring lines is considered to estimate the reliability of mooring system the failure probability results of the mooring lines l 1 l 11 are shown in table 3 when the mean value and the cov of the random allowable strength of mooring lines are 15 0 kn and 0 05 respectively it indicates that the downstream mooring lines have a higher reliability than the corresponding upstream mooring lines the grid lines parallel to waves have a higher reliability than the grid lines perpendicular to waves the results also demonstrate that the mooring line l 6 which has the largest mpv of the extreme tension distribution is more prone to be failure when the same allowable strength of each mooring line of the whole mooring system is considered 6 4 failure probability of mooring system if the failure of one mooring line occurs the grid mooring system is considered to be failure the failure probability of the grid mooring system for net cage structure under ultimate limit state can be achieved based on the equivalent extreme value event method as described in section 5 2 the main advantage of the equivalent extreme value event method is that the total correlation information among the components failure is inherent and retained in comparison to the classical bounding method for simplicity the mean value and the cov of the allowable strength for the upper layer lines including bridle lines buoy lines and grid lines are different for different hypothetical cases while the allowable strength of the lower layer lines anchor lines with the mean value of 15 0 kn and the cov of 0 05 remains unchanged fig 19 presents the pdf and cdf of the equivalent extreme value variable x max in eq 30 for different mean values of allowable strength t lim of the upper layer lines with the cov of 0 05 the failure probability of the mooring system is 0 156 0 033 0 0083 and 0 0073 when the mean value of the allowable strength of the upper layer mooring lines is 15 0 kn 18 0 kn 21 0 kn and 24 0 kn the results indicate that the failure probability of the mooring system dramatically increases with the decrease of the mean value of allowable strength for upper layer mooring lines as the mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines increases the equivalent extreme value variable tends to decrease and its distribution ranges have almost the same width as shown in fig 19 while the allowable limit of the equivalent extreme value variable always follow the standard normal distribution it means that the smaller failure probability of mooring system can be obtained for a larger mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines however the cdfs of the equivalent extreme value variable have a small difference for the mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines between 21 0 kn and 24 0 kn which leads to a negligible difference in the failure probability of mooring system this implies that the main contributor to the system reliability of the grid mooring system is the failure probability of the lower layer mooring lines when the mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines is larger than 21 0 kn fig 20 shows the pdf and the cdf for the equivalent extreme value variable x max for different covs of the allowable strength of the upper layer mooring lines with the mean value of 21 0 kn the distribution ranges of the equivalent extreme value variable become narrow gradually and move towards the direction of positive value with the increasing cov of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines the reliability index of the mooring system is 2 416 2 358 2 211 2 018 and 1 812 for the covs of the allowable strength varying from 0 04 to 0 20 with a constant increment of 0 04 for the upper layer mooring lines it demonstrates that the larger cov of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines results in a narrower distribution range and a larger failure probability of the mooring system therefore the uncertainty of the allowable strength of the mooring lines is of great importance to accurately predict the system reliability of the grid mooring system for comparison the failure probability of mooring system is estimated by the narrow bound method according to ditlevsen 1979 and garbatov and guedes soares 2011 the detailed formulas for the upper and lower bounds of the failure probability of mooring system are shown in hou et al 2018 based on the reliability information of the components in the grid mooring system in section 6 3 the system reliability of the whole mooring system for net cage is evaluated accounting for different correlation coefficients between the components failure fig 21 shows the failure probability of the mooring system obtained by the narrow bound method when the mean value of the allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines varies from 15 0 kn to 24 0 kn with the cov of 0 05 when the mean value is 21 0 kn and the cov varies from 0 04 to 0 16 with an increment of 0 04 for the allowable strength of the upper layer mooring lines the failure probability of the mooring system is shown in fig 22 as a function of the correlation coefficient between the components failure of the mooring system the results indicate that the failure probability of the mooring system under ultimate limit state dramatically increases with the decreasing mean value and the increasing cov of allowable strength for the upper layer mooring lines which is consistent with the results calculated from the equivalent extreme value event method the system reliability is insensitive to the correlation coefficient when the correlation coefficient is lower than 0 3 however the failure probability for the mooring system decreases rapidly when the correlation coefficient is around 0 8 and the full dependent relationship for the failure of the mooring components will give a non conservative result for the reliability of the mooring system for the net cage structure under ultimate limit state however the overly conservative estimation of the system reliability by the independent relationship of the components failure may result in the unnecessary maintenance and renewal of mooring lines it is found that the failure probability of the mooring system calculated based on the equivalent extreme value event method is between the bounds intervals obtained by the narrow bound approach the detailed correlation information between the components failure is necessary in the narrow bound method while the correlation information is inherent and is not required a priori in the equivalent extreme value event method and the failure probability calculated by the equivalent extreme value event method can make it possible to obtain the upper and lower bounds of the correlation coefficient between the components failure however even including the correct total correlation information the narrow bound technique may provide a wide bound for the reliability of mooring system which makes it difficult to accurately obtain the system reliability with respect to the calculation of the system reliability both the failure probability of each component and the correlation coefficient between the components failure affect the failure probability of mooring system in the narrow bound approach however the equivalent extreme value event method focuses on the tension response of mooring system instead of the failure probability of the components in mooring system therefore the equivalent extreme value event method is suggested to predict the system reliability without the detailed correlation information among the failure probability of the components 7 conclusions a set of numerical simulations associated with the representative wave loads are conducted to obtain the time histories of the tension on mooring lines for net cage the extreme tension distribution of the grid mooring system for fish cage is determined by combining the generalized probability density evolution method gpdem with the virtual stochastic process model and the system reliability of the grid mooring system under ultimate limit state is evaluated through the equivalent extreme value event method several conclusions can be drawn as follows the extreme tension distribution which is calculated by the gpdem from a stochastic point of view agrees very well with the empirical pdf rather than the classical asymptotic distributions the mooring line l 6 is the most loaded among the grid mooring system and is more prone to be failure considering the same allowable strength of mooring components in addition the failure probability of the grid mooring system calculated by the equivalent extreme value event method is between the intervals obtained from the narrow bound approach the equivalent extreme value event method focuses on the response of the mooring system and retains the correlation information among the components failure without dealing with the components failure probability thus the equivalent extreme value event method has a significant advantage over the narrow bound approach in accurately estimating the reliability of the grid mooring system the larger uncertainty of random allowable strength leads to a significantly larger failure probability of mooring system since the larger integral region of the extreme value distribution is included during the calculation of the failure probability in the future work the uncertainty quantification of the allowable strength is worth investigating to predict the system reliability of the grid mooring system precisely and the calibration of safety factor is necessary to be conducted for the net cage system to provide the assurance

23064,for the very large floating structure vlfs which is deployed near seashore islands and reefs the encounter wave conditions will become extremely complex the influences of the inhomogeneous

near seashores and islands keywords simplified method vlfs hydroelasticity model tests inhomogeneous waves 1 introduction in the past several years extensive investigations have been carried out on the hydroelastic responses of vlfs in deep open seas and the hydroelastic methods range from two dimensional linear theory bishop and price 1979 three dimensional linear theory wu 1984 price and wu 1985 two dimensional nonlinear theory wu and moan 1996 xia et al 1998 to three dimensional nonlinear theory wu et al 1997 chen et al 2003 tian 2006 hu et al 2012 malenica et al 2013 senjanović et al 2014a 2014b lee and lee 2016 as well as different hybrid hydroelastic analysis methods hamamoto et al 1998 seto et al 2005 belibassakis and athanassoulis 2005 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 michailides et

2018 wu et al 2018 however in addition to the complicated hydroelastic coupling effects between the hydrodynamic loads and structural dynamic responses when tackling the hydroelastic problems of floating structures deployed not far from a shoreline or near an island the influences of the inhomogeneous incident waves multi directions different wave height should be taken into account particularly in extreme typhoon wave environment in the present paper a simplified method and its corresponding software thafts ihiw taking into account the effect of inhomogeneous incident wave is developed based on the classical three dimensional hydroelasticity theory the software thafts three dimension hydroelastic analysis of floating and traveling structures wu 1984 and the inhomogeneous

for the hydroelastic analysis of the 8 module vlfs in the typhoon kalmaegi is also given the inhomogeneity of wave conditions may induce a significant increase in the responses of vlfs which should be considered in the hydroelastic analysis the conclusions drawn from the results provide information and guidance in the design optimization and safety assessment of structure and connectors of a multi module vlfs deployed near shoreline or island and coral reefs 2 theoretical background 2 1 inhomogeneous wave condition if a vlfs is deployed near islands and reefs in complicated geographical environment the encounter wave conditions for the vlfs will be quite different than that in open sea so far the above most of researches have generally assumed a constant water depth and a homogeneous wave condition therefore the analysis methods are not applicable for the vlfs located nearshore or islands and reefs the idea of partition will be adopted in the simplified method to consider the influence of inhomogeneous incident wave conditions for the hydroelastic analysis of vlfs in complicated geographical environment assuming that the water surface surrounding the structure is partitioned to several pieces regions and in the adjacent surface regions the wave conditions are piece wise varied keeping homogeneous in each region in the ℓ th region ℓ 1 2 l the incident wave is defined by a local wave energy spectrum s ξ ℓ ω and a local wave direction β ℓ which can been obtained from the incident wave elevation at the center of the ℓ th region the incident wave elevation and potential in the ℓ th region may be represented as 1 ζ ℓ x y t i 1 n a i ℓ sin ω i t k i x cos β ℓ y sin β ℓ ε i a i ℓ 2 s ζ ℓ ω i δ ω i ℓ 1 2 l where a i ℓ is the regular wave amplitude ℓ 1 2 l i 1 2 n k i and ε i are respectively the wave number and the phase angle the wave characteristics for different regions can be obtained by field wave measurements in the sea model tests and the numerical simulations in this paper both the model tests and numerical simulation will be used to provide the input incident wave data for the hydroelastic analysis of vlfs the model tests which will be introduced in section 3 1 were set up for simulation of the inhomogeneous wave filed for the numerical simulation based on multi grid approach tolman 2008 in ww3 a series of grids with different resolutions are nested to calculate wave fields in a typical lagoon induced by typhoon considering the interactions between these grids simultaneously and continuously the balance equation for

2 2 hydroelasticity of vlfs by assuming water to be ideal fluid with no viscosity and its motion is irrotational the fluid motion can be represented by a velocity potential ϕ x y z t the steady state harmonic potential is expressed as 3 ϕ x y z t re ϕ x y z e i ω t where ω is circular frequency t is the time and i is the imaginary unit the motion and elastic deformation are assumed small and the whole system is assumed to be linear as well therefore based on superposition theory the motion and elastic deformation of a floating body can be written as follows 4 u r 1 m u r p r r 1 m u r v r w r p r where p r r 1 2 m is the principal coordinate component of the rth dry mode the total potential is the summary of incident wave potential ϕ i diffraction potential ϕ d and radiation potential ϕ r

condition on the wetted body which is 6 ϕ d n s 0 ϕ i n in order to consider the influence of inhomogeneous wave conditions it is assumed that the green function of definite water depth may be used in the hydroelastic analysis but in description of the incident wave potential and in calculation of the green function the water depth in the ℓ th region can be approximately averaged and taken as h ℓ

module flexible connector model ertekin et al 1993 is usually used to assess the motion responses and connector loads to reduce the overall workload in rmfc model each module is assumed to be a rigid body with the displacements of six degrees of freedom the surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw the displacement vector can be denoted as 9 u i k u 1 k u 2 k u 3 k u 4 k u 5 k u 6 k t where u 1 k u 6 k are 6 degrees of freedom of the kth module the connector is modeled as a linear spring in this paper and the spring restricts relative translations but allows for relative rotations of different modules the ith link point is assumed to be on the kth module and its motions have the following expression 10 u i n i u i k 1 0 0 0 z k i y k i 0 1 0 z k i 0 x k i 0 0 1 y k i x k i 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

and k 1 respectively 3 validation of the proposed simplified hydroelastic method 3 1 model tests in 2017 the model of reduction scale λ 100 1 of an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs fig 2 was tested in the state key laboratory of ocean engineering of shanghai jiaotong university fig 3 the particulars of each module and the stiffness components of connectors are shown in table 1 the uneven seabed was simplified as a 2 slope two dimensional topography as shown in fig 4 to simulate the effect of inhomogeneous wave directions a model island was fixed between the slope seabed and the vlfs model fig 5 before the model tests eight wave height gauges were arranged in the central positions of the eight vlfs models supposed to be deployed as shown in fig 2 from s1 s8 at that time the eight vlfs models were not placed in the wave basin four typical irregular incident waves b1 b4 were made and the wave parameters in the eight positions were obtained as shown in table 2 considering four wave spectra with different significant wave heights h s and spectral peak periods t p which were generated from a 3 parameter jonswap spectrum 13 s ω 319 34 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 1948 t p ω 4 γ exp 0 159 ω t p 1 2 2 σ 2 where γ 2 0 is the spectral peak parameter σ is the spectral width parameter the results are converted into prototype scale according to the model scale factor it clearly shows that the wave characteristics in eight positions are inhomogeneous because of the diffraction and refraction effects of the island and seabed models the results in table 2 will be taken as the incident waves for the numerical model for hydroelastic analysis of vlfs in the inhomogeneous waves after that the 8 module vlfs model was placed into the wave basin the motions of module 1 and module 4 as well as the connector forces of c1 and c7 were measured in the irregular wave conditions of b1 b4 the test results can be provided for the comparison of the numerical predictions in the next section 3 2 numerical model table 3 shows the natural vibration frequencies of each floating structure module it can be found that the dry structure of each module of vlfs can be assumed to be a rigid body compared with the flexible connector therefore the 8 module vlfs was modeled as rigid modules and flexible connectors rmfc model and the bush elements were used between two adjacent modules to simulate the stiffness of connectors as shown in table 1 the numerical model is shown in fig 6 including the single structure model the connection between adjacent modules the dry model analysis is carried out to obtain the dynamic characteristics of this structure in vacuum with the above three dimensional finite element model the structural damping of 2 is used in the analysis four typical modes and corresponding principal coordinates are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 which may play a leading role in motions and connector loads 3 3 verification results the simplified method is used to predict the motions and connector loads of the 8 module vlfs in the inhomogeneous waves the encounter wave for each module of the vlfs is according to the measured results as given in table 2 fig 9 is the sketch map of encounter waves for different modules of irregular wave condition b1 as shown in fig 10 the inhomogeneity of the wave field was obvious after crossing the island model the dynamic responses of vlfs model included clear lateral bending deformation which should not appear in the homogeneous beam sea conditions this phenomenon may result in very large connector loads in fx table 4 and table 5 are the comparisons between the predictions and the test results of motions of module 1 and module 4 as well as the connecting force components of c1 and c7 it really shows that the present simplified method may reasonably predict the hydroelastic responses of a very large floating structure in the inhomogeneous waves but the numerical results are generally smaller than the model test results by about 20 35 the main reason for this difference can be concluded as follows only eight wave characteristics in the central positions of the vlfs model were considered in the numerical model it means the encounter wave for single module of vlfs is completely the same but the actual encounter waves for vlfs model were totally different not only for the whole 8 module model but also for one single module therefore the actual inhomogeneity of the encounter waves for vlfs model was simplified in the numerical model which may introduce some error into the predictions in other word the accuracy of the predictions can be improved if much more wave parameters in different positions could be obtained for the input data of the numerical model in that case the inhomogeneity of the encounter waves in the numerical model will be closed to the actual wave conditions compared with the test results the simplified numerical model can give a reasonable solution for the hydroelastic analysis of multi module vlfs in the inhomogeneous wave conditions in addition this simplified numerical model has the merits of simple calculation and high calculation efficiency which can be used to quickly evaluate the influence of the complex environments in the preliminary design phase of vlfs 4 application the hydroelastic responses of the 8 module vlfs deployed in lagoon area during the super typhoon kalmaegi typhoon no 1415 2014 is investigated using the thafts ihiw the inhomogeneous wave parameters induced by typhoon kalmaegi are used as the extreme incident wave condition to predict module motions and connector loads of vlfs which can provide information and guidance for design optimization and safety assessment of the structure of the multi module vlfs near islands and reefs 4 1 inhomogeneous waves for vlfs near an island in a typhoon event the wave propagation induced by typhoon kalmaegi typhoon no 1415 2014 is simulated fig 11 shows the evolution of significant wave height h s distribution calculated during the passage of the typhoon kalmaegi fig 11 a b represent the period before typhoon kalmaegi approaching the target lagoon c represents the period during typhoon kalmaegi mostly affecting the target lagoon and the d represents the period after typhoon kalmaegi departing from the target lagoon as shown in fig 12 two wave rider buoys were deployed at station 1 st 1 inside the lagoon and station 2 st 2 outside the lagoon with 25 m and 160 m water depth respectively fig 13 shows the calculated wave energy spectra and its corresponding observed wave energy spectra inside the lagoon and outside the lagoon when h s reach the peak value the solid line represents the numerical result while dots represent the observed data from buoys it can be seen that the calculated wave energy spectra matches well with measurement results in fig 12 an 8 module vlfs is supposed to be deployed in the target lagoon with p1 p8 denoting the center of each module of vlfs fig 14 a c show the simulated significant wave height mean wave period and mean wave direction distribution along vlfs at the moment when h s reaches the maximum value the corresponding wave characteristics in the 8 locations for 8 module vlfs when typhoon kalmaegi was passing by can be obtained as shown in table 6 it can be seen that these mean wave parameters are varying at different location along vlfs therefore for the hydroelastic analysis of the vlfs deployed near islands and reefs the encountered inhomogeneous waves in extreme typhoon environment should be taken into account as the input incident waves 4 2 hydroelastic responses of vlfs in the typhoon waves the short term predictions of the vlfs responses in typhoon waves of kalmaegi with space varying significant wave heights mean wave periods and wave directions are predicted by thafts ihiw the predicted significant values of motions and connector loads in inhomogeneous typhoon waves are compared with those excited by the homogeneous incident waves with respective mean values in table 6 it shows that the inhomogeneous typhoon waves induce much higher motions and connector loads than the homogeneous waves by about 2 2 40 for typhoon kalmaegi table 7 fig 15 exhibits the distribution of results of motions for module 1 module 8 and connector loads for c1 c14 in the typhoon kalmaegi the predicted results in homogeneous waves are also provided for comparison it can be seen that both the motions and the connector loads in typhoon kalmaegi are larger than those in homogeneous waves for the motions of different modules along the vlfs the roll is nearly the same but the heave and pitch vary evidently for different modules when the connector loads are concerned it can be seen that the connector loads along x direction are one order of magnitude larger than those in y and z directions especially for c7 fx the significant value is nearly 10000 tons which provide a reference value for the design of connectors in addition the maximum values of fx and fz usually appears near the middle section of vlfs as opposed to the fy 5 conclusions if a vlfs is deployed near islands and reefs in complicated geographical environment the wave conditions wave loads and the hydroelastic responses will be quite different and more complicated than in open sea based on the 3d hydroelasticity theory and inhomogeneous wave theory a simplified method was developed in this paper which can be used to estimate the hydroelastic responses of vlfs in the inhomogeneous wave conditions the following conclusions can be drawn 1 compared with the model test results the simplified numerical model can give a reasonable solution for the hydroelastic analysis of multi module vlfs in the inhomogeneous wave conditions in addition this simplified numerical model has the merits of simple calculation and high calculation efficiency which can be used to quickly evaluate the influence of the complex environments in the preliminary design phase of vlfs 2 a multi grid algorithm is employed to predict the propagation of typhoon waves and validated by the on site measurement data the corresponding wave characteristics in the 8 locations for 8 module vlfs when typhoon kalmaegi was passing are varying at different location along vlfs 3 the inhomogeneous typhoon waves induce much higher motions and connector loads than the homogeneous waves by about 2 2 40 for typhoon kalmaegi 4 the distribution of motions and connector loads along the vlfs in the typhoon kalmaegi were also investigated the connector loads along x direction are one order of magnitude larger than those in y and z directions especially for c7 fx the significant value is nearly 10000 tons in addition the maximum values of fx and fz usually appears near the middle section of vlfs as opposed to the fy the proposed simplified method can provide an efficient tool for the analysis of dynamic responses of floating bodies in the complicated environments even though the full scale measurements are needed in the future for further validation moreover some other more precise methods need to be developed to consider the effects of real sea conditions which can give references for the detailed design and manufacture of vlfs in different severe working conditions acknowledgments the work summarized in this paper was

considered in the hydroelastic analysis the conclusions drawn from the results provide information and guidance in the design optimization and safety assessment of structure and connectors of a multi module vlfs deployed near shoreline or island and coral reefs 2 theoretical background 2 1 inhomogeneous wave condition if a vlfs is deployed near islands and reefs in complicated geographical environment the encounter wave conditions for the vlfs will be quite different than that in open sea so far the above most of researches have generally assumed a constant water depth and a homogeneous wave condition therefore the analysis methods are not applicable for the vlfs located nearshore or islands and reefs the idea of partition will be adopted in the simplified method to consider the influence of inhomogeneous incident wave conditions for the hydroelastic analysis of vlfs in complicated geographical environment assuming that the water surface surrounding the structure is partitioned to several pieces regions and in the adjacent surface regions the wave conditions are piece wise varied keeping homogeneous in each region in the ℓ th region ℓ 1 2 l the incident wave is defined by a local wave energy spectrum s ξ ℓ ω and a local wave direction β ℓ which can been obtained from the incident wave elevation at the center of the ℓ th region the incident wave elevation and potential in the ℓ th region may be represented as 1 ζ ℓ x y t i 1 n a i ℓ sin ω i t k i x cos β ℓ y sin β ℓ ε i a i ℓ 2 s ζ ℓ ω i δ ω i ℓ 1 2 l where a i ℓ is the regular wave amplitude ℓ 1 2 l i 1 2 n k i and ε i are respectively the wave number and the phase angle the wave characteristics for different regions can be obtained by field wave measurements in the sea model tests and the numerical simulations in this paper both the model tests and numerical simulation will be used to provide the input incident wave data for the hydroelastic analysis of vlfs the model tests which will be introduced in section 3 1 were set up for simulation of the inhomogeneous wave filed for the numerical simulation based on multi grid approach tolman 2008 in ww3 a series of grids with different resolutions are nested to calculate wave fields in a typical lagoon induced by typhoon considering the interactions between these grids simultaneously and continuously the balance equation for

2 2 hydroelasticity of vlfs by assuming water to be ideal fluid with no viscosity and its motion is irrotational the fluid motion can be represented by a velocity potential ϕ x y z t the steady state harmonic potential is expressed as 3 ϕ x y z t re ϕ x y z e i ω t where ω is circular frequency t is the time and i is the imaginary unit the motion and elastic deformation are assumed small and the whole system is assumed to be linear as well therefore based on superposition theory the motion and elastic deformation of a floating body can be written as follows 4 u r 1 m u r p r r 1 m u r v r w r p r where p r r 1 2 m is the principal coordinate component of the rth dry mode the total potential is the summary of incident wave potential ϕ i diffraction potential ϕ d and radiation potential ϕ r the boundary conditions for solving the rth radiation potential ϕ r x y z for free floating structures are 5 in fluid 2 ϕ r x y z 0 on the free surface ϕ r z v ϕ r 0 on the wet body ϕ r n s 0 i ω u r

the flat seabed of constant depth r is the radiation radius of out propagating waves the boundary condition of the diffraction potential ϕ d x y z is the same as radiation case except the boundary condition on the wetted body which is 6 ϕ d n s 0 ϕ i n in order to consider the influence of inhomogeneous wave conditions it is assumed that the green function of definite water depth may be used in the hydroelastic analysis but in description of the incident wave potential and in calculation of the green function the water depth in the ℓ th region can be approximately averaged and taken as h ℓ so that 7 ϕ i ℓ x y z t re i 1 n i a i ℓ g ω i ch k i z h ℓ ch k i h ℓ exp i ω i t i k i x cos β ℓ y sin β ℓ i ε i and ϕ i ℓ n ϕ i ℓ x n 1 ϕ i ℓ y n 2 ϕ i ℓ z n 3 where ϕ i ℓ x i k i cos β ℓ ϕ i ℓ ϕ i

damping matrix and restoring force matrix of fluid respectively f is the generalized wave exciting force 2 3 motions and connector loads in the stage of preliminary design of a vlfs a rmfc rigid module flexible connector model ertekin et al 1993 is usually used to assess the motion responses and connector loads to reduce the overall workload in rmfc model each module is assumed to be a rigid body with the displacements of six degrees of freedom the surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw the displacement vector can be denoted as 9 u i k u 1 k u 2 k u 3 k u 4 k u 5 k u 6 k t where u 1 k u 6 k are 6 degrees of freedom of the kth module the connector is modeled as a linear spring in this paper and the spring restricts relative translations but allows for relative rotations of different modules the ith link point is assumed to be on the kth module and its motions have the following expression 10 u i n i u i k 1 0 0 0 z k i y k i 0 1 0 z k i 0 x k i 0 0 1 y k i x k i 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

elastic assumption of connectors the connector loads between two adjacent modules could be written as 11 f k c δ u k k 1 k x 0 0 0 0 0 0 k y 0 0 0 0 0 0 k z 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 δ

and k 1 respectively 3 validation of the proposed simplified hydroelastic method 3 1 model tests in 2017 the model of reduction scale λ 100 1 of an 8 module semi submersible type vlfs fig 2 was tested in the state key laboratory of ocean engineering of shanghai jiaotong university fig 3 the particulars of each module and the stiffness components of connectors are shown in table 1 the uneven seabed was simplified as a 2 slope two dimensional topography as shown in fig 4 to simulate the effect of inhomogeneous wave directions a model island was fixed between the slope seabed and the vlfs model fig 5 before the model tests eight wave height gauges were arranged in the central positions of the eight vlfs models supposed to be deployed as shown in fig 2 from s1 s8 at that time the eight vlfs models were not placed in the wave basin four typical irregular incident waves b1 b4 were made and the wave parameters in the eight positions were obtained as shown in table 2 considering four wave spectra with different significant wave heights h s and spectral peak periods t p which were generated from a 3 parameter jonswap spectrum 13 s ω 319 34 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 1948 t p ω 4 γ exp 0 159 ω t p 1 2 2 σ 2 where γ 2 0 is the spectral peak parameter σ is the spectral width parameter the results are converted into prototype scale according to the model scale factor it clearly shows that the wave characteristics in eight positions are inhomogeneous because of the diffraction and refraction effects of the island and seabed models the results in table 2 will be taken as the incident waves for the numerical model for hydroelastic analysis of vlfs in the inhomogeneous waves after that the 8 module vlfs model was placed into the wave basin the motions of module 1 and module 4 as well as the connector forces of c1 and c7 were measured in the irregular wave conditions of b1 b4 the test results can be provided for the comparison of the numerical predictions in the next section 3 2 numerical model table 3 shows the natural vibration frequencies of each floating structure module it can be found that the dry structure of each module of vlfs can be assumed to be a rigid body compared with the flexible connector therefore the 8 module vlfs was modeled as rigid modules and flexible connectors rmfc model and the bush elements were used between two adjacent modules to simulate the stiffness of connectors as shown in table 1 the numerical model is shown in fig 6 including the single structure model the connection between adjacent modules the dry model analysis is carried out to obtain the dynamic characteristics of this structure in vacuum with the above three dimensional finite element model the structural damping of 2 is used in the analysis four typical modes and corresponding principal coordinates are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 which may play a leading role in motions and connector loads 3 3 verification results the simplified method is used to predict the motions and connector loads of the 8 module vlfs in the inhomogeneous waves the encounter wave for each module of the vlfs is according to the measured results as given in table 2 fig 9 is the sketch map of encounter waves for different modules of irregular wave condition b1 as shown in fig 10 the inhomogeneity of the wave field was obvious after crossing the island model the dynamic responses of vlfs model included clear lateral bending deformation which should not appear in the homogeneous beam sea conditions this phenomenon may result in very large connector loads in fx table 4 and table 5 are the comparisons between the predictions and the test results of motions of module 1 and module 4 as well as the connecting force components of c1 and c7 it really shows that the present simplified method may reasonably predict the hydroelastic responses of a very large floating structure in the inhomogeneous waves but the numerical results are generally smaller than the model test results by about 20 35 the main reason for this difference can be concluded as follows only eight wave characteristics in the central positions of the vlfs model were considered in the numerical model it means the encounter wave for single module of vlfs is completely the same but the actual encounter waves for vlfs model were totally different not only for the whole 8 module model but also for one single module therefore the actual inhomogeneity of the encounter waves for vlfs model was simplified in the numerical model which may introduce some error into the predictions in other word the accuracy of the predictions can be improved if much more wave parameters in different positions could be obtained for the input data of the numerical model in that case the inhomogeneity of the encounter waves in the numerical model will be closed to the actual wave conditions compared with the test results the simplified numerical model can give a reasonable solution for the hydroelastic analysis of multi module vlfs in the inhomogeneous wave conditions in addition this simplified numerical model has the merits of simple calculation and high calculation efficiency which can be used to quickly evaluate the influence of the complex environments in the preliminary design phase of vlfs 4 application the hydroelastic responses of the 8 module vlfs deployed in lagoon area during the super typhoon kalmaegi typhoon no 1415 2014 is investigated using the thafts ihiw the inhomogeneous wave parameters induced by typhoon kalmaegi are used as the extreme incident wave condition to predict module motions and connector loads of vlfs which can provide information and guidance for design optimization and safety assessment of the structure of the multi module vlfs near islands and reefs 4 1 inhomogeneous waves for vlfs near an island in a typhoon event the wave propagation induced by typhoon kalmaegi typhoon no 1415 2014 is simulated fig 11 shows the evolution of significant wave height h s distribution calculated during the passage of the typhoon kalmaegi fig 11 a b represent the period before typhoon kalmaegi approaching the target lagoon c represents the period during typhoon kalmaegi mostly affecting the target lagoon and the d represents the period after typhoon kalmaegi departing from the target lagoon as shown in fig 12 two wave rider buoys were deployed at station 1 st 1 inside the lagoon and station 2 st 2 outside the lagoon with 25 m and 160 m water depth respectively fig 13 shows the calculated wave energy spectra and its corresponding observed wave energy spectra inside the lagoon and outside the lagoon when h s reach the peak value the solid line represents the numerical result while dots represent the observed data from buoys it can be seen that the calculated wave energy spectra matches well with measurement results in fig 12 an 8 module vlfs is supposed to be deployed in the target lagoon with p1 p8 denoting the center of each module of vlfs fig 14 a c show the simulated significant wave height mean wave period and mean wave direction distribution along vlfs at the moment when h s reaches the maximum value the corresponding wave characteristics in the 8 locations for 8 module vlfs when typhoon kalmaegi was passing by can be obtained as shown in table 6 it can be seen that these mean wave parameters are varying at different location along vlfs therefore for the hydroelastic analysis of the vlfs deployed near islands and reefs the encountered inhomogeneous waves in extreme typhoon environment should be taken into account as the input incident waves 4 2 hydroelastic responses of vlfs in the typhoon waves the short term predictions of the vlfs responses in typhoon waves of kalmaegi with space varying significant wave heights mean wave periods and wave directions are predicted by thafts ihiw the predicted significant values of motions and connector loads in inhomogeneous typhoon waves are compared with those excited by the homogeneous incident waves with respective mean values in table 6 it shows that the inhomogeneous typhoon waves induce much higher motions and connector loads than the homogeneous waves by about 2 2 40 for typhoon kalmaegi table 7 fig 15 exhibits the distribution of results of motions for module 1 module 8 and connector loads for c1 c14 in the typhoon kalmaegi the predicted results in homogeneous waves are also provided for comparison it can be seen that both the motions and the connector loads in typhoon kalmaegi are larger than those in homogeneous waves for the motions of different modules along the vlfs the roll is nearly the same but the heave and pitch vary evidently for different modules when the connector loads are concerned it can be seen that the connector loads along x direction are one order of magnitude larger than those in y and z directions especially for c7 fx the significant value is nearly 10000 tons which provide a reference value for the design of connectors in addition the maximum values of fx and fz usually appears near the middle section of vlfs as opposed to the fy 5 conclusions if a vlfs is deployed near islands and reefs in complicated geographical environment the wave conditions wave loads and the hydroelastic responses will be quite different and more complicated than in open sea based on the 3d hydroelasticity theory and inhomogeneous wave theory a simplified method was developed in this paper which can be used to estimate the hydroelastic responses of vlfs in the inhomogeneous wave conditions the following conclusions can be drawn 1 compared with the model test results the simplified numerical model can give a reasonable solution for the hydroelastic analysis of multi module vlfs in the inhomogeneous wave conditions in addition this simplified numerical model has the merits of simple calculation and high calculation efficiency which can be used to quickly evaluate the influence of the complex environments in the preliminary design phase of vlfs 2 a multi grid algorithm is employed to predict the propagation of typhoon waves and validated by the on site measurement data the corresponding wave characteristics in the 8 locations for 8 module vlfs when typhoon kalmaegi was passing are varying at different location along vlfs 3 the inhomogeneous typhoon waves induce much higher motions and connector loads than the homogeneous waves by about 2 2 40 for typhoon kalmaegi 4 the distribution of motions and connector loads along the vlfs in the typhoon kalmaegi were also investigated the connector loads along x direction are one order of magnitude larger than those in y and z directions especially for c7 fx the significant value is nearly 10000 tons in addition the maximum values of fx and fz usually appears near the middle section of vlfs as opposed to the fy the proposed simplified method can provide an efficient tool for the analysis of dynamic responses of floating bodies in the complicated environments even though the full scale measurements are needed in the future for further validation moreover some other more precise methods need to be developed to consider the effects of real sea conditions which can give references for the detailed design and manufacture of vlfs in different severe working conditions acknowledgments the work summarized in this paper was
