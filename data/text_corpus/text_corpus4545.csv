and achieves self tuning path planning which adapts time varying environments 2 to minimize yaw cost for the usv within local path a novel ca algorithm is developed by the b spline method 3 for capturing environmental influences arisen from reefs around the coastline a stochastic dynamic coastal environments sdce model is built by virtue of poisson distribution in combination with the fast

terms of both collision avoidance and adaptability to complex environments keywords multilayer path planner collision avoidance routine correction stochastic dynamic coastal environment fast marching method 1 introduction currently with the increasing usage of unmanned surface vehicle usv many studies have spread around promising technologies wang et al 2017 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b qin wu sun chen meanwhile a path planning technique with high safety and efficiency plays an essential role in applying the usv to real world maritime environments to be specific the usv needs path planning methods to autonomously perform various tasks including coastal patrols and rescues etc to this end in addition global approaches tools for local collision avoidance ca and route correction rc become critical within the whole path planning scheme as a consequence both global and local path planning strategies are highly desired to be utilized simultaneously in the earlier stage path planners mainly focused on gpp approaches whereby heuristic algorithms were popularly employed in hart et al 1972 a formal mathematical framework including a method has been established to minimize path costs it should be noted that the traditional a approach is exclusively designed for static environments as a result if the environment happens to change rapidly and or suddenly the global sense path planning approaches like a would become unavailable since re optimization burden definitely requires unexpectedly overlong computation time in this context to solve the foregoing problem various improvements on a method were conducted in the literature in stentz 1995 ferguson and stentz 2006 a dynamic a algorithm with its extensions have been proposed to reduce total planning time by re planning accurate path at arbitrary position by using a modified a method in ammar et al 2016 phanthong et al 2014 gpp problem of a robot was solved by establishing an approximation to the optimal path in terms of decreasing computation time the modified a algorithm constructed another version without visiting any cell more than once however the vehicle cannot consider real world environments which may include unknown static dynamic obstacles in phanthong et al 2014 an a based algorithm has been used to compute near optimal paths considering underwater obstacles in ocean environments however the heuristic methods were mainly responsible for planning path in global or static environments excluding local planning if there is no crashworthiness pawlus et al 2013 the vehicle is likely to be damaged hence global approaches like a and its variants are unsuitable for ca and rc in the literature a series of dynamic local path planning algorithms including genetic algorithm kim et al 2017 kanakakis and tsourveloudis 2007 leigh et al 2007 tanakikorn et al 2014 ant colony optimization vinay and sridharan 2012 chen et al 2013 wu et al 2016a and particle swarm optimization roberge et al 2013 li et al 2006 have been proposed it should be noted that foregoing evolutionary algorithms did not consider suboptimal problems and thereby resulting that the optimization of path length and the convergence and consistency cannot be guaranteed alternatively the artificial potential field apf method khatib 1986 can characterize the influence of obstacles and target points in real time by generating a potential field including the repulsive and attractive forces hence successive path points can be rapidly determined by the apf algorithm which might be regarded as a potential tool to solve local optimization of path planning for a usv variants of the apf in wu et al 2016b pan et al 2014 li et al 2016 kim et al 2016 min et al 2015 sethian 1996 garrido et al 2006 wang et al 2018c 2018d zhou et al 2018 liu and bucknall 2015 2017 song et al 2017 richards and how 2002 liu et al 2017 have also been proposed to address dynamic obstacles avoidance however the vital drawback i e local minimum pertaining to the apf inevitably renders the vehicle stagnant or trapped recently the fast marching method fmm sethian 1996 was proposed to artificially simulate the propagation process of an electromagnetic wave that starts from the original point basically the farther away from the original point the higher the potential value in this context the original point of propagation can be set as the goal point such that there exists only one minimum locating at the goal in garrido et al 2006 the fmm has been used to obtain the path with characteristics of speed and reliability in wang et al 2018c an fmm based path planning scheme between two points has been developed with an additional minimization step a multi player differential problem called reach avoid game in zhou et al 2018 has been solved by deploying the fmm in liu and bucknall 2017 a safety parameter has been introduced into the fmm so that ca capability can be ensured in a constrained environment in song et al 2017 liu and bucknall 2015 path planning for a usv in practical environments has also been proposed by modifying the fmm however the generated paths can only guarantee sub optimal solutions furthermore considering vehicle dynamics and or constraints a trajectory rather than a path is highly required to be planned in the literature dynamic constraints in known environments have been addressed in richards and how 2002 a cooperative planning scheme for multiple aircrafts with ca has been developed a trajectory planning method for parking has been devised in liu et al 2017 whereby vehicle dynamic constraints can be matched it should be noted that these aforementioned algorithms neglected stochastic uncertainties and dynamic constrains in complex environments actually complex uncertainties and or unknown dynamics wang et al 2018d 2018e are highly desired to be addressed in practice in park et al 2018 the stochastic environmental dynamics were modeled by gaussian distributions in shin and mckay 1986 a solution to minimizing the cost along a geometric path has been provided by using the dynamic programming for autonomous underwater vehicle path planning a planning algorithm which includes terrain dynamic matching algorithm search length min length cost function dynamic path planning and second goal point algorithm was proposed based on a algorithm in li et al 2017a in li et al 2017b an improved terrain correlation correction method is proposed to correct the inertial navigation system error of the prior marine map however foregoing algorithms cannot capture complex marine environments including reefs and dynamic obstacles in this context a promising path planning scheme which can address complex environments covering both surface and reefs is highly desirable to be specific both rc and ca under complex marine environments with coastal and or dynamic obstacles should be handled simultaneously in this paper we focus on an unresolved problem that in the presence of static obstacles dynamic obstacles and reefs the ca and rc are addressed based on the gpp with fmm by defining a series of functions the entire mpp is formulated in a path planning scheme consisting of backbone layer ca layer and rc layer in the complex environments including both coastal and surface constraints in order to avoid dynamic obstacle an auxiliary system for optimizing original ca path is designed to minimize its yaw cost the coastal environments is built to exactly estimate influence range of reefs by poisson distribution in combination with gpp by fmm the novel multilayer path planner mpp are eventually presented unlike previous approaches the proposed path planning scheme not only estimates special environments but also generates suitable path for a usv the rest of this paper is organized as follow in section 2 preliminaries and problem formulation are briefly described in section 3 the proposed multilayer path planning scheme of usv path planner is developed by addressing not only gpp but also ca and rc in the complex marine environments simulation results in the complex environments are presented in section 4 the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 problem formulation this paper describes the complex marine environments ω x including both marine surface domain ω 1 and coastal domain ω 2 where x x y represents the position in ω x the illustration of the complex marine environments is shown in fig 1 the marine surface domain ω 1 has two kinds of obstacles 1 ω 1 ω m o v a b l e ω s t a t i c ω d y n a m i c t d where ω m o v a b l e is the movable space for the usv ω s t a t i c represents the domain of the static obstacles that need to be globally path planned on ω m o v a b l e ω d y n a m i c corresponds to dynamic obstacles which are the objects of collision avoidance ca while the t d is the moment when dynamic obstacle appear in addition as shown in fig 2 an orange area of the usv with safety radius r is expected to be strictly inviolable during path planning to be specific this safety area with r is determined by 2 c r t s i s i ω d y n a m i c t d r where s i s i x s i y t represents the position of the usv at the ith moment when the dynamic obstacle enters this area the usv begins to avoid collision meanwhile the energy consumption e c a of c a action is derived from the yaw ψ i changing in order to save the energy of the usv e c a should have a maximum limit as follows 3 c φ e c a e c a e m a x where e m a x is the maximum energy consumption of the c a path the coastal domain ω 2 can be partitioned as 4 ω 2 ω i n l a n d ω r e e f t where ω i n l a n d is a compact set representing the inland space in which the usv can not move while ω r e e f t corresponds to reefs whose uncertain influence ranges θ are randomly varied by water levels w changing to be specific the coastal constraints is determined by 5 c r t ω r e e f t θ s c d e w t where s c d e is the stochastic dynamic coastal environments scde model within the water level w t and the t is the moment when the usv detects the w and performs route correction rc in this domain in this context given a p r i o r i knowledge on these constraints c u m which not allows a usv to move in domain ω u m consisting of ω i n l a n d and ω s t a t i c together with movable conditions c m on the sea surface 6 c u m ω u n m o v a b l e f ω i n l a n d ω s t a t i c 0 7 c m ω m o v a b l e f ω m o v a b l e 1 where f is appropriate function reflecting the degree of mobility in these constraints and or conditions 0 and 1 represent completely unmovable and movable respectively the aim of this paper is to design the mpp for the usv in foregoing complex marine environments with these c respectively such that g p p c a and r c in terms of length safety and efficiency e t c have good results within the problem domains 8 c u m c m g p p c u m c m c r c φ c a c u m c m c r r c 3 multilayer path planning scheme in this section a multilayer path planning scheme is created by both design marine environments and searching paths simultaneously and thereby facilitating the implementation of each layer s function solving the above problem domains 3 1 backbone layer 3 1 1 global division in order to divide the movable and unmovable domains i e ω u n m o v a b l e and ω m o v a b l e within the whole map domain ω x the gray scale map m g g x y is obtained by gray processing the original color map m o r x y g x y b x y from the camera on the usv to be specific a gray scale map m g g x y can be characterized as follows 9 g x y ω 1 r x y ω 2 g x y ω 3 b x y where r g and b are the degree of the red green and blue respectively ω is the weight of these colors defined by the weighted average method to initialize the graysacle of the map in addition there are two initialization cluster centers μ 1 and μ 2 of groups g 1 and g 2 10 g g 1 μ 1 g 2 μ 2 and the final cluster centers μ are obtained by refining iteratively with k means clustering algorithm the objective function is expressed as follows 11 μ 1 μ 2 arg min μ i 2 g x y g i g x y μ i in order to clearly partition c m and c u m we set the gray value of c m and c u m to 255 and 0 respectively 12 g x y 0 g x y δ 255 g x y δ where δ is a threshold that equal to μ 1 μ 2 2 combined with eqs 6 7 and 12 as follows 13 c u m ω u n m o v a b l e f 0 g x y 0 c m ω m o v a b l e f 1 g x y 255 3 1 2 global path planning in this section the traditional fmm is the main method used to generate global path under the static constraints c m u m the fmm is a level set method that was first proposed by sethian to solve the eikonal equation which simulates the propagation of the surface the eikonal equation of domain ω x can be formed as 14 t x y f x y v x y 1 where t represents the arrival time which indicates the distance to the start point v represents the propagation speed in ω x and f is obtained by eq 13 the illustration of the fmm is presented in fig 3 where the green area represents domain ω x d x and d y are the horizontal and vertical increments respectively and the orange and blue points are the neighbor points theirs t x and t y are represented as 15 t x min t x d x y t x d x y t y min t x y d y t x y d y the solutions to eq 14 can be written as 16 t x y t x 1 f v x y t y inf t x y t y 1 f v x y t x inf t x y t x d x 2 t x y t y d y 2 f v x y 2 based on above t obtained under c m u m we can generate the global path by applying the gradient descent method gdm this method can compute the gradient of t and generate the optimal global path between goal point and start point by following the direction of gradient the flowchart of the global layer is shown in fig 4 remark 1 during the process of grayscale processing we first use the weighted average method to initialize the grayscale of the map and then optimize the global segmentation result by k means clustering 3 2 collision avoidance layer 3 2 1 original collision avoidance in order to avoid collision under constraints c r fmm is re used when dynamic obstacle appears near the safety area with 17 f ω d y n a m i c t d 1 so that the usv can obtain the original collision avoidance ca path p o c a while moving on the initial path p i n i t thereby preventing the dynamic obstacle from entering the safety area the original ca action is shown in fig 5 where the blue and red usvs are the positions of before and after ca ca point is the moment when the usv begins to avoid collision and the yaw φ i can be determined by 18 φ i arctan s i 1 y s i y s i 1 x s i x 3 2 2 path smoothing based on the original ca in fig 5 the yaw cost e c a gets evaluated as follows 19 e c a ε max 0 δ φ i ϕ where ε is the cost parameter and ϕ is the critical of consuming the energy the b spline curve of the new ca is defined by 20 c a n e w η i n d i b i k η τ where η 0 1 and the d are the control points on the p i n i t or p o c a 21 d d 1 d m p i n i t d m 1 d n p o c a b is the normalized b spline basic function as follows 22 b i 0 η τ 0 η τ i η τ i 1 1 τ i η τ i 1 b i k η τ η τ i τ i k τ i b i k 1 η τ τ i k 1 η τ i k 1 τ i b i 1 k 1 η τ d e f i n e 0 0 0 where k is the path smoothness factor and τ is a non decreasing sequence of parameters 0 τ 0 τ 1 τ n k 1 the flowchart of c a layer is shown in fig 6 remark 2 in comparison with the time cost and length cost of the usv the yaw cost is related to the usv motion characteristics extreme maneuvers in yaw would make the planned path infeasible for a usv with limited control torque and even render the usv suffer from severe risk of capsizing once the initial collision avoidance path does not satisfy the constraint c φ the b spline method is activated to smooth the original path and thereby rejecting the initial collision avoidance path remark 3 the nondecreasing sequence of parameters τ of the b spline method is the node vector which decides the k order piecewise polynomial in eq 22 in order to rigorously formulate the i t h k order base function b i k η τ we require k 1 nodes τ i τ i 1 τ i k while other nodes are invalid 3 3 routine correction layer 3 3 1 stochastic dynamic coastal environments in the scde w will change around the average water level w l as follows 23 w w l σ w l σ where l is coastal environments parameter called hazard level that obtained by human experience σ denotes the bound of the water level w in order to correct route under constraints c r the poisson distribution is used to evaluate the water level w hence the probability of water level w is 24 p w w l w e w l the s c d e model in c r can be designed by 25 s c d e w θ ω r e e f p w 3 3 2 routine correction based on the scde model in eq 25 we design the ω r e e f as triangle and then use fig 7 to illustrate the cross section of the scde model where l and h are the length and height of the reefs and θ is expressed in length θ can be expressed as 26 θ l h h w we define f ω r e e f in θ as follows 27 f ω r e e f γ θ 0 γ θ where γ is the distance from the nearest ω i n l a n d combined with eqs 13 and 16 the usv can perform r c while moving in the scde with w changing we design the flowchart of the route correction rc layer that can be shown in fig 8 remark 4 the parameter σ is defined as the bound of the water level w since the influence range of the reefs varies with the water level in this context the parameter σ directly affects the scope of navigation of the usv along the coastline in this paper we set the σ as the value of the l remark 5 if the cross section of the reef is irregular it essentially relates to the robust separation between feasible and infeasible areas for path planning as a preliminary idea we may deploy or design a classifier to determine a virtual coastline rather than using the irregular one 4 simulation studies in this section the effectiveness and superiority of the mpp including backbone ca and rc layers will be demonstrated in static or time varying environments that divided by using k means clustering method whereby the principal parameters are set as follows weight ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 3 the low cluster center μ 1 0 and the high cluster center μ 2 255 simulation studies are presented in the following three parts i e the usv gpp using fmm b spline based path smoothing validation and poisson distribution based scde model implementation the mpp scheme have been coded in matlab r2017b version with an intel r core tm i7 6700 3 40 ghz cpu 4 1 global path planning for usv in order to construct the static environments the static marine environments map m o of dalian sea area with 600 600 pixels from the satellite is mainly used in the backbone layer as shown in fig 9 from which we can see that this global environments mainly includes static yachts and inlands etc in ω u n m o v a b l e and sea surface in ω m o v a b l e based on the weight w and μ the simulation results by k means clustering method are shown in fig 10 whereby the static marine environments are distinguished by black and white which are unmovable and movable parts since the unit size of ω is 1 d x and d y are set to 1 whereby the global path with fmm is shown in fig 11 from which we can see that gpp with fmm can make the usv avoid the static obstacles and reach the goal successfully 4 2 collision avoidance based on b spline in order to validate the smooth capability of the developed novel ca we make domain ω d y n a m i c in fig 12 from we can see that there are three static blue obstacles and a green dynamic obstacle note that while the usv is moving the dynamic obstacle is moving along the y axis the time varying environments is shown in fig 13 in addition due to the static and dynamic obstacles are added in this domain we also use k means clustering method to distinguish the position of the static obstacles and the dynamic obstacles the design parameters are chosen as follows r 16 e m a x 8 η 0 05 and ϕ 0 04 the fmm based original ca is illustrated by fig 14 whereby the initial yaw φ i are shown in fig 15 by eq 18 as can be seen from the above figure at ca point where occur to avoid collision φ i has a sudden step from 0 6150 to 1 5143 that e c a does not satisfy the constraint c φ for smoothing this path we set three control points on p i n i t and four control points on p o c a and then use the b spline to generate the new ca path p n c a here p o c a and p n c a are shown in fig 16 whereby the comparison results of the φ i and e c a with the old and new methods are shown in figs 17 18 from which we can see that the new method allows the usv to move a distance on p i n i t and gradually towards to p o c a instead of directly making a turning action at the ca point in other word p n c a is not only safer but also smoother 4 3 route correction using scde in order to compare the influence ranges θ of the hazard level l in scde l are chosen to equal to 5 10 15 20 and the parameters of ω r e e f are chosen as follows h 10 and l 20 which are based on environmental factors and human experience in dalian sea area the simulation results which display θ in scde are shown in fig 19 from which we can see that there are twice changes of w for each l the higher the l the less the w l and the higher the w the less the θ during usv moving in ω r e e f each change of w leads the usv to correct route so that it can move safely fig 20 shows the rc for each l 5 conclusion in this paper a multilayer path planning mpp scheme has been proposed the essence of the mpp scheme is able to collaboratively address gpp ca and rc in the complex marine environment for the usv within a uniformly integrated framework the marine environments have been characterized by k means clustering method such that global path can be feasibly generated with the aid of the fmm in the backbone layer by employing the b spline method a new ca algorithm has been developed to smooth the original collision avoidance p o c a with a lower yaw cost in the ca layer using poisson distribution a stochastic dynamic coastal environments sdce model has been derived to generate a series of real time rc such that the planned path is safe enough around the reefs in the rc layer simulation results and comparisons have demonstrated that the entire mpp scheme has remarkable path planning

facilitating the implementation of each layer s function solving the above problem domains 3 1 backbone layer 3 1 1 global division in order to divide the movable and unmovable domains i e ω u n m o v a b l e and ω m o v a b l e within the whole map domain ω x the gray scale map m g g x y is obtained by gray processing the original color map m o r x y g x y b x y from the camera on the usv to be specific a gray scale map m g g x y can be characterized as follows 9 g x y ω 1 r x y ω 2 g x y ω 3 b x y where r g and b are the degree of the red green and blue respectively ω is the weight of these colors defined by the weighted average method to initialize the graysacle of the map in addition there are two initialization cluster centers μ 1 and μ 2 of groups g 1 and g 2 10 g g 1 μ 1 g 2 μ 2 and the final cluster centers μ are obtained by refining iteratively with k means clustering algorithm the objective function is expressed as follows 11 μ 1 μ 2 arg min μ i 2 g x y g i g x y μ i in order to clearly partition c m and c u m we set the gray value of c m and c u m to 255 and 0 respectively 12 g x y 0 g x y δ 255 g x y δ where δ is a threshold that equal to μ 1 μ 2 2 combined with eqs 6 7

path under the static constraints c m u m the fmm is a level set method that was first proposed by sethian to solve the eikonal equation which simulates the propagation of the surface the eikonal equation of domain ω x can be formed as 14 t x y f x y v x y 1 where t represents the arrival time which indicates the distance to the start point v represents the propagation speed in ω x and f is obtained by eq 13 the illustration of the fmm is presented in fig 3 where the green area represents domain ω x d x and d y are the horizontal and vertical increments respectively and the orange and blue points are the neighbor points theirs t x and t y are represented as 15 t x min t x d x y t x d x y t y min t x y d y t x y d y the solutions to eq 14 can be written as 16 t x y t x 1 f v x y t y inf t x y t y 1 f v x y t x inf t x y t x d x 2 t x y t y d y 2 f v x y 2 based on above t obtained under c m u m we can generate the global path by applying the gradient descent method gdm this method can compute the gradient of t and generate the optimal global path between goal point and start point by following the direction of gradient the flowchart of the global layer is shown in fig 4 remark 1 during the process of grayscale processing we first use the weighted average method to initialize the grayscale of the map and then optimize the global segmentation result by k means clustering 3 2 collision avoidance layer 3 2 1 original collision avoidance in order to avoid collision under constraints c r fmm is re used when dynamic obstacle appears near the safety area with 17 f ω d y n a m i c t d 1 so that the usv can obtain the original collision avoidance ca path p o c a while moving on the initial path p i n i t thereby preventing the dynamic obstacle from entering the safety area the original ca action is shown in fig 5 where the blue and red usvs are the positions of before and after ca ca point is the moment when the usv begins to avoid collision and the yaw φ i can be determined by 18 φ i arctan s i 1 y s i y s i 1 x s i x 3 2 2 path smoothing based on the original ca in fig 5 the yaw cost e c a gets evaluated as follows 19 e c a ε max 0 δ φ i ϕ where ε is the cost parameter and ϕ is the critical of consuming the energy the b spline curve of the new ca is defined by 20 c a n e w η i n d i b i k η τ where η 0 1 and the d are the control points on the p i n i t or p o c a 21 d d 1 d m p i n i t d m 1 d n p o c a b is the normalized b spline basic function as follows 22 b i 0 η τ 0 η τ i η τ i 1 1 τ i η τ i 1 b i k η τ η τ i τ i k τ i b i k 1 η τ τ i k 1 η τ i k 1 τ i b i 1 k 1 η τ d e f i n e 0 0 0 where k is the path smoothness factor and τ is a non decreasing sequence of parameters 0 τ 0 τ 1 τ n k 1 the flowchart of c a layer is shown in fig 6 remark 2 in comparison with the time cost and length cost of the usv the yaw cost is related to the usv motion characteristics extreme maneuvers in yaw would make the planned path infeasible for a usv with limited control torque and even render the usv suffer from severe risk of capsizing once the initial collision avoidance path does not satisfy the constraint c φ the b spline method is activated to smooth the original path and thereby rejecting the initial collision avoidance path remark 3 the nondecreasing sequence of parameters τ of the b spline method is the node vector which decides the k order piecewise polynomial in eq 22 in order to rigorously formulate the i t h k order base function b i k η τ we require k 1 nodes τ i τ i 1 τ i k while other nodes are invalid 3 3 routine correction layer 3 3 1 stochastic dynamic coastal environments in the scde w will change around the average water level w l as follows 23 w w l σ w l σ where l is coastal environments parameter called hazard level that obtained by human experience σ denotes the bound of the water level w in order to correct route under constraints c r the poisson distribution is used to evaluate the water level w hence the probability of water level w is 24 p w w l w e w l the s c d e model in c r can be designed by 25 s c d e w θ ω r e e f p w 3 3 2 routine correction based on the scde model in eq 25 we design the ω r e e f as triangle and then use fig 7 to illustrate the cross section of the scde model where l and h are the length and height of the reefs and θ is expressed in length θ can be expressed as 26 θ l h h w we define f ω r e e f in θ as follows 27 f ω r e e f γ θ 0 γ θ where γ is the distance from the nearest ω i n l a n d combined with eqs 13 and 16 the usv can perform r c while moving in the scde with w changing we design the flowchart of the route correction rc layer that can be shown in fig 8 remark 4 the parameter σ is defined as the bound of the water level w since the influence range of the reefs varies with the water level in this context the parameter σ directly affects the scope of navigation of the usv along the coastline in this paper we set the σ as the value of the l remark 5 if the cross section of the reef is irregular it essentially relates to the robust separation between feasible and infeasible areas for path planning as a preliminary idea we may deploy or design a classifier to determine a virtual coastline rather than using the irregular one 4 simulation studies in this section the effectiveness and superiority of the mpp including backbone ca and rc layers will be demonstrated in static or time varying environments that divided by using k means clustering method whereby the principal parameters are set as follows weight ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 1 3 the low cluster center μ 1 0 and the high cluster center μ 2 255 simulation studies are presented in the following three parts i e the usv gpp using fmm b spline based path smoothing validation and poisson distribution based scde model implementation the mpp scheme have been coded in matlab r2017b version with an intel r core tm i7 6700 3 40 ghz cpu 4 1 global path planning for usv in order to construct the static environments the static marine environments map m o of dalian sea area with 600 600 pixels from the satellite is mainly used in the backbone layer as shown in fig 9 from which we can see that this global environments mainly includes static yachts and inlands etc in ω u n m o v a b l e and sea surface in ω m o v a b l e based on the weight w and μ the simulation results by k means clustering method are shown in fig 10 whereby the static marine environments are distinguished by black and white which are unmovable and movable parts since the unit size of ω is 1 d x and d y are set to 1 whereby the global path with fmm is shown in fig 11 from which we can see that gpp with fmm can make the usv avoid the static obstacles and reach the goal successfully 4 2 collision avoidance based on b spline in order to validate the smooth capability of the developed novel ca we make domain ω d y n a m i c in fig 12 from we can see that there are three static blue obstacles and a green dynamic obstacle note that while the usv is moving the dynamic obstacle is moving along the y axis the time varying environments is shown in fig 13 in addition due to the static and dynamic obstacles are added in this domain we also use k means clustering method to distinguish the position of the static obstacles and the dynamic obstacles the design parameters are chosen as follows r 16 e m a x 8 η 0 05 and ϕ 0 04 the fmm based original ca is illustrated by fig 14 whereby the initial yaw φ i are shown in fig 15 by eq 18 as can be seen from the above figure at ca point where occur to avoid collision φ i has a sudden step from 0 6150 to 1 5143 that e c a does not satisfy the constraint c φ for smoothing this path we set three control points on p i n i t and four control points on p o c a and then use the b spline to generate the new ca path p n c a here p o c a and p n c a are shown in fig 16 whereby the comparison results of the φ i and e c a with the old and new methods are shown in figs 17 18 from which we can see that the new method allows the usv to move a distance on p i n i t and gradually towards to p o c a instead of directly making a turning action at the ca point in other word p n c a is not only safer but also smoother 4 3 route correction using scde in order to compare the influence ranges θ of the hazard level l in scde l are chosen to equal to 5 10 15 20 and the parameters of ω r e e f are chosen as follows h 10 and l 20 which are based on environmental factors and human experience in dalian sea area the simulation results which display θ in scde are shown in fig 19 from which we can see that there are twice changes of w for each l the higher the l the less the w l and the higher the w the less the θ during usv moving in ω r e e f each change of w leads the usv to correct route so that it can move safely fig 20 shows the rc for each l 5 conclusion in this paper a multilayer path planning mpp scheme has been proposed the essence of the mpp scheme is able to collaboratively address gpp ca and rc in the complex marine environment for the usv within a uniformly integrated framework the marine environments have been characterized by k means clustering method such that global path can be feasibly generated with the aid of the fmm in the backbone layer by employing the b spline method a new ca algorithm has been developed to smooth the original collision avoidance p o c a with a lower yaw cost in the ca layer using poisson distribution a stochastic dynamic coastal environments sdce model has been derived to generate a series of real time rc such that the planned path is safe enough around the reefs in the rc layer simulation results and comparisons have demonstrated that the entire mpp scheme has remarkable path planning

22726,design optimization is crucial as offshore structures are exposed to deeper and harsher marine conditions the structure behaviour is dependent on several joint environmental parameters wind wave currents etc environmental contours are useful representations to provide multivariate design conditions however these contours may lead to different design points depending on the method used to compute them and thus may be misleading to structural engineer in this work we propose to use a response meta model for the inter comparison of some state of the art methods available for modelling multivariate extremes in order to provide a straightforward methodology focusing on the derivation of three dimensional contours the considered case study focuses on the tension in a mooring line of a semi submersible platform in a first step the key met ocean parameters and the associated load model of the tension in the mooring line are set up several multivariate extreme analysis methods are then applied to derive the environmental contours these methods are chosen in order to cover all the possible dependence cases from extremal dependence to extremal independence conditional extreme and several extreme value dependence function models are investigated the physical space huseby contouring method is used to derive environmental surface a comparison with the extreme load extrapolated from the meta model is provided to assess the performance of each method keywords multivariate extreme value modelling environmental contours pot joint probability distribution sea state engineering design 1 introduction the emergence of floating wind turbines requires an updated design methodology for assessing the environmental conditions these devices are exposed to the joint loads of wind wave and currents not only their intensities but their direction and also the wave frequency influence the design of floating structures the calculation of the met ocean extreme values should take into account the dependency between atmospheric and oceanic processes by studying examples of existing offshore structure in harsh environments our final goal is to refine extreme multivariate analysis in order to reduce the costs and increase the reliability of the floating structures the mulanr multivariate analysis methodology in function of the response project see pineau et al 2018 for more details was launched to get more insight into the state of the art methods available for modelling multivariate extremes in the aim of better identifying which combinations of environmental variables raises extreme responses many approaches exist to estimate the extreme environment and the related structure response design point a procedure called response based is based on a numerical model of a structure and may be difficult to apply to complex structures whom behaviour relies complex interactions with the sea state the alternative response independent approach is based on constructing the centennial sea state for the parameters which is the hyper surface of equal probability of being exceeded on average once every one hundred years then the maximum of the response of the structure is computed on this hyper surface by the use of a response meta model see e g huseby et al 2015 for a definition of such curves and ewans and jonathan 2014 for more precise thoughts about response based and response independent methods the main objective of this study is to inter compare by the mean of a response meta model the techniques to derive 3 d environmental contours since most of structure numerical models computation are time consuming alternative meta models should be simple and fast running formula linking the met ocean variables to the response the met ocean parameters to be considered in offshore design include wind speed w s current speed c s significant wave height h s and peak period t p of one or more wave systems as well as the directions of all these components see table 1 for a description of the environmental variables considered in this study the building of an environmental joint contour consists in two steps i the statistical dependence modelling and ii the contouring method among the dependence modelling a perfect dependence hypothesis is compared to several investigated conditional models the gaussian copula a k a nataf method families of extreme value dependence functions copula including logistic model gumbel copula and the conditional extreme model of heffernan and tawn 2004 then we applied the huseby huseby et al 2015 contouring methods which calculates directly the contour in the physical space from monte carlo simulations the work of huseby has been here extended to 3 d but extension to higher dimensions is straightforward the maximum tension in a mooring line of a semi submersible in north sea is considered as an application case for the comparisons of the joint extreme approaches the introduction of statistical models of structures provides a novel approach to compare extreme values of responses which are not easily accessible related work on the construction of contours taking into account the directionality in the 2d case can be found in pineau et al 2018 along with comparison if the huseby method to the more classical i form winterstein et al 1993 the first section of this article presents the building of the tension meta model then the met ocean components of the extreme environment at site are described a methodology part reviews the extreme value modelling techniques both univariate and multivariate considered in this study and the contouring procedure the obtained numerical results are presented and inter compared and some key findings are highlighted 2 meta model for the mooring line tension the gjøa semi submersible is operating on gjøa field an oil and gas field located 40 km west offshore norway 100 km north of bergen the field lies in water depths ranging from 360 to 380 m the semi submersible design is a ring pontoon type of structure with four columns fig 1 the mooring system features 16 mooring lines arranged in clusters of 4 the empirical meta model aims at representing the relationship between the environment wave wind and current and the tension in a mooring line it is fitted on the in situ measurements of the environment and of the response of the structure the waves and current have been measured by a miros radar the significant wave height h s wind speed w s and current speed c s and the corresponding directions are used the tensions in the 16 mooring lines are sampled at 1 hz 28 storms between 2011 and 2016 12 h each are selected with h s up to 13 m each 12 h has been split into 20 min sea states the tension considered by the meta model is the maximum tension in one of the mooring lines during a 20 min sea state 2 1 mooring line tension the total tension in a mooring line comes from four different contributions a static pretension a quasi static tension a low frequency dynamic tension and a high frequency dynamic tension the decomposition is illustrated on fig 2 on the top 12 h on the bottom a zoom on 10 min of the lf and hf dynamic tensions the pretension is the tension in the mooring which exists in the line when the structure is at rest with no waves wind and current the pretension is supposed constant during all the 28 storms 2000 kn the quasi static tension up to 1000 kn is due to drift forces due to second order wave loads and to wind and current orange line in fig 2 it depends on the h s w s and c s and the corresponding directions and in a certain way on the mean wave frequency the low frequency dynamic tension up to 500 kn is induced by the low frequency horizontal movements of the structure 145 s mainly surge and sway themselves generated by second order low frequency wave loads purple lines in fig 2 it depends on h s not really on the wave direction as sway and surge behaviour are very similar the structure is more or less symmetrical and depends on mean wave frequency and on frequency bandwidth the high frequency dynamic tension up to 800 kn is due to the pitch roll and heave movements of the platform linear platform responses to the wave kinematics green lines in fig 2 it depends on h s not really on the wave direction as the structure is more or less symmetrical and depends on mean wave frequency as the frequency information of waves is not available to the project the meta model is constructed considering only h s w s and c s and the corresponding directions 2 2 estimation of the meta model parameters on each 20 min sea state we first calculate h s wind and current mean speeds and the corresponding mean directions then a fourier band pass filtering separates the tension components then the mean quasi static tension standard deviation and maximum of lf and hf tensions are calculated the parameters of the following models are estimated by a least square method 2 2 1 quasi static tension in one part the drift forces are proportional to the square of the amplitude of the environmental loadings and in another part the structure is approximately symmetrical in the direction of the mooring line considered which is 225 then the model for the quasi static tension is taken as 1 t q s α h h s 2 cos d m sin d m α w w s 2 cos w dir sin w dir α c c s 2 cos c dir sin c dir 2 2 2 lf dynamic tension as a second order effect the standard deviation of the lf tension is related to the square of the h s and as told previously independent of the wave direction as the behaviour of the mooring line is modified by the quasi static tension this tension has also been introduced in the meta model the model for σ l f the standard deviation of the lf tension is then 2 σ l f a l f h s 2 b l f t q s t q s 2 2 3 hf dynamic tension the standard deviation of the hf tension is mainly proportional to h s and as told previously independent of the wave direction as the behaviour of the mooring line is modified by the quasi static and lf dynamic tensions these tensions have also been introduced in the meta model the model for σ h f the standard deviation of the hf tension is then 3 σ h f a h f h s b h f h s 3 c h f t q s t q s d h f σ l f 2 2 2 4 relation between standard deviation and 20 min maximum the statistical distribution of the maximum value of a random process on a duration d tends when d is large under some restrictive hypotheses to a gev generalized extreme value distribution see coles 2001 a particular case of this distribution is the gumbel distribution we have fitted this distribution on the empirical distributions of the normalized 20 min maxima of lf and hf dynamic tensions for example for the hf tension the distribution has the form 4 p t h f m a x σ h f r exp exp r μ h f β h f where t h f m a x is the 20 min maximum hf tension σ h f the standard deviation of the hf dynamic tension μ h f and β h f respectively the mode and the scale parameter of the gumbel distribution the fittings were very good as shown in fig 3 for the lf tension the quality is the same for hf tension the value of the maximum that we will consider could be the most probable value or a higher quantile for a good fit with the measurements we have chosen r h f 75 the quantile 75 defined by eq 4 and 5 p t h f m a x σ h f r h f 75 0 75 2 3 meta model the meta model for the maximum tension is constructed from eqs 1 5 with t p r e the pretension 6 t m a x t p r e t q s r l f 75 σ l f r h f 75 σ h f the appropriateness of the model to the measurements is shown in fig 4 which compares the total maximum tension measured in the mooring line to the value given by the meta model eq 6 3 environmental dataset 3 1 available data as explained before the meta model is constructed from in situ measurements although for practical applications of structural design such data are not available it is of common practice for structural design to rely on hindcast databases see e g savory 2013 hindcast databases are based on numerical models and hence are available on a regular time step over a fine spatial grid in many regions of the world the ifremer iowaga wave database see rascle and ardhuin 2013 which is a recently developed model that provides accurate estimation of waves based on wavewatch iii has been used to provide long time series of h s the wind from the ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 reanalysis dataset is used as forcing of the numerical wave model and is also used here for wind time series the global hycom reanalysis cummings 2006 is used for estimation of currents no circulation model forced by ncep cfsr in north sea was available for this work hycom was chosen for the availability of 3 hourly surface current speed over a long period from 1993 the concomitant use of three databases used for metocean environment provide a consistent hourly dataset see e g ailliot et al 2011 thus the simultaneous use of these hindcasts is relevant for combining their independent physical effects on offshore structures for each dataset we used the nearest neighbour to the semi submersible location the resulting database spans from 1st january 1993 to 31st december 2015 with a hourly time step the sea state is described by 8 parameters detailed in table 1 since the platform is almost symmetric hence not very sensitive to the directionality only the mean direction is considered for each variable e g the mean of h s cos d m h s sin d m for significant wave height the marginal and bivariate distributions of the four environmental variables can be seen in fig 5 along with a kernel density estimation concerning the instantaneous distributions of the variables one can clearly see the dependency between strong h s and strong w s between strong w s and strong c s on the other hand the extremal dependency between h s and c s is less obvious with high wave values occurring whatever the value of the current concerning the tension in the mooring lines one clearly sees the impact of wind and waves and that the effect of the current is less important this plot also points out that the marginal distribution of the tension has heavier tail that any of the other environmental parameters 3 2 data analysis before going into the core of the methodology a more precise insight into the data is provided in fig 6 this figure presents an extract of the full dataset during january 2003 where two important events of tension in the mooring lines can be observed first in the upper left corner one can see the time series of the tension in a mooring line and the corresponding environmental forcings in the other plots h s in the upper left w s in the bottom left and c s in the bottom right plot two vertical lines are superimposed on the plot corresponding to extreme tensions the left one in yellow corresponds to an extreme in the tension caused by conjunction of high wave height and strong wind none of them being at its maximum as it can be seen from the plot the h s is still increasing while the wind is decreasing the right line in green corresponds to an extreme in the tension caused by a strong current associated with strong wind while the significant wave height is not so important about 6 m the plot emphasizes the need for a joint modelling of the simultaneous distribution of the environmental parameters because the joint occurrences of the different conditions leading to extreme response need to be quantified precisely this will be the point of the following section 4 methodology 4 1 extreme values modelling 4 1 1 univariate modelling as stated in the description of the data since we deal with time series with a time step small compared to the usual duration of storms we need to retain only the maximal value within each storm before fitting an extreme model this is done with the run length method see ferro and segers 2003 in which we define a cluster as the consecutive values exceeding a storm threshold u s and allowing the process to be under this threshold for some time d s if two clusters are separated from less that d s time steps they are considered as only one cluster then one takes the maximum value within each cluster we thus obtain a sample of cluster maxima x x 1 x n s where n s is the number of clusters or storms this method is called the run length approach see coles 2001 following classical arguments see e g coles 2001 one can assume that for a given sufficiently high threshold u gpd the distribution of x i conditionally on being above the threshold u gpd follows a generalized pareto distribution gpd with parameters σ 0 and ξ r best described by its cumulative distribution function cdf p x x x u gpd 1 1 ξ x u s σ 1 ξ with z max z 0 we have chosen to estimate the parameters of the gpd through a maximum likelihood method results are shown in table 2 we have two parameters to fix here u s and u gpd they are respectively fixed as the 97 5 quantile and the 99 quantile of the original dataset only the second one is reported since it impacts the estimated parameters the duration d s separating two clusters has been fixed to 48 h we also checked not shown here that these values correspond to sensible choices by using the classical tools such as residual life plot the stability of estimates above the threshold and the validity of the poisson process hypothesis for threshold excesses using the dispersion index plot cunnane 1979 it can be seen from this table that the estimated shape parameter is positive only for the tension in the mooring lines which is in accordance with the discussion of fig 5 and corresponds to a larger tail than the ones of the environmental variables in fig 7 we show the return level plots for each variable each plot contains both the data blue dots the fitted models solid black lines and the corresponding confidence intervals computed using the delta method dotted lines it can be seen that the adjustment is very good for every variable and that the threshold used to fit the models is rather good the 100 year return level reported in table 2 for the tension is the reference value which would not be available for designing a new structure hence our objective is to propose a method for deriving this value from the environmental data and from the knowledge of the meta model 4 1 2 joint extreme values modelling as stated in section 2 the structure is sensitive to three intensity variables meaning that the joint extremal structure of the environmental variables is needed in order to be able to compute extreme responses of the structure indeed it is quite straightforward to guess that taking the three 100 year return levels simultaneously in the meta model called perfect dependence in the following would lead to over estimating the centennial return level for the tension which is confirmed by the corresponding row in table 3 hence the need for joint modelling of extreme is crucial and some different models will be studied here in the 2d case the standards and guidelines written by dnv gl and iec give some recommendations in the use of conditional laws for instance the log normal model is recommended for t p given h s and for h s conditional on wind speed gallop et al 2013 the 2 parameter weibull law is recommended for wind speed conditional on h s in north sea dnv 2010 to our knowledge such recommendations do not exist for more than two variables from a statistical point of view these models are fitted to the bulk of the distribution and hence may not be well suited for extreme values moreover parametric models chosen to link the parameters of the distribution depending on the conditioning variable value are difficult to address which may lead to misestimation of the true 100 year sea state in the sequel we will focus on classical models that are able to deal with arbitrary dimensions more precisely let assume that our observations are the sample of cluster maxima for which at least one component is extreme x x 1 x d a vector of r d with gpd margins f i where f i is a gpd distribution with parameters σ i ξ i then the methods studied are the following independence the components of x are assumed to be independent hence its p d f is just the product of the f i which is a non conservative approach perfect dependence in this case it is assumed that each return level occurs simultaneously which is obviously conservative in practice it is usual to use for example the 100 year return level for waves and wind coupled with the 20 year return level for current without theoretical justification modified nataf transform the vector x is transformed to standard normally distributed marginals and then one assumes that this vector is a gaussian vector the correlation matrix of the gaussian vector is chosen such that the such that the correlation matrix of the data x is respected this approach is usual in structural safety see e g renard and lang 2010 for more details in this study we modified the standard method to take better into account the tail of the joint distributions the gaussian correlation matrix is estimated such that the correlations between the components of the gaussian vector above the threshold u gpd equals the correlations between the components of the data above the same quantile ratio logistic dependence function x is transformed to a frećhet scale vector z z 1 z d with z i 1 log f i x i its d dimensional distribution function is taken to be g z 1 z n exp v z 1 z n where v z 1 z 2 z 1 1 α z 2 1 α α α 0 1 this functional form is called logistic dependence and can be extended to allowing asymmetry between the variables the estimation has been carried out using a censored likelihood approach see e g raillard et al 2014 for more details conditional extremes this approach also referred to as heffernan tawn model is a rather new and flexible semi parametric approach to extremal dependence modelling more precisely a non linear regression model fitted on each marginal of z and assuming z i z i a i i z i z i b i i ε i i for z i ν and z i z i where z i if the vector of all variables excluding z i a i i 0 1 and b i i 1 are parameters of the fitted regression model ν is a dependence threshold above which the model is fitted and ε i i are i i d with normal distribution n μ i i σ i i with the latter parameters μ i i σ i i estimated from using maximum likelihood for more details one can refer to gallop et al 2013 it could have been interesting to study other dependence structure especially non symmetric dependence functions however such a systematic study was beyond the scope of this project which was to propose a clear methodology for extreme value modelling in a multivariate context in addition the study here covers all the possible dependence cases from extremal dependence to extremal independence 4 2 environmental contours here we aim at comparing the response based and response independent approaches based on the simplified meta model presented in section 2 more precisely we use the huseby approach extended in 3d as in vanem 2018 to compute the environmental contours and then the meta model to calculate the response of the structure on this contour as explained before the meta model depends on three intensity parameters significant wave height wind and current speeds and the response was computed on the whole environmental data set with these three parameters next we computed the contours for low levels up to the 98 quantile using the huseby method extended here to the 3 d case the method used is similar to the one developed in although the authors were not aware of the method proposed by vanem when starting the project it can be seen from fig 8 that this method provides good estimates of the true response quantiles the green curve corresponding to the response estimated from the environmental contours lies inside the 95 confidence interval of the response quantiles estimated from the whole time series of responses in the bottom plot of fig 8 the relative error in estimating the response from the environmental contour is presented it can be seen from this plot that the error in estimating high quantiles of the response from environmental contours increases as the quantile increases which is quite sensible because of the paucity of data in the tail this plot emphasizes the need for modelling the tail of the joint distribution of environmental variables in order to obtain accurate estimations of high quantiles of responses an example of a 3d contour is given in fig 9 this plot shows each combination of h s w s and c s that is exceeded with a probability of 0 3 this empirical surface is here rather smooth although such a surface could not be easily obtained for higher quantiles due the paucity of data in the distribution tails once the environmental contour is defined the tension is computed on the whole surface and its maximum value is retained this value is considered to be the 100 year return level and the point at wich this value is maximal is called the design point compared to computing the response over the whole space the model needs only to be computed on a hyper surface of the environmental parameters space 5 comparison of results on extreme tensions in mooring lines in this section we want to compare the aforementioned methods to compute extreme tensions in the mooring lines namely the 100 years return level the results are shown in table 3 for the estimation of the 100 year return level of the tension and in table 4 for associated design points our reference is the return level computed from the meta model which is first line in the table as is can be seen the perfect dependence which is value obtained by assuming that the three 100 year values occur at the same time greatly overestimates the tension the value of 4273 kn corresponds to the 300 year return level of the tension in comparison the two newly introduced methods provide values in accordance with the extreme tension computed for the meta model the 3 d logistic model tends to slightly over estimate the 100 year tension while the conditional method slightly under estimates it this can be explained by the quite rigid structure imposed by the logistic model which forces the three parameters to have a common dependence strength the modified nataf transform also performs very well in this case while it should be noticed that the gaussian copula is in the class of asymptotic independence copula and should thus be used with care in other applications if one compares the design values associated to the return level computed from each method presented in table 4 it can be seen that even if the current speed value is more or less the same the design wind speed and design significant wave height are rather different depending on the method used usually the contours are provided as curves in the plane to allow easier comparison of the methods used here the contours are 3 d surfaces and can be found in fig 10 in the figure one can see in each sub figure the contour derived with the indicated method with blue dots the red dots correspond to the design points i e the point of the surface for which the response computed with the meta model is the highest in each plot is also represented the perfectly dependant case with a grey dot the differences in the dependence structure are stringent in this figure since in the margins are the same for each case here the conditional extreme model seems to be left cut which is caused by the modelling procedure this model tackles the case where at least one component is extreme while the others consider that all the components are above the threshold this figure also emphasizes the dependence of the structure on the h s parameter since the design points are all located along this direction it can be noticed from this plot that the logistic copula leads to a dependence structure that is close to perfect dependence which would be a straight line connecting the origin to the grey dot this might be due to the symmetry imposed by the model since all the variables are exchangeable in the model while the semi parametric model of heffernan tawn suggests that the dependence is stronger between h s and w s than the others extensions of the logistic copula exist but become rapidly intractable as the dimension grows the use of parametric models taking into account asymmetry in the variables is left for future work and one can conclude that the conditional extreme model is able to give very accurate prediction of the extreme level in the case considered here 6 conclusion this paper presented some work achieved during the citeph project mulanr whose objective was to explore new methodologies to ease the design phase of offshore structure first by constructing a meta model of the structure we were able to obtain a time series of synthetic yet realistic response of the structure and by then an estimation of the centennial response this value was then considered as a reference in a response based approach then we compared different classical and new methods to derive environmental contours in a response independent approach which leads in turns to an estimation of the centennial response of the structure which can be compared to the reference obtained previously the key finding in this paper is the versatility of the heffernan tawn model also referred to as conditional extreme model which was found to be efficient in modelling 3 d extremes along with the use of huseby s contouring approach this approach was also found to be efficient for 2 d extremes although it was not shown here an interesting application can be found in gouldby et al 2017 this result is shown for our case study and further investigations are needed for other extremal dependences although the adopted methodology is general enough to be adapted to other structures and locations see pineau et al 2018 for examples e g including directionality as a discrete covariable however this finding is important because it allows to extend the computation of design points above 2d which is usually the case as far as offshore structure are concerned however attention should be paid on the difficulties associated with the threshold choice for this conditional extreme value model but this question is left for future studies the good performance of the modified nataf model gaussian copula can also be pointed out given that this model is not an extreme value copula and the question whether to consider it or not is left for future study acknowledgements this research work

22726,design optimization is crucial as offshore structures are exposed to deeper and harsher marine conditions the structure behaviour is dependent on several joint environmental parameters wind wave currents etc environmental contours are useful representations to provide multivariate design conditions however these contours may lead to different design points depending on the method used to compute them and thus may be misleading to structural engineer in this work we propose to use a response meta model for the inter comparison of some state of the art methods available for modelling multivariate extremes in order to provide a straightforward methodology focusing on the derivation of three dimensional contours the considered case study focuses on the tension in a mooring line of a semi submersible platform in a first step the key met ocean parameters and the associated load model of the tension in the mooring line are set up several multivariate extreme analysis methods are then applied to derive the environmental contours these methods are chosen in order to cover all the possible dependence cases from extremal dependence to extremal independence conditional extreme and several extreme value dependence function models are investigated the physical space huseby contouring method is used to derive environmental surface a comparison with the extreme load extrapolated from the meta model is provided to assess the performance of each method keywords multivariate extreme value modelling environmental contours pot joint probability distribution sea state engineering design 1 introduction the emergence of floating wind turbines requires an updated design methodology for assessing the environmental conditions these devices are exposed to the joint loads of wind wave and currents not only their intensities but their direction and also the wave frequency influence the design of floating structures the calculation of the met ocean extreme values should take into account the dependency between atmospheric and oceanic processes by studying examples of existing offshore structure in harsh environments our final goal is to refine extreme multivariate analysis in order to reduce the costs and increase the reliability of the floating structures the mulanr multivariate analysis methodology in function of the response project see pineau et al 2018 for more details was launched to get more insight into the state of the art methods available for modelling multivariate extremes in the aim of better identifying which combinations of environmental variables raises extreme responses many approaches exist to estimate the extreme environment and the related structure response design point a procedure called response based is based on a numerical model of a structure and may be difficult to apply to complex structures whom behaviour relies complex interactions with the sea state the alternative response independent approach is based on constructing the centennial sea state for the parameters which is the hyper surface of equal probability of being exceeded on average once every one hundred years then the maximum of the response of the structure is computed on this hyper surface by the use of a response meta model see e g huseby et al 2015 for a definition of such curves and ewans and jonathan 2014 for more precise thoughts about response based and response independent methods the main objective of this study is to inter compare by the mean of a response meta model the techniques to derive 3 d environmental contours since most of structure numerical models computation are time consuming alternative meta models should be simple and fast running formula linking the met ocean variables to the response the met ocean parameters to be considered in offshore design include wind speed w s current speed c s significant wave height h s and peak period t p of one or more wave systems as well as the directions of all these components see table 1 for a description of the environmental variables considered in this study the building of an environmental joint contour consists in two steps i the statistical dependence modelling and ii the contouring method among the dependence modelling a perfect dependence hypothesis is compared to several investigated conditional models the gaussian copula a k a nataf method families of extreme value dependence functions copula including logistic model gumbel copula and the conditional extreme model of heffernan and tawn 2004 then we applied the huseby huseby et al 2015 contouring methods which calculates directly the contour in the physical space from monte carlo simulations the work of huseby has been here extended to 3 d but extension to higher dimensions is straightforward the maximum tension in a mooring line of a semi submersible in north sea is considered as an application case for the comparisons of the joint extreme approaches the introduction of statistical models of structures provides a novel approach to compare extreme values of responses which are not easily accessible related work on the construction of contours taking into account the directionality in the 2d case can be found in pineau et al 2018 along with comparison if the huseby method to the more classical i form winterstein et al 1993 the first section of this article presents the building of the tension meta model then the met ocean components of the extreme environment at site are described a methodology part reviews the extreme value modelling techniques both univariate and multivariate considered in this study and the contouring procedure the obtained numerical results are presented and inter compared and some key findings are highlighted 2 meta model for the mooring line tension the gjøa semi submersible is operating on gjøa field an oil and gas field located 40 km west offshore norway 100 km north of bergen the field lies in water depths ranging from 360 to 380 m the semi submersible design is a ring pontoon type of structure with four columns fig 1 the mooring system features 16 mooring lines arranged in clusters of 4 the empirical meta model aims at representing the relationship between the environment wave wind and current and the tension in a mooring line it is fitted on the in situ measurements of the environment and of the response of the structure the waves and current have been measured by a miros radar the significant wave height h s wind speed w s and current speed c s and the corresponding directions are used the tensions in the 16 mooring lines are sampled at 1 hz 28 storms between 2011 and 2016 12 h each are selected with h s up to 13 m each 12 h has been split into 20 min sea states the tension considered by the meta model is the maximum tension in one of the mooring lines during a 20 min sea state 2 1 mooring line tension the total tension in a mooring line comes from four different contributions a static pretension a quasi static tension a low frequency dynamic tension and a high frequency dynamic tension the decomposition is illustrated on fig 2 on the top 12 h on the bottom a zoom on 10 min of the lf and hf dynamic tensions the pretension is the tension in the mooring which exists in the line when the structure is at rest with no waves wind and current the pretension is supposed constant during all the 28 storms 2000 kn the quasi static tension up to 1000 kn is due to drift forces due to second order wave loads and to wind and current orange line in fig 2 it depends on the h s w s and c s and the corresponding directions and in a certain way on the mean wave frequency the low frequency dynamic tension up to 500 kn is induced by the low frequency horizontal movements of the structure 145 s mainly surge and sway themselves generated by second order low frequency wave loads purple lines in fig 2 it depends on h s not really on the wave direction as sway and surge behaviour are very similar the structure is more or less symmetrical and depends on mean wave frequency and on frequency bandwidth the high frequency dynamic tension up to 800 kn is due to the pitch roll and heave movements of the platform linear platform responses to the wave kinematics green lines in fig 2 it depends on h s not really on the wave direction as the structure is more or less symmetrical and depends on mean wave frequency as the frequency information of waves is not available to the project the meta model is constructed considering only h s w s and c s and the corresponding directions 2 2 estimation of the meta model parameters on each 20 min sea state we first calculate h s wind and current mean speeds and the corresponding mean directions then a fourier band pass filtering separates the tension components then the mean quasi static tension standard deviation and maximum of lf and hf tensions are calculated the parameters of the following models are estimated by a least square method 2 2 1 quasi static tension in one part the drift forces are proportional to the square of the amplitude of the environmental loadings and in another part the structure is approximately symmetrical in the direction of the mooring line considered which is 225 then the model for the quasi static tension is taken as 1 t q s α h h s 2 cos d m sin d m α w w s 2 cos w dir sin w dir α c c s 2 cos c dir sin c dir 2 2 2 lf dynamic tension as a second order effect the standard deviation of the lf tension is related to the square of the h s and as told previously independent of the wave direction as the behaviour of the mooring line is modified by the quasi static tension this tension has also been introduced in the meta model the model for σ l f the standard deviation of the lf tension is then 2 σ l f a l f h s 2 b l f t q s t q s 2 2 3 hf dynamic tension the standard deviation of the hf tension is mainly proportional to h s and as told previously independent of the wave direction as the behaviour of the mooring line is modified by the quasi static and lf dynamic tensions these tensions have also been introduced in the meta model the model for σ h f the standard deviation of the hf tension is then 3 σ h f a h f h s b h f h s 3 c h f t q s t q s d h f σ l f 2 2 2 4 relation between standard deviation and 20 min maximum the statistical distribution of the maximum value of a random process on a duration d tends when d is large under some restrictive hypotheses to a gev generalized extreme value distribution see coles 2001 a particular case of this distribution is the gumbel distribution we have fitted this distribution on the empirical distributions of the normalized 20 min maxima of lf and hf dynamic tensions for example for the hf tension the distribution has the form 4 p t h f m a x σ h f r exp exp r μ h f β h f where t h f m a x is the 20 min maximum hf tension σ h f the standard deviation of the hf dynamic tension μ h f and β h f respectively the mode and the scale parameter of the gumbel distribution the fittings were very good as shown in fig 3 for the lf tension the quality is the same for hf tension the value of the maximum that we will consider could be the most probable value or a higher quantile for a good fit with the measurements we have chosen r h f 75 the quantile 75 defined by eq 4 and 5 p t h f m a x σ h f r h f 75 0 75 2 3 meta model the meta model for the maximum tension is constructed from eqs 1 5 with t p r e the pretension 6 t m a x t p r e t q s r l f 75 σ l f r h f 75 σ h f the appropriateness of the model to the measurements is shown in fig 4 which compares the total maximum tension measured in the mooring line to the value given by the meta model eq 6 3 environmental dataset 3 1 available data as explained before the meta model is constructed from in situ measurements although for practical applications of structural design such data are not available it is of common practice for structural design to rely on hindcast databases see e g savory 2013 hindcast databases are based on numerical models and hence are available on a regular time step over a fine spatial grid in many regions of the world the ifremer iowaga wave database see rascle and ardhuin 2013 which is a recently developed model that provides accurate estimation of waves based on wavewatch iii has been used to provide long time series of h s the wind from the ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 reanalysis dataset is used as forcing of the numerical wave model and is also used here for wind time series the global hycom reanalysis cummings 2006 is used for estimation of currents no circulation model forced by ncep cfsr in north sea was available for this work hycom was chosen for the availability of 3 hourly surface current speed over a long period from 1993 the concomitant use of three databases used for metocean environment provide a consistent hourly dataset see e g ailliot et al 2011 thus the simultaneous use of these hindcasts is relevant for combining their independent physical effects on offshore structures for each dataset we used the nearest neighbour to the semi submersible location the resulting database spans from 1st january 1993 to 31st december 2015 with a hourly time step the sea state is described by 8 parameters detailed in table 1 since the platform is almost symmetric hence not very sensitive to the directionality only the mean direction is considered for each variable e g the mean of h s cos d m h s sin d m for significant wave height the marginal and bivariate distributions of the four environmental variables can be seen in fig 5 along with a kernel density estimation concerning the instantaneous distributions of the variables one can clearly see the dependency between strong h s and strong w s between strong w s and strong c s on the other hand the extremal dependency between h s and c s is less obvious with high wave values occurring whatever the value of the current concerning the tension in the mooring lines one clearly sees the impact of wind and waves and that the effect of the current is less important this plot also points out that the marginal distribution of the tension has heavier tail that any of the other environmental parameters 3 2 data analysis before going into the core of the methodology a more precise insight into the data is provided in fig 6 this figure presents an extract of the full dataset during january 2003 where two important events of tension in the mooring lines can be observed first in the upper left corner one can see the time series of the tension in a mooring line and the corresponding environmental forcings in the other plots h s in the upper left w s in the bottom left and c s in the bottom right plot two vertical lines are superimposed on the plot corresponding to extreme tensions the left one in yellow corresponds to an extreme in the tension caused by conjunction of high wave height and strong wind none of them being at its maximum as it can be seen from the plot the h s is still increasing while the wind is decreasing the right line in green corresponds to an extreme in the tension caused by a strong current associated with strong wind while the significant wave height is not so important about 6 m the plot emphasizes the need for a joint modelling of the simultaneous distribution of the environmental parameters because the joint occurrences of the different conditions leading to extreme response need to be quantified precisely this will be the point of the following section 4 methodology 4 1 extreme values modelling 4 1 1 univariate modelling as stated in the description of the data since we deal with time series with a time step small compared to the usual duration of storms we need to retain only the maximal value within each storm before fitting an extreme model this is done with the run length method see ferro and segers 2003 in which we define a cluster as the consecutive values exceeding a storm threshold u s and allowing the process to be under this threshold for some time d s if two clusters are separated from less that d s time steps they are considered as only one cluster then one takes the maximum value within each cluster we thus obtain a sample of cluster maxima x x 1 x n s where n s is the number of clusters or storms this method is called the run length approach see coles 2001 following classical arguments see e g coles 2001 one can assume that for a given sufficiently high threshold u gpd the distribution of x i conditionally on being above the threshold u gpd follows a generalized pareto distribution gpd with parameters σ 0 and ξ r best described by its cumulative distribution function cdf p x x x u gpd 1 1 ξ x u s σ 1 ξ with z max z 0 we have chosen to estimate the parameters of the gpd through a maximum likelihood method results are shown in table 2 we have two parameters to fix here u s and u gpd they are respectively fixed as the 97 5 quantile and the 99 quantile of the original dataset only the second one is reported since it impacts the estimated parameters the duration d s separating two clusters has been fixed to 48 h we also checked not shown here that these values correspond to sensible choices by using the classical tools such as residual life plot the stability of estimates above the threshold and the validity of the poisson process hypothesis for threshold excesses using the dispersion index plot cunnane 1979 it can be seen from this table that the estimated shape parameter is positive only for the tension in the mooring lines which is in accordance with the discussion of fig 5 and corresponds to a larger tail than the ones of the environmental variables in fig 7 we show the return level plots for each variable each plot contains both the data blue dots the fitted models solid black lines and the corresponding confidence intervals computed using the delta method dotted lines it can be seen that the adjustment is very good for every variable and that the threshold used to fit the models is rather good the 100 year return level reported in table 2 for the tension is the reference value which would not be available for designing a new structure hence our objective is to propose a method for deriving this value from the environmental data and from the knowledge of the meta model 4 1 2 joint extreme values modelling as stated in section 2 the structure is sensitive to three intensity variables meaning that the joint extremal structure of the environmental variables is needed in order to be able to compute extreme responses of the structure indeed it is quite straightforward to guess that taking the three 100 year return levels simultaneously in the meta model called perfect dependence in the following would lead to over estimating the centennial return level for the tension which is confirmed by the corresponding row in table 3 hence the need for joint modelling of extreme is crucial and some different models will be studied here in the 2d case the standards and guidelines written by dnv gl and iec give some recommendations in the use of conditional laws for instance the log normal model is recommended for t p given h s and for h s conditional on wind speed gallop et al 2013 the 2 parameter weibull law is recommended for wind speed conditional on h s in north sea dnv 2010 to our knowledge such recommendations do not exist for more than two variables from a statistical point of view these models are fitted to the bulk of the distribution and hence may not be well suited for extreme values moreover parametric models chosen to link the parameters of the distribution depending on the conditioning variable value are difficult to address which may lead to misestimation of the true 100 year sea state in the sequel we will focus on classical models that are able to deal with arbitrary dimensions more precisely let assume that our observations are the sample of cluster maxima for which at least one component is extreme x x 1 x d a vector of r d with gpd margins f i where f i is a gpd distribution with parameters σ i ξ i then the methods studied are the following independence the components of x are assumed to be independent hence its p d f is just the product of the f i which is a non conservative approach perfect dependence in this case it is assumed that each return level occurs simultaneously which is obviously conservative in practice it is usual to use for example the 100 year return level for waves and wind coupled with the 20 year return level for current without theoretical justification modified nataf transform the vector x is transformed to standard normally distributed marginals and then one assumes that this vector is a gaussian vector the correlation matrix of the gaussian vector is chosen such that the such that the correlation matrix of the data x is respected this approach is usual in structural safety see e g renard and lang 2010 for more details in this study we modified the standard method to take better into account the tail of the joint distributions the gaussian correlation matrix is estimated such that the correlations between the components of the gaussian vector above the threshold u gpd equals the correlations between the components of the data above the same quantile ratio logistic dependence function x is transformed to a frećhet scale vector z z 1 z d with z i 1 log f i x i its d dimensional distribution function is taken to be g z 1 z n exp v z 1 z n where v z 1 z 2 z 1 1 α z 2 1 α α α 0 1 this functional form is called logistic dependence and can be extended to allowing asymmetry between the variables the estimation has been carried out using a censored likelihood approach see e g raillard et al 2014 for more details conditional extremes this approach also referred to as heffernan tawn model is a rather new and flexible semi parametric approach to extremal dependence modelling more precisely a non linear regression model fitted on each marginal of z and assuming z i z i a i i z i z i b i i ε i i for z i ν and z i z i where z i if the vector of all variables excluding z i a i i 0 1 and b i i 1 are parameters of the fitted regression model ν is a dependence threshold above which the model is fitted and ε i i are i i d with normal distribution n μ i i σ i i with the latter parameters μ i i σ i i estimated from using maximum likelihood for more details one can refer to gallop et al 2013 it could have been interesting to study other dependence structure especially non symmetric dependence functions however such a systematic study was beyond the scope of this project which was to propose a clear methodology for extreme value modelling in a multivariate context in addition the study here covers all the possible dependence cases from extremal dependence to extremal independence 4 2 environmental contours here we aim at comparing the response based and response independent approaches based on the simplified meta model presented in section 2 more precisely we use the huseby approach extended in 3d as in vanem 2018 to compute the environmental contours and then the meta model to calculate the response of the structure on this contour as explained before the meta model depends on three intensity parameters significant wave height wind and current speeds and the response was computed on the whole environmental data set with these three parameters next we computed the contours for low levels up to the 98 quantile using the huseby method extended here to the 3 d case the method used is similar to the one developed in although the authors were not aware of the method proposed by vanem when starting the project it can be seen from fig 8 that this method provides good estimates of the true response quantiles the green curve corresponding to the response estimated from the environmental contours lies inside the 95 confidence interval of the response quantiles estimated from the whole time series of responses in the bottom plot of fig 8 the relative error in estimating the response from the environmental contour is presented it can be seen from this plot that the error in estimating high quantiles of the response from environmental contours increases as the quantile increases which is quite sensible because of the paucity of data in the tail this plot emphasizes the need for modelling the tail of the joint distribution of environmental variables in order to obtain accurate estimations of high quantiles of responses an example of a 3d contour is given in fig 9 this plot shows each combination of h s w s and c s that is exceeded with a probability of 0 3 this empirical surface is here rather smooth although such a surface could not be easily obtained for higher quantiles due the paucity of data in the distribution tails once the environmental contour is defined the tension is computed on the whole surface and its maximum value is retained this value is considered to be the 100 year return level and the point at wich this value is maximal is called the design point compared to computing the response over the whole space the model needs only to be computed on a hyper surface of the environmental parameters space 5 comparison of results on extreme tensions in mooring lines in this section we want to compare the aforementioned methods to compute extreme tensions in the mooring lines namely the 100 years return level the results are shown in table 3 for the estimation of the 100 year return level of the tension and in table 4 for associated design points our reference is the return level computed from the meta model which is first line in the table as is can be seen the perfect dependence which is value obtained by assuming that the three 100 year values occur at the same time greatly overestimates the tension the value of 4273 kn corresponds to the 300 year return level of the tension in comparison the two newly introduced methods provide values in accordance with the extreme tension computed for the meta model the 3 d logistic model tends to slightly over estimate the 100 year tension while the conditional method slightly under estimates it this can be explained by the quite rigid structure imposed by the logistic model which forces the three parameters to have a common dependence strength the modified nataf transform also performs very well in this case while it should be noticed that the gaussian copula is in the class of asymptotic independence copula and should thus be used with care in other applications if one compares the design values associated to the return level computed from each method presented in table 4 it can be seen that even if the current speed value is more or less the same the design wind speed and design significant wave height are rather different depending on the method used usually the contours are provided as curves in the plane to allow easier comparison of the methods used here the contours are 3 d surfaces and can be found in fig 10 in the figure one can see in each sub figure the contour derived with the indicated method with blue dots the red dots correspond to the design points i e the point of the surface for which the response computed with the meta model is the highest in each plot is also represented the perfectly dependant case with a grey dot the differences in the dependence structure are stringent in this figure since in the margins are the same for each case here the conditional extreme model seems to be left cut which is caused by the modelling procedure this model tackles the case where at least one component is extreme while the others consider that all the components are above the threshold this figure also emphasizes the dependence of the structure on the h s parameter since the design points are all located along this direction it can be noticed from this plot that the logistic copula leads to a dependence structure that is close to perfect dependence which would be a straight line connecting the origin to the grey

22727,jack up rigs are often operated near a permanent jacket platform for offshore gas and petroleum exploitation a reduction in the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent platform piles could occur due to the disturbance of the soil around the footprint created by spudcan penetration and extraction centrifuge model tests were conducted in soft clay to investigate the lateral behaviour of piles

spudcan foundations to provide support in the seabed the spudcan should be penetrated to the depth below mudline required to achieve a bearing capacity sufficient for environmental loads the penetration depth of a spudcan is usually shallow in sand and much deeper in clay and the spudcan may penetrate into the seabed to a depth 2 3 times its diameter to reach equilibrium in soft clayey deposits endley et al 1981 when the jack up rig service is finished in one oil and gas field the spudcan will be extracted from the seabed and then relocated to another oil and gas field because the function of a jack up rig depends on a cantilever beam which has a limited length the jack up has to work near a permanent jacket platform the clearance edge to edge between the spudcan and a pile foundation of the jacket platform is usually within half of the spudcan diameter the society of naval architects and marine engineers sname 2008 and international organization for standardization iso international organization for standardization 2012 suggest that the setup should be analysed in detail if the clearance is within one spudcan diameter unfortunately no specific methods for performing such an analysis are provided in these guidelines in particular in a soft clay seabed a spudcan will penetrate through the deep clay layer and finally rest on a stiff bearing stratum spudcan penetration and extraction have a great influence on adjacent piles the soil around the spudcan is primarily displaced radially outward during penetration while an unloading effect is caused by the back flow of soil during extraction several experimental and numerical studies leung et al 2012 xie 2009 siciliano et al 1990 tho et al 2013 li et al 2015 have been conducted to investigate the effects of spudcan penetration and extraction on adjacent platform piles however these studies focused on only the lateral deformations of adjacent piles due to spudcan pile interactions the lateral pile response is mainly affected by the spudcan pile clearance spudcan penetration spudcan diameter soil stiffness and pile head fixity as a platform pile is loaded laterally the upper part of the pile contributes most to resisting the lateral force more specifically there is a critical depth near the ground surface where the shear force is zero kim et al 2004 the critical depth is not less than seven times greater than the pile diameter according to the research by briadu briaud 1997 with deeper spudcan penetration in clay soil the spudcan disturbs the surrounding soil to within a distance approximately equal to the critical depth of the platform piles moreover previous centrifuge model tests siciliano et al 1990 leung et al 2007 stewart 2005 stewart and finnie 2001 found a zone of relatively intense remoulding around the footprint after spudcan penetration and extraction indicating a reduction in the undrained shear strength of the soil these experimental results also indicated a reduction in both the soil reaction stiffness and ultimate lateral pressure consequently a reduction in the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent platform piles could occur due to the footprint and the region of decreased strength in the soil mirza et al 1988 to date few published studies have investigated the influence of spudcan pile interactions on the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent piles in addition current guidelines do not consider spudcan pile interaction in offshore pile foundation design however there have been a number of cases in the field where the spudcan pile clearance is only several metres and a spudcan is reinstalled close to an existing footprint therefore it is necessary to reevaluate the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent platform piles due to the lack of field investigations no recommendation is provided in the current guidelines apart from noting that a rule of thumb for the acceptable clearance is one spudcan diameter tho et al 2013 the motivation of this study emanates from the need to evaluate the effect of spudcan pile interaction on the lateral capacity of adjacent piles a series of centrifuge model tests are carried out in soft clay the behaviour of single piles including the base pile and adjacent piles affected by the spudcan subjected to monotonic lateral loading was investigated based on the model test results a modified p y curve method is proposed for evaluating the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent piles 2 centrifuge model test the present centrifuge model tests were conducted on the lxj 450 beam centrifuge at the china institute of water resources and hydropower fig 1 its maximum capacity and acceleration are 450 g t and 300 g respectively the effective arm radius of the centrifuge is 5 03 m the centrifuge model tests were conducted at 60 g the relationships between the parameters of the centrifuge model and the prototype are defined by scaling laws which are derived from the dimensional analysis by schofield 1980 and garnier et al 2007 the relevant scaling laws for this work are presented in table 1 and n is the ratio of centrifugal acceleration to gravity 2 1 model spudcan and piles 2 1 1 model spudcan the model spudcan without a spigot is made of aluminium alloy the model spudcan has a diameter of 120 mm corresponding to a 7 2 m diameter prototype spudcan as shown in fig 2 2 1 2 model pile all three model piles were made of hollow circular stainless steel pipes with an external diameter of 24 mm a wall thickness of 2 5 mm and a young s modulus of 210 gpa the burial depth and total length of each pile were 0 5 and 0 6 m respectively the models were designed to represent offshore prototype steel piles with an external diameter of 1 8 m and a wall thickness of 38 mm the scaling ratio of the flexural rigidity between the model pile and the prototype pile was 1 n 4 n 60 the model pile tip was sealed and 8 pairs of strain gauges were glued on the pile shaft to measure the pile bending moments the strain gauges were coated with a thin uniform 3 mm layer of epoxy young s modulus of 3 gpa resulting in a final outside diameter of 30 mm which is scaled to have the same outside diameter of the prototype pile as shown in fig 3 ei where e is young s modulus and i is the area moment of inertia of the model pile is 1328 n m2 and ei of the prototype pile was 17 15 gn m2 which ensured that the ei values were basically equivalent when scaled the parameters of the model pile and the corresponding prototype pile can be found in table 2 notably it is seldom possible to replicate precisely all details of the prototype and the model soil particles in the tests were not reduced by a factor of n it is necessary to take the particle size effect and the influence of model and prototype soil pile stiffness into account for the fine grained clay soils the particle size effects have no significant influence on the lateral behaviour of a pile taylor 2014 moreover a series of centrifuge tests about modelling of models were reported by terashi et al 1989 and hamilton et al 1991 these test results show the influence of the soil pile stiffness is not significant for the lateral behaviour of a pile five pairs of these gauges were arranged 50 mm apart near the spudcan penetration depth and the rest were arranged near the pile tip with a spacing of 100 mm as shown in fig 3 the wires along the external pile shaft were pulled to the top of the model pile the gauges and wires were protected by a layer of epoxy with a thickness of 3 mm the bending moment was calculated by the mean value of the two strain gauges on either side of the pile due to the quarter bridge strain gauge circuits three model piles were vertically jacked into the soil by the loading actuator at 1 g and a constant velocity of 2 mm s the loading actuator was controlled by a servo controlled loading system with two hydraulic servo valves as shown in fig 5 the two independent hydraulic servo valves could control the actuator in displacement mode maximum displacement of 400 mm with the feedback signals the final embedment depth of each pile was 0 5 m and the pile tip was socketed in the sand layer although the stress of the soil around the model pile is different when driving at 1 g and n g it has been found that the effect of this difference is not significant for laterally loaded piles remaud et al 1998 in test pbase the strain gauges along the pile shaft were aligned with the fixed pulley in test p0 75d and test p0 5d fig 6 the strain gauges were aligned with the centre of the spudcan and the spudcan pile clearances l the distance from the spudcan edge to the pile edge were 0 75d and 0 5d where d is the spudcan diameter respectively 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 soil sample the internal size of the model container was 0 6 m length 0 6 m width 0 68 m height corresponding to prototype dimensions of 36 m 36 m and 40 8 m respectively the soil in the model experiment was marine clay obtained from the seabed of the bohai sea china the physical properties of this marine clay are listed in table 3 saturated sand was placed into the base of the container to a thickness of 0 1 m the pile tip with a length of 2 cm was socketed in the top of the sand cushion to ensure that the pile tip was fixed the slurry of marine soil was first mixed in a vacuum mixer with a water content of 2 times its liquid limit then the slurry was poured on top of the sand the soil sample was loaded by a loading plate connected to a pneumatic jack and the consolidation process was achieved through surcharge loading the settlement displacement of the soil sample was monitored by the dial gauge and the subsequent loadings were applied until the settlement displacement remained stable successive surcharge loadings were slowly applied to achieve a final vertical stress of 50 kpa according to previous experimental experience the soil sample will settle slightly during the centrifuge reconsolidation process the soil sample with a depth of 52 cm was transferred to the centrifuge and consolidated at 60 g for 3 h the soil surface settlement was measured by laser displacement and the final stabilized depth of the soil sample was 50 cm after centrifugal consolidation a micro vane shear test was employed to measure the clay strength profile at 1 g fig 4 shows the measured undrained shear strength s u profile 2 2 2 test loading and measurement the spudcan penetration and extraction were controlled by the loading actuator in the displacement control mode with a constant velocity of 0 8 mm s the spudcan was inserted to a depth of 15 cm and then extracted corresponding to a prototype depth of 9 m the dimensionless velocity factor vd c v is 198 where v is the loading rate d is the spudcan diameter and c v is the coefficient of consolidation of the clay the undrained conditions can be ensured when vd c v is greater than 30 according to finnie 1993 a 300 mm laser displacement sensor with a resolution of 0 3 mm was placed above the ground surface to monitor the penetration depth a load cell with a range of 0 5 kn and a resolution of 5 n was placed between the hydraulic piston rod and spudcan rod to measure the spudcan loading during penetration and extraction as shown in fig 5 the model pile was laterally loaded by a wire rope connected to a load cell a range of 1 kn and a resolution of 1 n fixed on the hydraulic piston rod the loading frame consisted of a wire rope a fixed pulley and a servo controlled loading system fig 6 the ends of the wire rope were connected on the loading point on the pile shaft and the load cell and the fixed pully was used to change the direction of force the wire rope and fixed pully were polished and smeared with lubricant to reduce friction in all three pile tests the loading height from the ground surface was 20 mm the load was transferred from the loading frame to the model pile at a constant velocity of 0 1 mm s use of the fixed pully allows the lateral load on the loading point to be basically equal to the measured value of the load cell the horizontal displacement at the loading point was measured by a laser displacement sensor a range of 20 mm and a resolution of 0 02 mm pile pbase was loaded laterally directly towards the fixed pully and the adjacent piles pile p0 75d and pile p0 5d were loaded laterally directly towards the footprint fig 6 b the most potentially dangerous direction data from the load cells laser displacement sensors and strain gauges were transferred to the data acquisition system through the junction boxes and electrical slip rings the acquisition frequency of the tests was 10 hz 2 3 test procedures and objectives four tests were conducted in the model container including the penetration and extraction of the spudcan and lateral loading of the base pile pile pbase and adjacent piles pile p0 75d and pile p0 5d a summary of the lateral loading test programme is presented in table 4 after consolidation of the soil sample at 60 g the centrifugal model tests are conducted in the following order test p base the first test was a base test with no disturbance from an adjacent spudcan the model pile was loaded laterally with no displacement or rotation restraint at the loading point test s1 after test pbase the centrifuge was spun down to facilitate the assembly of the experimental setup for test s1 two adjacent pile heads pile p0 75d and pile p0 5d were fixed in terms of the horizontal translational and rotational degrees of freedom by the pile head fixing devices during test s1 as shown in fig 5 subsequently the spudcan was inserted and extracted at 60 g and the bending moments of the adjacent piles were measured not discussed here test p 0 75d and test p 0 5d after test s1 the centrifuge was spun down again to facilitate the assembly of the experimental setup for test p0 75d and test p0 5d two adjacent piles were loaded laterally in the same manner as that in test pbase with no displacement or rotation restraint at the loading point the objective of these two tests was to assess the effect of spudcan penetration and extraction on the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent piles and the results were compared with those of the base test 3 test results 3 1 results of lateral loading tests all the test results in this study are presented at the prototype scale the load displacement curves from the loading point for all three monotonic loading tests are shown in fig 7 in this study the lateral load corresponding to a lateral displacement of 0 1d where d is the pile diameter at the loading point is defined as the lateral static capacity p r the results show a reduction in the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent piles greater spudcan pile clearances resulted in gradually reduced footprint effects test p0 75d and test p0 5d resulted in lateral static capacities p r of the adjacent piles that were reduced by 3 9 l d 0 75 and 10 5 l d 0 5 compared to that of test pbase the bending moments of the pile shaft were measured by the strain gauges during lateral loading as shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the pile tip was fixed well and the maximum bending moment of the adjacent piles increased with the closer spudcan pile clearance for the same lateral load the maximum bending moment of test p0 5d was 16 4 greater than that of test pbase moreover the position of the maximum bending moment also gradually shifted downwards all of these test results indicated that the surrounding soil was weakened by spudcan penetration and extraction consequently the lateral bearing capacities of adjacent piles were reduced 3 2 derived p y curves the soil reaction per unit length p can be obtained by double differentiating the bending moment profile m z 1 p d 2 m z d z 2 the horizontal displacement of the pile shaft y can be obtained by double integration of the bending moments 2 y m z e i d z d z a key step in processing these soil responses is the interpolation of measured bending moments at discrete depths the measured values were processed with matlab using a series of 6th order polynomials m z c 7z6 c6z5 c 2 z c 1 and the least squares method to derive a continuous bending moment profile along the pile shaft fig 9 shows the experimental bending moment data from test pbase fitted with the bending moment profile generated in matlab fig 9 indicates that a good fit was achieved for the bending moment data the soil reaction per unit length p and displacement y were then obtained by eqs 1 and 2 the boundary condition at the pile tip was fixed because the pile tip was socketed in sand therefore the two integration constants for eq 2 were obtained by two boundary conditions a measured displacement at the loading point and b zero displacement at the pile tip fig 10 shows the three curves of the normalized unit lateral pressure p s u d against the lateral displacement y d fig 10 shows an obvious reduction in both the soil reaction stiffness and ultimate lateral pressure due to spudcan penetration and extraction the extent of which is related to the spudcan pile clearance and burial depth for depth z 3 m the ultimate lateral pressure at l d 0 5 is 39 less than that of the undisturbed base test however the soil lateral pressure is not influenced at a depth of 9 m similarly the maximum spudcan penetration h in the model tests was 9 m overall the decrease in soil lateral pressure is obvious at shallow depths with an increase in depth below the maximum penetration depth h the soil lateral pressure no longer changes these results can explain the increase in maximum bending moment with depth as shown in fig 8 4 static p y curves 4 1 p y curves for the base pile the p y curves from test pbase are clearly stiffer than the american petroleum institute api rp 2geo curves 2014 which consider the initial stiffness and ultimate lateral pressure fig 12 consistent with the research results for soft clay discussed by jeanjean 2009 and nichols et al 2014 many studies have investigated the ultimate lateral pressure p max in soft clay although no rigorous analytic solutions have been widely adopted due to the nonlinear and elastic plastic behaviour of soil material the value of the ultimate lateral pressure p max adopted by the api api 2014 increases from 3s u to 9s u at various depths jeanjean 2009 suggests increasing p max from 9s u to 12s u for offshore pile foundations randolph and houlsby 1984 considered the value of p max to be limited to 11 9s u based on the plasticity theory for a rough pile the soil undrained shear strength in the model test increased approximately linearly with depth z and was assumed as follows s u s u0 kz where s u0 is the soil shear strength at the mudline a linear function fitting to the measured undrained shear strength is shown in fig 11 the strength profiles indicate that the shear strength at the mudline s u0 is 20 8 kpa and that the shear strength gradient k is 0 36 kpa m the ultimate lateral pressure p max can be expressed as 3 p max n p s u γ z where n p is the lateral bearing capacity factor and γ is the submerged unit weight for a linearly increasing shear strength profile the factor n p was selected by using the following empirical expressions according to murff and hamilton 1993 4 n p n 1 n 2 e ξ z d where ξ 0 25 0 05 λ 6 ξ 0 55 λ 6 λ s u 0 k d the p y curves of underwater soft clay proposed by matlock 1970 are adopted 5 p p max 0 5 y y c 1 3 where y c is the local lateral pile displacement at half of the ultimate resistance y c 2 5e 50 d and e 50 is the strain at one half the maximum deviator stress in the laboratory undrained compression tests for the marine clay in this study when the values of n 1 and n 2 in eq 4 are taken as 10 7 and 7 0 respectively the calculated normalized p y curves according to eq 5 are in good agreement with the test pbase results as shown in fig 12 a a series of p y curves following from eq 5 or the api api 2014 guidelines were imported into the iterative finite difference program developed in matlab then the load displacement curves at the loading point were obtained the load displacement curves predicted by using the proposed p y curves and api method are compared with the measured results from test pbase as shown in fig 12 b clearly the use of api p y curves results in a conservative prediction of the lateral bearing capacity of the pile while the load displacement curves predicted by the proposed p y curves according to eqs 3 and 5 are in good agreement with the measured results based on these proposed p y curves in the following section a modified method is proposed for analysing the influence of spudcans on adjacent piles 4 2 modified p y curves for adjacent piles earlier research siciliano et al 1990 stewart 2005 mirza et al 1988 identified a decrease in undrained shear strength due to the footprint caused by spudcan extraction resulting in a reduction in the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent piles the derived p y curves in fig 10 also validate these conclusions to assess the p y curves of adjacent piles a strength attenuation coefficient α α 1 is introduced in eq 3 6 p max α n p s u γ z fig 10 indicates that the reduction in soil shear strength depends on the spudcan pile clearance l and burial depth z thus α is closely related to both the soil near the mudline is extensively disturbed and the value of α is minimal the soil at the depth of the maximum spudcan penetration h is almost undisturbed and the value of α is taken as 1 for convenient implementation in practice the strength attenuation coefficient α is assumed to satisfy a linear increase with depth z fig 13 shows the profile of the strength attenuation coefficient α vs normalized depth z h for clearances of l 0 75d and l 0 5d based on eqs 5 and 6 after introducing the coefficient α the normalized p y curves of two adjacent piles were obtained as shown in figs 14 a and 15 a then these modified p y curves were imported into the iterative finite difference program to obtain the load displacement curves at the loading point of the two adjacent piles as shown in figs 14 b and 15 b although coefficient α satisfying a linear increase with depth z is only an approximate assumption the calculated results figs 14 and 15 indicate that this relationship can reveal the reduction in the reaction stiffness of the soil and lateral bearing capacity of the adjacent piles because the spudcan pile clearances are usually from 0 25d to 1d in the field the values of coefficient α were derived from the two representative clearances 0 5d and 0 75d this work provided a recommendation for assessing the average effect of the spducan penetration and extraction however it is still not enough to meet the requirements of the practical design and needs to be further studied 5 conclusions centrifuge model tests were carried out to investigate the effect of spudcan pile interaction on the lateral capacity of adjacent piles based on the proposed p y curves for the base test a modified p y curve method for adjacent piles was presented by introducing a strength attenuation coefficient the validation of the proposed method was presented the following conclusions were drawn 1 a reduction in the lateral capacity of adjacent piles could occur due to the soil disturbance around a footprint formed by spudcan penetration and extraction in this work the lateral static capacities p r of the adjacent piles were reduced by 3 9 l d 0 75 and 10 5 l d 0 5 compared with that of the base pile 2 for the same lateral load the maximum bending moment of test p0 5d was 16 4 greater than that of test pbase the position of the maximum bending moment shifted downwards 3 the p y curves derived from the model tests showed an obvious reduction in both the soil reaction stiffness and ultimate lateral pressure this reduction was related to the spudcan pile clearance and burial depth 4 the proposed p y curves were presented for marine soil in this study because the p y curves provided by api rp 2geo 2014 are conservative based on these proposed p y curves the modified p y curve method for adjacent piles was presented by introducing a strength attenuation coefficient the proposed method results were compared with the test results and this approach was proven to be reasonable suggesting that it could be used as an engineering analysis approach for evaluating the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent platform piles acknowledgements

with a constant velocity of 0 8 mm s the spudcan was inserted to a depth of 15 cm and then extracted corresponding to a prototype depth of 9 m the dimensionless velocity factor vd c v is 198 where v is the loading rate d is the spudcan diameter and c v is the coefficient of consolidation of the clay the undrained conditions can be ensured when vd c v is greater than 30 according to finnie 1993 a 300 mm laser displacement sensor with a resolution of 0 3 mm was placed above the ground surface to monitor the penetration depth a load cell with a range of 0 5 kn and a resolution of 5 n was placed between the hydraulic piston rod and spudcan rod to measure the spudcan loading during penetration and extraction as shown in fig 5 the model pile was laterally loaded by a wire rope connected to a load cell a range of 1 kn and a resolution of 1 n fixed on the hydraulic piston rod the loading frame consisted of a wire rope a fixed pulley and a servo controlled loading system fig 6 the ends of the wire rope were connected on the loading point on the pile shaft and the load cell and the fixed pully was used to change the direction of force the wire rope and fixed pully were polished and smeared with lubricant to reduce friction in all three pile tests the loading height from the ground surface was 20 mm the load was transferred from the loading frame to the model pile at a constant velocity of 0 1 mm s use of the fixed pully allows the lateral load on the loading point to be basically equal to the measured value of the load cell the horizontal displacement at the loading point was measured by a laser displacement sensor a range of 20 mm and a resolution of 0 02 mm pile pbase was loaded laterally directly towards the fixed pully and the adjacent piles pile p0 75d and pile p0 5d were loaded laterally directly towards the footprint fig 6 b the most potentially dangerous direction data from the load cells laser displacement sensors and strain gauges were transferred to the data acquisition system through the junction boxes and electrical slip rings the acquisition frequency of the tests was 10 hz 2 3 test procedures and objectives four tests were conducted in the model container including the penetration and extraction of the spudcan and lateral loading of the base pile pile pbase and adjacent piles pile p0 75d and pile p0 5d a summary of the lateral loading test programme is presented in table 4 after consolidation of the soil sample at 60 g the centrifugal model tests are conducted in the following order test p base the first test was a base test with no disturbance from an adjacent spudcan the model pile was loaded laterally with no displacement or rotation restraint at the loading point test s1 after test pbase the centrifuge was spun down to facilitate the assembly of the experimental setup for test s1 two adjacent pile heads pile p0 75d and pile p0 5d were fixed in terms of the horizontal translational and rotational degrees of freedom by the pile head fixing devices during test s1 as shown in fig 5 subsequently the spudcan was inserted and extracted at 60 g and the bending moments of the adjacent piles were measured not discussed here test p 0 75d and test p 0 5d after test s1 the centrifuge was spun down again to facilitate the assembly of the experimental setup for test p0 75d and test p0 5d two adjacent piles were loaded laterally in the same manner as that in test pbase with no displacement or rotation restraint at the loading point the objective of these two tests was to assess the effect of spudcan penetration and extraction on the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent piles and the results were compared with those of the base test 3 test results 3 1 results of lateral loading tests all the test results in this study are presented at the prototype scale the load displacement curves from the loading point for all three monotonic loading tests are shown in fig 7 in this study the lateral load corresponding to a lateral displacement of 0 1d where d is the pile diameter at the loading point is defined as the lateral static capacity p r the results show a reduction in the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent piles greater spudcan pile clearances resulted in gradually reduced footprint effects test p0 75d and test p0 5d resulted in lateral static capacities p r of the adjacent piles that were reduced by 3 9 l d 0 75 and 10 5 l d 0 5 compared to that of test pbase the bending moments of the pile shaft were measured by the strain gauges during lateral loading as shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the pile tip was fixed well and the maximum bending moment of the adjacent piles increased with the closer spudcan pile clearance for the same lateral load the maximum bending moment of test p0 5d was 16 4 greater than that of test pbase moreover the position of the maximum bending moment also gradually shifted downwards all of these test results indicated that the surrounding soil was weakened by spudcan penetration and extraction consequently the lateral bearing capacities of adjacent piles were reduced 3 2 derived p y curves the soil reaction per unit length p can be obtained by double differentiating the bending moment profile m z 1 p d 2 m z d z 2 the horizontal displacement of the pile shaft y can be obtained by double integration of the bending moments 2 y m z e i d z d z a key step in processing these soil responses is the interpolation of measured bending moments at discrete depths the measured values were processed with matlab using a series of 6th order polynomials m z c 7z6 c6z5 c 2 z c 1 and the least squares method to derive a continuous bending moment profile along the pile shaft fig 9 shows the experimental bending moment data from test pbase fitted with the bending moment profile generated in matlab fig 9 indicates that a good fit was achieved for the bending moment data the soil reaction per unit length p and displacement y were then obtained by eqs 1 and 2 the boundary condition at the pile tip was fixed because the pile tip was socketed in sand therefore the two integration constants for eq 2 were obtained by two boundary conditions a measured displacement at the loading point and b zero displacement at the pile tip fig 10 shows the three curves of the normalized unit lateral pressure p s u d against the lateral displacement y d fig 10 shows an obvious reduction in both the soil reaction stiffness and ultimate lateral pressure due to spudcan penetration and extraction the extent of which is related to the spudcan pile clearance and burial depth for depth z 3 m the ultimate lateral pressure at l d 0 5 is 39 less than that of the undisturbed base test however the soil lateral pressure is not influenced at a depth of 9 m similarly the maximum spudcan penetration h in the model tests was 9 m overall the decrease in soil lateral pressure is obvious at shallow depths with an increase in depth below the maximum penetration depth h the soil lateral pressure no longer changes these results can explain the increase in maximum bending moment with depth as shown in fig 8 4 static p y curves 4 1 p y curves for the base pile the p y curves from test pbase are clearly stiffer than the american petroleum institute api rp 2geo curves 2014 which consider the initial stiffness and ultimate lateral pressure fig 12 consistent with the research results for soft clay discussed by jeanjean 2009 and nichols et al 2014 many studies have investigated the ultimate lateral pressure p max in soft clay although no rigorous analytic solutions have been widely adopted due to the nonlinear and elastic plastic behaviour of soil material the value of the ultimate lateral pressure p max adopted by the api api 2014 increases from 3s u to 9s u at various depths jeanjean 2009 suggests increasing p max from 9s u to 12s u for offshore pile foundations randolph and houlsby 1984 considered the value of p max to be limited to 11 9s u based on the plasticity theory for a rough pile the soil undrained shear strength in the model test increased approximately linearly with depth z and was assumed as follows s u s u0 kz where s u0 is the soil shear strength at the mudline a linear function fitting to the measured undrained shear strength is shown in fig 11 the strength profiles indicate that the shear strength at the mudline s u0 is 20 8 kpa and that the shear strength gradient k is 0 36 kpa m the ultimate lateral pressure p max can be expressed as 3 p max n p s u γ z where n p is the lateral bearing capacity factor and γ is the submerged unit weight for a linearly increasing shear strength profile the factor n p was selected by using the following empirical expressions according to murff and hamilton 1993 4 n p n 1 n 2 e ξ z d where ξ 0 25 0 05 λ 6 ξ 0 55 λ 6 λ s u 0 k d the p y curves of underwater soft clay proposed by matlock 1970 are adopted 5 p p max 0 5 y y c 1 3 where y c is the local lateral pile displacement at half of the ultimate resistance y c 2 5e 50 d and e 50 is the strain at one half the maximum deviator stress in the laboratory undrained compression tests for the marine clay in this study when the values of n 1 and n 2 in eq 4 are taken as 10 7 and 7 0 respectively the calculated normalized p y curves according to eq 5 are in good agreement with the test pbase results as shown in fig 12 a a series of p y curves following from eq 5 or the api api 2014 guidelines were imported into the iterative finite difference program developed in matlab then the load displacement curves at the loading point were obtained the load displacement curves predicted by using the proposed p y curves and api method are compared with the measured results from test pbase as shown in fig 12 b clearly the use of api p y curves results in a conservative prediction of the lateral bearing capacity of the pile while the load displacement curves predicted by the proposed p y curves according to eqs 3 and 5 are in good agreement with the measured results based on these proposed p y curves in the following section a modified method is proposed for analysing the influence of spudcans on adjacent piles 4 2 modified p y curves for adjacent piles earlier research siciliano et al 1990 stewart 2005 mirza et al 1988 identified a decrease in undrained shear strength due to the footprint caused by spudcan extraction resulting in a reduction in the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent piles the derived p y curves in fig 10 also validate these conclusions to assess the p y curves of adjacent piles a strength attenuation coefficient α α 1 is introduced in eq 3 6 p max α n p s u γ z fig 10 indicates that the reduction in soil shear strength depends on the spudcan pile clearance l and burial depth z thus α is closely related to both the soil near the mudline is extensively disturbed and the value of α is minimal the soil at the depth of the maximum spudcan penetration h is almost undisturbed and the value of α is taken as 1 for convenient implementation in practice the strength attenuation coefficient α is assumed to satisfy a linear increase with depth z fig 13 shows the profile of the strength attenuation coefficient α vs normalized depth z h for clearances of l 0 75d and l 0 5d based on eqs 5 and 6 after introducing the coefficient α the normalized p y curves of two adjacent piles were obtained as shown in figs 14 a and 15 a then these modified p y curves were imported into the iterative finite difference program to obtain the load displacement curves at the loading point of the two adjacent piles as shown in figs 14 b and 15 b although coefficient α satisfying a linear increase with depth z is only an approximate assumption the calculated results figs 14 and 15 indicate that this relationship can reveal the reduction in the reaction stiffness of the soil and lateral bearing capacity of the adjacent piles because the spudcan pile clearances are usually from 0 25d to 1d in the field the values of coefficient α were derived from the two representative clearances 0 5d and 0 75d this work provided a recommendation for assessing the average effect of the spducan penetration and extraction however it is still not enough to meet the requirements of the practical design and needs to be further studied 5 conclusions centrifuge model tests were carried out to investigate the effect of spudcan pile interaction on the lateral capacity of adjacent piles based on the proposed p y curves for the base test a modified p y curve method for adjacent piles was presented by introducing a strength attenuation coefficient the validation of the proposed method was presented the following conclusions were drawn 1 a reduction in the lateral capacity of adjacent piles could occur due to the soil disturbance around a footprint formed by spudcan penetration and extraction in this work the lateral static capacities p r of the adjacent piles were reduced by 3 9 l d 0 75 and 10 5 l d 0 5 compared with that of the base pile 2 for the same lateral load the maximum bending moment of test p0 5d was 16 4 greater than that of test pbase the position of the maximum bending moment shifted downwards 3 the p y curves derived from the model tests showed an obvious reduction in both the soil reaction stiffness and ultimate lateral pressure this reduction was related to the spudcan pile clearance and burial depth 4 the proposed p y curves were presented for marine soil in this study because the p y curves provided by api rp 2geo 2014 are conservative based on these proposed p y curves the modified p y curve method for adjacent piles was presented by introducing a strength attenuation coefficient the proposed method results were compared with the test results and this approach was proven to be reasonable suggesting that it could be used as an engineering analysis approach for evaluating the lateral bearing capacity of adjacent platform piles acknowledgements

the optimization result weilin 2015 considered hydrodynamic performances of auv in the design including the resistance and the maneuverability and proposed a collaborative optimization method into which particle swarm optimization pso was incorporated to improve the efficiency of optimization based on the aforementioned research this paper establishes a multidisciplinary concurrent subspace design frame of auv based on the radial basis function based high dimensional models analysis models for individual disciplines involved in the optimization frame such as the hull form structure propulsion energy maneuverability and general arrangement are established respectively based on which a concurrent subspace design based on the radial basis function based high dimensional models is performed and yields an optimal design that meet the design requirements which includes a weight of 300 kg class diving depth of 1000 m and range of 200 km performances of the vehicle before and after optimization are compared and analyzed and the effectiveness of the design scheme is verified in the sea trial 2 multidisciplinary design optimization 2 1 concurrent subspace design 2 1 1 related theory in 1989 sobieski first proposed the concept of concurrent subspace optimization csso the basic tenet of csso is that each subgroup tried to minimize the system objective while trying to satisfy its own constraints and not preventing other groups from satisfying their constraints sobieszczanski sobieski 1989 csso is mainly used for non hierarchical structures so each subgroup independently optimizes a set of independent design variables in each subspace optimization process the state variables of this subspace will be obtained by subject analysis while other state variables and constraints will be determined by approximation strategies concurrent subspace design csd framework used in this paper is evolved from the fundamental structure of csso and it also contains three phases system analysis and decoupling concurrent subspace optimization and system approximation and coordination but optimal solutions of discipline needn t be obtained in the optimization process and feasible design solutions are provided for the system level so the database can be expanded for systems with computationally expensive system analysis csd is more efficient than conventional optimization since system analysis in csd are explicit in the system design variables and design searches in the approximate design space are very efficient csd also allows subspace designers to suggest new designs that are used to improve the response surfaces in a cyclic process batill et al 1999a b the system chart of csd is shown in fig 1 the common mathematical formulation of csd architecture is described as follows 1 m i n f x f i n d x s t g x 0 where f is the objective function x is the design variable g represents inequality constraints the optimization process of csd is as follows 1 system analysis according to the database of the last optimization cycle the system temporarily cuts off the connection between disciplines and transfers the optimal value of the last optimization cycle to the discipline as the baseline scheme 2 concurrent subspace design at this stage the variable x i in the ith discipline is local design variable while the design variable x j of other disciplines is fixed in the allocation of value in the baseline scheme the state variable y i of ith discipline is calculated by using high precision model while the state variable y j of other subjects is estimated by approximate model at this point the sub disciplines are no longer optimized but only subject analysis to submit feasible design plans to the system this feasible design scheme may not be optimal if it is assumed that there are n disciplines then the design problem of the ith discipline in the rth cycle is expressed as 2 f i n d x i r f x i r y i y i c a i x i r y j s t g x i r 0 where c a i is the system analysis function y j is the state variable of the ith discipline calculated by response surface 3 system analysis the feasible scheme obtained in step 2 is analyzed and the results are added to the database then the approximate models are updated 4 system level optimization in this stage all design variables x are optimized in the system layer and all state variables are calculated by the approximation model the system level optimization problem in the rth cycle can be expressed as 3 f i n d x i r m i n f x r s t g x i r 0 it is assumed that the optimal solution in this cycle is x r if x r meets the convergence condition the optimization process will be finished then the final optimization result is x x r otherwise f the x r is used as the value for the r 1 th cycle and the scheme is added to the database then the approximate model is updated just like the solution in csso the global optimal solution of csd also depends on the accuracy of the approximate model along with the iterative process the information of the system response surface around the optimal solution is gradually increased then the approximation model will be more accurate and it will eventually converge to the optimal solution of the system 2 1 2 example test the gear reducer example is used to test csso and csd the design objective is to find the minimum of a gear box volume subject to several constraints golinski 1970 1973 seven design variables and constraints represent in table 1 and table 2 respectively see table 3 following li 1989 golinski s speed reducer problem is decomposed into three discipline optimization subproblems and a system level optimization subproblem mathematically the system level optimization subproblem is specified as follows min f x

specified as follows min f x 1 0 7854 x g 1 x g 2 2 3 3333 x g 3 2 14 9334 x g 3 43 0934 s t g 1 1 g 2 1 g 8 1 0 g 9 1 0 for the discipline optimization subproblem 2 the shaft 1 diameter design variable x g 6 is optimized with all the others held fixed then the problem is specified as follows min f x 2 1 508 x g 6 2 x g 1 7 477 x g 6 3 0 7854 x g 4 x g 6 2 s t g 3 1 g 5 1 g 24 1 0 for the discipline optimization subproblem 3 the shaft 2 diameter design variable x g 7 is optimized with all the others held fixed then the problem is specified as follows min f x 3 1 508 x g 7 2 x g 1 7 477 x g 7 3 0 7854 x g 5 x g 7 2 s t g 4 1 g 6 1 0 g 11 1 0 different initial points are selected for this example and the optimal solution of design variables and design results in li 1989 are used as the reference values and the detailed parameters are depicted in table 4 root mean squared error rmse is applied to estimate the accuracy of design variables which is written as 4 r m s e i 1 7 x g i o p t x g i 2 7 where x g i is reference solution of ith design variable and x g i o p t is optimal solution of ith design variable the results are depicted in table 5 and table 6 the convergence histories are shown in fig 2 from these comparative results they are shown that the csd is not sensitive to the initial points so the optimality results obtained by csd match better the results found by li 1989 moreover csd has a great advantage in number of optimization analysis so csd requires fewer computing resources the example test demonstrates that csd is more efficient than csso 2 2 metamodeling for high dimensional simulation based design problems 2 2 1 the radial basis function based high dimensional model representation the metamodeling techniques e g polynomial regression kriging and radial basis function rbf have been extensively used in costly simulation based engineering design and optimization to facilitate the design efficiency sharvari and senthilnath 2012 and hongbing and mark 2006 the conventional metamodeling techniques have been found to work well for low dimensional problems but when increasing the dimensionality because of the accompanying curse of dimensionality the efficiency and accuracy of the popular metamodeling techniques will decrease sharply as a promising approximation method for high dimensional problems the high dimensional model representation hdmr method was first introduced by sobol 1993 and shan 2010 proposed a rbf hdmr method by using rbf and an accompanying sampling method to model the component functions in hdmr compared to current metamodeling techniques numerical experiments revealed that rbf hdmr is very promising for approximating high dimensional problems this paper employs rbf hdmr models which will be introduced in the following let x x 1 x 2 x n 0 1 n be a point with n input variables in the unit space and f x be the output response a hdmr model is expressed as haitao et al 2017 5 f x f 0 i 1 n f i x i 1 i j n f i j x i x j 1 i 1 i l n f i 1 i 2 i l x i 1 x i 2 x i l f 12 n x 1 x 2 x n where f 0 represents the 0th order effect on the output f x f i x i is the effect of x i on f x f i j x i x j describes the correlated contribution of x i and x j on f x after removing the individual effects f 12 n x 1 x 2 x n denotes the residual effect of all the variables acting together on f x after all the lower order correlations and individual effects have been removed by using the rbf type model to approximate the component functions in eq 5 rbf hdmr can be expanded to the second order as 6 f ˆ x f 0 i 1 n f ˆ i x i 1 i j n f ˆ i j x i x j where f ˆ i a 1d rbf model is the approximation of the first order component function f i and f ˆ i j a 2d rbf model approximates the second order component function f i j suppose that x i x i x 0 i t contains the first order points on the i th cut line and y i f i x i t contains the associated first order component function responses and x i contains the i th column of x i then f ˆ i in eq 6 is built using the point set x i and the response set y i similarly x i j x i x j x 0 i j t contains the second order points on the i j cut plane and y i j f i j x i x j t contains the associated second order component function responses x i j has the i th and j th columns of x i j the second order rbf model f ˆ i j is built using x i j and y i j finally the flowchart of the second order rbf hdmr metamodeling process is shown in fig 3 and it is shown that the rbf hdmr as compared with other metamodels fundamentally reduces the number of calls to the expensive simulation in order to build a metamodel thus breaks alleviates exponentially increasing computational difficulty songqing 2010 2 2 2 dividing rectangles sampling method in this study dividing rectangles direct sampling method jones 1993 is used to construct rbf hdmr model the main idea of direct is to find all the local extreme points so as to identify the global minimum points in the various parameters of the ranges within the search the method has a very fast rate of convergence and it is robust to local optimum thus it is suitable for the hdmr zhiyuan et al 2015 the direct algorithm transforms the design space into the unit hyper cube finkel 2003 and it is described as 7 ω x x 1 x 2 x d r d 0 x i 1 the algorithm runs in this normalized space referring to the original space only when corresponding function is evaluated the center of this space is c 1 and its value is f c 1 then it divides the hyper cube into d smaller hyper rectangles by evaluating the objective function at sampling points c i δ e i i 1 2 d where δ equals 1 3 of the side length of the cube and e i is the ith unit vector the direct algorithm chooses to leave the best function values in the largest space such that 8 w i min f c i δ e i f c i δ e i 1 i d the dimension with the smallest w i is divided into thirds so that c i δ e i are the centers of the new hyper rectangles this pattern is repeated for all dimensions on the center hyper rectangle and the next dimension is determined by the next smallest w i the most important strategy for direct is how to choose potentially optimal hyper rectangles the direct searches locally and globally by dividing all hyper rectangles according to following criteria a hyper rectangle j is said to be potential optimal if there exists some k 0 such that for an arbitrarily small ε 0 9 f c i k d i f c j k d j 1 i d 10 f c i k d i f m i n ε f m i n where f m i n is the best function value found up to now and ε is used here to protect the algorithm against excessive local bias in the search the algorithm evaluates all the new hyperrectangle at their centers then it identifies the set of potentially optimal hyperrectangles in this paper the procedure of direct combined with rbf hdmr is outlined in table 7 2 2 3 example test to assess the accuracy of the metamodel the proposed rbf hdmr method has been tested using a number of well known mathematical examples jin et al 2001 presented in table 8 the rbf hdmr is constructed according to the process described in fig 3 for the rbf second order response surface model rsm 2 and kriging the method of optimal latin hypercube design is used in the design of experiment and the comparison results are summarized in table 9 statistic criterions r square r2 relative root mean square error rrmse relative maximum absolute error rmae are applied to estimate the accuracy of the current metamodel the expressions for these three criteria are given in following equations respectively 11 r 2 1 i 1 m f x i f ˆ x i 2 i 1 m f x i f x i 2 where f ˆ x i is the corresponding approximated value for the observed value f x i f x i denotes the mean of all the observed values 12 r r m s e i 1 m f x i f ˆ x i 2 m std where std represents the standard deviation of the observed value f x i 13 r m a e max f x i f ˆ x i std according to table 9 rbf hdmr combined with direct outperforms other methods in most cases with respect to all metrics which all the results of are good enough for high dimensional problems the results are also shown that the method has a great advantage in number of sample points utilized the direct sampling strategy it can construct the approximate model with less sample number and better prediction accuracy and does not need a large number of sample points for the modeling like other methods the example test demonstrates that it will be reliable 3 description of the optimization problem in the problem of mdo of underwater vehicles in this paper the design

1 discipline model establishment to satisfy the requirements of weight diving depth and range the conceptual design plan should be optimized further by the multidisciplinary design method based on the discipline division method proposed by charle 2002 auv design contents are divided into six disciplines hull form discipline structure discipline propulsion discipline energy discipline maneuverability discipline and general arrangement discipline among them hull form discipline is coupled with maneuverability discipline and general arrangement discipline structure discipline energy discipline and maneuverability discipline are coupled with general arrangement discipline the detailed system decomposition is shown in fig 5 3 1 1 discipline of the hull form establishment the discipline of the hull form is to obtain the optimal solution with minimum resistance under the constraint of a certain displacement so the shape of hull and appendage are considered and some

position along the centerline the nose section is considered as an incomplete ellipse and the tail section is considered as an incomplete parabola they are described by the nystrom curve function which begins from the maximum diameter of the vehicle and ends at the base diameter and nose section function y n x and tail section function y t x are described as 15 x d 2 1 x l n h u l l n n 1 n n 0 x l n 0 y n x d 2 16 y t x d 2 1 x l t h u l l n t 0 x l t 0 y t x d 2 where x is the span length along the centerline between certain position in curve and maximum cross section of the nose section and tail section n n and n t are adjustable parameters of bow curve and stern curve appendages of auv consist of two parts rudders and antennae shell rudders are designed as the same trapezoidal shape but surface area of horizontal rudder and vertical rudder are different for the different requirement of maneuverability which are calculated in section 3 1 5 usually b r is constrained as a constant for the requirement of install and maintain in this paper d r is considered as the diameter of body at the position of rudder shaft as the installation location of rudders are often fixed d r is supposed as a constant then c r r is also supposed as a constant from the reference ting 2013 c r is determined by 17 c r 2 a r b r d r c r is often designed as the average value of c t r and c r r so c t is calculated by 18 c t r 4 a r b r d r c r r antennae shell is defined as the rudder design the span and trailing edge are designed as the fixed size as some antennas are set on the top of antennae shell so the tip chord length is also definite angle a is an adjustable parameter of leading edge which has influence on the shape of antennae shell considering the water flow interference between rudders and antennae shell l s is treated as factors in the parameterized modeling in this discipline the low drag profile of auv under the constraint of a certain displacement is to be obtained therefore the optimization problem can be described as follows variables x h u l l l n h u l l l t h u l l l m h u l l d n n n t l s a obj fun f h u l l m i n r x h u l l s t g 1 h u l l 0 75

superscript hull represents the discipline of the hull form techniques for estimating the drag of an auv can be done by means of tools originally developed for predicting the hydrodynamic coefficients of ship and submarines so the hull is modelled by fluid computational software to analyze the resistance performance xu et al 2018 based on the motion characteristics of the vehicle to ensure a fully developed flow field the calculation control domain is a cylindrical domain the computation domain extends 1 5 times length of the vehicle in front of the bow and extends 3 times length of the vehicle at the back of the rear it also extends 1 5 times length of the vehicle along the width and depth direction in the calculation a hybrid grid is used to divide the computational grid area into two parts the internal flow field containing the hull and the external flow field in order to adapt to the shapes of the appendages unstructured grids are used in the internal flow field to control grids size and nodes density the external flow field is composed of structural hexahedron grids and prism grids to reduce grids quantity and improve grids quality for the liquid viscosity influence structured grids near the auv surface are used to maintain the accuracy of cfd simulation the grids of calculate domain are shown in fig 7 captive model tests were conducted to validate the cfd simulations the tests were carried out in the circulating water tunnel of the state key laboratory of science and technology on autonomous underwater vehicles at harbin engineering university in china the length of the test model is 1 46m and its diameter is 0 214m which is shown in fig 8 in fig 9 and table 12 it indicates that results gained by cfd match well the test values at different velocity and the numerical simulation procedure can be used to simulate the experiments with an acceptable level of accuracy so the optimization platform based on it will be reliable see table 13 14 15 3 1 2 discipline of structure establishment underwater vehicle structure design includes the pressure cabin design and hull framework structure design for the former it mainly considers the ultimate bearing capability of its yield stress under a large diving depth however the latter not only has to meet the requirement of the equipment loading but also considers some special issues such as the hull longitudinal strength local strength under the surf slamming and opening structure reinforcement 3 1 2 1 pressure cabin design the pressure cabin consists of a cabin shell and hatches the structure of cabin shell is cylindrical shell with outer ring ribs which is made of 7075 aluminum alloy material the structure of hatches is flat head which is made of titanium alloy to improve the sealing reliability both the axial sealing and radial sealing are applied the pressure cabin and head are shown in fig 10 the low weight of pressure cabin w c a b i n under the constraint of working depth is to be obtained therefore the optimization problem can be described as follows variables x c a b i n l c a b i n t c a b i n d c a b i n t f l a n g e h f l a n g e n r i b t r i b h r i b t h e a d

stress values used in cabin shell and hatches respectively techniques for estimating the stress of a pressure cabin can also be done by means of tools based on these parameters and rules for the classification and construction of submersible systems and submersibles 2013 an approximate computational model is constructed in parametric design language by ansys software in the computational model the solid186 elements are selected as element division in the yield analysis both ends of the cabin shell are under full constraints and the maximum working pressure is imposed to an external surface of the cabin shell for the static analysis the results are shown in fig 11 3 1 2 2 hull framework structure design the hull framework structure is made of carbon fiber composite material and the integrated manufacture process of hull is adopted to reduce the number of connectors and assembly parts so the structure weight can be reduced the hull structure is composed of the light shell and strengthening bulkheads hull sections are connected by the transverse strengthening bulkheads and both sides of hull are strengthened by the longitudinal bulkheads as shown in fig 12 the longitudinal bulkheads and transverse bulkheads are structures that not only strengthen the shell but also provide space for internal equipment installation to improve the overall longitudinal strength of hull and reduce the weight at the same time the buoyance material is poured between the shell and longitudinal bulkheads to form a sandwich layer structure so as to increase the overall longitudinal strength as shown in fig 13 for the condition of dual point lifting two lifting points of hull frame are set as the fixed rigidity points where the translational degree of freedom and rotational degree of freedom are constrained in all directions the basic load is equal to the weight of auv in the air in addition some factors have to be considered such as the sea wave slamming the acceleration motion during the lifting and recovery process additional seawater mass when emerging from the water and the collision with obstacle seafloor or mothership then the design load is obtained by multiplying the basic load by the dynamic load coefficient the low weight of hull framework structure w f r a m e under the constraint of auv weight is to be obtained and it is in relation to the hull parameters and numbers of carbon fiber layers the hull parameters are obtained in the discipline of the hull form therefore the optimization problem in discipline of structure can be described as follows variables x

lifting condition σ f i x d f i x represent max stress and max deformation of hull frame structure in the fastening condition b c are dynamic coefficient the strength evaluation of hull framework is based on the stress and deformation under the hull lifting conditions since the carbon fiber materials are anisotropic materials based on lamination theory the approximate calculation model of the hull framework is constructed by ansys software in the model structural connections are assumed to be coupled and the shell99 composite material elements are selected for geometrical model meshing all shells are cut into regular shapes and all surfaces are divided into quadrilateral grids as much as possible to improve computational accuracy which is shown in fig 14 3 1 3 discipline of propulsion establishment for the propulsion system as the input power p s of propulsion motor is converted into effective power p e energy loss is inevitable thus it is expected to obtain the optimal solution with low energy loss usually the expression is written as follows 19 p s p e η d η s η r η 0 η h where η d represents the motor efficiency η s represents the machinery efficiency η r represents the relative rotational efficiency η 0 represents the open water efficiency and η h represents hull efficiency normally p e is determined as follows 20 p e r v where r represented the total resistance of vehicle and v represented the vehicle speed then formula 19 can be written as 21 p s r v η d η s η r η 0 η h usually it is supposed that η s 1 η r 1 η h 1 as the rotation speed of propeller is often low the motor has to work in the condition of low speed so it is supposed that η d 0 8 η 0 depends on the propeller diameter rpm and number of blades in this paper the dual blade propeller is used thus η 0 is related to the propeller diameter d p r o p e l l e r propeller pitch b p r o p e l l e r propeller chord length c p r o p e l l e r rotating speed of propeller w 1 and w 2 at cruise speed and maximum speed therefore the optimization problem in discipline of propulsion can be described as follows variables x p r o p u l s i o n d p r o p e l l e r b p r o p e l l e r c p r o p e l l e r

speed respectively t 1 and t 2 represent propulsive force in cruising speed and max speed respectively σ p r o p e l l e r represents stress of propeller techniques for estimating the performance of a propeller can also be done by means of tools the propeller is designed by the method proposed by ting 2013 and an approximate computational model is constructed by ansys software and cfd software to calculate its performance 3 1 4 discipline of energy establishment the energy configuration of auv depends on the tasks that it can perform and the range of travel which comprises two parts the energy consumed by hotel load e h and the energy consumed by propulsion e p e p is defined as the power going directly into the propulsion motor and e h is defined as the power used by the onboard systems computers sensors etc although not necessarily constant in time for a real auv e h is assumed to be constant within this model then it is approximated by 22 e h v i i i t i where v i and i i are the voltage and current of ith electric instrument t i is the operating hours of ith electric instrument to simplify the problem of determining e p the auv motion is restricted to the vertical plane and it is assumed that the vehicle maintains constant depth hence turning and depth changes are ignored under these circumstances e p is modelled as 23 e p p s t where t is the endurance of auv mission and it is defined as 24 t r a n g e v finally total required energy e is determined by 25 e p s r a n g e v v i i i t i in the model the self developed underwater battery is used the energy density of battery is ρ e and the mass density is ρ m then the weight w e n e r g y and volume e n e r g y of batteries can be derived as 26 w e n e r g y e ρ m 27 e n e r g y e ρ e the low weight of batteries under the constraint of working range is to be obtained and p s will be determined in discipline of propulsion therefore the optimization problem can be described as follows variables x e n e r g y v

inequality constraints 3 1 5 discipline of maneuverability establishment in order to simplify the calculation it is assumed that roll motion of auv is not big so the motion of auv can be decomposed into the motion in the horizontal plane and vertical plane in this paper high maneuverability of auv is to obtained in the horizontal plane then the stability coefficient k h c k h β and steady turning diameter d s are important indicators of maneuverability of auv they are given as 28 k h c n r y v y v m y r 29 k h β n v y v 30 d s 2 n v m y r n r y v δ n v y δ n δ y v where y v n v represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient generated by sway motion respectively y r n r represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient generated by yaw motion respectively y δ n δ represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient generated by rudder respectively obviously the maneuverability performance of auv is closely related to the shape of hull and appendage and rudder area a r the shape of hull and appendage will be confirmed in the discipline of the hull form thus he optimization problem can be described as follows variables x m a n e u v e r a b i l i t y a r obj fun f m a n e u v e r a b i l i t y m i n d x m a n e u v e r a b i l i t y s t g 1 maneuverability δ 20 0 g 2 maneuverability 1 k h c 0 g 3 maneuverability k h β 0 where g 1 maneuverability g 2 maneuverability g 3 maneuverability represent inequality constraints d represents the steady turning diameter function δ represents rudder angle in the primary design phase the hull is not definite so empirical formulas have to be used to estimate hydrodynamics derivatives of auv it is assumed that the hydrodynamic derivatives of auv are equal to the sum of the hydrodynamic coefficients of bare hull and appendages so some hydrodynamic coefficient expressions are determined as 31 y v y v h y v a 32 n v n v h n v a 33 y r y r h y r a 34 n r n r h n r a 35 y δ y δ a r 36 n δ n δ a r where y h n h represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient of bare hull and y a n a represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient of appendages from ting 2013 the hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient of bare hull are estimated as 37 y v h 0 22 h u l l 2 3 l 2 38 n v h 1 32 0 037 l d 6 6 h u l l l 3 39 y r h 0 33 0 023 l d 7 5 h u l l l 3 40 n r h 0 575 0 1 l d 7 5 h u l l 4 3 l 4 as the appendage of auv hydrodynamic derivatives of rudders and antenna shell are considered it means that 41 y v a y v a r y v a a 42 n v a n v a r n v a a 43 y r a y r a r y r a a 44 n r a n r a r n r a a where y a r n a r represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient of rudders and y a a n a a represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient of antenna shell they are estimated as 45 y

v a r l r l 52 n r a r y v a r l r l 2 where λ a and λ r represent the aspect ratio of antenna shell and rudders a a and a r represent the surface area of antenna shell and rudders l r represents the length along the centerline between end of tail section and rudder 3 1 6 discipline of general arrangement establishment in the general arrangement the shapes and installation requirements of equipment are different so it is extremely difficult to use a mathematical function to describe the interaction among them therefore the rule that the equipment are arranged close to each other but not in such a way that they interfere with each other is abided by buoyance material are often arranged in the hull to keep the auv balance so it is assumed that the weight of buoyance material is m b u o y a n c e and the distance along the centerline between end of tail section and its position is l b u and the distance between bottom and its position is h b u then auv gravity center x g y g z g represent as 53 x g m x i m b u o y a n c e l b u w m b u o y a n c e 54 y g m y i w m b u o y a n c e 55 z g m z i m b u o y a n c e h b u w m b u o y a n c e where m x i m y i and m z i represent the weight moments of ith module in auv and w represents the gross weight of the modules excluded buoyance material similarly the buoyancy center of auv are written as 56 x c m c x i m c b u o y a n c e l b u δ m c b u o y a n c e 57 y c m c y i δ m c b u o y a n c e 58 z c m c z i m c b u o y a n c e h b u δ m c b u o y a n c e where m c x i m c y i and m c z i represent the buoyancy moments of i t h module in auv m c b u o y a n c e represents the buoyancy of buoyancy material δ represents the sum of the buoyancies of all parts excluded buoyance material then the metacenter height h is determined as follows 59 h z c z g if a longitudinal inclination along the x direction appears the expression for the static trim angle is written as 60 tan φ 0 x c x g z c z g as the weight of auv is equal to its buoyancy so m b u o y a n c e and m c b u o y a n c e are written as m b u o y a n c e ρ b u w δ ρ w a t e r m c b u o y a n c e w δ where ρ b u represents density of buoyance and ρ w a t e r represents density of sea water usually if it doesn t cost much energy to keep the stable movement auv need have big steady metacenter height and small trim angle in the hydrostatic performance in other disciplines the buoyancy and weight of each part can be obtained thus the optimization problem can be described as follows variables x a r r a n g e m e n t l b u h b u obj fun f a r r a n g e m e n t m i n x a r r a n g e m e n t s t g 1 a r r a n g e m e n t h i n i t h 0 where g 1 arrangement represent inequality constraints represents the static trim angle h i n i t represents the metacenter height of no design optimization and its value is 0 02 which is estimated in fig 4 3 2 optimization problem 3 2 1 objective function in this research the weight index is optimized based on the working ability of auv the most important parameters that are diving depth and voyage the objective function is considered based on the minimum total weight w of auv thus the weighted sum of all parts as objective function and the optimization problem in system level is also considered a minimization problem as shown below variables x x h u l l x c a b i n x f r a m e x p r o p u l s i o n x

e n t 3 2 2 optimization results under the premise that all design constraints are satisfied the coupling relationships among disciplines are considered which is shown in fig 15 and the concurrent subspace design method is used to improve the overall performance of auv to the maximum extent see table 16 in some references ting et al 2016 yan et al 2017 the comparison results of optimizer are shown that multi island genetic optimization algorithm mgo spent more time but it is a consistently perfect process and the optimization distinctly approaches the ideal outcome so mgo is selected to find the optimization results in system level analysis the corresponding parameter settings are shown in table 17 the optimization is implemented on a 24 core cpu with a 1 8 ghz base clock the optimization process is shown in fig 16 the optimization results are shown in table 18 from fig 16 it shows the convergence history for runs the results of run converge to the same value that shows the good convergence capability of csd architecture from table 18 it indicates that the optimization results in an 27 decrease of weight which is mainly due to the decrease of batteries weight by decrease of resistance compared to the vehicle before optimization l n h u l l of the optimal vehicle is increased by 60 l t h u l l of the optimal vehicle is increased by 27 5 and d of the optimal vehicle is reduced by 11 7 which lead to forward movement of the center of pressure decrease of resistance and increase of cruise duration then the cruise range is increased and w e n e r g y is reduced h is increased 290 which causes increase of static instability d s and φ 0 are reduced 21 5 and77 2 respectively which improves the maneuverability performance reduces of energy consumption from table 8 it is shown that design parameters obtained by optimization algorithms can improve the performance of auv to some extent therefore the design parameters optimized are selected for the final design of the auv and the design results are shown in fig 17 according to design parameters and design schemes the underwater vehicle is manufactured due to the influence of production process the actual dimensions are slightly different from the optimization design parameters the dimensions of some parts produced are shown in table 19 and the shape of auv is shown in fig 18 4 test verification the optimization results are gained to evaluate the overall performance of auv by the coupled analysis of multiple disciplines in the paper so they are interdisciplinary trade offs and each one is maybe not the most optimal result for the single discipline thus it is maybe difficult to re evaluate them by cfd ting et al 2016 and yan et al 2017 to verify if the performance of auv designed satisfied the mission requirements auv undergoes a standardized sea test organized by the ministry of science and technology of the people s republic of china the test is carried out in the south china sea which lasts for 10 days the major test contents included weight diving depth and voyage in auv weight test the actual weight in air was 395 kg which was different from the optimization result of 365 kg the primary reason was that it was difficult to calculate accurate weight of the watertight cables watertight connectors and bolts at the initial design stage therefore those weights were omitted in the optimization design which caused differences between the actual underwater vehicle weight and the optimization result see fig 19 the depth test was conducted nearby the sea region 17 14 319 n 110 16 692 e during the test auv dove to the working depth of 1000m and navigated for a certain period then ascended to the surface auv diving depth and navigation state were evaluated based on sensor data which were shown in fig 20 the results showed that auv kept moving steadily for 302 min at the depth of 1000 m the steady navigation speed was approximately 1 7 m s and the travel range was approximately 30 km the pressure resistance of the entire underwater vehicle was fully verified because auv was pushed forward by a single propeller when the propeller rotated it would inevitably produce a counter rotating torque on the hull in the transverse direction and then roll angle of hull would appear from the data it could be seen that the roll angle was kept at a relatively small value under a combined force of the transverse inclination recovery moment and fluid force and then it had no significant impact on the navigation performance of the entire vehicle body so it was shown that the transverse metacenter height designed was rational the travel range test was performed in an offshore sea area near18 02 830 n 110 02 0226 e during the test a position near the mother ship was defined as the return point navigation path in the range test was a square which four vertices of were calculated by the planning program auv kept moving along the lines connecting the four points at the depth of 40 m after every 5 h auv floated up to the surface to calibrate its position by gps the test lasted for 36 h the track recorded in the experiment was shown in fig 21 the results of travel range were shown in table 20 from table 20 it could be seen that auv navigation lasted for nearly 40 h and the navigation distance reached 249 km which exceeded the design requirement of 200 km so it proved the validity and effectiveness of the hull form design and power configuration in the design plan these test results fully validated the effectiveness and reliability of the optimization design plan 5 conclusions in this paper six factors i e the hull form structure propulsion power maneuverability and general arrangement are considered based on the concurrent subspace design framework underwater vehicle design parameters are determined by optimization method to solve the constraint problem for weight diving depth and range the sea test result showed that not only the performance of designed auv satisfied the mission requirements but also the navigation performance is significantly improved the results proved the effectiveness of the design plan and showed that this plan provided a reference for the design of other underwater vehicles acknowledgments this research work is supported by the national high technology research and development

structural analysis referring to the u s navy auv master plan martz 2008 took into account seven factors which were power hull form resistance cost risk feasibility and efficiency and he proposed a conceptual design optimization method of auv based on a multi objective genetic algorithm based on the auv design requirement xuebin 2008 decomposed the auv system into one system control layer and five sub discipline layers which included observation subsystem communication subsystem control subsystem payload subsystem and power subsystem taking into account two objects functions of vehicle

optimization method further based on the classical framework of multidisciplinary optimization wei 2006 proposed one hierarchical bilevel framework of mdo methodology to auv design optimization which was the high controlling system level and low level of parallel individual subsystems the results were shown that it was suitable to maximize the payload length and thrust force of auv and minimize its gross weight based on multidisciplinary optimization design theory and uncertainty design theory peng 2009 investigated the intrinsic nondeterministic factor in auv design and proposed a collaborative optimization design method which was used in a certain micro auv design process to improve the design efficiency from the perspective of the user and the mission khairu 2012 proposed a steady optimization algorithm based on two random populations and applied it to the concept design of a micro auv considering the coupling effect among different subsystems mengyun 2015 used genetic algorithms to comprehensively optimize the auv rapidity and energy system and discovered that auv parameters such as the length of the parallel mid body and diameter of the gyrator were sensitive to the optimization result weilin 2015 considered hydrodynamic performances of auv in the design including the resistance and the maneuverability and proposed a collaborative optimization method into which particle swarm optimization pso was incorporated to improve the efficiency of optimization based on the aforementioned research this paper establishes a multidisciplinary concurrent subspace design frame of auv based on the radial basis function based high dimensional models analysis models for individual disciplines involved in the optimization frame such as the hull form structure propulsion energy maneuverability and general arrangement are established respectively based on which a concurrent subspace design based on the radial basis function based high dimensional models is performed and yields an optimal design that meet the design requirements which includes a weight of 300 kg class diving depth of 1000 m and range of 200 km performances of the vehicle before and after

theory in 1989 sobieski first proposed the concept of concurrent subspace optimization csso the basic tenet of csso is that each subgroup tried to minimize the system objective while trying to satisfy its own constraints and not preventing other groups from satisfying their constraints sobieszczanski sobieski 1989 csso is mainly used for non hierarchical structures so each subgroup independently optimizes a set of independent design variables in each subspace optimization process the state variables of this subspace will be obtained by subject analysis while other state variables and constraints will be determined by approximation strategies concurrent subspace design csd framework used in this paper is evolved from the fundamental structure of csso and it also contains three phases system analysis and decoupling concurrent subspace optimization and system approximation and coordination but optimal solutions of discipline needn t be obtained in the optimization process and feasible design solutions are provided for the system level so the database can be expanded for systems with computationally expensive system analysis csd is more efficient than conventional optimization since system analysis in csd are explicit in the system design variables and design searches in the approximate design space are very efficient csd also allows subspace designers to suggest new designs that are used to improve the response surfaces in a cyclic process batill et al 1999a b the system chart of csd is shown in fig 1 the common mathematical formulation of csd architecture is described as follows 1 m i n f x f i n d x s t g x 0 where f is the objective function x is the design variable g represents inequality constraints the optimization process of csd is as follows 1 system analysis according to the database of the last optimization cycle the system temporarily cuts off the connection between disciplines and transfers the optimal value of the last optimization cycle to the discipline as the baseline scheme 2 concurrent subspace design at this stage the variable x i in the ith discipline is local design variable while the design variable x j of other disciplines is fixed in the allocation of value in the baseline scheme the state variable y i of ith discipline is calculated by using high precision model while the state variable y j of other subjects is estimated by approximate model at this point the sub disciplines are no longer optimized but only subject analysis to submit feasible design plans to the system this feasible design scheme may not be optimal if it is assumed that there are n disciplines then the design problem of the ith discipline in the rth cycle is expressed as 2 f i n d x i r f x i r y i y i c a i x i r y j s t g x i r 0 where c a i is the system analysis function y j is the state variable of the ith discipline calculated by response surface 3 system analysis the feasible scheme obtained in step 2 is analyzed and the results are added to the database then the approximate models are updated 4 system level optimization in this stage all design variables x are optimized in the system layer and all state variables are calculated by the approximation model the system level optimization problem in the rth cycle can be expressed as 3 f i n d x i r m i n f x r s t g x i r 0 it is assumed that the optimal solution in this cycle is x r if x r meets the convergence condition the optimization process will be finished then the final optimization result is x x r otherwise f the x r is used as the value for the r 1 th cycle and the scheme is added to the database then the approximate model is updated just like the solution in csso the global optimal solution of csd also depends on the accuracy of the approximate model along with the iterative process the information of the system response surface around the optimal solution is gradually increased then the approximation model will be more accurate and it will eventually converge to the optimal solution of the system 2 1 2 example test the gear reducer example is used to test csso and csd the design objective is to find the minimum of a gear box volume subject to several constraints golinski 1970 1973 seven design variables and constraints represent in table 1 and table 2 respectively see table 3 following li 1989 golinski s speed reducer problem is decomposed into three discipline optimization subproblems and a system level optimization subproblem mathematically the system level optimization subproblem is specified as follows min f x

specified as follows min f x 1 0 7854 x g 1 x g 2 2 3 3333 x g 3 2 14 9334 x g 3 43 0934 s t g 1 1 g 2 1 g 8 1 0 g 9 1 0 for the discipline optimization subproblem 2 the shaft 1 diameter design variable x g 6 is optimized with all the others held fixed then the problem is specified as follows min f x 2 1 508 x g 6 2 x g 1 7 477 x g 6 3 0 7854 x g 4 x g 6 2 s t g 3 1 g 5 1 g 24 1 0 for the discipline optimization subproblem 3 the shaft 2 diameter design variable x g 7 is optimized with all the others held fixed then the problem is specified as follows min f x 3 1 508 x g 7 2 x g 1 7 477 x g 7 3 0 7854 x g 5 x g 7 2 s t g 4 1 g 6 1 0 g 11 1 0 different initial points are selected for this example and the optimal solution of design variables and design results in li 1989 are used as the reference values and the detailed parameters are depicted in table 4 root mean squared error rmse is applied to estimate the accuracy of design variables which is written as 4 r m s e i 1 7 x g i o p t x g i 2 7 where x g i is reference solution of ith design variable and x g i o p t is optimal solution of ith design variable the results are depicted in table 5 and table 6 the convergence histories are shown in fig 2 from these comparative results they are shown that the csd is not sensitive to the initial points so the optimality results obtained by csd match better the results found by li 1989 moreover csd has a great advantage in number of optimization analysis so csd requires fewer computing resources the example test demonstrates that csd is more efficient than csso 2 2 metamodeling for high dimensional simulation based design problems 2 2 1 the radial basis function based high dimensional model representation the metamodeling techniques e g polynomial regression kriging and radial basis function rbf have been extensively used in costly simulation based engineering design and optimization to facilitate the design efficiency sharvari and senthilnath 2012 and hongbing and mark 2006 the conventional metamodeling techniques have been found to work well for low dimensional problems but when increasing the dimensionality because of the accompanying curse of dimensionality the efficiency and accuracy of the popular metamodeling techniques will decrease sharply as a promising approximation method for high dimensional problems the high dimensional model representation hdmr method was first introduced by sobol 1993 and shan 2010 proposed a rbf hdmr method by using rbf and an accompanying sampling method to model the component functions in hdmr compared to current metamodeling techniques numerical experiments revealed that rbf hdmr is very promising for approximating high dimensional problems this paper employs rbf hdmr models which will be introduced in the following let x x 1 x 2 x n 0 1 n be a point with n input variables in the unit space and f x be the output response a hdmr model is expressed as haitao et al 2017 5 f x f 0 i 1 n f i x i 1 i j n f i j x i x j 1 i 1 i l n f i 1 i 2 i l x i 1 x i 2 x i l f 12 n x 1 x 2 x n where f 0 represents the 0th order effect on the output f x f i x i is the effect of x i on f x f i j x i x j describes the correlated contribution of x i and x j on f x after removing the individual effects f 12 n x 1 x 2 x n denotes the residual effect of all the variables acting together on f x after all the lower order correlations and individual effects have been removed by using the rbf type model to approximate the component functions in eq 5 rbf hdmr can be expanded to the second order as 6 f ˆ x f 0 i 1 n f ˆ i x i 1 i j n f ˆ i j x i x j where f ˆ i a 1d rbf model is the approximation of the first order component function f i and f ˆ i j a 2d rbf model approximates the second order component function f i j suppose that x i x i x 0 i t contains the first order points on the i th cut line and y i f i x i t contains the associated first order component function responses and x i contains the i th column of x i then f ˆ i in eq 6 is built using the point set x i and the response set y i similarly x i j x i x j x 0 i j t contains the second order points on the i j cut plane and y i j f i j x i x j t contains the associated second order component function responses x i j has the i th and j th columns of x i j the second order rbf model f ˆ i j is built using x i j and y i j finally the flowchart of the second order rbf hdmr metamodeling process is shown in fig 3 and it is shown that the rbf hdmr as compared with other metamodels fundamentally reduces the number of calls to the expensive simulation in order to build a metamodel thus breaks alleviates exponentially increasing computational difficulty songqing 2010 2 2 2 dividing rectangles sampling method in this study dividing rectangles direct sampling method jones 1993 is used to construct rbf hdmr model the main idea of direct is to find all the local extreme points so as to identify the global minimum points in the various parameters of the ranges within the search the method has a very fast rate of convergence and it is robust to local optimum thus it is suitable for the hdmr zhiyuan et al 2015 the direct algorithm transforms the design space into the unit hyper cube finkel 2003 and it is described as 7 ω x x 1 x 2 x d r d 0 x i 1 the algorithm runs in this normalized space referring to the original space only when corresponding function is evaluated the center of this space is c 1 and its value is f c 1 then it divides the hyper cube into d smaller hyper rectangles by evaluating the objective function at sampling points c i δ e i i 1 2 d where δ equals 1 3 of the side length of the cube and e i is the ith unit vector the direct algorithm chooses to leave the best function values in the largest space such that 8 w i min f c i δ e i f c i δ e i 1 i d the dimension with the smallest w i is divided into thirds so that c i δ e i are the centers of the new hyper rectangles this pattern is repeated for all dimensions on the center hyper rectangle and the next dimension is determined by the next smallest w i the most important strategy for direct is how to choose potentially optimal hyper rectangles the direct searches locally and globally by dividing all hyper rectangles according to following criteria a hyper rectangle j is said to be potential optimal if there exists some k 0 such that for an arbitrarily small ε 0 9 f c i k d i f c j k d j 1 i d 10 f c i k d i f m i n ε f m i n where f m i n is the best function value found up to now and ε is used here to protect the algorithm against excessive local bias in the search the algorithm evaluates all the new hyperrectangle at their centers then it identifies the set of potentially optimal hyperrectangles in this paper the procedure of direct combined with rbf hdmr is outlined in table 7 2 2 3 example test to assess the accuracy of the metamodel the proposed rbf hdmr method has been tested using a number of well known mathematical examples jin et al 2001 presented in table 8 the rbf hdmr is constructed according to the process described in fig 3 for the rbf second order response surface model rsm 2 and kriging the method of optimal latin hypercube design is used in the design of experiment and the comparison results are summarized in table 9 statistic criterions r square r2 relative root mean square error rrmse relative maximum absolute error rmae are applied to estimate the accuracy of the current metamodel the expressions for these three criteria are given in following equations respectively 11 r 2 1 i 1 m f x i f ˆ x i 2 i 1 m f x i f x i 2 where f ˆ x i is the corresponding approximated value for the observed value f x i f x i denotes the mean of all the observed values 12 r r m s e i 1 m f x i f ˆ x i 2 m std where std represents the standard deviation of the observed value f x i 13 r m a e max f x i f ˆ x i std according to table 9 rbf hdmr combined with direct outperforms other methods in most cases with respect to all metrics which all the results of are good enough for high dimensional problems the results are also shown that the method has a great advantage in number of sample points utilized the direct sampling strategy it can construct the approximate model with less sample number and better prediction accuracy and does not need a large number of sample points for the modeling like other methods the example test demonstrates that it will be reliable 3 description of the optimization problem in the problem of mdo of underwater vehicles in this paper the design objective is to minimize the vehicle weight under the condition that the range and working depth are fulfilled the vehicle configuration before optimization is shown in fig 4 the shape of underwater vehicle consists of three parts nose section middle section and tail section the inflow section in the nose region is semi oval profile and the flow section in the tail region is low resistance profile the middle section is a parallel mid body structure to increase the effective volume of the hull and free space are left to meet the future needs of different payload configuration in engineering applications considering equipment convenient deployment the bottom of entire hull is flat the nose region primarily carries the sensors such as a collision avoidance sonar and a camera the middle region primarily carries equipment such as the pressure cabin batteries and some loads the tail region carries equipment such as the propulsion motor steering motor propeller and rudders 3 1 discipline model establishment to satisfy the requirements of weight diving depth and range the conceptual design plan should be optimized further by the multidisciplinary design method based on the discipline division method proposed by charle 2002 auv design contents are divided into six disciplines hull form discipline structure discipline propulsion discipline energy discipline maneuverability discipline and general arrangement discipline among them hull form discipline is coupled with maneuverability discipline and general arrangement discipline structure discipline energy discipline and maneuverability discipline are coupled with general arrangement discipline the detailed system decomposition is shown in fig 5 3 1 1 discipline of the hull form establishment the discipline of the hull form is to obtain the optimal solution with minimum resistance under the constraint of a certain displacement so the shape of hull and appendage are considered and some parameters are defined in fig 6 and table 10 the total length of auv can be determined by 14 l l n h u l l l m h u l l l t h u l l the middle section is shown as the radius of body at each axial position along the centerline the nose section is considered as an incomplete ellipse and the tail section is considered as an incomplete parabola they are described by the nystrom curve function which begins from the maximum diameter of the vehicle and ends at the base diameter and nose section function y n x and tail section function y t x are described as 15 x d 2 1 x l n h u l l n n 1 n n 0 x l n 0 y n x d 2 16 y t x d 2 1 x l t h u l l n t 0 x l t 0 y t x d 2 where x is the span length along the centerline between certain position in curve and maximum cross section of the nose section and tail section n n and n t are adjustable parameters of bow curve and stern curve appendages of auv consist of two parts rudders and antennae shell rudders are designed as the same trapezoidal shape but surface area of horizontal rudder and vertical rudder are different for the different requirement of maneuverability which are calculated in section 3 1 5 usually b r is constrained as a constant for the requirement of install and maintain in this paper d r is considered as the diameter of body at the position of rudder shaft as the installation location of rudders are often fixed d r is supposed as a constant then c r r is also supposed as a constant from the reference ting 2013 c r is determined by 17 c r 2 a r b r d r c r is often designed as the average value of c t r and c r r so c t is calculated by 18 c t r 4 a r b r d r c r r antennae shell is defined as the rudder design the span and trailing edge are designed as the fixed size as some antennas are set on the top of antennae shell so the tip chord length is also definite angle a is an adjustable parameter of leading edge which has influence on the shape of antennae shell considering the water flow interference between rudders and antennae shell l s is treated as factors in the parameterized modeling in this discipline the low drag profile of auv under the constraint of a certain displacement is to be obtained therefore the optimization problem can be described as follows variables x h u l l l n h u l l l t h u l l l m h u l l d n n n t l s a obj fun f h u l l m i n r x h u l l s t g 1 h u l l 0 75

represents molded volume of auv r represents the resistance of hull g 1 h u l l g 2 h u l l g 3 h u l l g 4 h u l l g 5 h u l l g 6 h u l l g 7 h u l l represents inequality constraints and superscript hull represents the discipline of the hull form techniques for estimating the drag of an auv can be done by means of tools originally developed for predicting the hydrodynamic coefficients of ship and submarines so the hull is modelled by fluid computational software to analyze the resistance performance xu et al 2018 based on the motion characteristics of the vehicle to ensure a fully developed flow field the calculation control domain is a cylindrical domain the computation domain extends 1 5 times length of the vehicle in front of the bow and extends 3 times length of the vehicle at the back of the rear it also extends 1 5 times length of the vehicle along the width and depth direction in the calculation a hybrid grid is used to divide the computational grid area into two parts the internal flow field containing the hull and the external flow field in order to adapt to the shapes of the appendages unstructured grids are used in the internal flow field to control grids size and nodes density the external flow field is composed of structural hexahedron grids and prism grids to reduce grids quantity and improve grids quality for the liquid viscosity influence structured grids near the auv surface are used to maintain the accuracy of cfd simulation the grids of calculate domain are shown in fig 7 captive model tests were conducted to validate the cfd simulations the tests were carried out in the circulating water tunnel of the state key laboratory of science and technology on autonomous underwater vehicles at harbin engineering university in china the length of the test model is 1 46m and its diameter is 0 214m which is shown in fig 8 in fig 9 and table 12 it indicates that results gained by cfd match well the test values at different velocity and the numerical simulation procedure can be used to simulate the experiments with an acceptable level of accuracy so the optimization platform based on it will be reliable see table 13 14 15 3 1 2 discipline of structure establishment underwater vehicle structure design includes the pressure cabin design and hull framework structure design for the former it mainly considers the ultimate bearing capability of its yield stress under a large diving depth however the latter not only has to meet the requirement of the equipment loading but also considers some special issues such as the hull longitudinal strength local strength under the surf slamming and opening structure reinforcement 3 1 2 1 pressure cabin design the pressure cabin consists of a cabin shell and hatches the structure of cabin shell is cylindrical shell with outer ring ribs which is made of 7075 aluminum alloy material the structure of hatches is flat head which is made of titanium alloy to improve the sealing reliability both the axial sealing and radial sealing are applied the pressure cabin and head are shown in fig 10 the low weight of pressure cabin w c a b i n under the constraint of working depth is to be obtained therefore the optimization problem can be described as follows variables x c a b i n l c a b i n t c a b i n d c a b i n t f l a n g e h f l a n g e n r i b t r i b h r i b t h e a d obj fun f c a b i n m i n w x c a b i n s t g 1 c a b i n 0 045 c a b i n 0 g 2 c a b i n 18 p h 0 g 3 c a b i n σ 1 435 0 g 4 c a b i n σ 2 840 0 where c a b i n represents volume of pressure cabin w represents the weight function g 1 c a b i n g 2 c a b i n g 3 c a b i n g 4 c a b i n represent inequality constraints p h represents yield stress of pressure cabin σ 1 and σ 2 represent material stress values used in cabin shell and hatches respectively techniques for estimating the stress of a pressure cabin can also be done by means of tools based on these parameters and rules for the classification and construction of submersible systems and submersibles 2013 an approximate computational model is constructed in parametric design language by ansys software in the computational model the solid186 elements are selected as element division in the yield analysis both ends of the cabin shell are under full constraints and the maximum working pressure is imposed to an external surface of the cabin shell for the static analysis the results are shown in fig 11 3 1 2 2 hull framework structure design the hull framework structure is made of carbon fiber composite material and the integrated manufacture process of hull is adopted to reduce the number of connectors and assembly parts so the structure weight can be reduced the hull structure is composed of the light shell and strengthening bulkheads hull sections are connected by the transverse strengthening bulkheads and both sides of hull are strengthened by the longitudinal bulkheads as shown in fig 12 the longitudinal bulkheads and transverse bulkheads are structures that not only strengthen the shell but also provide space for internal equipment installation to improve the overall longitudinal strength of hull and reduce the weight at the same time the buoyance material is poured between the shell and longitudinal bulkheads to form a sandwich layer structure so as to increase the overall longitudinal strength as shown in fig 13 for the condition of dual point lifting two lifting points of hull frame are set as the fixed rigidity points where the translational degree of freedom and rotational degree of freedom are constrained in all directions the basic load is equal to the weight of auv in the air in addition some factors have to be considered such as the sea wave slamming the acceleration motion during the lifting and recovery process additional seawater mass when emerging from the water and the collision with obstacle seafloor or mothership then the design load is obtained by multiplying the basic load by the dynamic load coefficient the low weight of hull framework structure w f r a m e under the constraint of auv weight is to be obtained and it is in relation to the hull parameters and numbers of carbon fiber layers the hull parameters are obtained in the discipline of the hull form therefore the optimization problem in discipline of structure can be described as follows variables x

n 1 n 2 n 3 represent numbers of hull layers longitudinal bulkhead layers and transverse bulkhead layers σ l i f t d l i f t represent max stress and max deformation of hull frame structure in the lifting condition σ f i x d f i x represent max stress and max deformation of hull frame structure in the fastening condition b c are dynamic coefficient the strength evaluation of hull framework is based on the stress and deformation under the hull lifting conditions since the carbon fiber materials are anisotropic materials based on lamination theory the approximate calculation model of the hull framework is constructed by ansys software in the model structural connections are assumed to be coupled and the shell99 composite material elements are selected for geometrical model meshing all shells are cut into regular shapes and all surfaces are divided into quadrilateral grids as much as possible to improve computational accuracy which is shown in fig 14 3 1 3 discipline of propulsion establishment for the propulsion system as the input power p s of propulsion motor is converted into effective power p e energy loss is inevitable thus it is expected to obtain the optimal solution with low energy loss usually the expression is written as follows 19 p s p e η d η s η r η 0 η h where η d represents the motor efficiency η s represents the machinery efficiency η r represents the relative rotational efficiency η 0 represents the open water efficiency and η h represents hull efficiency normally p e is determined as follows 20 p e r v where r represented the total resistance of vehicle and v represented the vehicle speed then formula 19 can be written as 21 p s r v η d η s η r η 0 η h usually it is supposed that η s 1 η r 1 η h 1 as the rotation speed of propeller is often low the motor has to work in the condition of low speed so it is supposed that η d 0 8 η 0 depends on the propeller diameter rpm and number of blades in this paper the dual blade propeller is used thus η 0 is related to the propeller diameter d p r o p e l l e r propeller pitch b p r o p e l l e r propeller chord length c p r o p e l l e r rotating speed of propeller w 1 and w 2 at cruise speed and maximum speed therefore the optimization problem in discipline of propulsion can be described as follows variables x p r o p u l s i o n d p r o p e l l e r b p r o p e l l e r c p r o p e l l e r

propeller can also be done by means of tools the propeller is designed by the method proposed by ting 2013 and an approximate computational model is constructed by ansys software and cfd software to calculate its performance 3 1 4 discipline of energy establishment the energy configuration of auv depends on the tasks that it can perform and the range of travel which comprises two parts the energy consumed by hotel load e h and the energy consumed by propulsion e p e p is defined as the power going directly into the propulsion motor and e h is defined as the power used by the onboard systems computers sensors etc although not necessarily constant in time for a real auv e h is assumed to be constant within this model then it is approximated by 22 e h v i i i t i where v i and i i are the voltage and current of ith electric instrument t i is the operating hours of ith electric instrument to simplify the problem of determining e p the auv motion is restricted to the vertical plane and it is assumed that the vehicle maintains constant depth hence turning and depth changes are ignored under these circumstances e p is modelled as 23 e p p s t where t is the endurance of auv mission and it is defined as 24 t r a n g e v finally total required energy e is determined by 25 e p s r a n g e v v i i i t i in the model the self developed underwater battery is used the energy density of battery is ρ e and the mass density is ρ m then the weight w e n e r g y and volume e n e r g y of batteries can be derived as 26 w e n e r g y e ρ m 27 e n e r g y e ρ e the low weight of batteries under the constraint of working range is to be obtained and p s will be determined in discipline of propulsion therefore the optimization problem can be described as follows variables x e n e r g y v

inequality constraints 3 1 5 discipline of maneuverability establishment in order to simplify the calculation it is assumed that roll motion of auv is not big so the motion of auv can be decomposed into the motion in the horizontal plane and vertical plane in this paper high maneuverability of auv is to obtained in the horizontal plane then the stability coefficient k h c k h β and steady turning diameter d s are important indicators of maneuverability of auv they are given as 28 k h c n r y v y v m y r 29 k h β n v y v 30 d s 2 n v m y r n r y v δ n v y δ n δ y v where y v n v represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient generated by sway motion respectively y r n r represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient generated by yaw motion respectively y δ n δ represent hydrodynamic forces and moments coefficient generated by rudder respectively obviously the maneuverability performance of auv is closely related to the shape of hull and appendage and rudder area a r the shape of hull and appendage will be confirmed in the discipline of the hull form thus he optimization problem can be described as follows variables x m a n e u v e r a b i l i t y a r obj

maneuverability g 3 maneuverability represent inequality constraints d represents the steady turning diameter function δ represents rudder angle in the primary design phase the hull is not definite so empirical formulas have to be used to estimate hydrodynamics derivatives of auv it is assumed that the hydrodynamic derivatives of auv are equal to the sum of the hydrodynamic coefficients of bare hull and appendages so some hydrodynamic coefficient expressions are determined as 31 y v y v h y v a 32 n v n v h n v a 33 y r y r h y r a 34 n r n r h n r a 35 y δ y δ a r 36 n δ n δ a r where y h n

length along the centerline between end of tail section and rudder 3 1 6 discipline of general arrangement establishment in the general arrangement the shapes and installation requirements of equipment are different so it is extremely difficult to use a mathematical function to describe the interaction among them therefore the rule that the equipment are arranged close to each other but not in such a way that they interfere with each other is abided by buoyance material are often arranged in the hull to keep the auv balance so it is assumed that the weight of buoyance material is m b u o y a n c e and the distance along the centerline between end of tail section and its position is l b u and the distance between bottom and its position is h b u then auv gravity center x g y g z g represent as 53 x g m x i m b u o y a n c e l b u w m b u o y a n c e 54 y g m y i w m b u o y a n c e 55 z g m z i m b u o y a n c e h b u w m b u o y a n c e where m x i m y i and m z i represent the weight moments of ith module in auv and w represents the gross weight of the modules excluded buoyance material similarly the buoyancy center of auv are written as 56 x c m c x i m c b u o y a n c e l b u δ m c b u o y a n c e 57 y c m c y i δ m c b u o y a n c e 58 z c m c z i m c b u o y a n c e h b u δ m c b u o y a n c e where m c x i m c y i and m c z i represent the buoyancy moments of i t h module in auv m c b u o y a n c e represents the buoyancy of buoyancy material δ represents the sum of the buoyancies of all parts excluded buoyance material then the metacenter height h is determined as follows 59 h z c z g if a longitudinal inclination along the x direction appears the expression for the static trim angle is written as 60 tan φ 0 x c x g z c z g as the weight of auv is equal to its buoyancy so m b u o y a n c e and m c b u o y a n c e are written as m b u o y a n c e ρ b u w δ ρ w a t e r m c b u o y a n c e w δ where ρ b u represents density of buoyance and ρ w a t e r represents density of sea water usually if it doesn t cost much energy to keep the stable movement auv need have big steady metacenter height and small trim angle in the hydrostatic performance in other disciplines the buoyancy and weight of each part can be obtained thus the optimization problem can be described as follows variables x a r r a n g e m e n t l b u h b u obj fun f a r r a n g e m

metacenter height of no design optimization and its value is 0 02 which is estimated in fig 4 3 2 optimization problem 3 2 1 objective function in this research the weight index is optimized based on the working ability of auv the most important parameters that are diving depth and voyage the objective function is considered based on the minimum total weight w of auv thus the weighted sum of all

subspace design method is used to improve the overall performance of auv to the maximum extent see table 16 in some references ting et al 2016 yan et al 2017 the comparison results of optimizer are shown that multi island genetic optimization algorithm mgo spent more time but it is a consistently perfect process and the optimization distinctly approaches the ideal outcome so mgo is selected to find the optimization results in system level analysis the corresponding parameter settings are shown in table 17 the optimization is implemented on a 24 core cpu with a 1 8 ghz base clock the optimization process is shown in fig 16 the optimization results are shown in table 18 from fig 16 it shows the convergence history for runs the results of run converge to the same value that shows the good convergence capability of csd architecture from table 18 it indicates that the optimization results in an 27 decrease of weight which is mainly due to the decrease of batteries weight by decrease of resistance compared to the vehicle before optimization l n h u l l of the optimal vehicle is increased by 60 l t h u l l of the optimal vehicle is increased by 27 5 and d of the optimal vehicle is reduced by 11 7 which lead to forward movement of the center of pressure decrease of resistance and increase of cruise duration then the cruise range is increased and w e n e r g y is reduced h is increased 290 which causes increase of static instability d s and φ 0 are reduced 21 5 and77 2 respectively which improves the maneuverability performance reduces of energy consumption from table 8 it is shown that design parameters obtained by optimization algorithms can improve the performance of auv to some extent therefore the design parameters optimized are selected for the final design of the auv and the design results are shown in fig 17 according to design parameters and design schemes the underwater vehicle is manufactured due to the influence of production process the actual dimensions are slightly different from the optimization design parameters the dimensions of some parts produced are shown in table 19 and the shape of auv is shown in fig 18 4 test verification the optimization results are gained to evaluate the overall performance of auv by the coupled analysis of multiple disciplines in the paper so they are interdisciplinary trade offs and each one is maybe not the most optimal result for the single discipline thus it is maybe difficult to re evaluate them by cfd ting et al 2016 and yan et al 2017 to verify if the performance of auv designed satisfied the mission requirements auv undergoes a standardized sea test organized by the ministry of science and technology of the people s republic of china the test is carried out in the south china sea which lasts for 10 days the major test contents included weight diving depth and voyage in auv weight test the actual weight in air was 395 kg which was different from the optimization result of 365 kg the primary reason was that it was difficult to calculate accurate weight of the watertight cables watertight connectors and bolts at the initial design stage therefore those weights were omitted in the optimization design which caused differences between the actual underwater vehicle weight and the optimization result see fig 19 the depth test was conducted nearby the sea region 17 14 319 n 110 16 692 e during the test auv dove to the working depth of 1000m and navigated for a certain period then ascended to the surface auv diving depth and navigation state were evaluated based on sensor data which were shown in fig 20 the results showed that auv kept moving steadily for 302 min at the depth of 1000 m the steady navigation speed was approximately 1 7 m s and the travel range was approximately 30 km the pressure resistance of the entire underwater vehicle was fully verified because auv was pushed forward by a single propeller when the propeller rotated it would inevitably produce a counter rotating torque on the hull in the transverse direction and then roll angle of hull would appear from the data it could be seen that the roll angle was kept at a relatively small value under a combined force of the transverse inclination recovery moment and fluid force and then it had no significant impact on the navigation performance of the entire vehicle body so it was shown that the transverse metacenter height designed was rational the travel range test was performed in an offshore sea area near18 02 830 n 110 02 0226 e during the test a position near the mother ship was defined as the return point navigation path in the range test was a square which four vertices of were calculated by the planning program auv kept moving along the lines connecting the four points at the depth of 40 m after every 5 h auv floated up to the surface to calibrate its position by gps the test lasted for 36 h the track recorded in the experiment was shown in fig 21 the results of travel range were shown in table 20 from table 20 it could be seen that auv navigation lasted for nearly 40 h and the navigation distance reached 249 km which exceeded the design requirement of 200 km so it proved the validity and effectiveness of the hull form design and power configuration in the design plan these test results fully validated the effectiveness and reliability of the optimization design plan 5 conclusions in this paper six factors i e the hull form structure propulsion power maneuverability and general arrangement are considered based on the concurrent subspace design framework underwater vehicle design parameters are determined by optimization method to solve the constraint problem for weight diving depth and range the sea test result showed that not only the performance of designed auv satisfied the mission requirements but also the navigation performance is significantly improved the results proved the effectiveness of the design plan and showed that this plan provided a reference for the design of other underwater vehicles acknowledgments this research work is supported by the national high technology research and development

22729,a shared multiline anchor system may reduce material and installation costs for floating offshore wind farms but the concept also expands the physical space over which the analysis of the system must be considered the multiline anchor force is a combination of forces that originate from different floating offshore wind turbine fowt platforms and this interconnectivity mandates investigation of spatial coherence of waves over the area of the connected turbines the goal of this work is to determine if anchor force characteristics are sensitive to spatial coherence of the wave field or if an assumption of independent wave fields at different fowt locations provides sufficiently accurate anchor load characterizations spatially coherent irregular wave fields are generated and applied to fowt systems in 3 line and 6 line anchor systems revealing negligible sensitivity of multiline anchor force to wave spatial coherence these results are continued with a parametric study showing how wave characteristics affect correlation lengths of spatially coherent waves a review of installed offshore wind turbine spacings is presented as a context for these results in each section regular waves are first used to examine the dynamics in a simple context then irregular waves are used to more realistically simulate ocean conditions keywords floating turbines wind energy spatial waves wave coherence multiline anchors turbine spacing abbreviations fowt floating offshore wind turbine wwc wind wave current slc survival load case jonswap joint north sea wave project 1 introduction as the offshore wind industry trends towards deeper water locations the need for floating offshore wind technology becomes more important u s department of energy 2016 however the additional support structure demands present in floating offshore wind turbines fowts currently prevent them from being cost competitive with fixed bottom turbines mone et al 2015 one potential way to address this high cost hurdle is a multiline anchor concept in which fowts share anchors to reduce the total number of anchors required as shown in fig 1 fontana et al 2017 a key difference in this novel anchoring concept is that the forces acting on the multiline anchor come from multiple turbines at several different locations in the wind farm as compared to the conventional single line anchor which only sees forces from one fowt at one location this interconnectedness of the system through shared anchor points creates the need to evaluate the loading of the multiline anchors on a multi turbine spatio temporally coherent scale since demands on the multiline anchor depend on the motions of multiple platforms at different locations in the wind farm the goal of this work is to determine if characteristics of the anchor loads are sensitive to spatial coherence of the wave field as it moves through an offshore floating wind farm or whether an assumption of independence of the wave fields at different fowt locations provides sufficiently accurate anchor load characterizations this investigation of spatial wave coherence in multiline anchor systems will inform more accurate numerical modeling an essential task when obtaining meaningful results for this novel system determining the importance of spatial wave coherence in multiline anchor force modeling is also a valuable outcome for all future multiline anchor analysis as the simulations of spatially coherent waves are significantly more complex than those of independent wave fields especially as the scale of the wind farm and number of wind turbines increase for the purposes of this study wind fields are assumed to be spatially independent at different fowt locations however wake effects could play a role in governing multiline anchor forces and this topic is a subject of ongoing study by the authors furthermore directional spreading of the sea state is not considered in any case because unidirectional sea states are assumed to have more impact on the multiline anchor loads there are many examinations of spatial wave characteristics in published literature but far fewer have looked at the wave surface over a large distance and have mostly been limited to extreme and freak waves latifah and groesen 2012 focused on estimating the position and time of a freak wave event given a time signal and phase information at a certain position alvise et al 2017 analyzed the temporal profile and height of space time extreme wind waves using real wave data in efforts to verify estimations of the shape and the crest to trough height of near focusing large 3d wave groups other research on spatial characteristics of waves has been focused on the evolution of statistical wavefield parameters shemer and sergeeva 2009 generated unidirectional random waves in 300 m wave tank to analyze changes in the frequency spectrum of the wavefield over the distance of travel additionally sergeeva et al 2013 generated numerical simulations of unidirectional spatio temporal wave evolutions with a focus on rogue wave occurrence and propagation as a distinction one of the novel outcomes of this research is the examination of the correlation coefficient of wave elevation time histories at two different points in space furthermore this research examines wave correlation and coherence over larger distances 1000 m than most previous studies the results of this study on spatial wave coherence are not limited to use in fowts with multiline anchor systems design of wave energy converters wecs may also benefit from better understanding of spatial wave coherence as it could potentially be used to optimize the layout within an array such that each wec experiences the largest waves and in effect produces the most power balitsky et al 2017 in addition wave energy converters may also be a well suited candidate for multiline anchor system applications the role of spatial wave coherence in determining multiline anchor forces is addressed with numerical simulations of a multiline anchor connected to fowts loaded by spatially coherent and independent waves this paper first examines the effect of spatial wave coherence in a multiline anchor system for semisubmersible fowts then expands upon these results with an examination of just waves realizations no fowt to determine how wave characteristics affect the wave correlation lengths in both of these sections regular waves are first used to examine the dynamics in a simple context then irregular waves are used to more accurately simulate real world conditions results are presented in the context of real spacings of installed offshore wind farms 2 multiline anchor force this section examines a multiline anchor connected to fowts subjected to both regular and irregular wave loading in this context use of the terms in phase versus out of phase to describe waves at the platforms is specific to regular waves while use of the terms coherent versus independent are specific to irregular waves the first goal of this section is to establish the range of the multiline anchor force for the case where the platforms connected to the anchor are loaded by in phase versus out of phase regular waves the following subsection then uses irregular waves to determine if the multiline anchor force dynamics are a function of wave coherence 2 1 software and turbine model simulation of fowt dynamics was accomplished with national renewable energy laboratory s computer aided engineering tool fast fast v8 is a comprehensive coupled aero hydro servo elastic simulator capable of predicting motions and loads in the time domain jonkman and jonkman 2016 jonkman and buhl jr 2005 the turbine chosen for this analysis is the national renewable energy laboratory s nrel 5 mw reference turbine which was developed to be representative of a typical utility scale turbine and is widely used in the wind energy research community jonkman et al 2009 the fowt support structure chosen for this study is the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible platform in 200 m water depth coulling et al 2013a b robertson et al 2014 which is based largely on the deepcwind scaled test floater robertson et al 2013 and consists of a ballast supported tri floater with three large cylindrical columns acting as pontoons which are connected to a central main column that supports the tower and rotor nacelle assembly robertson et al 2014 the deepcwind oc4 semisubmersible floating system was chosen because it employs the most commonly studied platform type semisubmersible and mooring system type catenary in current fowt technology concepts carbon trust 2015 mooring line and anchor force dynamics were simulated via moordyn a lumped mass mooring model within fast hall 2017 seabed friction forces on the mooring line are not currently included in this model and therefore were applied in a post processing routine outlined in fontana et al 2018 capturing seabed friction forces in a postprocessing routine is possible for this model since the anchor is treated as a fixed point on the seabed surface and the reverse catenary curvature of the mooring line under the soil is not considered fontana et al 2018 the hydrodynamics model includes 2nd order mean drift and slow drift effects on the floating platform using the full difference frequency quadratic transfer functions jonkman et al 2015 the spatial layouts of the conventional single line and novel multiline fowt systems are shown in fig 2 the multiline layout was obtained by taking the layout of the default oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible system and patterning it such that the anchor points overlapped the key takeaway of this method is that the mooring system layout of each turbine the distance of each anchor from the turbine is unchanged between the single line fig 2a and the multiline systems fig 2b and c patterning the default system in this way results in a turbine spacing of 1451 m this spatial layout of the mooring system was generated from the default mooring design and the floating system could of course be designed for different radial distances from fairlead to anchor the interconnectivity of the turbines in fig 2b and c exhibits the need to examine whether the spatial coherence of the waves in the multiline system affects the anchor forces significantly compared to the configuration of the turbines in fig 2a where each anchor s load depends only on the dynamics of a single fowt to determine the net force on an anchor being loaded by multiple mooring lines simultaneously simulations of single line fowts are completed then post processed as shown in fig 3 the net multiline anchor force is computed by the vector sum of the contributing single line tensions since the mooring system is catenary the contributing mooring lines tensions t1 t2 and t3 are purely horizontal parallel with the seabed therefore the resultant force on the multiline anchor tmulti is also horizonal furthermore anchors are modeled as fixed points at the seabed surface in fast therefore anchor characteristics like geometry and embedment depth are not relevant in this study it can be observed that the magnitude and direction of the net multiline anchor force is a function of the contributing line tensions the net multiline anchor force is controlled by the maximum contributing critical single line tension while the smaller cancelling tensions create a reduction in this force this is where wave coherence between connected turbines is most important as the magnitude of this reduction depends on the timing of the cancellation tension relative to the critical tension 2 2 multiline anchor force with unidirectional regular waves the goal of this section is to determine the differences between the net multiline anchor force produced under perfectly in phase and out of phase regular wave loading on the connected platforms in phase loading refers to regular wave crests acting on the connected fowt platforms simultaneously fig 4 a and out of phase loading refers to wave crests and troughs acting on the connected platforms simultaneously fig 4b these two cases represent bounding limiting realizations of the way that spatially coherent irregular waves may affect multiline anchor loads equation of the regular wave surface η in the time domain is 1 η x t a cos k x ω t ϕ where k is wave number x is distance ω is wave frequency t is time a is regular wave amplitude h 2 and ϕ is the random phase for simplification in describing the effects of wave phase relative to line tension and anchor force the following analysis focuses only on the 3 line anchor system fig 4 reveals how the timing of the cancellation tension relative to the critical tension affects the cycle amplitude and maximum of the net multiline anchor force it should be noted that wind forces are not included in fig 4 but will be incorporated later in this section to better understand these cases the dynamics of the fowt mooring system must first be examined wave elevation platform displacement and line tension are all tightly correlated when a wave strikes and displaces a fowt platform in its direction of travel the upwind line t2 experiences peak tension while the downwind lines t1 and t3 simultaneously experience a minimum tension conversely when a wave trough comes in contact the platform displaces opposite the wave direction of travel and in effect the upwind line t2 experiences a minimum tension while the downwind lines t1 and t3 experience peak tensions it should be noted however that these are general descriptions of the temporal relationship between wave strike platform displacement surge heave pitch and line tension as there can be significant and varying time delays between these events depending on the wave characteristics and the shape of the floating platform fig 4a is a specific example in which there is negligible time delay and the peak minimum tensions are nearly simultaneous with the wave strike on the platform when critical and cancelling contributing tensions are out of phase the amplitude and maximum of the net multiline anchor force are maximized fig 4a conversely when the critical and cancelling single line tensions are in phase the amplitude and maximum of the net multiline anchor force is minimized fig 4b this behavior is related to interference in that waves in phase at the connected platforms produce contributing line tensions with constructive interference while waves out of phase at the connected platforms produces contributing line tensions with destructive interference spatial characteristics namely wavelength are not considered in this step because it is not possible to compare the same wave acting on the connected platforms in both an in phase and out of phase scenario when spacing between the fowts is held constant in order to produce perfectly in phase and out of phase wave loading of a certain wave height on the set of platforms in a multiline system the waves would need to have slightly different wavelengths and periods a wave train with n waves over a distance of 1257 m see fig 2b is different than a wave train with n ½ waves over the same distance for example a 6 m regular in phase wave i e 10 waves between the platforms has a wavelength of 125 7 m and a wave period of 8 97 s in contrast a 6 m regular out of phase wave 10 5 waves between the platforms has a wavelength of 119 7 m and a wave period of 8 75 s wavelength is determined by converting wave period to angular frequency then using angular frequency and the water depth of 200 m in the linear dispersion relationship dnv 2007 to determine wave number k and in effect wavelength instead the steady state minima and maxima of the line tensions produced under regular wave loading are used to examine the magnitude of the anchor force produced by different sized regular waves more specifically the regular wave scenario is used here to evaluate the question where given a sea state regular wave height what is the best minimum and worst maximum loading on the multiline anchor the minimum and maximum values of the maximum net multiline anchor force for all wave loading cases fig 5 are found by offsetting the time between the critical and cancelling line tensions such that the maximum critical and minimum cancelling tensions are aligned in time in phase waves at the platforms or the maximum critical and maximum cancelling tensions are aligned out of phase waves at the platforms as previously shown in fig 4 the effect of wave phase at the platforms is examined over a range of wave heights and periods in this context wave period factor t f is a value used in calculating wave period given by 2 t t f h g where t is wave period h is wave height and g is gravity values of 11 and 14 for t f are chosen to be close to the lower and upper bounds of this value as recommended in iec 61400 2009 furthermore the 0 wave direction is used for the entirety of this section because it is the most critical load direction case meaning that it produces larger maximum single line and multiline anchor forces than those of the 30 and 60 case therefore it is of the most interest relative to the effects of wave phases results are shown in fig 5 in general the range variance of the net multiline anchor force relative to wave phase at connected platforms increases with wave height the local maxima of anchor force that occurs at the 5 m wave height for t f 11 t 7 9 s and at the 3 m wave height for t f 11 t 7 7 s is due to the mean drift of the platforms this mean drift force results from closeness of these wave frequencies to the rigid body motion natural frequencies for the semisubmersible and its mooring system details on mean drift forces in the nrel semisubmersible floating system can be found in coulling et al 2013 the mean drift or mean surge displaces the platform in the direction of the waves resulting on a higher mean tension on the critical line t2 and a lower tension on the cancelling lines t1 and t3 it is this higher mean tension in critical line t2 that amplifies on the maximum force for the wave periods close to the platform s rigid body motion natural frequency similar trends are present for cases where the turbine is operating with the addition of a steady rated wind of 11 4 m s and a steady current of 0 3 m s in addition to regular waves as shown in fig 6 wind and current are modeled as co directional with waves and misalignment of the environmental loads may yield different results it should also be noted that wind and currents change the wave characteristics for non linear interactions which also affects the following conclusions the primary distinction of these operational cases compared to the wave only cases is a smaller range variance of the net multiline anchor force relative to wave phase at connected platforms increases with wave height there is less sensitivity to wave phase differences in these operational cases because a significant portion of the line tension is being controlled by the wind loading therefore changes in the wave phase have less effect this is an important distinction to make over the non operational wave only scenario as these larger values of anchor force are produced from a more realistic environmental conditions and are likely closer to design values anchor design is based primarily on a maximum anchor force american bureau of shipping 2014 therefore in this set of analyses the difference in maximum net multiline anchor force between in phase and out of phase wave loading can be thought of a measure of uncertainty in anchor demand anchor design uses whichever load case produces the largest anchor force therefore it can be observed from the values in figs 5 and 6 that the larger wave height cases encompass the conditions most likely to control anchor design these larger wave height cases see larger differences between maxima produced by in phase and out of phase wave loading which would potentially lead to a more conservative anchor design if irregular spatial wave coherence were to be deemed important the amplitudes of the anchor force cycles are used primarily in checking the fatigue strength of the anchor and the smaller wave height cases encompass the conditions most likely to be used in fatigue analysis since the difference between in phase and out of phase force cycle amplitude values are smallest in these small wave height cases it can be anticipated that spatial wave coherence will not have a significant impact on fatigue analysis even if irregular spatial wave coherence were to be deemed important while the force cycle amplitudes in larger extreme wave height conditions are not likely to be used in a fatigue analysis of the anchor the bounds are still important in the context of anchor force direction reversal this behavior can be seen in fig 4 where correlated loading produces a net multiline anchor force that reverses direction min fmulti 62 kn while the anti correlated loading does not min fmulti 42 kn this behavior is of interest because force direction reversal is a characteristic of anchor loading that is not present in single line anchors which are only loaded in one direction the effect of this force direction reversal within a single force cycle relative to anchor design is not yet known as anchor design standards currently only apply to single line anchors this type of anchor loading event has been examined in previous work by the authors which determined that multiline anchors can experience force direction reversal within a single cycle for extreme loading conditions fontana et al 2017 it should be noted that force direction reversal falls within the broader topic of multidirectionality of the anchor force which is an ongoing topic of study for the novel multiline anchor concept 2 3 multiline anchor force with unidirectional irregular waves this section extends the previous section to the case of irregular unidirectional waves and seeks to understand how the multiline anchor force is affected by the use of spatially coherent irregular waves at connected platforms the irregular waves in this study are modeled via the procedures outlined in agarwal and manuel 2010 they are linear with a jonswap spectrum and rayleigh distributed wave heights all of the cases in this paper have been analyzed using first order kinematics with second order forces the authors chose the first order kinematics due to the ease of calculating the closed form solution of wave propagation over the distance of the wind turbines and because the default method of calculating second order kinematics in the fast program used artificially adds energy to the wave spectrum to account for 2nd order effects the authors believe that 2nd order kinematics will have little effect in other words first order wave kinematics are used in the strip theory solution whereas the potential flow solution is based on second order theory fourier coefficients for sea surface elevation x are 3 x ω m a m exp i ϕ m where a m is the rayleigh distributed amplitudes and ϕ m is the phase shift of frequency component m the spatial phase shift is accounted for using the dispersion relationship at each frequency given as 4 x ω m a m exp k x i ϕ m in the final step fourier coefficients are transformed to the time domain to obtain the wave surface resulting in 5 η t x r i f f t x ω m ϕ m x this method of modeling creates time histories of unidirectional spatially coherent waves over a distance sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 when they are applied to the fowt simulations the variation in wave elevation is spanned only over the direction of travel and wave elevation is identical over the direction perpendicular to their travel due to the unidirectional nature as shown in fig 7 with this use of unidirectional wave fields multiple turbines connected to the multiline anchor experience identical wave loading under spatially coherent wave conditions this is shown in fig 8 a for turbines 1 and 3 and fig 8c for turbines 2 and 3 more specifically the only scenario in which duplication of wave elevation time history at two turbines does not occur is for the 3 line anchor with 30 wave direction therefore this case is focused on more specifically in the following analysis although the other cases are discussed as well where there is wave loading duplication in the coherent case due to location turbines 1 and 3 in 0 degree turbines 2 and 3 in 60 direction the corresponding independent wave loading case also uses 2 of the same although independent waves fields at these turbines for consistency in comparison see fig 8a and c in this section the coherent wave condition refers to simulations of the net multiline anchor force in which the connected turbines are loaded by spatially coherent waves where wave elevation time history at the distance location of each turbine is generated via the procedure outlined in equations 1 and 3 through 5 the independent wave condition refers to simulations of the net multiline anchor force in which the connected turbines are loaded by independent waves the independent cases shown in fig 8 assume that the waves are long crested such that the wave profiles are identical between t1 and t3 for the 0 wave direction case and between t3 and t2 in the 60 degree case but whose random phase shifts ϕ are independent from the other turbines for the coherent case the waves are again long crested but the phase angles ϕ are identical for all 3 turbines to make the comparison between coherent and independent wave conditions easier for each wave direction the wave history that generates the critical contributing line tension t2 remains common while cancelling tensions t1 and t3 are changed to fit the degree of wave coherence see fig 8 this was done to remove a source of variation between different realizations of a wave field that is not related to coherence as a result the wave elevation at turbine 1 locations x 0 m is not the same across different wave directions but wave elevation is identical at turbine locations that produce governing contributing tensions t2 x 1257 for wave directions 0 and 60 and x 1451 m for wave direction 30 the contributing line tensions and the net multiline anchor force for the coherent and independent case can be seen in fig 9 fig 9 also displays how the dominant contributing force of t2 controls the behavior of the net multiline anchor force for each combination of significant wave height wave period factor direction and coherence or independence six realizations were completed consistent with the number of realizations recommended by iec for design iec 61400 3 2009 the effect of wave coherence is examined for both the 3 line and 6 line geometries as shown in fig 2 the difference in the multiline anchor force dynamics between the coherent and independent wave conditions is shown in table 1 and which shows average values across the six realizations the percent difference in the maximum value mean value and standard deviation of the net multiline anchor force for coherent and independent waves is calculated relative to the corresponding t2 single line value the maximum significant wave height is chosen based on survival load case slc conditions of the full scale volturnus a planned floating wind demonstration project in the gulf of maine viselli et al 2016 it should be noted that the 0 values in table 1 are not absolute 0 values but rather a result of rounding values 0 5 to one significant digit percent difference in table 1 is calculated by 6 d i f f e r e n c e 100 v m c v m i v s where v mc is the value of the multiline anchor force with spatially coherent wave loading v mi is the value of the multiline anchor force with independent wave loading and v s is the maximum contributing single line anchor force t2 which is the same for multiline anchors with both coherent and independent wave loading the lack of any consistent trend in the differences for the net multiline anchor force suggest that the differences result primarily from natural randomness of the irregular wave fields not from a difference in coherence versus regular wave loading this lack of any trend was further confirmed by adding 6 additional irregular wave realizations for a total of 12 realizations to be averaged across larger differences are seen in the 6 line anchor cases as the duplicate wave effects are amplified by the presence of additional line attachments when examining multiline anchors forces one of the most distinctive characteristics is the directionality of the force in a single line anchor system only one mooring line is attached therefore the anchor is loaded in one direction that varies by less than 1 for the oc4 floating system in any of the simulations completed in a multiline anchor system multiple mooring lines are attached and the anchor is loaded in many different directions with many different force magnitudes therefore a comparison must be made of the directionality of the net multiline anchor force between the coherent and independent wave conditions as shown in table 2 this comparison is only shown for the 30 wave direction because the duplicate wave effect renders the anchor force directionality for the other wave directions unidirectional the direction of the net multiline anchor force in the 0 and 60 wave direction cases in the 3 line anchor system and the 0 and 30 wave direction cases in the 6 line anchor system fluctuate between the positive and negative value of the wave direction due to the exact symmetry of the loading in the direction perpendicular to the waves y components y direction being perpendicular to wave direction of the contributing tensions cancel out perfectly due to the duplicate wave effect therefore the direction of the multiline anchor force only varies back and forth in the exact direction of the waves for the 30 wave direction case which does not have any duplicate wave effects the variation in the direction of the multiline force can be seen in fig 10 as with table 1 the lack of any consistent trend in the differences for the mean and standard deviation of the net multiline anchor force direction suggests that the differences result primarily from natural randomness of the wave fields this lack of any trend was again confirmed by adding 6 additional irregular wave realizations for a total of 12 realizations to be averaged across the lack of difference between the coherent and independent wave cases is also exhibited in the rosettes while some of the rosettes not shown here exhibit slightly larger differences in shapes there is still no consistency or trend in these small differences this further bolsters the conclusion that the differences are a product of the natural dissimilarity between two different realizations of waves not a difference due to the use of spatially coherent waves versus independent waves the smallness of the differences in the critical values of the net multiline anchor force reveal that spatial wave coherence does not have any significant effect on the dynamics of the net multiline anchor force and that assumption of independence of the wave fields at different fowt locations provides sufficiently accurate anchor load characterizations this conclusion is of course of quite a different nature than that of regular waves in section 2 2 and this difference is explained in section 3 3 wave coherence the lack of difference between the coherent and independent wave results in the previous analysis suggests that wave coherence at connected turbines in a multiline anchor system is insignificant in determining multiline anchor force dynamics the following section seeks to better understand and explain these results by focusing on only the waves and their characteristics and examining the distances at which wave elevations are no longer correlated enough to produce measurable synchronicity or anti synchronicity the metric used here to determine the relationship of waves at different locations is the correlation coefficient between wave elevation time histories at different distances 3 1 regular waves before examining realistic irregular waves the correlation of regular waves is first presented a regular wave in the shape of a repeating sine wave is shown in fig 11 the relationship between wave elevation and space is expressed through the correlation coefficient r which is a measure of the strength and direction positive or negative of the linear relationship between two variables for regular waves at intervals of the wavelength the correlation coefficient is 1 and the wave elevations at a time lag of one wave period are perfectly correlated conversely at intervals of wavelength plus or minus one half the correlation coefficient is 1 and the wave elevations at these points are perfectly anti correlated these characteristics can be seen in fig 11 where the red and green markers are perfectly correlated and the purple and green markers are perfectly anti correlated with regular waves each wave has an identical height length and period therefore the location of and time between any of the crests and troughs can be perfectly and infinitely identified with irregular waves in the following analysis r serves as a measure of predictability for the locations of the crests and troughs of the waves 3 2 unidirectional irregular waves this section builds upon the previous section with the goal of examining the correlation coefficient between irregular wave elevation time histories at different distances elevation time histories of irregular spatially coherent waves are generated via the procedures outlined in equations 1 and 3 through 5 and each is generated over a distance of 7 peak spectral wavelengths for a 1 h duration sections of a sample time history are shown in fig 12 fig 12b reveals more clearly how quickly a specific wave moves in space and how long it lasts in time the colored ridges correspond to specific waves and show that larger waves generally last longer and travel faster than smaller waves yellow ridges compared to green ridges it can be observed that even the largest waves are only able to maintain themselves in the wave train no more than several hundred meters which is far less than any turbine spacings in fig 8 wave correlation relative to space and time can be calculated by 7 r x c o v η t 0 η t x σ η t 0 σ η t x where r is the correlation coefficient of wave time histories at locations 0 and x x is distance t is time η is wave elevation σ is standard deviation and cov is covariance the correlation coefficient with distance is shown in fig 13 it is important to note that the correlation coefficient is used over the space domain as the interest lies in how wave elevation time histories at different locations correlate not how a single wave propagates over time fig 13a shows the correlation coefficient of waves generated with the minimum recommended period and fig 13b shows waves generated with the maximum recommended period as designated by iec offshore wind turbine design standards iec 61400 3 2009 the relationship of correlation coefficient with distance is averaged across 18 realizations of the random process for each combination of significant wave height and peak spectral wave period similar to the regular waves the correlation coefficient function still experiences peaks at intervals of peak spectral wavelength but the magnitudes of the peaks decay with distance due to irregularity and loss of correlation of the wave train these peaks at intervals of peak spectral wavelength are used to fit an exponential decay function as shown in fig 14 the decay constant c d measures how quickly the correlation coefficient approaches 0 this relationship is determined relative to distance fig 14 rather than fraction of peak spectral wavelengths fig 13 to allow for comparisons of c d across different wave parameters correlation length x c is defined as the distance x at which the correlation coefficient is equal to e 1 or 0 368 a large decay constant means that the correlation coefficient decreases quickly short correlation length and a small decay constant means the correlation coefficient decreases slowly long correlation length this relationship can be expressed by 8 r x e x p c d x f o r x λ n where r is the correlation coefficient between the wave elevation time history at a starting point and a wave elevation time history at a point n peak spectral wavelengths away x is distance from the starting point c d is decay constant n is an integer and λ is peak spectral wavelength a parametric study reveals how wave height h s wave period factor t f and water depth affect decay constant and in effect correlation length parameter ranges are given in table 3 wave period factors t f extend slightly beyond the recommended range of 11 1 14 3 given in iec 61400 2009 for modeling normal and extreme wave heights the relationship between input wave parameters and the correlation length can be seen in fig 15 in general it can be seen that wave correlation length increases with significant wave height water depth has a very small effect on the relationship between correlation length and wave characteristics the correlation length is largely independent of changes in wave period factor except for very large wave heights the maximum correlation length of 298 m occurs for water depth 50 m t f 11 5 and h s 12 m where c d 0 0034 the minimum correlation length of 16 m occurs for h s 1 m and t f 10 for all water depths where c d 0 0639 referring back to the multiline anchor analysis for the maximum significant wave height of h s 12 m with t f 11 and water depth 200 m the minimum decay constant is 0 0042 and the maximum correlation length is 238 m this correlation length is significantly smaller than any of the minimum turbine spacings in the multiline anchor layouts as shown in table 4 these very low correlation coefficients 0 2 supplement the conclusion that spatial coherence of the waves at these distances does not have any significant effect on the multiline anchor force compared to the independent wave scenario directional waves were also investigated in this context of correlation length two dimensional wave spreading was assumed to follow the cosine spreading function independent of wave frequency and was implemented using the seasim function in the wafo toolbox in matlab it was found that the correlation coefficient decays faster in the directional wave case than in the unidirectional wave case fig 16 and as a result wave correlation lengths are shorter in the directional case therefore the use of unidirectional waves is a conservative choice in that if there was any effect of spatial wave coherence on net multiline anchor force it is expected that it would be revealed here these unidirectional wave field results effectively allow the assumption that the directional wave field would also not result in any difference between spatially coherent and independent wave loading at platforms connected to a multiline anchor 3 3 minimum spacing of installed offshore wind turbines the correlation lengths of this study are evaluated here in the context of typical spacing between turbines in installed offshore wind farms while there is only one operational floating offshore wind farm observations can still be made for the many installed fixed bottom wind farms the following analysis of turbine spacing uses only wind farms that employ turbines with a 4 mw or greater capacity as deployment of commercial scale floating wind technologies is likely to coincide with the progression to larger turbines spyroudi 2016 the wind farms from this study exhibit a range of turbine capacities farm sizes and countries of origin and all wind farms were commissioned within the past 10 years it was found that most of the installed wind farms in this study have minimum turbine spacings between 4 and 8 rotor diameters with fixed bottom wind turbine spacings ranging from 435 to 1072 m see fig 17 data for this study was obtained from 4c global offshore wind farms database 2018 and details on the determination of turbine minimum spacings can be found in the appendix the first and only floating offshore wind farm as of writing this paper hywind pilot park statoil 2016 employs the largest turbine spacing by a significant amount in terms of both total distance and number of rotor diameters while no conclusions can be drawn from this singular example of a floating offshore wind farm it is still important to note the outlier nature of this point amongst the other offshore wind farms the most important conclusion to note is that the wave correlation lengths in section 3 1 of this study 300 m are smaller than typical spacings of installed owts 500 m and anticipated spacings of other fowts even if the significant wave height in the correlation length study is increased to 18 m the maximum correlation length is only 413 m which is still smaller than any of the current spacings of most installed offshore wind farms using 4 mw or larger turbines the idea of changing the mooring system and or wave characteristics such that turbine spacings were less than or equal to the wave correlation length was considered however this was not realistic from extrapolating the relationship between maximum correlation length and significant wave height in 200 m water depth it was estimated that unrealistically large significant wave heights h s 25 m more than double the slc value of h s in the full scale volturnus viselli et al 2016 would be needed to create correlation lengths greater than the minimum turbine spacing in terms of rotor diameter of any currently installed offshore wind farms rotor diameter 126 m rd 4 0 spacing 504 m 4 conclusions this paper investigated spatial characteristics of linear waves in the context of a multiline anchor system for floating wind turbines the goal was to determine if multiline anchor force dynamics are a function of spatial wave coherence or if the treatment of wave fields as independent at each turbine provides adequate load characterizations while regular waves fields in the multiline system showed the limits of what the difference in multiline anchor forces could be between these two models could be the irregular wave fields applied to fowts in a multiline anchor system revealed no consistent trends that differentiated multiline anchor force dynamics generated by spatially independent versus coherent waves differences between the two wave loading models were insignificant mean anchor force values differed by less than 1 and maximum anchor force values differed by less than 5 in the 3 line anchor system a deeper investigation into spatial wave characteristics revealed that the correlation coefficient between wave elevation time histories at different points in space decays rapidly with distance between the points even for the maximum wave height studied h s 12 m the correlation length was less than 300 m the situation where wave coherence could potentially have an effect on multiline anchor force dynamics is one in which turbine spacing is less than or equal to wave correlation length it is almost certain that this situation is not feasible possible for several reasons first in the context of turbine spacing it is observed that spacing will likely not be less than 4 rotor diameters this minimum spacing limit coupled with the limit of floating turbines not being less than 4 mw capacity and 120 m rotor diameter means that the absolute minimum spacing of fowts is likely to be at about 500 m in combination with the findings in section 3 2 that significant wave heights must be unrealistically large h s 25 m to produce wave correlation lengths of this distance it can be concluded that a situation will not exist in which waves will be significantly correlated at the connected platforms in multiline anchor systems for fowts it should be noted that this analysis is fundamentally linear and based on simple superposition for non linear waves the correlation and the maximum loads might be different this study is considering the effect of rather large and long waves intrinsically non linear particularly the asymmetry of the free surface and the velocity profile thus the force time series at the mooring lines will be significantly affected therefore the conclusions are only valid for linear wave systems funding sources this work was supported by the us national science foundation grant numbers igert 1068864 cmmi 1463273 cmmi 1463431 and

component 1 appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 04 048 appendix minimum turbine spacings were determined from matlab image processing procedures with images of offshore wind turbine locations taken from the 4c offshore resource 4c offshore 2018 this is a public resource that provides a large amount of information about offshore wind farms the map feature of this resource provides the location and layout of many fully commissioned offshore wind farms as shown in fig 18 the use of this resource allows for the determination of turbine locations and in effect turbine spacings the image in fig 18a is first converted into matrix form using the imread function then turbine locations are obtained using the imfindcircles function these initial turbine locations are in terms of pixel distances and the map scale key provided in for each wind farm was used to determine the number of meters per pixel fig 18 image processing of map data from 4coffshore to obtain turbine locations the minimum distance for grid layout farms such as ormonde offshore wind farm in fig 18 is simple but determining spacing for farms such as the bard 1 offshore wind farm in fig 19 is more complex fig 18 fig 19 inconsistent turbine spacing in bard offshore 1 wind farm fig 19 in cases such as this where turbine layout lacks a pattern grid and spacing is inconsistent an alternate method is used to determine spacing the delanuay triangulation function in matlab delaunaytriangulation is used to determine which turbines are the nearest neighbors for each turbine and the distance of the nearest neighboring turbine in noted the minimum spacing value for the farm is then taken as the average of these values for all turbines in the farm results for minimum turbine spacing are shown in table 5 it should be noted that minimum turbine spacing in the context of wave coherence would depend on the wwc direction therefore the calculation of the turbine spacings for the closest spaced turbines in a wind farm serves as a conservative estimate for this topic table 5 minimum turbine spacing of installed offshore

22729,a shared multiline anchor system may reduce material and installation costs for floating offshore wind farms but the concept also expands the physical space over which the analysis of the system must be considered the multiline anchor force is a combination of forces that originate from different floating offshore wind turbine fowt platforms and this interconnectivity mandates investigation of spatial coherence of waves over the area of the connected turbines the goal of this work is to determine if anchor force characteristics are sensitive to spatial coherence of the wave field or if an assumption of independent wave fields at different fowt locations provides sufficiently accurate anchor load characterizations spatially coherent irregular wave fields are generated and applied to fowt systems in 3 line and 6 line anchor systems revealing negligible sensitivity of multiline anchor force to wave spatial coherence these results are continued with a parametric study showing how wave characteristics affect correlation lengths of spatially coherent waves a review of installed offshore wind turbine spacings is presented as a context for these results in each section regular waves are first used to examine the dynamics in a simple context then irregular waves are used to more realistically simulate ocean conditions keywords floating turbines wind energy spatial waves wave coherence multiline anchors turbine spacing abbreviations fowt floating offshore wind turbine wwc wind wave current slc survival load case jonswap joint north sea wave project 1 introduction as the offshore wind industry trends towards deeper water locations the need for floating offshore wind technology becomes more important u s department of energy 2016 however the additional support structure demands present in floating offshore wind turbines fowts currently prevent them from being cost competitive with fixed bottom turbines mone et al 2015 one potential way to address this high cost hurdle is a multiline anchor concept in which fowts share anchors to reduce the total number of anchors required as shown in fig 1 fontana et al 2017 a key difference in this novel anchoring concept is that the forces acting on the multiline anchor come from multiple turbines at several different locations in the wind farm as compared to the conventional single line anchor which only sees forces from one fowt at one location this interconnectedness of the system through shared anchor points creates the need to evaluate the loading of the multiline anchors on a multi turbine spatio temporally coherent scale since demands on the multiline anchor depend on the motions of multiple platforms at different locations in the wind farm the goal of this work is to determine if characteristics of the anchor loads are sensitive to spatial coherence of the wave field as it moves through an offshore floating wind farm or whether an assumption of independence of the wave fields at different fowt locations provides sufficiently accurate anchor load characterizations this investigation of spatial wave coherence in multiline anchor systems will inform more accurate numerical modeling an essential task when obtaining meaningful results for this novel system determining the importance of spatial wave coherence in multiline anchor force modeling is also a valuable outcome for all future multiline anchor analysis as the simulations of spatially coherent waves are significantly more complex than those of independent wave fields especially as the scale of the wind farm and number of wind turbines increase for the purposes of this study wind fields are assumed to be spatially independent at different fowt locations however wake effects could play a role in governing multiline anchor forces and this topic is a subject of ongoing study by the authors furthermore directional spreading of the sea state is not considered in any case because unidirectional sea states are assumed to have more impact on the multiline anchor loads there are many examinations of spatial wave characteristics in published literature but far fewer have looked at the wave surface over a large distance and have mostly been limited to extreme and freak waves latifah and groesen 2012 focused on estimating the position and time of a freak wave event given a time signal and phase information at a certain position alvise et al 2017 analyzed the temporal profile and height of space time extreme wind waves using real wave data in efforts to verify estimations of the shape and the crest to trough height of near focusing large 3d wave groups other research on spatial characteristics of waves has been focused on the evolution of statistical wavefield parameters shemer and sergeeva 2009 generated unidirectional random waves in 300 m wave tank to analyze changes in the frequency spectrum of the wavefield over the distance of travel additionally sergeeva et al 2013 generated numerical simulations of unidirectional spatio temporal wave evolutions with a focus on rogue wave occurrence and propagation as a distinction one of the novel outcomes of this research is the examination of the correlation coefficient of wave elevation time histories at two different points in space furthermore this research examines wave correlation and coherence over larger distances 1000 m than most previous studies the results of this study on spatial wave coherence are not limited to use in fowts with multiline anchor systems design of wave energy converters wecs may also benefit from better understanding of spatial wave coherence as it could potentially be used to optimize the layout within an array such that each wec experiences the largest waves and in effect produces the most power balitsky et al 2017 in addition wave energy converters may also be a well suited candidate for multiline anchor system applications the role of spatial wave coherence in determining multiline anchor forces is addressed with numerical simulations of a multiline anchor connected to fowts loaded by spatially coherent and independent waves this paper first examines the effect of spatial wave coherence in a multiline anchor system for semisubmersible fowts then expands upon these results with an examination of just waves realizations no fowt to determine how wave characteristics affect the wave correlation lengths in both of these sections regular waves are first used to examine the dynamics in a simple context then irregular waves are used to more accurately simulate real world conditions results are presented in the context of real spacings of installed offshore wind farms 2 multiline anchor force this section examines a multiline anchor connected to fowts subjected to both regular and irregular wave loading in this context use of the terms in phase versus out of phase to describe waves at the platforms is specific to regular waves while use of the terms coherent versus independent are specific to irregular waves the first goal of this section is to establish the range of the multiline anchor force for the case where the platforms connected to the anchor are loaded by in phase versus out of phase regular waves the following subsection then uses irregular waves to determine if the multiline anchor force dynamics are a function of wave coherence 2 1 software and turbine model simulation of fowt dynamics was accomplished with national renewable energy laboratory s computer aided engineering tool fast fast v8 is a comprehensive coupled aero hydro servo elastic simulator capable of predicting motions and loads in the time domain jonkman and jonkman 2016 jonkman and buhl jr 2005 the turbine chosen for this analysis is the national renewable energy laboratory s nrel 5 mw reference turbine which was developed to be representative of a typical utility scale turbine and is widely used in the wind energy research community jonkman et al 2009 the fowt support structure chosen for this study is the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible platform in 200 m water depth coulling et al 2013a b robertson et al 2014 which is based largely on the deepcwind scaled test floater robertson et al 2013 and consists of a ballast supported tri floater with three large cylindrical columns acting as pontoons which are connected to a central main column that supports the tower and rotor nacelle assembly robertson et al 2014 the deepcwind oc4 semisubmersible floating system was chosen because it employs the most commonly studied platform type semisubmersible and mooring system type catenary in current fowt technology concepts carbon trust 2015 mooring line and anchor force dynamics were simulated via moordyn a lumped mass mooring model within fast hall 2017 seabed friction forces on the mooring line are not currently included in this model and therefore were applied in a post processing routine outlined in fontana et al 2018 capturing seabed friction forces in a postprocessing routine is possible for this model since the anchor is treated as a fixed point on the seabed surface and the reverse catenary curvature of the mooring line under the soil is not considered fontana et al 2018 the hydrodynamics model includes 2nd order mean drift and slow drift effects on the floating platform using the full difference frequency quadratic transfer functions jonkman et al 2015 the spatial layouts of the conventional single line and novel multiline fowt systems are shown in fig 2 the multiline layout was obtained by taking the layout of the default oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible system and patterning it such that the anchor points overlapped the key takeaway of this method is that the mooring system layout of each turbine the distance of each anchor from the turbine is unchanged between the single line fig 2a and the multiline systems fig 2b and c patterning the default system in this way results in a turbine spacing of 1451 m this spatial layout of the mooring system was generated from the default mooring design and the floating system could of course be designed for different radial distances from fairlead to anchor the interconnectivity of the turbines in fig 2b and c exhibits the need to examine whether the spatial coherence of the waves in the multiline system affects the anchor forces significantly compared to the configuration of the turbines in fig 2a where each anchor s load depends only on the dynamics of a single fowt to determine the net force on an anchor being loaded by multiple mooring lines simultaneously simulations of single line fowts are completed then post processed as shown in fig 3 the net multiline anchor force is computed by the vector sum of the contributing single line tensions since the mooring system is catenary the contributing mooring lines tensions t1 t2 and t3 are purely horizontal parallel with the seabed therefore the resultant force on the multiline anchor tmulti is also horizonal furthermore anchors are modeled as fixed points at the seabed surface in fast therefore anchor characteristics like geometry and embedment depth are not relevant in this study it can be observed that the magnitude and direction of the net multiline anchor force is a function of the contributing line tensions the net multiline anchor force is controlled by the maximum contributing critical single line tension while the smaller cancelling tensions create a reduction in this force this is where wave coherence between connected turbines is most important as the magnitude of this reduction depends on the timing of the cancellation tension relative to the critical tension 2 2 multiline anchor force with unidirectional regular waves the goal of this section is to determine the differences between the net multiline anchor force produced under perfectly in phase and out of phase regular wave loading on the connected platforms in phase loading refers to regular wave crests acting on the connected fowt platforms simultaneously fig 4 a and out of phase loading refers to wave crests and troughs acting on the connected platforms simultaneously fig 4b these two cases represent bounding limiting realizations of the way that spatially coherent irregular waves may affect multiline anchor loads equation of the regular wave surface η in the time domain is 1 η x t a cos k x ω t ϕ where k is wave number x is distance ω is wave frequency t is time a is regular wave amplitude h 2 and ϕ is the random phase for simplification in describing the effects of wave phase relative to line tension and anchor force the following analysis focuses only on the 3 line anchor system fig 4 reveals how the timing of the cancellation tension relative to the critical tension affects the cycle amplitude and maximum of the net multiline anchor force it should be noted that wind forces are not included in fig 4 but will be incorporated later in this section to better understand these cases the dynamics of the fowt mooring system must first be examined wave elevation platform displacement and line tension are all tightly correlated when a wave strikes and displaces a fowt platform in its direction of travel the upwind line t2 experiences peak tension while the downwind lines t1 and t3 simultaneously experience a minimum tension conversely when a wave trough comes in contact the platform displaces opposite the wave direction of travel and in effect the upwind line t2 experiences a minimum tension while the downwind lines t1 and t3 experience peak tensions it should be noted however that these are general descriptions of the temporal relationship between wave strike platform displacement surge heave pitch and line tension as there can be significant and varying time delays between these events depending on the wave characteristics and the shape of the floating platform fig 4a is a specific example in which there is negligible time delay and the peak minimum tensions are nearly simultaneous with the wave strike on the platform when critical and cancelling contributing tensions are out of phase the amplitude and maximum of the net multiline anchor force are maximized fig 4a conversely when the critical and cancelling single line tensions are in phase the amplitude and maximum of the net multiline anchor force is minimized fig 4b this behavior is related to interference in that waves in phase at the connected platforms produce contributing line tensions with constructive interference while waves out of phase at the connected platforms produces contributing line tensions with destructive interference spatial characteristics namely wavelength are not considered in this step because it is not possible to compare the same wave acting on the connected platforms in both an in phase and out of phase scenario when spacing between the fowts is held constant in order to produce perfectly in phase and out of phase wave loading of a certain wave height on the set of platforms in a multiline system the waves would need to have slightly different wavelengths and periods a wave train with n waves over a distance of 1257 m see fig 2b is different than a wave train with n ½ waves over the same distance for example a 6 m regular in phase wave i e 10 waves between the platforms has a wavelength of 125 7 m and a wave period of 8 97 s in contrast a 6 m regular out of phase wave 10 5 waves between the platforms has a wavelength of 119 7 m and a wave period of 8 75 s wavelength is determined by converting wave period to angular frequency then using angular frequency and the water depth of 200 m in the linear dispersion relationship dnv 2007 to determine wave number k and in effect wavelength instead the steady state minima and maxima of the line tensions produced under regular wave loading are used to examine the magnitude of the anchor force produced by different sized regular waves more specifically the regular wave scenario is used here to evaluate the question where given a sea state regular wave height what is the best minimum and worst maximum loading on the multiline anchor the minimum and maximum values of the maximum net multiline anchor force for all wave loading cases fig 5 are found by offsetting the time between the critical and cancelling line tensions such that the maximum critical and minimum cancelling tensions are aligned in time in phase waves at the platforms or the maximum critical and maximum cancelling tensions are aligned out of phase waves at the platforms as previously shown in fig 4 the effect of wave phase at the platforms is examined over a range of wave heights and periods in this context wave period factor t f is a value used in calculating wave period given by 2 t t f h g where t is wave period h is wave height and g is gravity values of 11 and 14 for t f are chosen to be close to the lower and upper bounds of this value as recommended in iec 61400 2009 furthermore the 0 wave direction is used for the entirety of this section because it is the most critical load direction case meaning that it produces larger maximum single line and multiline anchor forces than those of the 30 and 60 case therefore it is of the most interest relative to the effects of wave phases results are shown in fig 5 in general the range variance of the net multiline anchor force relative to wave phase at connected platforms increases with wave height the local maxima of anchor force that occurs at the 5 m wave height for t f 11 t 7 9 s and at the 3 m wave height for t f 11 t 7 7 s is due to the mean drift of the platforms this mean drift force results from closeness of these wave frequencies to the rigid body motion natural frequencies for the semisubmersible and its mooring system details on mean drift forces in the nrel semisubmersible floating system can be found in coulling et al 2013 the mean drift or mean surge displaces the platform in the direction of the waves resulting on a higher mean tension on the critical line t2 and a lower tension on the cancelling lines t1 and t3 it is this higher mean tension in critical line t2 that amplifies on the maximum force for the wave periods close to the platform s rigid body motion natural frequency similar trends are present for cases where the turbine is operating with the addition of a steady rated wind of 11 4 m s and a steady current of 0 3 m s in addition to regular waves as shown in fig 6 wind and current are modeled as co directional with waves and misalignment of the environmental loads may yield different results it should also be noted that wind and currents change the wave characteristics for non linear interactions which also affects the following conclusions the primary distinction of these operational cases compared to the wave only cases is a smaller range variance of the net multiline anchor force relative to wave phase at connected platforms increases with wave height there is less sensitivity to wave phase differences in these operational cases because a significant portion of the line tension is being controlled by the wind loading therefore changes in the wave phase have less effect this is an important distinction to make over the non operational wave only scenario as these larger values of anchor force are produced from a more realistic environmental conditions and are likely closer to design values anchor design is based primarily on a maximum anchor force american bureau of shipping 2014 therefore in this set of analyses the difference in maximum net multiline anchor force between in phase and out of phase wave loading can be thought of a measure of uncertainty in anchor demand anchor design uses whichever load case produces the largest anchor force therefore it can be observed from the values in figs 5 and 6 that the larger wave height cases encompass the conditions most likely to control anchor design these larger wave height cases see larger differences between maxima produced by in phase and out of phase wave loading which would potentially lead to a more conservative anchor design if irregular spatial wave coherence were to be deemed important the amplitudes of the anchor force cycles are used primarily in checking the fatigue strength of the anchor and the smaller wave height cases encompass the conditions most likely to be used in fatigue analysis since the difference between in phase and out of phase force cycle amplitude values are smallest in these small wave height cases it can be anticipated that spatial wave coherence will not have a significant impact on fatigue analysis even if irregular spatial wave coherence were to be deemed important while the force cycle amplitudes in larger extreme wave height conditions are not likely to be used in a fatigue analysis of the anchor the bounds are still important in the context of anchor force direction reversal this behavior can be seen in fig 4 where correlated loading produces a net multiline anchor force that reverses direction min fmulti 62 kn while the anti correlated loading does not min fmulti 42 kn this behavior is of interest because force direction reversal is a characteristic of anchor loading that is not present in single line anchors which are only loaded in one direction the effect of this force direction reversal within a single force cycle relative to anchor design is not yet known as anchor design standards currently only apply to single line anchors this type of anchor loading event has been examined in previous work by the authors which determined that multiline anchors can experience force direction reversal within a single cycle for extreme loading conditions fontana et al 2017 it should be noted that force direction reversal falls within the broader topic of multidirectionality of the anchor force which is an ongoing topic of study for the novel multiline anchor concept 2 3 multiline anchor force with unidirectional irregular waves this section extends the previous section to the case of irregular unidirectional waves and seeks to understand how the multiline anchor force is affected by the use of spatially coherent irregular waves at connected platforms the irregular waves in this study are modeled via the procedures outlined in agarwal and manuel 2010 they are linear with a jonswap spectrum and rayleigh distributed wave heights all of the cases in this paper have been analyzed using first order kinematics with second order forces the authors chose the first order kinematics due to the ease of calculating the closed form solution of wave propagation over the distance of the wind turbines and because the default method of calculating second order kinematics in the fast program used artificially adds energy to the wave spectrum to account for 2nd order effects the authors believe that 2nd order kinematics will have little effect in other words first order wave kinematics are used in the strip theory solution whereas the potential flow solution is based on second order theory fourier coefficients for sea surface elevation x are 3 x ω m a m exp i ϕ m where a m is the rayleigh distributed amplitudes and ϕ m is the phase shift of frequency component m the spatial phase shift is accounted for using the dispersion relationship at each frequency given as 4 x ω m a m exp k x i ϕ m in the final step fourier coefficients are transformed to the time domain to obtain the wave surface resulting in 5 η t x r i f f t x ω m ϕ m x this method of modeling creates time histories of unidirectional spatially coherent waves over a distance sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 when they are applied to the fowt simulations the variation in wave elevation is spanned only over the direction of travel and wave elevation is identical over the direction perpendicular to their travel due to the unidirectional nature as shown in fig 7 with this use of unidirectional wave fields multiple turbines connected to the multiline anchor experience identical wave loading under spatially coherent wave conditions this is shown in fig 8 a for turbines 1 and 3 and fig 8c for turbines 2 and 3 more specifically the only scenario in which duplication of wave elevation time history at two turbines does not occur is for the 3 line anchor with 30 wave direction therefore this case is focused on more specifically in the following analysis although the other cases are discussed as well where there is wave loading duplication in the coherent case due to location turbines 1 and 3 in 0 degree turbines 2 and 3 in 60 direction the corresponding independent wave loading case also uses 2 of the same although independent waves fields at these turbines for consistency in comparison see fig 8a and c in this section the coherent wave condition refers to simulations of the net multiline anchor force in which the connected turbines are loaded by spatially coherent waves where wave elevation time history at the distance location of each turbine is generated via the procedure outlined in equations 1 and 3 through 5 the independent wave condition refers to simulations of the net multiline anchor force in which the connected turbines are loaded by independent waves the independent cases shown in fig 8 assume that the waves are long crested such that the wave profiles are identical between t1 and t3 for the 0 wave direction case and between t3 and t2 in the 60 degree case but whose random phase shifts ϕ are independent from the other turbines for the coherent case the waves are again long crested but the phase angles ϕ are identical for all 3 turbines to make the comparison between coherent and independent wave conditions easier for each wave direction the wave history that generates the critical contributing line tension t2 remains common while cancelling tensions t1 and t3 are changed to fit the degree of wave coherence see fig 8 this was done to remove a source of variation between different realizations of a wave field that is not related to coherence as a result the wave elevation at turbine 1 locations x 0 m is not the same across different wave directions but wave elevation is identical at turbine locations that produce governing contributing tensions t2 x 1257 for wave directions 0 and 60 and x 1451 m for wave direction 30 the contributing line tensions and the net multiline anchor force for the coherent and independent case can be seen in fig 9 fig 9 also displays how the dominant contributing force of t2 controls the behavior of the net multiline anchor force for each combination of significant wave height wave period factor direction and coherence or independence six realizations were completed consistent with the number of realizations recommended by iec for design iec 61400 3 2009 the effect of wave coherence is examined for both the 3 line and 6 line geometries as shown in fig 2 the difference in the multiline anchor force dynamics between the coherent and independent wave conditions is shown in table 1 and which shows average values across the six realizations the percent difference in the maximum value mean value and standard deviation of the net multiline anchor force for coherent and independent waves is calculated relative to the corresponding t2 single line value the maximum significant wave height is chosen based on survival load case slc conditions of the full scale volturnus a planned floating wind demonstration project in the gulf of maine viselli et al 2016 it should be noted that the 0 values in table 1 are not absolute 0 values but rather a result of rounding values 0 5 to one significant digit percent difference in table 1 is calculated by 6 d i f f e r e n c e 100 v m c v m i v s where v mc is the value of the multiline anchor force with spatially coherent wave loading v mi is the value of the multiline anchor force with independent wave loading and v s is the maximum contributing single line anchor force t2 which is the same for multiline anchors with both coherent and independent wave loading the lack of any consistent trend in the differences for the net multiline anchor force suggest that the differences result primarily from natural randomness of the irregular wave fields not from a difference in coherence versus regular wave loading this lack of any trend was further confirmed by adding 6 additional irregular wave realizations for a total of 12 realizations to be averaged across larger differences are seen in the 6 line anchor cases as the duplicate wave effects are amplified by the presence of additional line attachments when examining multiline anchors forces one of the most distinctive characteristics is the directionality of the force in a single line anchor system only one mooring line is attached therefore the anchor is loaded in one direction that varies by less than 1 for the oc4 floating system in any of the simulations completed in a multiline anchor system multiple mooring lines are attached and the anchor is loaded in many different directions with many different force magnitudes therefore a comparison must be made of the directionality of the net multiline anchor force between the coherent and independent wave conditions as shown in table 2 this comparison is only shown for the 30 wave direction because the duplicate wave effect renders the anchor force directionality for the other wave directions unidirectional the direction of the net multiline anchor force in the 0 and 60 wave direction cases in the 3 line anchor system and the 0 and 30 wave direction cases in the 6 line anchor system fluctuate between the positive and negative value of the wave direction due to the exact symmetry of the loading in the direction perpendicular to the waves y components y direction being perpendicular to wave direction of the contributing tensions cancel out perfectly due to the duplicate wave effect therefore the direction of the multiline anchor force only varies back and forth in the exact direction of the waves for the 30 wave direction case which does not have any duplicate wave effects the variation in the direction of the multiline force can be seen in fig 10 as with table 1 the lack of any consistent trend in the differences for the mean and standard deviation of the net multiline anchor force direction suggests that the differences result primarily from natural randomness of the wave fields this lack of any trend was again confirmed by adding 6 additional irregular wave realizations for a total of 12 realizations to be averaged across the lack of difference between the coherent and independent wave cases is also exhibited in the rosettes while some of the rosettes not shown here exhibit slightly larger differences in shapes there is still no consistency or trend in these small differences this further bolsters the conclusion that the differences are a product of the natural dissimilarity between two different realizations of waves not a difference due to the use of spatially coherent waves versus independent waves the smallness of the differences in the critical values of the net multiline anchor force reveal that spatial wave coherence does not have any significant effect on the dynamics of the net multiline anchor force and that assumption of independence of the wave fields at different fowt locations provides sufficiently accurate anchor load characterizations this conclusion is of course of quite a different nature than that of regular waves in section 2 2 and this difference is explained in section 3 3 wave coherence the lack of difference between the coherent and independent wave results in the previous analysis suggests that wave coherence at connected turbines in a multiline anchor system is insignificant in determining multiline anchor force dynamics the following section seeks to better understand and explain these results by focusing on only the waves and their characteristics and examining the distances at which wave elevations are no longer correlated enough to produce measurable synchronicity or anti synchronicity the metric used here to determine the relationship of waves at different locations is the correlation coefficient between wave elevation time histories at different distances 3 1 regular waves before examining realistic irregular waves the correlation of regular waves is first presented a regular wave in the shape of a repeating sine wave is shown in fig 11 the relationship between wave elevation and space is expressed through the correlation coefficient r which is a measure of the strength and direction positive or negative of the linear relationship between two variables for regular waves at intervals of the wavelength the correlation coefficient is 1 and the wave elevations at a time lag of one wave period are perfectly correlated conversely at intervals of wavelength plus or minus one half the correlation coefficient is 1 and the wave elevations at these points are perfectly anti correlated these characteristics can be seen in fig 11 where the red and green markers are perfectly correlated and the purple and green markers are perfectly anti correlated with regular waves each wave has an identical height length and period therefore the location of and time between any of the crests and troughs can be perfectly and infinitely identified with irregular waves in the following analysis r serves as a measure of predictability for the locations of the crests and troughs of the waves 3 2 unidirectional irregular waves this section builds upon the previous section with the goal of examining the correlation coefficient between irregular wave elevation time histories at different distances elevation time histories of irregular spatially coherent waves are generated via the procedures outlined in equations 1 and 3 through 5 and each is generated over a distance of 7 peak spectral wavelengths for a 1 h duration sections of a sample time history are shown in fig 12 fig 12b reveals more clearly how quickly a specific wave moves in space and how long it lasts in time the colored ridges correspond to specific waves and show that larger waves generally last longer and travel faster than smaller waves yellow ridges compared to green ridges it can be observed that even the largest waves are only able to maintain themselves in the wave train no more than several hundred meters which is far less than any turbine spacings in fig 8 wave correlation relative to space and time can be calculated by 7 r x c o v η t 0 η t x σ η t 0 σ η t x where r is the correlation coefficient of wave time histories at locations 0 and x x is distance t is time η is wave elevation σ is standard deviation and cov is covariance the correlation coefficient with distance is shown in fig 13 it is important to note that the correlation coefficient is used over the space domain as the interest lies in how wave elevation time histories at different locations correlate not how a single wave propagates over time fig 13a shows the correlation coefficient of waves generated with the minimum recommended period and fig 13b shows waves generated with the maximum recommended period as designated by iec offshore wind turbine design standards iec 61400 3 2009 the relationship of correlation coefficient with distance is averaged across 18 realizations of the random process for each combination of significant wave height and peak spectral wave period similar to the regular waves the correlation coefficient function still experiences peaks at intervals of peak spectral wavelength but the magnitudes of the peaks decay with distance due to irregularity and loss of correlation of the wave train these peaks at intervals of peak spectral wavelength are used to fit an exponential decay function as shown in fig 14 the decay constant c d measures how quickly the correlation coefficient approaches 0 this relationship is determined relative to distance fig 14 rather than fraction of peak spectral wavelengths fig 13 to allow for comparisons of c d across different wave parameters correlation length x c is defined as the distance x at which the correlation coefficient is equal to e 1 or 0 368 a large decay constant means that the correlation coefficient decreases quickly short correlation length and a small decay constant means the correlation coefficient decreases slowly long correlation length this relationship can be expressed by 8 r x e x p c d x f o r x λ n where r is the correlation coefficient between the wave elevation time history at a starting point and a wave elevation time history at a point n peak spectral wavelengths away x is distance from the starting point c d is decay constant n is an integer and λ is peak spectral wavelength a parametric study reveals how wave height h s wave period factor t f and water depth affect decay constant and in effect correlation length parameter ranges are given in table 3 wave period factors t f extend slightly beyond the recommended range of 11 1 14 3 given in iec 61400 2009 for modeling normal and extreme wave heights the relationship between input wave parameters and the correlation length can be seen in fig 15 in general it can be seen that wave correlation length increases with significant wave height water depth has a very small effect on the relationship between correlation length and wave characteristics the correlation length is largely independent of changes in wave period factor except for very large wave heights the maximum correlation length of 298 m occurs for water depth 50 m t f 11 5 and h s 12 m where c d 0 0034 the minimum correlation length of 16 m occurs for h s 1 m and t f 10 for all water depths where c d 0 0639 referring back to the multiline anchor analysis for the maximum significant wave height of h s 12 m with t f 11 and water depth 200 m the minimum decay constant is 0 0042 and the maximum correlation length is 238 m this correlation length is significantly smaller than any of the minimum turbine spacings in the multiline anchor layouts as shown in table 4 these very low correlation coefficients 0 2 supplement the conclusion that spatial coherence of the waves at these distances does not have any significant effect on the multiline anchor force compared to the independent wave scenario directional waves were also investigated in this context of correlation length two dimensional wave spreading was assumed to follow the cosine spreading function independent of wave frequency and was implemented using the seasim function in the wafo toolbox in matlab it was found that the correlation coefficient decays faster in the directional wave case than in the unidirectional wave case fig 16 and as a result wave correlation lengths are shorter in the directional case therefore the use of unidirectional waves is a conservative choice in that if there was any effect of spatial wave coherence on net multiline anchor force it is expected that it would be revealed here these unidirectional wave field results effectively allow the assumption that the directional wave field would also not result in any difference between spatially coherent and independent wave loading at platforms connected to a multiline anchor 3 3 minimum spacing of installed offshore wind turbines the correlation lengths of this study are evaluated here in the context of typical spacing between turbines in installed offshore wind farms while there is only one operational floating offshore wind farm observations can still be made for the many installed fixed bottom wind farms the following analysis of turbine spacing uses only wind farms that employ turbines with a 4 mw or greater capacity as deployment of commercial scale floating wind technologies is likely to coincide with the progression to larger turbines spyroudi 2016 the wind farms from this study exhibit a range of turbine capacities farm sizes and countries of origin and all wind farms were commissioned within the past 10 years it was found that most of the installed wind farms in this study have minimum turbine spacings between 4 and 8 rotor diameters with fixed bottom wind turbine spacings ranging from 435 to 1072 m see fig 17 data for this study was obtained from 4c global offshore wind farms database 2018 and details on the determination of turbine minimum spacings can be found in the appendix the first and only floating offshore wind farm as of writing this paper hywind pilot park statoil 2016 employs the largest turbine spacing by a significant amount in terms of both total distance and number of rotor diameters while no conclusions can be drawn from this singular example of a floating offshore wind farm it is still important to note the outlier nature of this point amongst the other offshore wind farms the most important conclusion to note is that the wave correlation lengths in section 3 1 of this study 300 m are smaller than typical spacings of installed owts 500 m and anticipated spacings of other fowts even if the significant wave height in the correlation length study is increased to 18 m the maximum correlation length is only 413 m which is still smaller than any of the current spacings of most installed offshore wind farms using 4 mw or larger turbines the idea of changing the mooring system and or wave characteristics such that turbine spacings were less than or equal to the wave correlation length was considered however this was not realistic from extrapolating the relationship between maximum correlation length and significant wave height in 200 m water depth it was estimated that unrealistically large significant wave heights h s 25 m more than double the slc value of h s in the full scale volturnus viselli et al 2016 would be needed to create correlation lengths greater than the minimum turbine spacing in terms of rotor diameter of any currently installed offshore wind farms rotor diameter 126 m rd 4 0 spacing 504 m 4 conclusions this paper investigated spatial characteristics of linear waves in the context of a multiline anchor system for floating wind turbines the goal was to determine if multiline anchor force dynamics are a function of spatial wave coherence or if the treatment of wave fields as independent at each turbine provides adequate load characterizations while regular waves fields in the multiline system showed the limits of what the difference in multiline anchor forces could be between these two models could be the irregular wave fields applied to fowts in a multiline anchor system revealed no consistent trends that differentiated multiline anchor force dynamics generated by spatially independent versus coherent waves differences between the two wave loading models were insignificant mean anchor force values differed by less than 1 and maximum anchor force values differed by less than 5 in the 3 line anchor system a deeper investigation into spatial wave characteristics revealed that the correlation coefficient between wave elevation time histories at different points in space decays rapidly with distance between the points even for the maximum wave height studied h s 12 m the correlation length was less than 300 m the situation where wave coherence could potentially have an effect on multiline anchor force dynamics is one in which turbine spacing is less than or equal to wave correlation length it is almost certain that this situation is not feasible possible for several reasons first in the context of turbine spacing it is observed that spacing will likely not be less than 4 rotor diameters this minimum spacing limit coupled with the limit of floating turbines not being less than 4 mw capacity and 120 m rotor diameter means that the absolute minimum spacing of fowts is likely to be at about 500 m in combination with the findings in section 3 2 that significant wave heights must be unrealistically large h s 25 m to produce wave correlation lengths of this distance it can be concluded that a situation will not exist in which waves will be significantly correlated at the connected platforms in multiline anchor systems for fowts it should be noted that this analysis is fundamentally linear and based on simple superposition for non linear waves the correlation and the maximum loads might be different this study is considering the effect of rather large and long waves intrinsically non linear particularly the asymmetry of the free surface and the velocity profile thus the force time series at the mooring lines will be significantly affected therefore the conclusions are only valid for linear wave systems funding sources this work was supported by the us national science foundation grant numbers igert 1068864 cmmi 1463273 cmmi 1463431 and

component 1 appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 04 048 appendix minimum turbine spacings were determined from matlab image processing procedures with images of offshore wind turbine locations taken from the 4c offshore resource 4c offshore 2018 this is a public resource that provides a large amount of information about offshore wind farms the map feature of this resource provides the location and layout of many fully commissioned offshore wind farms as shown in fig 18 the use of this resource allows for the determination of turbine locations and in effect turbine spacings the image in fig 18a is first converted into matrix form using the imread function then turbine locations are obtained using the imfindcircles function these initial turbine locations are in terms of pixel distances and the map scale key provided in for each wind farm was used to determine the number of meters per pixel fig 18 image processing of map data from 4coffshore to obtain turbine locations the minimum distance for grid layout farms such as ormonde offshore wind farm in fig 18 is simple but determining spacing for farms such as the bard 1 offshore wind farm in fig 19 is more complex fig 18 fig 19 inconsistent turbine spacing in bard offshore 1 wind farm fig 19 in cases such as this where turbine layout lacks a pattern grid and spacing is inconsistent an alternate method is used to determine spacing the delanuay triangulation function in matlab delaunaytriangulation is used to determine which turbines are the nearest neighbors for each turbine and the distance of the nearest neighboring turbine in noted the minimum spacing value for the farm is then taken as the average of these values for all turbines in the farm results for minimum turbine spacing are shown in table 5 it should be noted that minimum turbine spacing in the context of wave coherence would depend on the wwc direction therefore the calculation of the turbine spacings for the closest spaced turbines in a wind farm serves as a conservative estimate for this topic table 5 minimum turbine spacing of installed offshore
