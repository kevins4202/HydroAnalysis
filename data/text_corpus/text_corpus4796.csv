23980,in this study observational data together with the simulations from a high resolution numerical ocean model are used to identify the processes responsible for the anomalous warm sea surface temperature sst in the equatorial indian ocean during late spring early summer in 2007 our analysis suggests that the sst in the western equatorial indian ocean weio remained unusually warm owing to the combined influence of the wind induced and reflected rossby waves in the equatorial indian ocean anomalous westerly wind burst in the equatorial indian ocean in early april generated an eastward propagating downwelling kelvin wave which got reflected from the eastern boundary as a downwelling rossby wave and propagated to the weio the easterlies appeared during the second fortnight of april generated another downwelling rossby wave which also propagated to the weio thus a couple of downwelling rossby waves reflected and direct wind induced propagated to the weio deepened the thermocline and prohibited cooling in the weio during the early months of summer monsoon season this study demonstrates the importance of the equatorial winds and associated oceanic dynamics in modulating the sst variability in the weio 1 introduction distribution of sea surface temperature sst is considered to be one of the most critical parameters that determines the location of deep convection over the tropical oceans gadgil et al 1984 graham and barnett 1987 gadgil et al 1984 have shown that the relationship between sst and convection is highly non linear in the tropical oceans and 27 5 c is a suitable threshold value for the local sst to support deep convection below this threshold the probability for deep convection to occur is very low if the sst is above this threshold the atmospheric dynamics determines the location of deep convection graham and barnett 1987 thus sst being above 27 5 c is a necessary condition for deep convection to occur over the tropical oceans but not the sufficient condition most part of the tropical indian ocean is above this threshold for deep convection due to the presence of indian ocean warm pool though as a response to strong monsoon winds and intense upwelling the sea surface in the western parts of the equatorial indian ocean is relatively cooler compared to the central and eastern parts during summer monsoon season montégut et al 2007 izumo et al 2008 francis et al 2007 have shown that despite the sst in the western equatorial indian ocean weio 50 e 70 e 10 s 10 n being above 27 5 c the convection over this region is generally intermittent in the monsoon season except during strong positive indian ocean dipole piod events the frequency distributions of monthly mean outgoing longwave radiation olr in the weio when the monthly mean sst in the corresponding grid is above and below 27 5 c are depicted in fig 1 it may be seen that when sst is below 27 5 c 90 of grids have olr values greater than 240 w m 2 absence of deep convection with the mode at 260 270 w m 2 fig 1a this shows that when sst in the weio is cool below the threshold deep convection hardly occurs however about 65 of grids have olr values less than 240 w m 2 represents deep convection when sst is greater than 27 5 c fig 1b thus for the occurrence of organized convection in the weio it is necessary to have sst above the threshold value of 27 5 c it is seen that there is a drastic change in the convection when sst increases from 27 5 c therefore slight changes in the sst distribution of the weio will have significant influence on the atmospheric circulation there the indian ocean dipole iod a coupled ocean atmosphere process in the tropical indian ocean is associated with anomalous warming in the weio and cooling in the eastern equatorial indian ocean eeio 90 e 110 e 10 s equator fig 2a saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 during the piod events enhanced convection is seen over the weio while it remains suppressed over the eeio fig 2b saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 several studies have shown that the atmospheric dynamics plays a critical role in suppressing convection over the eeio and promoting convection over the weio during the developing phase of a piod kajikawa et al 2003 li et al 2003 francis et al 2007 during the mature phase of piod events the sea surface becomes anomalously warm in the weio conducive for convection and sst in the eeio falls below the threshold for deep convection reverdin et al 1986 hastenrath et al 1993 saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 francis et al 2007 previous studies have suggested that anomalous easterlies and associated internal dynamics promote warming in the weio during the piod saji et al 1999 murtugudde et al 2000 vinayachandran et al 2002 francis et al 2007 anomalous easterlies in the equatorial indian ocean induce surface divergence at the equator which shoals the thermocline and this signal propagates eastward as upwelling kelvin wave vinayachandran et al 2002 francis et al 2007 in the eastern boundary this upwelling kelvin wave lifts up the thermocline which acts as a favourable condition to cool the eeio vinayachandran et al 1999 murtugudde et al 2000 vinayachandran et al 2002 rao et al 2002 further the local alongshore southeasterly winds also favour the coastal upwelling in the eeio vinayachandran et al 1999 murtugudde et al 2000 at the same time the convergence of warm water in the off equatorial region induced by the anomalous easterlies deepens the thermocline and propagates westward as downwelling rossby waves the anomalous anticyclonic wind stress curl due to the southeasterly winds along sumatra java coasts also triggers downwelling rossby waves xie et al 2002 rao and behera 2005 which upon reaching the weio prohibits cooling of the sea surface by preventing entrainment murtugudde et al 2000 vinayachandran et al 2002 it may be noted that the warming of the weio associated with piod generally starts in the middle of the monsoon season and continues until fall winter seasons saji et al 1999 vinayachandran et al 2002 hastenrath et al 1993 have reported that the climate anomalies in the weio can be related to the southern oscillation also through coupled ocean atmosphere processes and these anomalies peak during october november some recent studies also have shown that the changes in the sst of the weio can be associated with the changes in the net heat flux linked to el niño southern oscillation enso xie et al 2009 du et al 2009 roxy et al 2014 gadgil et al 2004 have shown that the sustained convection over the weio and suppression of convection over the eeio characteristic of a positive phase of equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo is favourable for the indian summer monsoon the positive phase of equinoo events can overcome the adverse effects of an el niño on the indian monsoon gadgil et al 2004 charlotte et al 2012 surendran et al 2015 further enhanced convection over the weio is associated with enhanced rainfall over almost all parts of indian subcontinent fig 3 in 2007 warm sst anomalies are observed in most part of the central and western indian ocean together with enhanced suppressed convection over the central and western eastern indian ocean fig 2c and d interestingly significant cooling of sea surface was not seen until september in the eeio further the magnitude of the sst anomalies in the weio was greater than any other piod events in the recent period fig s1 in the supplementary information in addition as seen from fig s2 in which normalized by standard deviation sst anomaly averaged over the weio during the summer monsoon season june september for the period 1982 2010 is shown positive sst anomalies in the weio in 2007 was the strongest other than 1983 the magnitude of sst anomaly in the weio during june september was close to two standard deviation σ the warming of weio in 1983 which is similar to 2007 was not investigated in this study due to the non availability of necessary data and model simulations it may be noted from fig s2 that strong warming of weio happened in 2009 and 2010 also however these events were associated with a basin wide warming of indian ocean in which eastern equatorial indian ocean eeio also warmed up considerably hence warming of weio during 2009 and 2010 are not unique some studies have classified the indian ocean conditions during 2007 as a weak piod event as the values of dipole mode index dmi were positive in several months behera et al 2008 cai et al 2009 rao et al 2009 iskandar et al 2014 however it may be noted that the dmi which is defined as the difference in the sst anomaly of the weio and the eeio exceeded one standard deviation only in the month of september the positive values of dmi in most of the months in 2007 were due to warmer than normal sst in the weio rather than the cooling of the eeio which is the most prominent signature of the piod events fig 2a and c interestingly the dipole like pattern with cooler than normal eeio and warmer weio appeared in the month of september in 2007 but it disappeared by the month of november and the indian ocean returned to normal conditions in addition to this 2007 event evolved together with a developing la niña this situation is atypical of indian ocean conditions i e a negative positive iod occurring during the development phase of la niña el niño cai et al 2009 lim and hendon 2017 a similar event i e the co occurrence of la niña and piod happened only in the year 1967 in the recent history behera et al 2008 in a typical event when a la niña co occurs with negative iod they have a common ascending branch of the walker circulation over the maritime continent and descending branches over the weio and eastern pacific in the indo pacific basin behera et al 2008 this leads to anomalous westerlies in the equatorial indian ocean a characteristic feature of negative equinoo iod which leads to anomalous cooling in the weio and warming in the eeio saji et al 1999 gadgil et al 2004 the anomalous warming of the weio in 2007 is therefore clearly a deviation from such a normal combination in addition to this the 2007 event occurred after a strong iod event in 2006 consecutive occurrence of piod events in the indian ocean is extremely rare behera et al 2008 therefore the seldomness of this event motivated us to investigate the unique conditions in the indian ocean associated with the 2007 event further it may be noted that the indian summer monsoon was close to an excess season all indian summer monsoon rainfall anomaly above normal by one standard deviation in 2007 which happened for the first time after the 1994 monsoon season based on all india rainfall data provided at http www tropmet res in as noted above this was associated with a strong positive equinoo event with enhanced convection over the weio and suppressed convection over the eeio fig 2d this is consistent with the findings of gadgil et al 2004 that the positive equinoo is favourable for stronger monsoon therefore variation in the sst of the weio during the monsoon season of 2007 and its link to the convection activity clearly suggest that it is important to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in the variation of the sst in the weio in particular for understanding the variation of the ismr in different timescales in this paper we attempt to address this issue with a case study of 2007 by analysing the observed data and the numerical ocean model simulations the paper is organized as follows brief

mentioned above excluding 2007 2 2 ocean models simulations from the regional ocean modelling system roms version 3 6 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 are extensively used here to study the processes which determine the evolution of sst in the weio to study the processes involved in the persistence of warmer sst in the weio during the monsoon season of 2007 in addition to the simulations by roms we analysed the simulations from a relatively simpler linear and continuously stratified lcs model also details of the model setup and configuration are given below 2 2 1 regional ocean modelling system roms roms is a three dimensional terrain following sigma coordinate system model which solves the primitive equations on an arakawa c grid with a second order finite difference scheme shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 it assumes the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations the domain of the model setup covers the entire tropical indian ocean extending from 30 e to 120 e and from 30 s to 30 n this is an upgraded configuration of the model used in francis et al 2013 with increased horizontal resolution and realistic open boundary conditions the horizontal resolution of the model is 1 12 approximately 9 km the vertical stretching parameters are chosen in such a way that the model has higher vertical resolution in the upper layers compared to the bottom layers θ s 7 and θ b 0 2 the ocean model is forced at the surface boundary with six hourly atmospheric analysis based on global forecast system gfs provided by national centre for medium range weather forecast ncmrwf with a horizontal resolution of 1 4 the model uses the kpp mixing scheme large et al 1994 to parametrize the vertical mixing and bulk parameterization scheme fairall et al 1996 for the computation of air sea fluxes latent and sensible heat fluxes while the net longwave and net shortwave are taken directly from the atmospheric forcing penetrative solar radiation corresponding to type i water jerlov 1968 as described by paulson and simpson 1977 is used in this model configuration the model is initialized using the tracer momentum and sea level anomaly data for 4 january 2005 derived from incois godas ocean analysis ravichandran et al 2013 and integrated up to 29 april 2016 the lateral boundary conditions of momentum tracers and sea level anomaly in the south and east are also derived from 10 day averaged values from the incois godas ocean analysis sea surface salinity of the model is relaxed to climatological values obtained from world ocean atlas woa 2009 antonov et al 2010 2 2 2 linear continuously stratified model lcs solutions from the lcs model mccreary et al 1996 are used in the study to understand the mechanisms involved in the evolution and maintenance of higher sst in the weio the model equations are linearized about a uniform background density state and the variables are decomposed into vertical normal modes a flat bottom and realistic coastline are prescribed in the model configuration which has a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 in the domain 30 s 30 n 30 e 120 e the model is forced by quikscat daily mean winds with horizontal resolution 0 25 0 25 from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2012 the solutions are obtained as the sum of first 10 vertical modes we refer to the above solution as the control ctl experiment since the lcs model is linear it is easy to separate the contribution of local and remote forcing to the ssha to assess the relative importance of reflected rossby waves from the eastern boundary we performed a sensitivity experiment by applying a damper near the eastern boundary from 90 e onwards to dampen those waves which reach the eastern boundary the sensitivity experiment has been done in such a way that there is a damper in the p pressure equation that relaxes p to zero within eastern indian ocean 90 e 94 e 1 5 s 5 n it has the form γ p where γ increases linearly towards the eastern boundary from zero at 90 e to a maximum at 94 e the damper ensures that kelvin waves which reach the eastern boundary do not get reflected back as rossby waves hence the solutions of this experiment do not contain the waves reflected from the eastern boundary and only the waves directly forced by the surface forcing are present this experiment is referred as eastern boundary damped experiment ebdex the difference between ctl run and ebdex gives the contribution of reflected waves from the eastern boundary 2 3 calculation of mixed layer heat budget the mixed layer is the uppermost layer of the ocean where quantities such as temperature salinity and density are homogeneous due to turbulent mixing associated with wind stress and heat exchange at the air sea interface kara et al 2000 mixed layer temperature mlt tendency equation used in the present study to estimate the upper ocean heat budget terms based on qu 2001 is given below 1 t m t q q p ρ c p h u t m w e n t t m t d h m r e s 2 where w e n t h m t u h m w m b in eq 1 t m denotes mlt t m t is the rate of change of t m ρ is seawater density 1024 kg m 3 c p is the heat capacity of seawater 4000 j kg 1 k 1 h m is mixed layer depth mld q is the net surface heat flux w m 2 q p is the shortwave radiation w m 2 penetrating below the mixed layer u is the current velocity which includes u and v which are the zonal and meridional velocities respectively w ent is the entrainment rate ms 1 and t d is the temperature at the bottom of the mixed layer w mb is the velocity at the base of the mixed layer res is residual term q p is calculated based on the empirical formula given below morel and antoine 1994 sweeney et al 2005 3 q p q s r 1 e h γ 1 r 2 e h γ 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation of the ocean model in this section we examine the simulated seasonal cycle in the weio the sst is known to be influenced by various processes which occur in the mixed layer such as the exchange of heat with atmosphere via surface fluxes advection of heat within the mixed layer and vertical processes such as upwelling entrainment of subsurface water into the mixed layer etc shenoi et al 2002 kurian and vinayachandran 2007 kang et al 2010 the depth of the mixed layer regulates the amount of heat content to be sustained in the upper layer and hence becomes an important quantity which influences the sst variation morioka et al 2010 keerthi et al 2013 hence accurate simulation of the mld is very important for the calculation of mixed layer heat budget and thus the evolution of the sst chen and busalacchi 1994 qiu et al 2004 in the present study following kara et al 2000 we define the mld as the depth at which the temperature is 0 8 c less than that at the surface it corresponds to the density criteria of 0 2 kg m 3 for such an mld criteria the correlation coefficient between temperature averaged over the mld and sst is 0 99 fig 4a depicts the seasonal cycle of the mld derived from the woa climatology locarnini et al 2010 antonov et al 2010 and from the roms model simulations it may be seen that there is a good agreement in the seasonal variation of the mld between the model and observations in the weio the mld exhibits pronounced annual cycle with deepening shoaling of the mld during winter and summer pre and post monsoon monsoon season which has been captured accurately by the model the deepening of the mld could be attributed to the seasonally reversing strong monsoon winds which enhance evaporation and hence latent heat loss and deepen the mixed layer during january march and june september santoso et al 2010 in addition to this the magnitude of the mld is greater during summer monsoon season 55 m compared to the winter monsoon season 45 m the model reproduces the sst seasonal cycle in the weio fig 4b with good accuracy the sst in the weio reaches its peak in march may 29 c and decreases in june august 27 c and then again peaks during october november 28 5 c the annual cycle of the model net heat flux agrees well with the observations fig 4c it is observed that the weio gains heat throughout the year except during the summer monsoon season this reduction in heat gain during summer monsoon season is due to the larger latent heat loss induced by monsoon winds and reduced shortwave radiative fluxes due to the presence of deep clouds the seasonal cycles of each component of heat flux indicate that the net heat flux is mainly dominated by the latent heat fluxes and shortwave radiation fluxes with longwave radiative fluxes and sensible heat fluxes playing relatively weaker roles fig not shown the surface currents also agree well with the observations fig 4d the surface zonal currents are eastward with speed of 10 cm s 1 during intermonsoon phases while it weakens during summer monsoon season this eastward flow of currents could be attributed to the winds in the equatorial indian ocean which are westerlies during pre and post monsoon season wyrtki 1973 luyten and roemmich 1982 the meridional currents also show good agreement with observations fig 4d both oscar and model simulations display weak southward flow associated with ekman transport during the summer monsoon season this generally good agreement between the model simulations and observations encouraged us to investigate the mixed layer heat budget in the weio using the model simulations 3 2 climatological heat budget in the western equatorial indian ocean variation of the individual terms of the mixed layer heat budget equation for the weio along with the rate of change of mlt are shown in fig 5 as discussed in the previous section the weio experiences two phases of warming during spring and fall march april and september november and one cooling phase during summer monsoon season june august it may be seen that in the weio the variation in the mlt tendency is generally driven by the net heat flux however the advection processes are relatively weak with oceanic vertical processes that contributes to cooling of sst throughout the year the first warming phase occurs during spring in which the contribution of atmospheric forcing also reaches maximum the reduction in winds which result in the decrease of heat losses combined with a shallow mixed layer is responsible for the increase in atmospheric heating rate figs 4a 5a along with this short wave radiation is maximum due to the absence of clouds which also warms up the sea surface during this season with the onset of summer monsoon oceanic vertical processes become strong contributors to the heat budget of the weio it is observed that upwelling starts in the month of may which has a huge contribution to the cooling of the weio along with the entrainment of cooler water fig 5d along coastal regions of the weio especially in the oman somalia coasts the winds are favourable for upwelling which cools the sst this results in significant cooling in the coastal region of the weio the oceanic vertical processes contribute to a decrease of 0 5 c in sst during the summer monsoon season along with vertical processes atmospheric forcing also cools the sst significantly reduced short wave radiation due to the presence of clouds and increased latent heat losses associated with stronger surface winds result in the cooling of the weio fig 5a b both vertical processes and atmospheric forcing are important and contribute equally to the sst cooling during summer monsoon it may be noted that the mixed layer also deepens due to the strong winds and strong vertical mixing during the summer monsoon season in the weio vertical advection of cooler water is important only during summer monsoon season when the winds are strong the lateral advection slightly warms up the ocean surface during summer monsoon though its contribution is relatively small further the meridional component dominates in the lateral advection of heat in the weio fig 4c during fall the mixed layer in the weio shoals and warms up due to enhanced incoming solar radiation and reduced latent heat losses in this season sst is mainly controlled by the air sea fluxes alone in the model the shortwave radiation penetrating below the mixed layer ranges from 15 w m 2 to 35 w m 2 in which the lower values correspond to summer monsoon season when mixed layer is deep the contribution of sensible heat flux to heat budget is almost negligible in all the seasons in the model the magnitude of the residual term which includes the numerical errors in the computation of ml heat budget is comparatively large when the mixed layer is shallow this is consistent with the findings of thangaprakash et al 2016 that the representation of shortwave penetration is not very accurate in the numerical models in the shallow mixed layer regimes 3 3 anomalous warming of the weio during late spring early summer in 2007 3 3 1 anomalous subsurface warming in the weio fig 6 shows the time depth section of temperature and corresponding anomalies in the weio for the piod composite and for the year 2007 compared to the piod composite there is remarkably strong anomalous warming with deeper than usual isothermal layers in the weio from april to july it is not uncommon that the weio warms up considerably in the boreal spring during the decaying phase of elnino due to the changes in the net heat flux klein et al 1999 vinayachandran et al 2009 however weio cools in the subsequent months june and july when the monsoon begins fig s3 therefore what is remarkable about 2007 is the sustained subsurface warming during june and july it is possible that this anomalous subsurface warming helped the weio to maintain the warmer sst even with stronger convection in 2007 since the deepening of the thermocline has significant role in the sustained warming of weio in 2007 the possible mechanisms which maintained the weio warmer than usual are examined in this section a mixed layer heat budget analysis is carried out using the simulations by roms to estimate the relative influences of atmospheric forcing and oceanic vertical processes to warming of the weio contributions of each of the individual terms to the mlt tendency equation eq 1 during the months of june and july the months in which maximum anomalous subsurface warming is observed compared to the piod composite of 2007 and climatology are given in table 1 in general the vertical oceanic processes such as upwelling and entrainment and atmospheric forcings play significant roles in cooling the weio during the summer monsoon compared to the climatology the contribution of atmospheric forcing in the cooling of the mlt of the weio is higher by 17 in 2007 lateral advection also contributed to the cooling of sst in 2007 however there is a 30 decrease in the contribution of vertical processes to the sst cooling in 2007 compared to the climatology it is seen that there is substantial decrease in the contribution of vertical processes the process which generally cools the weio during july thus even though atmospheric fluxes and the lateral advection were favourable for the cooling of surface layers of the weio during june and july in 2007 the reduction in the contribution of vertical oceanic processes to the cooling helped this region to remain warmer we have compared the contribution of each term of the mlt tendency in june and july of 2013 in which the sst in the weio was the lowest during the 2005 2015 period with those for 2007 in table s1 in the supplementary information it may be seen that the vertical processes are the most dominant factors which contributed to the cooling of the weio 189 during july 2013 this confirms the dominant role played by the vertical processes maintaining the higher sst during the summer monsoon season of 2007 next we address the factors which could have lead to the reduction in the contribution of vertical processes to the weio cooling in 2007 3 3 2 role of equatorial winds in the indian ocean during spring of 2007 the pronounced semiannual cycle of zonal winds over the equatorial indian ocean drive eastward equatorial jets known as wyrtki jet during summer yoshida 1960 wyrtki 1973 the anomalies in the zonal winds over the equatorial indian ocean can weaken or even reverse the wyrtki jet which causes a decrease in eastward transport resulting in a shallower thermocline in the east hastenrath et al 1993 vinayachandran et al 1999 and deeper thermocline in the west anomalous downwelling rossby waves forced by anomalous easterlies in the equatorial indian ocean can deepen the thermocline and prevent cooling of the sea surface in the weio murtugudde et al 2000 along with this the westerlies over the equatorial indian ocean during boreal spring usually excite downwelling kelvin waves which propagate eastward and remotely affect sea level and thermal structure along the eeio luyten and roemmich 1982 clarke and liu 1993 yamagata et al 1996 meyers 1996 vinayachandran et al 2009 these kelvin waves get reflected as rossby waves at the eastern boundary which travel westward and deepen the isothermal layers in the weio hence the surface atmospheric forcing in the equatorial indian ocean has profound impact on the variation in the isothermal layers in the eeio and the weio the variation of the zonal wind averaged over the equatorial indian ocean 80 90 e 2 5 s 2 5 n during april 2007 is given in fig 7a it may be noted that two major wind bursts occured in the month of april the former latter being a westerly easterly burst on the first second fortnight of april this anomalous westerly burst had a mean speed of 2 4 ms 1 analysis of outgoing longwave radiation data figure not shown over the equatorial indian ocean suggests that this westerly wind burst was due to enhanced convection over the eeio associated with an eastward propagating active phase of mjo in the first two weeks of april 2007 this was followed by much stronger anomalous easterlies with a maximum speed of about 4 5 ms 1 fig 7a easterly wind anomalies were weaker in the first few days in the month of may gradually strengthened thereafter and remained stronger during the rest of the month figure not shown 3 3 3 role of downwelling rossby waves in the anomalous warming of the weio associated with the changes in the surface wind corresponding changes are noticed in ssha also fig 8a in which the time longitude section of 20 90 day filtered ssha averaged over 5 n 5 n obtained from aviso is depicted clearly shows the westward propagation of positive ssha with a phase speed of 0 84 m s the westerly wind event during early april in the equatorial indian ocean with maximum intensity located from 85 e to 95 e leads to the positive ssha fig 8a b the figure clearly indicates the generation of a kelvin wave at the equator around 85 e during april as evident from the positive ssha in this region this ssha associated with the downwelling kelvin wave reached the eastern boundary within eight days suggesting a speed of about 2 4 ms 1 this speed agrees with the theoretical speed of first mode equatorial kelvin waves chelton et al 1998 webber et al 2014 it is clearly seen that after reaching the eastern boundary this positive ssha signal got reflected and propagated as a downwelling rossby wave at a speed of approximately 0 84 ms 1 fig 8a this speed also matches with the theoretical phase speed of first baroclinic mode of oceanic rossby waves near the equator associated with the propagation of the high ssha an increase in the depth of 20 c isotherm which is a measure of depth of thermocline is also clearly seen at 90 e 4 n measured by rama buoy fig 8c it may be noted that the roms model simulated these propagations of ssha associated with both the downwelling kelvin wave and the reflected rossby wave and the variation in 20 c isotherm with very good accuracy fig 8b the phase speed estimated for kelvin wave in the model simulation is approximately 2 ms 1 and for the rossby wave is 0 85 ms 1 the reflected downwelling rossby wave reached the weio around late june and caused a deepening of the thermocline fig 8c the deeper thermocline prohibited the cooling of the weio despite having strong convection and thus higher sst anomalies persisted in the weio during june july it may be noted that the anomalous easterlies in the second fortnight of april 2007 also could have generated downwelling upwelling rossby kelvin wave towards west east and influenced the thermocline variability in the weio however it is difficult to differentiate the effects of westerly and easterly wind bursts in the observation and roms model hence in order to ascertain the relative contribution of reflected and directly forced rossby waves we next analyse the simulations by the lcs model the lcs model gives an opportunity to detect the wave processes associated with warming of the weio as the model output can be differentiated into wind forced and boundary reflected waves in the next section we evaluate the relative contribution of wind forced and boundary reflected waves in generating anomalous sea level variations and hence the maintenance of the anomalous warming of the weio the spatio temporal evolution of ssha induced by the wind forced and boundary reflected during april july 2007 obtained from the ctl run of the lcs model is shown in fig 9 even though the model slightly underestimates the magnitude of anomalies the pattern of propagation of ssha in the ctl run matches well with the observation it is interesting that in the ctl run two downwelling rossby waves are observed one around the second week of april and the other during the first week of may while strong westerly wind anomalies are observed in early april easterly wind anomalies appeared from late april onwards it is interesting to note that these anomalous easterlies appeared in the second fortnight of april are associated with suppressed convection phase of mjo rao et al 2009 the anomalous westerlies appeared in the beginning of april generated downwelling upwelling kelvin rossby waves which propagated to east west as discussed in the previous section generation and propagation of these waves are simulated by the model with good accuracy in addition to that generation of downwelling rossby wave associated with anomalous easterlies from mid april to may and its propagation to the weio are also clearly seen in fig 9 in order to demonstrate the impact of wind forced rossby waves we have performed an experimental run in which the waves reaching the eastern boundary are damped at 90 e in the sensitivity experiment ebdex a hovmoller diagram of ssha band passed at 20 90 days and averaged over 5 s 5 n is shown in fig 10c in this experimental run the kelvin waves reaching the eastern boundary are not allowed to reflect back with the help of the damper applied east of 90 e thus the waves generated as a direct response of the equatorial forcing only will be present in this solution it is clearly seen that during early may as an oceanic response to the anomalous easterly wind anomalies in the 75 e 85 e longitudinal band downwelling rossby waves are generated fig 10c this downwelling rossby wave is generated around 80 e and propagates westward with a phase speed of 0 64 ms 2 which is slightly less than the theoretical phase speed of first baroclinic mode of oceanic rossby waves this rossby wave also reached the western boundary around late june early july the difference between ctl and ebdex shown in fig 10b represents the contribution of wave which is reflected back from the eastern boundary westward propagating positive ssha as a response of the westerly wind burst in the equatorial indian ocean is seen from the third week of april onwards this rossby wave reaches the western boundary in the last week of june it is clear from the model simulations that the downwelling kelvin wave which is excited as a response to anomalous westerlies during early april gets reflected and propagated westward as a downwelling rossby wave fig 10a and b thus a couple of downwelling rossby waves reflected and wind induced propagated to the weio deepened the thermocline there and helped the weio to remain warm during the early part of the monsoon season in 2007 4 conclusion in this paper the terms of the mixed layer heat budget are estimated from the simulations of high resolution ogcm configured for the indian ocean for identifying the major factors which influenced the variation of mlt in the weio validation of the model mld sst net heat flux and surface currents shows good agreement between the model and observations in the weio surface forcing from fluxes especially from the shortwave radiation and latent heat fluxes are the major factors which control the variation in the mlt however during summer monsoon season vertical processes also contribute equally to the sst cooling in the weio it was observed that among the years in the recent past convection over the weio was anomalously high in the monsoon season of 2007 interestingly in 2007 anomalous convection over the weio was also associated with positive sst anomalies throughout the summer monsoon season in the present study we studied the reasons for the sustained warming of the weio in 2007 despite not being a significant piod event heat budget analysis shows that there was a 30 decrease in the contribution of vertical processes to the cooling of weio it is found that the substantial reduction in the vertical processes was mainly responsible for the observed positive sst anomaly in the weio this was associated with the arrival of downwelling rossby waves in the weio the westerly wind event during the first fortnight of april in the equatorial indian ocean with maximum intensity located from 85 e to 95 e generated downwelling kelvin waves these downwelling kelvin waves reached the eastern boundary and reflected back as downwelling rossby waves and propagated towards weio apart from this easterly wind burst in the 75 e 85 e longitudes in the second fortnight of april 2007 also generated a downwelling rossby wave which reached weio in late june early july thus a combination of two episodes of downwelling rossby waves was responsible for the deepening of the thermocline in the weio and thus sustaining higher than normal sst and

23980,in this study observational data together with the simulations from a high resolution numerical ocean model are used to identify the processes responsible for the anomalous warm sea surface temperature sst in the equatorial indian ocean during late spring early summer in 2007 our analysis suggests that the sst in the western equatorial indian ocean weio remained unusually warm owing to the combined influence of the wind induced and reflected rossby waves in the equatorial indian ocean anomalous westerly wind burst in the equatorial indian ocean in early april generated an eastward propagating downwelling kelvin wave which got reflected from the eastern boundary as a downwelling rossby wave and propagated to the weio the easterlies appeared during the second fortnight of april generated another downwelling rossby wave which also propagated to the weio thus a couple of downwelling rossby waves reflected and direct wind induced propagated to the weio deepened the thermocline and prohibited cooling in the weio during the early months of summer monsoon season this study demonstrates the importance of the equatorial winds and associated oceanic dynamics in modulating the sst variability in the weio 1 introduction distribution of sea surface temperature sst is considered to be one of the most critical parameters that determines the location of deep convection over the tropical oceans gadgil et al 1984 graham and barnett 1987 gadgil et al 1984 have shown that the relationship between sst and convection is highly non linear in the tropical oceans and 27 5 c is a suitable threshold value for the local sst to support deep convection below this threshold the probability for deep convection to occur is very low if the sst is above this threshold the atmospheric dynamics determines the location of deep convection graham and barnett 1987 thus sst being above 27 5 c is a necessary condition for deep convection to occur over the tropical oceans but not the sufficient condition most part of the tropical indian ocean is above this threshold for deep convection due to the presence of indian ocean warm pool though as a response to strong monsoon winds and intense upwelling the sea surface in the western parts of the equatorial indian ocean is relatively cooler compared to the central and eastern parts during summer monsoon season montégut et al 2007 izumo et al 2008 francis et al 2007 have shown that despite the sst in the western equatorial indian ocean weio 50 e 70 e 10 s 10 n being above 27 5 c the convection over this region is generally intermittent in the monsoon season except during strong positive indian ocean dipole piod events the frequency distributions of monthly mean outgoing longwave radiation olr in the weio when the monthly mean sst in the corresponding grid is above and below 27 5 c are depicted in fig 1 it may be seen that when sst is below 27 5 c 90 of grids have olr values greater than 240 w m 2 absence of deep convection with the mode at 260 270 w m 2 fig 1a this shows that when sst in the weio is cool below the threshold deep convection hardly occurs however about 65 of grids have olr values less than 240 w m 2 represents deep convection when sst is greater than 27 5 c fig 1b thus for the occurrence of organized convection in the weio it is necessary to have sst above the threshold value of 27 5 c it is seen that there is a drastic change in the convection when sst increases from 27 5 c therefore slight changes in the sst distribution of the weio will have significant influence on the atmospheric circulation there the indian ocean dipole iod a coupled ocean atmosphere process in the tropical indian ocean is associated with anomalous warming in the weio and cooling in the eastern equatorial indian ocean eeio 90 e 110 e 10 s equator fig 2a saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 during the piod events enhanced convection is seen over the weio while it remains suppressed over the eeio fig 2b saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 several studies have shown that the atmospheric dynamics plays a critical role in suppressing convection over the eeio and promoting convection over the weio during the developing phase of a piod kajikawa et al 2003 li et al 2003 francis et al 2007 during the mature phase of piod events the sea surface becomes anomalously warm in the weio conducive for convection and sst in the eeio falls below the threshold for deep convection reverdin et al 1986 hastenrath et al 1993 saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 francis et al 2007 previous studies have suggested that anomalous easterlies and associated internal dynamics promote warming in the weio during the piod saji et al 1999 murtugudde et al 2000 vinayachandran et al 2002 francis et al 2007 anomalous easterlies in the equatorial indian ocean induce surface divergence at the equator which shoals the thermocline and this signal propagates eastward as upwelling kelvin wave vinayachandran et al 2002 francis et al 2007 in the eastern boundary this upwelling kelvin wave lifts up the thermocline which acts as a favourable condition to cool the eeio vinayachandran et al 1999 murtugudde et al 2000 vinayachandran et al 2002 rao et al 2002 further the local alongshore southeasterly winds also favour the coastal upwelling in the eeio vinayachandran et al 1999 murtugudde et al 2000 at the same time the convergence of warm water in the off equatorial region induced by the anomalous easterlies deepens the thermocline and propagates westward as downwelling rossby waves the anomalous anticyclonic wind stress curl due to the southeasterly winds along sumatra java coasts also triggers downwelling rossby waves xie et al 2002 rao and behera 2005 which upon reaching the weio prohibits cooling of the sea surface by preventing entrainment murtugudde et al 2000 vinayachandran et al 2002 it may be noted that the warming of the weio associated with piod generally starts in the middle of the monsoon season and continues until fall winter seasons saji et al 1999 vinayachandran et al 2002 hastenrath et al 1993 have reported that the climate anomalies in the weio can be related to the southern oscillation also through coupled ocean atmosphere processes and these anomalies peak during october november some recent studies also have shown that the changes in the sst of the weio can be associated with the changes in the net heat flux linked to el niño southern oscillation enso xie et al 2009 du et al 2009 roxy et al 2014 gadgil et al 2004 have shown that the sustained convection over the weio and suppression of convection over the eeio characteristic of a positive phase of equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo is favourable for the indian summer monsoon the positive phase of equinoo events can overcome the adverse effects of an el niño on the indian monsoon gadgil et al 2004 charlotte et al 2012 surendran et al 2015 further enhanced convection over the weio is associated with enhanced rainfall over almost all parts of indian subcontinent fig 3 in 2007 warm sst anomalies are observed in most part of the central and western indian ocean together with enhanced suppressed convection over the central and western eastern indian ocean fig 2c and d interestingly significant cooling of sea surface was not seen until september in the eeio further the magnitude of the sst anomalies in the weio was greater than any other piod events in the recent period fig s1 in the supplementary information in addition as seen from fig s2 in which normalized by standard deviation sst anomaly averaged over the weio during the summer monsoon season june september for the period 1982 2010 is shown positive sst anomalies in the weio in 2007 was the strongest other than 1983 the magnitude of sst anomaly in the weio during june september was close to two standard deviation σ the warming of weio in 1983 which is similar to 2007 was not investigated in this study due to the non availability of necessary data and model simulations it may be noted from fig s2 that strong warming of weio happened in 2009 and 2010 also however these events were associated with a basin wide warming of indian ocean in which eastern equatorial indian ocean eeio also warmed up considerably hence warming of weio during 2009 and 2010 are not unique some studies have classified the indian ocean conditions during 2007 as a weak piod event as the values of dipole mode index dmi were positive in several months behera et al 2008 cai et al 2009 rao et al 2009 iskandar et al 2014 however it may be noted that the dmi which is defined as the difference in the sst anomaly of the weio and the eeio exceeded one standard deviation only in the month of september the positive values of dmi in most of the months in 2007 were due to warmer than normal sst in the weio rather than the cooling of the eeio which is the most prominent signature of the piod events fig 2a and c interestingly the dipole like pattern with cooler than normal eeio and warmer weio appeared in the month of september in 2007 but it disappeared by the month of november and the indian ocean returned to normal conditions in addition to this 2007 event evolved together with a developing la niña this situation is atypical of indian ocean conditions i e a negative positive iod occurring during the development phase of la niña el niño cai et al 2009 lim and hendon 2017 a similar event i e the co occurrence of la niña and piod happened only in the year 1967 in the recent history behera et al 2008 in a typical event when a la niña co occurs with negative iod they have a common ascending branch of the walker circulation over the maritime continent and descending branches over the weio and eastern pacific in the indo pacific basin behera et al 2008 this leads to anomalous westerlies in the equatorial indian ocean a characteristic feature of negative equinoo iod which leads to anomalous cooling in the weio and warming in the eeio saji et al 1999 gadgil et al 2004 the anomalous warming of the weio in 2007 is therefore clearly a deviation from such a normal combination in addition to this the 2007 event occurred after a strong iod event in 2006 consecutive occurrence of piod events in the indian ocean is extremely rare behera et al 2008 therefore the seldomness of this event motivated us to investigate the unique conditions in the indian ocean associated with the 2007 event further it may be noted that the indian summer monsoon was close to an excess season all indian summer monsoon rainfall anomaly above normal by one standard deviation in 2007 which happened for the first time after the 1994 monsoon season based on all india rainfall data provided at http www tropmet res in as noted above this was associated with a strong positive equinoo event with enhanced convection over the weio and suppressed convection over the eeio fig 2d this is consistent with the findings of gadgil et al 2004 that the positive equinoo is favourable for stronger monsoon therefore variation in the sst of the weio during the monsoon season of 2007 and its link to the convection activity clearly suggest that it is important to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in the variation of the sst in the weio in particular for understanding the variation of the ismr in different timescales in this paper we attempt to address this issue with a case study of 2007 by analysing the observed data and the numerical ocean model simulations the paper is organized as follows brief descriptions of data used ocean general circulation model ogcm linearized continuously stratified lcs model and calculations of mixed layer heat budget are given in section 2 section 3 discusses the

mentioned above excluding 2007 2 2 ocean models simulations from the regional ocean modelling system roms version 3 6 shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 are extensively used here to study the processes which determine the evolution of sst in the weio to study the processes involved in the persistence of warmer sst in the weio during the monsoon season of 2007 in addition to the simulations by roms we analysed the simulations from a relatively simpler linear and continuously stratified lcs model also details of the model setup and configuration are given below 2 2 1 regional ocean modelling system roms roms is a three dimensional terrain following sigma coordinate system model which solves the primitive equations on an arakawa c grid with a second order finite difference scheme shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 it assumes the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations the domain of the model setup covers the entire tropical indian ocean extending from 30 e to 120 e and from 30 s to 30 n this is an upgraded configuration of the model used in francis et al 2013 with increased horizontal resolution and realistic open boundary conditions the horizontal resolution of the model is 1 12 approximately 9 km the vertical stretching parameters are chosen in such a way that the model has higher vertical resolution in the upper layers compared to the bottom layers θ s 7 and θ b 0 2 the ocean model is forced at the surface boundary with six hourly atmospheric analysis based on global forecast system gfs provided by national centre for medium range weather forecast ncmrwf with a horizontal resolution of 1 4 the model uses the kpp mixing scheme large et al 1994 to parametrize the vertical mixing and bulk parameterization scheme fairall et al 1996 for the computation of air sea fluxes latent and sensible heat fluxes while the net longwave and net shortwave are taken directly from the atmospheric forcing penetrative solar radiation corresponding to type i water jerlov 1968 as described by paulson and simpson 1977 is used in this model configuration the model is initialized using the tracer momentum and sea level anomaly data for 4 january 2005 derived from incois godas ocean analysis ravichandran et al 2013 and integrated up to 29 april 2016 the lateral boundary conditions of momentum tracers and sea level anomaly in the south and east are also derived from 10 day averaged values from the incois godas ocean analysis sea surface salinity of the model is relaxed to climatological values obtained from world ocean atlas woa 2009 antonov et al 2010 2 2 2 linear continuously stratified model lcs solutions from the lcs model mccreary et al 1996 are used in the study to understand the mechanisms involved in the evolution and maintenance of higher sst in the weio the model equations are linearized about a uniform background density state and the variables are decomposed into vertical normal modes a flat bottom and realistic coastline are prescribed in the model configuration which has a horizontal resolution of 0 25 0 25 in the domain 30 s 30 n 30 e 120 e the model is forced by quikscat daily mean winds with horizontal resolution 0 25 0 25 from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2012 the solutions are obtained as the sum of first 10 vertical modes we refer to the above solution as the control ctl experiment since the lcs model is linear it is easy to separate the contribution of local and remote forcing to the ssha to assess the relative importance of reflected rossby waves from the eastern boundary we performed a sensitivity experiment by applying a damper near the eastern boundary from 90 e onwards to dampen those waves which reach the eastern boundary the sensitivity experiment has been done in such a way that there is a damper in the p pressure equation that relaxes p to zero within eastern indian ocean 90 e 94 e 1 5 s 5 n it has the form γ p where γ increases linearly towards the eastern boundary from zero at 90 e to a maximum at 94 e the damper ensures that kelvin waves which reach the eastern boundary do not get reflected back as rossby waves hence the solutions of this experiment do not contain the waves reflected from the eastern boundary and only the waves directly forced by the surface forcing are present this experiment is referred as eastern boundary damped experiment ebdex the difference between ctl run and ebdex gives the contribution of reflected waves from the eastern boundary 2 3 calculation of mixed layer heat budget the mixed layer is the uppermost layer of the ocean where quantities such as temperature salinity and density are homogeneous due to turbulent mixing associated with wind stress and heat exchange at the air sea interface kara et al 2000 mixed layer temperature mlt tendency equation used in the present study to estimate the upper ocean heat budget terms based on qu 2001 is given below 1 t m t q q p ρ c p h u t m w e n t t m t d h m r e s 2 where w e n t h m t u

surface heat flux w m 2 q p is the shortwave radiation w m 2 penetrating below the mixed layer u is the current velocity which includes u and v which are the zonal and meridional velocities respectively w ent is the entrainment rate ms 1 and t d is the temperature at the bottom of the mixed layer w mb is the velocity at the base of the mixed layer res is residual term q p is calculated based on the empirical formula given below morel and antoine 1994 sweeney et al 2005 3 q p q s r 1 e h γ 1 r 2 e h γ 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 validation of the ocean model in this section we examine the simulated seasonal cycle in the weio the sst is known to be influenced by various processes which occur in the mixed layer such as the exchange of heat with atmosphere via surface fluxes advection of heat within the mixed layer and vertical processes such as upwelling entrainment of subsurface water into the mixed layer etc shenoi et al 2002 kurian and vinayachandran 2007 kang et al 2010 the depth of the mixed layer regulates the amount of heat content to be sustained in the upper layer and hence becomes an important quantity which influences the sst variation morioka et al 2010 keerthi et al 2013 hence accurate simulation of the mld is very important for the calculation of mixed layer heat budget and thus the evolution of the sst chen and busalacchi 1994 qiu et al 2004 in the present study following kara et al 2000 we define the mld as the depth at which the temperature is 0 8 c less than that at the surface it corresponds to the density criteria of 0 2 kg m 3 for such an mld criteria the correlation coefficient between temperature averaged over the mld and sst is 0 99 fig 4a depicts the seasonal cycle of the mld derived from the woa climatology locarnini et al 2010 antonov et al 2010 and from the roms model simulations it may be seen that there is a good agreement in the seasonal variation of the mld between the model and observations in the weio the mld exhibits pronounced annual cycle with deepening shoaling of the mld during winter and summer pre and post monsoon monsoon season which has been captured accurately by the model the deepening of the mld could be attributed to the seasonally reversing strong monsoon winds which enhance evaporation and hence latent heat loss and deepen the mixed layer during january march and june september santoso et al 2010 in addition to this the magnitude of the mld is greater during summer monsoon season 55 m compared to the winter monsoon season 45 m the model reproduces the sst seasonal cycle in the weio fig 4b with good accuracy the sst in the weio reaches its peak in march may 29 c and decreases in june august 27 c and then again peaks during october november 28 5 c the annual cycle of the model net heat flux agrees well with the observations fig 4c it is observed that the weio gains heat throughout the year except during the summer monsoon season this reduction in heat gain during summer monsoon season is due to the larger latent heat loss induced by monsoon winds and reduced shortwave radiative fluxes due to the presence of deep clouds the seasonal cycles of each component of heat flux indicate that the net heat flux is mainly dominated by the latent heat fluxes and shortwave radiation fluxes with longwave radiative fluxes and sensible heat fluxes playing relatively weaker roles fig not shown the surface currents also agree well with the observations fig 4d the surface zonal currents are eastward with speed of 10 cm s 1 during intermonsoon phases while it weakens during summer monsoon season this eastward flow of currents could be attributed to the winds in the equatorial indian ocean which are westerlies during pre and post monsoon season wyrtki 1973 luyten and roemmich 1982 the meridional currents also show good agreement with observations fig 4d both oscar and model simulations display weak southward flow associated with ekman transport during the summer monsoon season this generally good agreement between the model simulations and observations encouraged us to investigate the mixed layer heat budget in the weio using the model simulations 3 2 climatological heat budget in the western equatorial indian ocean variation of the individual terms of the mixed layer heat budget equation for the weio along with the rate of change of mlt are shown in fig 5 as discussed in the previous section the weio experiences two phases of warming during spring and fall march april and september november and one cooling phase during summer monsoon season june august it may be seen that in the weio the variation in the mlt tendency is generally driven by the net heat flux however the advection processes are relatively weak with oceanic vertical processes that contributes to cooling of sst throughout the year the first warming phase occurs during spring in which the contribution of atmospheric forcing also reaches maximum the reduction in winds which result in the decrease of heat losses combined with a shallow mixed layer is responsible for the increase in atmospheric heating rate figs 4a 5a along with this short wave radiation is maximum due to the absence of clouds which also warms up the sea surface during this season with the onset of summer monsoon oceanic vertical processes become strong contributors to the heat budget of the weio it is observed that upwelling starts in the month of may which has a huge contribution to the cooling of the weio along with the entrainment of cooler water fig 5d along coastal regions of the weio especially in the oman somalia coasts the winds are favourable for upwelling which cools the sst this results in significant cooling in the coastal region of the weio the oceanic vertical processes contribute to a decrease of 0 5 c in sst during the summer monsoon season along with vertical processes atmospheric forcing also cools the sst significantly reduced short wave radiation due to the presence of clouds and increased latent heat losses associated with stronger surface winds result in the cooling of the weio fig 5a b both vertical processes and atmospheric forcing are important and contribute equally to the sst cooling during summer monsoon it may be noted that the mixed layer also deepens due to the strong winds and strong vertical mixing during the summer monsoon season in the weio vertical advection of cooler water is important only during summer monsoon season when the winds are strong the lateral advection slightly warms up the ocean surface during summer monsoon though its contribution is relatively small further the meridional component dominates in the lateral advection of heat in the weio fig 4c during fall the mixed layer in the weio shoals and warms up due to enhanced incoming solar radiation and reduced latent heat losses in this season sst is mainly controlled by the air sea fluxes alone in the model the shortwave radiation penetrating below the mixed layer ranges from 15 w m 2 to 35 w m 2 in which the lower values correspond to summer monsoon season when mixed layer is deep the contribution of sensible heat flux to heat budget is almost negligible in all the seasons in the model the magnitude of the residual term which includes the numerical errors in the computation of ml heat budget is comparatively large when the mixed layer is shallow this is consistent with the findings of thangaprakash et al 2016 that the representation of shortwave penetration is not very accurate in the numerical models in the shallow mixed layer regimes 3 3 anomalous warming of the weio during late spring early summer in 2007 3 3 1 anomalous subsurface warming in the weio fig 6 shows the time depth section of temperature and corresponding anomalies in the weio for the piod composite and for the year 2007 compared to the piod composite there is remarkably strong anomalous warming with deeper than usual isothermal layers in the weio from april to july it is not uncommon that the weio warms up considerably in the boreal spring during the decaying phase of elnino due to the changes in the net heat flux klein et al 1999 vinayachandran et al 2009 however weio cools in the subsequent months june and july when the monsoon begins fig s3 therefore what is remarkable about 2007 is the sustained subsurface warming during june and july it is possible that this anomalous subsurface warming helped the weio to maintain the warmer sst even with stronger convection in 2007 since the deepening of the thermocline has significant role in the sustained warming of weio in 2007 the possible mechanisms which maintained the weio warmer than usual are examined in this section a mixed layer heat budget analysis is carried out using the simulations by roms to estimate the relative influences of atmospheric forcing and oceanic vertical processes to warming of the weio contributions of each of the individual terms to the mlt tendency equation eq 1 during the months of june and july the months in which maximum anomalous subsurface warming is observed compared to the piod composite of 2007 and climatology are given in table 1 in general the vertical oceanic processes such as upwelling and entrainment and atmospheric forcings play significant roles in cooling the weio during the summer monsoon compared to the climatology the contribution of atmospheric forcing in the cooling of the mlt of the weio is higher by 17 in 2007 lateral advection also contributed to the cooling of sst in 2007 however there is a 30 decrease in the contribution of vertical processes to the sst cooling in 2007 compared to the climatology it is seen that there is substantial decrease in the contribution of vertical processes the process which generally cools the weio during july thus even though atmospheric fluxes and the lateral advection were favourable for the cooling of surface layers of the weio during june and july in 2007 the reduction in the contribution of vertical oceanic processes to the cooling helped this region to remain warmer we have compared the contribution of each term of the mlt tendency in june and july of 2013 in which the sst in the weio was the lowest during the 2005 2015 period with those for 2007 in table s1 in the supplementary information it may be seen that the vertical processes are the most dominant factors which contributed to the cooling of the weio 189 during july 2013 this confirms the dominant role played by the vertical processes maintaining the higher sst during the summer monsoon season of 2007 next we address the factors which could have lead to the reduction in the contribution of vertical processes to the weio cooling in 2007 3 3 2 role of equatorial winds in the indian ocean during spring of 2007 the pronounced semiannual cycle of zonal winds over the equatorial indian ocean drive eastward equatorial jets known as wyrtki jet during summer yoshida 1960 wyrtki 1973 the anomalies in the zonal winds over the equatorial indian ocean can weaken or even reverse the wyrtki jet which causes a decrease in eastward transport resulting in a shallower thermocline in the east hastenrath et al 1993 vinayachandran et al 1999 and deeper thermocline in the west anomalous downwelling rossby waves forced by anomalous easterlies in the equatorial indian ocean can deepen the thermocline and prevent cooling of the sea surface in the weio murtugudde et al 2000 along with this the westerlies over the equatorial indian ocean during boreal spring usually excite downwelling kelvin waves which propagate eastward and remotely affect sea level and thermal structure along the eeio luyten and roemmich 1982 clarke and liu 1993 yamagata et al 1996 meyers 1996 vinayachandran et al 2009 these kelvin waves get reflected as rossby waves at the eastern boundary which travel westward and deepen the isothermal layers in the weio hence the surface atmospheric forcing in the equatorial indian ocean has profound impact on the variation in the isothermal layers in the eeio and the weio the variation of the zonal wind averaged over the equatorial indian ocean 80 90 e 2 5 s 2 5 n during april 2007 is given in fig 7a it may be noted that two major wind bursts occured in the month of april the former latter being a westerly easterly burst on the first second fortnight of april this anomalous westerly burst had a mean speed of 2 4 ms 1 analysis of outgoing longwave radiation data figure not shown over the equatorial indian ocean suggests that this westerly wind burst was due to enhanced convection over the eeio associated with an eastward propagating active phase of mjo in the first two weeks of april 2007 this was followed by much stronger anomalous easterlies with a maximum speed of about 4 5 ms 1 fig 7a easterly wind anomalies were weaker in the first few days in the month of may gradually strengthened thereafter and remained stronger during the rest of the month figure not shown 3 3 3 role of downwelling rossby waves in the anomalous warming of the weio associated with the changes in the surface wind corresponding changes are noticed in ssha also fig 8a in which the time longitude section of 20 90 day filtered ssha averaged over 5 n 5 n obtained from aviso is depicted clearly shows the westward propagation of positive ssha with a phase speed of 0 84 m s the westerly wind event during early april in the equatorial indian ocean with maximum intensity located from 85 e to 95 e leads to the positive ssha fig 8a b the figure clearly indicates the generation of a kelvin wave at the equator around 85 e during april as evident from the positive ssha in this region this ssha associated with the downwelling kelvin wave reached the eastern boundary within eight days suggesting a speed of about 2 4 ms 1 this speed agrees with the theoretical speed of first mode equatorial kelvin waves chelton et al 1998 webber et al 2014 it is clearly seen that after reaching the eastern boundary this positive ssha signal got reflected and propagated as a downwelling rossby wave at a speed of approximately 0 84 ms 1 fig 8a this speed also matches with the theoretical phase speed of first baroclinic mode of oceanic rossby waves near the equator associated with the propagation of the high ssha an increase in the depth of 20 c isotherm which is a measure of depth of thermocline is also clearly seen at 90 e 4 n measured by rama buoy fig 8c it may be noted that the roms model simulated these propagations of ssha associated with both the downwelling kelvin wave and the reflected rossby wave and the variation in 20 c isotherm with very good accuracy fig 8b the phase speed estimated for kelvin wave in the model simulation is approximately 2 ms 1 and for the rossby wave is 0 85 ms 1 the reflected downwelling rossby wave reached the weio around late june and caused a deepening of the thermocline fig 8c the deeper thermocline prohibited the cooling of the weio despite having strong convection and thus higher sst anomalies persisted in the weio during june july it may be noted that the anomalous easterlies in the second fortnight of april 2007 also could have generated downwelling upwelling rossby kelvin wave towards west east and influenced the thermocline variability in the weio however it is difficult to differentiate the effects of westerly and easterly wind bursts in the observation and roms model hence in order to ascertain the relative contribution of reflected and directly forced rossby waves we next analyse the simulations by the lcs model the lcs model gives an opportunity to detect the wave processes associated with warming of the weio as the model output can be differentiated into wind forced and boundary reflected waves in the next section we evaluate the relative contribution of wind forced and boundary reflected waves in generating anomalous sea level variations and hence the maintenance of the anomalous warming of the weio the spatio temporal evolution of ssha induced by the wind forced and boundary reflected during april july 2007 obtained from the ctl run of the lcs model is shown in fig 9 even though the model slightly underestimates the magnitude of anomalies the pattern of propagation of ssha in the ctl run matches well with the observation it is interesting that in the ctl run two downwelling rossby waves are observed one around the second week of april and the other during the first week of may while strong westerly wind anomalies are observed in early april easterly wind anomalies appeared from late april onwards it is interesting to note that these anomalous easterlies appeared in the second fortnight of april are associated with suppressed convection phase of mjo rao et al 2009 the anomalous westerlies appeared in the beginning of april generated downwelling upwelling kelvin rossby waves which propagated to east west as discussed in the previous section generation and propagation of these waves are simulated by the model with good accuracy in addition to that generation of downwelling rossby wave associated with anomalous easterlies from mid april to may and its propagation to the weio are also clearly seen in fig 9 in order to demonstrate the impact of wind forced rossby waves we have performed an experimental run in which the waves reaching the eastern boundary are damped at 90 e in the sensitivity experiment ebdex a hovmoller diagram of ssha band passed at 20 90 days and averaged over 5 s 5 n is shown in fig 10c in this experimental run the kelvin waves reaching the eastern boundary are not allowed to reflect back with the help of the damper applied east of 90 e thus the waves generated as a direct response of the equatorial forcing only will be present in this solution it is clearly seen that during early may as an oceanic response to the anomalous easterly wind anomalies in the 75 e 85 e longitudinal band downwelling rossby waves are generated fig 10c this downwelling rossby wave is generated around 80 e and propagates westward with a phase speed of 0 64 ms 2 which is slightly less than the theoretical phase speed of first baroclinic mode of oceanic rossby waves this rossby wave also reached the western boundary around late june early july the difference between ctl and ebdex shown in fig 10b represents the contribution of wave which is reflected back from the eastern boundary westward propagating positive ssha as a response of the westerly wind burst in the equatorial indian ocean is seen from the third week of april onwards this rossby wave reaches the western boundary in the last week of june it is clear from the model simulations that the downwelling kelvin wave which is excited as a response to anomalous westerlies during early april gets reflected and propagated westward as a downwelling rossby wave fig 10a and b thus a couple of downwelling rossby waves reflected and wind induced propagated to the weio deepened the thermocline there and helped the weio to remain warm during the early part of the monsoon season in 2007 4 conclusion in this paper the terms of the mixed layer heat budget are estimated from the simulations of high resolution ogcm configured for the indian ocean for identifying the major factors which influenced the variation of mlt in the weio validation of the model mld sst net heat flux and surface currents shows good agreement between the model and observations in the weio surface forcing from fluxes especially from the shortwave radiation and latent heat fluxes are the major factors which control the variation in the mlt however during summer monsoon season vertical processes also contribute equally to the sst cooling in the weio it was observed that among the years in the recent past convection over the weio was anomalously high in the monsoon season of 2007 interestingly in 2007 anomalous convection over the weio was also associated with positive sst anomalies throughout the summer monsoon season in the present study we studied the reasons for the sustained warming of the weio in 2007 despite not being a significant piod event heat budget analysis shows that there was a 30 decrease in the contribution of vertical processes to the cooling of weio it is found that the substantial reduction in the vertical processes was mainly responsible for the observed positive sst anomaly in the weio this was associated with the arrival of downwelling rossby waves in the weio the westerly wind event during the first fortnight of april in the equatorial indian ocean with maximum intensity located from 85 e to 95 e generated downwelling kelvin waves these downwelling kelvin waves reached the eastern boundary and reflected back as downwelling rossby waves and propagated towards weio apart from this easterly wind burst in the 75 e 85 e longitudes in the second fortnight of april 2007 also generated a downwelling rossby wave which reached weio in late june early july thus a combination of two episodes of downwelling rossby waves was responsible for the deepening of the thermocline in the weio and thus sustaining higher than normal sst and

23981,the wave characteristics and wave current interaction in the six tidal inlets connecting the barataria basin and the northern gulf of mexico are investigated during spring summer time period when both cold front passage and persistent southeast wind events exist a fully coupled unstructured grid three dimensional fvcom swave model is employed and validated against observational data during april june 2010 model simulation results indicate that waves in the shelf side of the inlets are mainly wind seas and swells from the gulf of mexico that are modified by ocean currents in the louisiana bight these currents include mississippi river plume buoyancy and wind driven alongshore current as well as the tidal jet in the barataria pass the bay side of the inlets similar to the interior of the barataria basin is dominated by locally generated waves in the middle of the inlets both wind seas and swells are presented at times though different inlets behave differently in terms of contribution from each component the contribution of local wind seas enhances during cold front passage contrastingly the influence of swells from continental shelf is more pronounced during persistent southeast wind event fvcom swave predicts a decrease in significant wave height inside the louisiana bight due to current induced refraction and wave stretching effect caused by clockwise gyre from mississippi plume the modulation of significant wave height at barataria pass due to partial wave blocking for the opposing current and wave stretching for the following current can be up to 20 the effect of depth induced breaking and bottom friction overshadows the one from wave current interaction at other shallower inlets keywords fvcom swave wave current interactions inlet dynamics wave dynamics numerical modeling cold fronts 1 introduction louisiana coast an invaluable resource from economic and ecological perspectives has been prone to severe land loss over the past century coastal protection and restoration authority of louisiana 2017 the barataria basin one of the major coastal bays in the northern gulf of mexico has suffered from the highest rate of land loss losing about 23 1 km2 between 1974 and 1990 lacoast 2002 the chain of barrier islands that protect the basin against the coastal wave action are also subjected to substantial erosion four major barrier islands defending the barataria basin i e west grand terre east grand terre grand pierre and cheniere ronquille have been reduced by 45 in area from 1990 to 2015 with a projected disappearance of east grand terre and grand pierre by 2045 lacoast 2002 this will expose the barataria basin to even larger waves from the continental shelf and consequently exacerbate the erosion in this estuarine system in an inlet barrier island system the inlet opening plays a major role in energy and momentum transfer as affected by local bathymetry tidal forcing wind generated surface gravity waves and wave current interaction xia et al 2011 olabarrieta et al 2014 kang et al 2017 therefore understanding of the inlet hydrodynamics is crucial for establishing a science based sustainable management framework to protect and restore the estuarine system such as the barataria basin in this paper we will mainly focus on wind wave dynamics and the impact of wave current interaction on wave dynamics wave dynamics in tidal inlets have been extensively studied using analytical method ismail and wiegel 1983 flume experiments ismail 1980 in situ measurements wargula et al 2014 orescanin et al 2014

wave current interaction alongshore current ocean swells wind intensity bottom friction and depth dependent wave breaking contribute to inlet wave dynamics olabarrieta et al 2011 ganju et al 2017 in shallow inlets for instance the depth induced breaking and nonlinear triad wave interaction becomes important in wave action balance and can even overshadow wave current interaction in modulation of wave height bertin et al 2009 malhadas et al 2009 van der westhuysen et al 2012 chen et al 2015 ghader et al 2016 haghshenas et al 2018 waves can be modified by current through current induced refraction and wave blocking a strong jet can alter wave propagation direction due to the gradient of the current perpendicular to the wave propagation direction jonsson and skovgaard 1979 wolf and prandle 1999 an opposing current can block the advancement of wave and transfer the wave energy to higher wave numbers provided that the current speed scales the wave group velocity jonsson 1990 chen et al 1998 chawla and kirby 2002 gonzales et al 1985 conducted an observational study at the columbia river entrance and demonstrated wave steepening and wave height increase during opposing current and elongation of wavelength in the presence of a following current smith et al 2000 applied the coupled stwave steady state wave model and adcirc circulation model to willapa bay wa and showed the increase and decrease of wave height at strong 2 m s opposing ebb and subsequent flood current by 80 and 20 respectively using the selfe hydrodynamic model and the simulating wave nearshore swan booij et al 1999 wave model dodet et al 2013 reported a retarding of wave during ebb flow and increase in wave height by 20 in albufeira inlet portugal due to partial wave blocking and current induced refraction the results of the numerical study from chen et al 2015 proved the onshore decrease of wave height and offshore decay of current velocities in spite of recent developments in remote sensing techniques to measure wave height in coastal environment and in absence of sufficient field measurements numerical modeling is still the main tool to tackle complex inlet wave and hydrodynamics chen et al 2015 two categories of numerical wave models exist phase resolving and phase averaging spectral models the application of phase resolving models is limited to relatively small domains due to their computational burden on the other hand spectral action balance models though losing phase information of waves are more practical in medium and large scale domains the wave spectral models have been extensively applied to two dimensional wave models and two dimensional quasi three dimensional and three dimensional coupled wave current modeling systems on complex coastal and inlet regions e g özkan haller and li 2003 newberger and allen 2007 banijamali et al 2009 haas and warner 2009 uchiyama et al 2010 kumar et al 2011 siadatmousavi et al 2012a van der westhuysen et al 2012 dodet et al 2013 olabarrieta et al 2014 allahdadi et al 2017 mao and xia 2018 some studies investigated the wave effect during frontal passages in the south and mid atlantic bight warner et al 2012 wu et al 2017 nonetheless none of the above mentioned studies tackled inlet wave dynamics under extratropical storms further the ambient currents near the inlets of the barataria basin are quite different from other inlet systems in that they are under influence of strong mississippi river plume and the circulation in the louisiana bight the cold front i e extratropical storm is a mid latitude synoptic atmospheric circulation system in which cold high pressure air moving towards the south encounters warm low pressure maritime air a rotational wind pattern accompanies each cold front passage frequent the northern gulf of mexico every three to seven days in winter and spring seasons stone and wang 1999 and sweep through the coastal estuaries of the region especially from the northern sector cold fronts can be categorized into three stages prefrontal frontal and post frontal during the prefrontal stage southerly winds prevail causing coastal water level setup and prolonged wave action from southerly sectors walker 1996 austin and lentz 1999 warner et al 2012 a decrease in barometric pressure a rise in air temperature and an increase in wind speed are common characteristics of this phase roberts et al 2015 wu et al 2018 frontal passage is a short lived event during which barometric pressure drops and wind direction suddenly changes from southerly to northerly the post frontal stage corresponds to strong wind from northerly quadrants accompanied by a quick set down in coastal water level rapid drop in air temperature and an increase in barometric pressure roberts et al 2015 though cold fronts are less energetic compared to hurricanes their impact is more pronounced on the louisiana coast owing to their frequent occurrence roberts et al 1989 mossa and roberts 1990 in spite of several hydrodynamic studies in the northern gulf of mexico and the barataria basin chen et al 1997 justic et al 2007 li et al 2011 das et al 2012 few studies focused on coupled wave current modeling of the louisiana coast and estuaries especially during cold front events xu et al 2011 studied the coupled wave current sediment modeling using the roms model but their study was confined to the continental shelf without sufficient resolution to capture the advection from the mississippi river plume liu 2016 applied the coupled circulation wave delft3d model to the terrebonne and barataria basins but his work only addressed the wave and sediment dynamics under hurricane gustave 2008 everett 2016 applied the swan wave model to investigate the wave field in terrebonne bay none of the aforementioned studies per contra were dedicated to study the wave field and its interaction with current in the tidal inlets of the barataria basin which is the main focus of current study the present study investigates the factors controlling the wave dynamics at major inlets of the barataria basin under cold front passage and fair weather conditions it also studies the current induced wave transformations in the louisiana bight in front of the inlets and the change in wave field from shelf to bay side of these inlets it is based on a three month april may and june 2010 numerical simulation using a high resolution finite volume 3 d fvcom swave finite volume community ocean model surface wave chen et al 2013 model the motivation to select this spring summer time span is that it comprises two typical wind regimes in the northern gulf of mexico i e cold front passage events in april 2010 called cf event hereafter and persistent wind blowing from the south and southeast directions during june 2010 se event nevertheless the intensity and frequency of extratropical storms in late spring are relatively less than those in winter and early spring following the introduction section the remaining of the present paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area section 3 introduces the methodology including the model grid and setup modeling system for waves and hydrodynamics and coupling method between the components section 4 elaborates on model validation the results are presented and discussed in section 5 coping with causality of wave in six major inlets and in their bay and shelf side regions during the whole three month simulation cold front event and persistent southeast wind event respectively in addition the effect of coastal current the tidal jet near the barataria pass and the influence of the mississippi river plume are also discussed in this section section 6 briefly summarizes the major findings of present study 2 study area the barataria basin is a deltaic estuarine system located on the west side of mississippi bird foot delta formed by lobe switching of the mississippi river over the past two thousand years rejmanek et al 1987 it is comprised of several lakes and water bodies fig 1a among which barataria bay is the largest one with average depth of 2 4 m several smaller and shallower bays such as caminada bay bay melville bay ronquille bay long and bastian bay are also distinguished in the southern barataria basin fig 1b wetlands which are prone to inundation due to their small elevation are also depicted as gray filled areas in fig 1a and 1b the basin opens to a mild slope continental shelf of the louisiana bight and mississippi bird foot delta which is created by progradational river dominated delta with a gradient of about 0 4 xu et al 2011 the exchange of water and material between the barataria basin and the continental shelf is through a number of tidal inlets as presented in fig 1b in this study six major tidal inlets namely caminada pass barataria pass pass abel quatre bayou pass bay long pass and grand bayou pass are studied among them barataria pass is the main entrance to the barataria basin between grand isle and grand terre island with width length and maximum depth of about 800 m 430 m and 40 m respectively marmer 1948 estimated that 66 of water exchange between barataria bay and louisiana bight went through barataria pass the rest of the outlets are shallower with the maximum depth of 1 5 m the circulation in the louisiana bight is mainly governed by confluence of buoyancy forcing wind forcing tidal forcing and the buoyant tidal jet from the barataria pass the major buoyancy forcing is from southwest pass of the mississippi river and from various crevasses along the western levee of the bird foot delta the mississippi river exports about 530 km3 yr freshwater into the continental shelf rong et al 2014 45 of which enters through the southwest pass etter et al 2004 the average and maximum mississippi river discharge during april june 2010 was 19730 and 28880 m3 s respectively usgs data the width of southwest pass is much narrower in the order of 700 m than other river systems resulting in a supercritical flow near the mouth of the pass with velocity greater than 2 m s moreover construction of jetties which has been included in our numerical grid and channel dredging in this outlet amplifies the effect of the river plume and generates a prominent clockwise gyre circulation in the louisiana bight rouse and coleman 1976 wiseman et al 1976 walker et al 2005 the river runoff from various crevasses induces a westward alongshore current just south of the barrier islands walker 1996 under special occasions loop current filaments or eddies may influence the circulation patterns adjacent to the bird foot delta wiseman and dinnel 1988 huh and schaudt 1990 fig 1c presents the wind rose for the whole 2010 year from national data buoy center ndbc station 42040 https www ndbc noaa gov see fig 1a for location it has been pointed out that there are two major wind regimes in this region chuang and wiseman 1983 one is wind blowing from a sector spanning from northwest to northeast that are more frequent in the winter time october to april and are mainly associated with cold front passages the other is southerly winds that prevail in the summer season the wind rose for the three month modeling period april june 2010 is shown in fig 1d demonstrating prevalent summer wind patterns the dominant southeasterly winds during this period presumably enforce westward surface current that reinforces the buoyancy induced westward current walker 1996 wind also modulates the mississippi plume this downwelling favorable wind from east and southeast sector pushes the plume closer to the coastline and downcoast zhang et al 2014 as will be shown later this summer wind pattern mostly occurred in june 2010 while the cold front passage events occurred during april 2010 over the louisiana continental shelf as well as inside the barataria basin k 1 and o 1 are the dominant tidal constituents each having an amplitude of 0 11 m at the ndbc grand isle station due to the microtidal condition tidal currents are relatively weak over the continental shelf averaging 0 15 m s murray 1972 at the barataria pass averaged tidal currents are 0 5 m s due to the narrowness of the pass snedden 2006 maximum tidal currents reach as high as 2 m s during tropic tides li et al 2011 inside the barataria basin the tidal range is 0 4 m near the barataria pass and is attenuated by 68 in the northern basin byrne et al 1976 conner et al 1987 except for the extreme events such as hurricanes and extratropical storms the wave regime over the continental shelf is a low wave action the calculated wave parameters for a 23 year time span 1995 2017 at ndbc station 42040 fig 1a show that the mean and standard deviation for significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p are 0 99 0 71 m and 5 64 1 55 s respectively however the maximum values of the same parameters during this period reaches 16 91 m and 23 55 s respectively which must be during a hurricane event in cold front events h s in the open coast can exceed 2 3 m dingler et al 1993 3 the modeling system 3 1 fvcom hydrodynamic model fvcom is a triangular grid 3 d primitive equation ocean model chen et al 2013 which has been extensively applied to coastal and estuarine environments chen et al 2006 2007 huang et al 2008 it solves the governing equations with flux based finite volume discretization algorithms on a horizontal triangular mesh that ensure conservations of mass and momentum in both the whole domain and individual mesh fvcom combines the best of finite difference models for simple code structures and finite element models for geometric flexibility the latter is essential for complex coastal and estuarine modeling modified mellor and yamada level 2 5 galperin et al 1988 and smagorinsky 1963 turbulent closure schemes are incorporated for vertical and horizontal viscosity and diffusivity respectively the governing equations can be numerically solved using either explicit mode splitting scheme or semi implicit scheme chen et al 2013 3 2 fvcom swave wave model fvcom swave is a triangular grid swan based phase averaged wave model developed by qi et al 2009 the model employs the wave action balance equation to calculate the wave spectrum evolution in temporal geographical and spectral spaces booij et al 1999 swan group 2012 the numerical discretization of the equation using the same finite volume scheme on the same triangular mesh as the fvcom model makes it particularly appropriate for coastal and estuarine applications under the wave current interaction condition qi et al 2009 this wave action balance equation in presence of ambient current is written as 1 n t c g u n c θ n θ c σ n σ s t o t σ where n is the wave action density spectrum t is the time θ is the wave direction taken counterclockwise from the geographical east σ is intrinsic radian frequency c σ and c θ are the wave propagation velocities in spectral space σ θ c g is the group velocity u is the ambient water current vector and is the horizontal divergence operator in geographic space an increase a decrease in wave height can be calculated from conservation of wave energy flux equation jonsson 1990 the term c g u n in eq 1 plays a major role in quantification of wave shortening lengthening under adverse favorable currents the propagation velocities are defined as mei 1983 dietrich et al 2013 2 c σ σ h h t u h c g k u s 3 c θ 1 k σ h h m k u m herein the k is the wave number vector s m are left turning spatial coordinates in the wave direction θ and perpendicular to it and h is the total water depth as expressed in eq 3 c θ is composed of two terms the term σ h h m represents the wave refraction due to change in water depth the second term k u m deals with the current induced refraction u m in this equation represents the gradient of current perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation what has similar effect as the shear current in jonsson and skovgaard 1979 the right hand side of eq 1 includes the source and sink terms that balance the change of wave action in temporal geographical and spectral space and can be described as 4 s t o t s i n s n l 3 s n l 4 s w c s b r s b o t where s i n determines the growth of the wind waves due to energy input from wind stresses s n l 3 and s n l 4 characterize nonlinear triad three wave and quadruplet four wave interaction between spectral components the last three terms on right hand side of eq 4 represent the dissipation due to whitecapping shallow water depth induced breaking and bottom friction respectively the triad wave interaction transfers energy from lower frequencies to the higher ones in shallow water the lumped triad approximation lta formulation eldeberky 1996 that approximates this process in swave model calculates the directionally decoupled propagation of energy through the spectrum from lower to higher frequencies the lta formulation expresses the three wave interaction using bi phase of the self interactions of the peak frequency components that is parameterized in terms of ursell number with the following formulation eldeberky 1996 5 β π 2 tanh 0 2 u r 1 where β is the bi phase of wave and u r is the ursell number expressed as 6 u r g 8 2 π 2 h m 0 t m 01 2 h 2 where h m 0 is the zero moment wave height t m 01 is the mean period using zero and first moment of spectrum and h is the water depth the bi phase value varies from β 0 symmetrical wave to β π 2 asymmetric wave and is a measure of wave nonlinearity the sin β governs lta based calculation of three wave interaction 3 3 model coupling and wave current interaction the fvcom and swave models exchange information at each wave time step to maximize accuracy of wave current interactions wave time step is always the product of current time step and an integer number starting from null initialization condition swave calculates the wave action temporal evolution and determines wave parameters namely h s t p mean wave direction average wave length and bottom wave orbital velocity wave radiation stress is thus calculated by swave based on these parameters and passed to fvcom in the next step fvcom computes current and surface elevation fields using momentum and continuity equations with added radiation stress gradient terms then wave action is calculated in swave for the next time step including the feedback of current and surface elevation of the previous time step from fvcom wu et al 2011 the momentum transfer from the wave model to the circulation model is treated through excess flux of momentum in the surf zone expressed as radiation stress gradients as formulated by longuet higgins and stewart 1964 and implemented by mellor 2005 the 3d radiation stress is implemented into fvcom swave as 7 s x x k e k x k x k 2 f c s f c c f s c f s s f c s f c c k x k x k 2 a r r z s y y k e k y k y k 2 f c s f c c f s c f s s f c s f c c k y k y k 2 a r r z s x y k e k x k y k 2 f c s f c c where s x x s y y are depth dependent radiation stress in x and y directions s x y is lateral component of the radiation stress e is the wave energy e g h s 2 16 and k x and k y are components of wave number in x and y directions the expressions for roller area a r roller shape function r z and vertical structure functions f c s f s c f c c and f s s can be found in mellor 2005 the formulation of mellor 2005 was found to produce erroneous flow pattern in non breaking wave propagation over a sloped topography ardhuin et al 2008 however on one hand since the main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of current on the wave field and the water surface and velocity calculated by the numerical model have been successfully validated against observation cui 2018 the spurious current is proved to be minimal on the other hand the error from mellor 2005 formulation is considerably reduced when applying this formulation for shallow environments with mild slopes i e at most in the order of surface wave slope and under realistic mixing kumar et al 2011 moghimi et al 2013 aiki and greatbatch 2013 in present study the bed slope was found to be at least an order of magnitude less than the surface slope of wave for the majority of numerical modeling domain additionally mellor 2013 presented a criterion for applicability of mellor 2005 formulation such that the value of h x sinh k h 2 needs to be smaller or in the order of k a 2 where a is the wave amplitude the analysis for the present application shows that this criterion is met for the whole domain figure not shown therefore the radiation stress algorithm can be applied to present study 3 4 numerical model setup the computational domain which encompasses most of alabama mississippi louisiana texas continental shelf is composed of an unstructured triangular grid with 143546 nodes and 278399 elements the finest mesh resolution is 15 m in shallow estuarine region and inside channels and it gradually enlarges to 8 km near the open boundary over the continental shelf the setting of

westhuysen et al 2012 other parameters in the wave model also follow van der westhuysen et al 2012 the wave spectrum simulation is divided into 36 intervals in directional space and 44 intervals in frequency logarithmically distributed from 0 05 3 0 hz the maximum cut off frequency in the model is larger than typical value of 0 5 hz recommended for application in the gulf of mexico siadatmousavi et al 2012b that is to capture the anticipated higher frequencies in the interior of the barataria basin and shallow bay side of the inlets three configurations of fvcom swave are considered in this study first fvcom and swave are fully coupled which is called wc case hereinafter second only swave runs excluding fvcom called wo case third a wc case except excluding the sea level elevation forcing in fvcom at the open boundary the last case is named wc ncwl which is only used in section 5 1 to show the effect of water surface variation in changing the shape of mississippi plume and discuss its effect on wave field inside louisiana bight 4 comparison between model simulations and observations the evaluation of fvcom performance is based on 19 noaa and usgs water level stations on the continental shelf and inside the barataria basin as elaborated in cui 2018 in summary all correlation coefficients for water surface elevation between wc case and observations exceed 0 83 with an average of 0 91 characteristic wave parameters of the wc and wo cases are validated against 5 ndbc stations and 1 coastal studies institute csi station as depicted in fig 1a the csi 09 is part of the wave current surge information system wavcis observation network initiated at louisiana state university it is 3 4 m deep and located inside the louisiana bight in front of the barataria bay the depths at ndbc stations 42035 42040 42369 42370 and 42887 are 15 5 m 290 4 m 1659 3 m 1225 6 m and 1849 8 m respectively the data for ndbc station 42035 and 42040 and csi 09 were measured on an hourly bases while it was measured every 20 min for the rest of the offshore stations the skill metrics selected in this study are scatter index s i relative bias r b i a s correlation coefficient c c mean absolute error m a e and index of agreement i a their formulations are as follows 8 s i 1 n i 1 n x m i x o i 2 1 n i 1 n x o i 9 r b i a s i 1 n x m i x o i i 1 n x o i 10 c c i 1 n x m i x m i x o i

overbars indicate the mean values s i is the standard deviation of the observation from corresponding model result normalized by mean observed data the r b i a s denotes the relative difference between modeled and measured values as for the deviation measure skill parameter m a e is preferred over root mean square deviation as recommended by willmott et al 2012 the c c is the pearson product moment correlation coefficient and has its value between 1 and 1 with unit value indicating perfect correlation and 0 meaning no correlation i a is regarded as a better performance measure than c c when used to compare model predicted and observed variables willmott 1981 perfect agreement between model results and observations yields i a of 1 and complete disagreement gives i a of 0 further due to angular nature of wind and mean wave direction a circular correlation coefficient c c c is used to analyze the correlation between these two variables the mathematical expression of c c c is as follows fisher and lee 1983 13 c c c i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sin x i x j sin y i y j i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sin 2 x i x j i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sin 2 y i y j where x and y are numerically calculated wind and wave directions the comparisons between observed and modeled h s and t p are tabulated in table 1 and shown in fig 2 in general the predictive skills of wc case are close to that of wo case indicating that the influence of current and sea level variation over the continental shelf is minimal at these stations owing to large c c and ia value and small mae score it can be concluded that both wc and wo are able to successfully reproduce h s the statistical scores for t p are also reasonable bearing in mind the high sensitivity of measured t p and modeled t p being a stepwise function rather than a smooth one compared with other stations ndbc 42887 station shows low c c and ia scores this is mainly because of the substantial scatter in observed data especially after 20 may fig 2 it is believed that observed t p data at this station may be erroneous the r b i a s and mae scores for t p at nearshore stations ndbc 42035 42040 and csi 09 are markedly better than the two offshore stations ndbc 42369 and 42370 in addition the r b i a s for h s at ndbc 42035 and csi 09 is negative indicating model under estimates h s otherwise model over estimates h s 5 model results and discussion given a degree of model veracity established through observation and model simulation comparisons we now set out to discuss wave characteristics in the various tidal inlets of the barataria basin as inferred from the fvcom swave simulation since the circulation in the louisiana bight affects the sea state in this bight and changes the waves from the continental shelf that may penetrate through the tidal inlets of the barataria basin we first discuss the hydrodynamics in this region 5 1 the effect of louisiana bight circulation on wave field near the passes the circulation in the louisiana bight strongly influences the height and direction of waves that approach various tidal inlets fig 3 presents the distributions of surface current vectors and h s at a prefrontal stage during maximum flood maximum ebb and slack water times for both wo and wc cases due to spatial and temporal uniformity of the wind field during these instances red straight arrows in fig 3 left column waves also uniformly propagate towards the barrier islands from a southeast direction in wo case fig 3 mid column however mean wave direction in the louisiana bight deviates greatly when wave current interaction is added green box in figs 3c and 3f inasmuch as depth induced refraction is relatively insignificant in the time instances studied in fig 3 as shown in wave field for wo cases and in smooth transition of sea surface height in the wc case figure not shown the change in mean wave direction is probably caused by the cumulative effect of current induced wave refraction because both clockwise and counterclockwise gyres inside the louisiana bight induce a current gradient perpendicular to the wave direction k u m term in eq 3 in addition the wc case predicts a h s reduction in the louisiana bight and close to coast green and red boxes in fig 3c and 3f comparing to the wo case such a decrease in h s may be attributed to the following current that stretches the wave height inside the bight when the clockwise freshwater gyre bends toward the coast red curve in fig 3a strong following velocities extend closer to the coastline lessening h s in front of the barrier islands east of grand bayou pass red box in fig 3c as the clockwise gyre moves away from the coast the wave elongation effect diminishes fig 3f and 3i a local h s shoal is also observed on the border of inner and mid shelf green box in fig 3c and 3f which could be explained by wave blocking induced by anticlockwise gyre near the mid shelf blue curved arrow in fig 3 left column in addition to the clockwise gyre from the mississippi river plume the runoff from the channels in west of bird foot delta induces an alongshore current that also changes the wave field on the eastside of barataria pass as a result of interaction between the clockwise gyre inside louisiana bight red curved arrow in fig 3 left column and westward alongshore current smaller scale secondary anticlockwise gyres may form close to the barrier islands green curved arrows in fig 4 fig 4a and 4b correspond to the maximum flood and ebb times respectively as presented in fig 3 the westward alongshore buoyancy driven current in fig 4 is 0 5 m s such currents have a component that follows the mean wave direction and reduces the significant wave height when the main clockwise gyre bends inside inward maximum flood time in fig 3a stronger secondary gyres are generated green curved arrow in fig 4a and the wave stretching influence of alongshore current is more pronounced stronger red color zone in fig 4a compared with fig 4b and 4c depending on relative direction between ocean surface current and mean wave direction these eddies can also block the wave propagation and enhance the significant wave height blue regions in fig 4b and 4c the flow from barataria pass also alters the wave height at this pass and caminada pass the results of the numerical model show that a strong jet or potential flow from barataria pass halts the buoyancy driven westward alongshore current fig 4 the eddies formed downcoast of barataria pass changes the wave height in front of grand isle and caminada pass the influence of jet flow from barataria pass will be further expounded in section 5 5 although tidal and subtidal forcing in louisiana bight is not as prominent as other abovementioned hydrodynamic forces it can still affect the wave field in this region considering typical wave characteristics h s 1 5 m t p 6 s and water level variation 0 5 m of the louisiana continental shelf applying linear wave theory for wave propagation on an average depth of 4 m results in a change of 0 03 m in h s value sea level variation also changes the shape of mississippi plume which modifies the wave field inside louisiana bight fig 5 presents the modeled h s and surface current vectors for the wc nowl case at the same time instances for maximum flood and ebb as in fig 3 in absence of water level forcing the clockwise mississippi river plume is more contracted particularly during maximum ebb flow fig 5b during flood time the gradient of surface current perpendicular to wave direction is dwindled and the effect of current induced refraction is diminished compare fig 5a with fig 3c contrastingly because of the inward bending of the louisiana gyre the local shoal in wave height is shifted to the front of southwest pass fig 5 b and wave stretching is stronger compared to fig 3i moreover the anticlockwise gyre in the mid shelf region blue curved arrow in fig 3 is weaker in the wc nowl case compared to the wc case that could affect the extension of louisiana gyre and the formation of the shoal for significant wave height 5 2 wave field inside the barataria bay the wave characteristics in the barataria basin are elaborated in a separate manuscript there we demonstrate that waves inside the barataria basin are mainly locally wind driven for the sake of comparisons with wave characteristics in various tidal inlets a station near the center of the barataria bay station bb in fig 1 is selected as a representative bay station time series of wind vectors vertically averaged current vectors and wave parameters at this station for the wc case are shown in fig 6 the lines a b c and d associated with four extreme wave events as introduced in fig 2 are also plotted during the three month simulation period two distinct wind patterns were clearly distinguishable in fig 6a first a cold front cf passage event which was characterized by clockwise rotation of wind lasts from 23 april to 3 may 2010 second a wind event with relatively constant wind direction from south or southeast se sector was seen for example from 2 june to 14 june 2010 the maximum wind speed reaches strong breeze to moderate gale beaufort wind scale 6 7 inside barataria bay during this period of time fig 6a fig 6b depicts vertically averaged flow vectors showing a dominant diurnal tidal current as commonly observed over the louisiana texas continental shelf as well as inside coastal bays and estuaries the magnitude of the current rarely exceeds 0 1 m s at this station the seemingly diurnal variation in h s fig 6c is not caused by wave current interaction since at this station wc and wo yield almost the same h s time series figure not shown the cause for this seemingly diurnal pattern in wo case requires further investigation the extreme wave events a b c and d fig 2 are also present in fig 6c though they are not as distinct as in fig 2 as illustrated in fig 6e the range of t p between 0 5 and 2 5 s is much less than typical t p values over the continental shelf 6 s a confirmation that waves in the bay are locally generated the wind and mean wave direction are strongly correlated inside barataria bay further attesting wind driven nature of wave field in this bay fig 6f1 this linear relation is enhanced during cf event fig 6f2 oppositely the statistical benchmarks are deteriorated during se event fig 6f3 the same behavior is also seen when comparing wind speed with h s as illustrated in fig 6g larger correlation coefficients values can be interpreted as strong dependency of wave height on wind intensity at this point thus such waves are mostly local wind seas smaller statistical metrics fig 6g3 on the other hand indicate that the wave at a certain point is rather affected by the wind outside of that location and shows that either a distant wave is propagated to that location or the relationship between wind and wave is nonlinear in summary the waves inside the barataria basin are strong locally generated wind seas especially during cf events 5 3 dynamics of wave and current in inlet passes 5 3 1 overall wave statistics a distinct change in wave characteristics can be observed from shelf side to bay side of the barataria basin inlets therefore for each inlet three stations are chosen that represent inlet location and its shelf and bay sides respectively green black and red dots for each inlet as depicted in fig 1b the shelf side station is influenced by waves from the deep gulf of mexico after transformations on the inner shelf and nearshore zone while the station on the bay side follows more or less similar wave pattern as discussed in section 5 2 fig 7 shows overall wind pattern depth averaged ocean current and wave parameters for pass abel and its shelf and bay sides similar to what has been shown in fig 6b diurnal variation of depth averaged tidal current is also detected at the inlet i 3 and bay stations i 3b fig 7b2 and 7b3 in spite of sporadic spikes in velocity on the shelf side i 3s fig 7b1 the mean magnitude of depth averaged current at the inlet is twice as large as that at the shelf side which can be attributed to smaller cross sectional area at the pass the numerical model predicts a notable reduction in h s from shelf to pass and further inside the basin fig 7c1 to 7c3 a comparison of mean and maximum value of h s and t p is summarized in table 2 the decrease in mean h s is 53 and 75 at i 3 and i 3b compared to i 3s table 2 demonstrates approximately the same amount of h s reduction for all other passes reduction of h s at inlet locations especially for i 3 which is 0 63 m deep is probably due to wave dissipation resulting from bottom friction and depth induced breaking before shelf waves approach the inlets the extreme wave events a b c and d are distinguished at i 3s and i 3 stations fig 7c1 and 7c2 however these events are less clear at i 3b due to dissipation of swells from the continental shelf fig 7c3 the pattern of h s at i 3 is more jagged compared to i 3s and i 3b fig 7c2 that is due to stronger ambient current along with tidal water surface variation this will be further elaborated in section 5 5 the mean wave direction on the shelf side follows somewhat a straight line which is aligned with overall orientation of coastline indicating the effect of refraction process fig 7d1 the occasional spikes in mean wave direction are triggered at frontal stage of cf events associated with an abrupt change in wind direction from southeast to northwest the jumps in mean wave direction become more frequent as we move to inlet or bay side locations fig 7d2 and 7d3 this is because of the growing influence of the seas determined by local wind variability the average value of t p decreases from shelf to pass station by about 10 fig 7e2 and table 2 though this decrease can reach up to 40 in shallow inlets such as quatre bayou pass such a reduction is in part attributed to redistribution of wave energy in shallow water due to triad wave interaction the analysis of the bi phase of the waves at the shelf side reveals strong wave nonlinearity especially during major wave events events a b c and d in fig 8 therefore transfer of energy to higher frequencies due to triad nonlinear wave interaction is more distinct at this region despite lower significant wave height at pass stations compared with shelf stations yet the shallower depth at inlet location increases the ursell number and bi phase is decreased fig 8 the only exception is barataria pass in which the water depth is greater than other passes by more than one order of magnitude therefore the denominator in eq 6 is two to three orders of magnitude greater than the numerator resulting in formation of symmetrical wave at i 2 station inside the inlet t p is reduced up to four times that characterizes locally generated waves on the bay side fig 7e3 here the contribution of three wave interaction is minimal since low h s and t p force small ursell number therefore wave is symmetric and β 0 referring to table 2 the maximum value of t p at bay long and bastian bay stations i 5b and i 6b is much less than their counterparts at other passes indicating that almost no wave from gulf of mexico can enter the barataria basin through these two passes the geometry of bay long pass has a major effect on preventing waves from entering bay long on one hand extension of the barrier island on the east of this pass blocks the more frequent waves from east to south direction and on the other hand the mostly dry wetlands on the north between bay long and bay ronquille height of about 0 5 m above navd88 obstruct the waves from n and nw direction therefore only small amplitude waves with high frequency are formed in this bay similarly the i 6b station is also surrounded by shallow water with the average depth of about 0 25 m therefore most of the wave from continental shelf is dissipated due to bottom friction and depth induced breaking before reaching i 6b station 5 3 2 relationship between wind and mean wave direction the statistical relation between wind and mean wave direction varies from coast to inside the bay at each pass fig 9 provides the analysis for barataria pass and quatre bayou pass as well as their shelf and bay sides at the continental shelf stations the wave direction has a concentrated range examining all the waves for these stations fig 9a1 and a4 when winds are from 0 to 180 wind and wave direction is to zero is due east counterclockwise waves are mostly centered on a constant direction aligned with coastline orientation 130 and 105 for barataria pass and quatre bayou pass respectively these near coastline waves are not locally generated but rather depend on a large scale wind and wave in deep gulf of mexico when wind is from 180 to 360 i e relatively rare northerly wind majority of waves are still refracted ones scattered around a constant wave direction nonetheless in a number of instances local wind waves are predicted whose direction is linearly correlated to the wind direction which is obviously fetch limited young seas fig 9a1 and 9a4 displays that locally generated wind waves are mostly observed when northerly winds are moderately strong between 5 8 m s stronger waves mainly from southern sector have induced agitation wide range of mean wave direction in i2 s station this could be due to current induced wave refraction governed by circulation at louisiana bight alongshore westward current and jet from barataria pass section 5 1 the wave field on the bay side fig 9a3 and a6 follows a pattern akin to the wave field inside the barataria basin fig 6f1 with more pronounced linear relation between wind and wave directions representing local seas the metrics at bay side stations are superior to shelf side stations as wind and wave direction does not obey a linear relationship at open coast fig 10 despite dominance of wind wave on the bay side there still exist some swells in which waves are aligned with overall coastline orientation fig 9a3 which will also be discussed in section 5 4 pass stations are a transition zone between shelf and bay stations fig 9a middle column therefore both wind sea and swells from gulf of mexico are observed nevertheless comparing quatre bayou pass vs barataria pass the scatter plot shows more contribution of wind seas in the former pass in order to investigate similar directional relationship between wind and wave direction for larger waves a threshold was applied to filter out the small waves fig 9b1 to b6 this threshold was considered as 0 1 m for pass and bay stations in shelf side stations since waves are much larger the threshold was raised to 0 5 m in coastal stations the wave pattern becomes swell dominated fig 9b1 and b4 on a contrary fig 9b3 and b6 shows that model skill improves and linear relationship between wind and wave direction is enhanced the c c c and ia in bay ranquille increase from 0 74 and 0 84 to 0 89 and 0 92 from all waves to large waves respectively mae and s i in this pass are also reduced from 31 33 and 0 43 to 19 16 and 0 24 respectively similar amelioration is also observed for other inlets therefore large waves more clearly follow the local wind that describes causality of wave on the bay side the horizontal distribution of mean wave direction for large waves in i 2 emphasizes the more presence of swells at this pass fig 9b2 on a contrary larger waves at shallower quatre bayou pass tend to establish a linear relationship similar to the bay side station fig 9b5 fig 9b1 and b4 also demonstrate that the direction of short period waves is more correlated with the wind direction differently for the waves with a period of larger than 5 s wind direction shows an independency from wind direction attesting that these waves are not generated by ambient wind force the results show a number of waves with a period of greater than 6 s inside barataria bay after barataria pass fig 9b3 such waves occur when wind direction is also southeast to south considering the lack of fetch on the bay side of the inlet they are probably the swells entering the bay when wind direction is aligned with channel direction 5 4 wave characteristics under cold front and persistent southeasterly wind events 5 4 1 wave characteristics during cold front cf event the dissipation of wave energy at the tidal inlets can also be confirmed using the spectral analysis fig 11 illustrates time series of variance density spectra for a point on the continental shelf csi 09 one station inside barataria bay bb and two inlet locations at pass shelf and bay region in addition three time instances associated with more energetic moments are singled out for which energy spectra is plotted for each station the swell sea separation frequency is calculated for each of these three time instances using spectrum integration method with upper frequency limit set as 3 hz hwang et al 2012 fig 11 the separation frequency between the swell sea f s 1 from this method is applied as a f s 1 0 75 f m 1 where f m 1 is the maximum frequency associated with the spectrum integration function based on overall observation of the wave energy spectra three empirical frequency categories are introduced f 1 0 10 0 13 hz t p 8 0 10 0 s f 2 0 25 0 33 hz t p 3 0 4 0 s and f 3 0 33 2 00 hz i e t p 0 5 3 0 s commonly inside the barataria basin these ranges are shaded in fig 11 the wave spectra in open coast fig 11a and in the interior of the barataria basin fig 11b are single peaked ones though the peak frequency and maximum energy is different in magnitude and corresponding frequency category during extratropical storm event the wave field in the continental shelf usually has a single peak at f 1 as could be seen for csi 09 station in fig 11a occasionally a double peaked spectrum is also perceived during this event as illustrated in time instance a in fig 11a inside the barataria basin the maximum peak period resides in f 3 range for the whole simulation time as depicted for bb station in fig 11b the spectrum integration based separation frequencies indicate that waves for csi 09 are mostly swells whereas the one for the station inside the barataria estuary are wind seas the spectral density for the stations at the shelf side of the inlets are in the same order of magnitude as the one for csi 09 station though the magnitude is decreased due to wave energy dissipation from nearshore processes in addition to the dominant frequency in f 1 category fig 11c1 and d1 a secondary peak frequency is also perceived that sometimes resides in wind sea region black dashed line for time instance a in fig 11c1 this demonstrates that even though shelf side of the inlets is determined by waves from continental shelf yet still a small influence from wind seas exists in this region the wave spectral energy drops by an order of magnitude at inlet locations compared with shelf stations signifying significant energy dissipation in tidal inlets as presented in fig 11c2 and d2 the dual peak shape in wave spectra is widely seen in pass stations fig 11c2 the magnitude of the energy corresponding f 3 category becomes as large as or even larger than the spectral density at other two categories e g time instance a in fig 11c2 therefore the influence of local seas is increased at the passes the energy dissipation at the inlets in the i 4 pass is found to be greater in magnitude compared to i 2 station presumably due to shallower depth in these inlets fig 11 displays that although the spectral energy in i 4s is larger than the one at i 2s the wave peak spectral energy in i 4 is about one fourth of the one in i 2 station further reduction in peak spectral density is seen in bay stations compared to pass stations alluding to continued energy dissipation inside the inlets however the magnitude of peak spectral density is in the same order as the pass station only in i 1b station not shown here this magnitude is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the station at caminada pass indicating the highest energy reduction among the passes similar to bb station the value of swell sea separation frequency attests the dominance of locally generated waves in the bay side of the inlets fig 11c3 and 11d3 nonetheless in i 2b station during cold front passage a secondary peak at f 1 range is also seen fig 11c3 the double peak pattern in wave spectra confirms that some swells from continental shelf can penetrate through this inlet due to its larger depth the double peak pattern is rarely seen in i 1b and i 3b stations the range of spectral density in bay stations is smaller compared to bb station further inside barataria bay which could indicate that local seas are relatively less developed in the bay stations in general the statistical measures of wind vs mean wave direction improved during cold front passage compared with the whole simulation time denoting the locally generated wind waves during this event fig 10 nonetheless the model skills are still lower than the one for bb station inside barataria bay fig 6f2 5 4 2 wave characteristics during persistent south east se event similar to the spectral analysis performed for cf event the spectral analysis proves a single peaked spectrum in swell range for csi 09 station fig 12a the peak frequency in se event per contra is larger than the one during cf event and pertains to f 2 range comparing figs 11 and 12 the spectral density at peak frequency is also an order of magnitude smaller than that of cf event denoting comparatively less energetic se event the spectral density of the shelf stations is on par with csi 09 fig 12c1 and d1 however it is at least one order of magnitude smaller at the passes due to bottom friction and wave current interaction fig 12c2 and d2 similar to the discussion pertaining cf event the rate of energy dissipation is larger in i 4 station compared to i 2 the swell sea separation frequency denotes the dominance of the wave from continental shelf in i 2 station during se event fig 12c2 however the concurrent contribution of local seas and swell is manifest in i 4 station fig 12d2 the spectrum integration based separation frequency for bay side stations indicates the growth of waves due to local wind fig 12c3 and fig 12d3 alike the case of cf event the double peak shape is also predicted at some instances for i 2b station alluding to penetration of waves with characteristic peak frequency at f 2 notwithstanding the magnitude of maximum density spectra is larger in bb station showing more wave development as we move further inside barataria bay 5 5 effect of wave current interaction on wave field in front of inlets owing to geometrical restriction current and wave direction at the inlet location are in line with each other where wave blocking stretching is amplified fig 13 depicts the difference between ocean surface current and mean wave direction for barataria pass and bay long pass the 0 and 180 of difference indicate following and opposing current respectively the analysis for other inlets follows the pattern as for bay long pass fig 13 demonstrates that opposing following current is more pronounced at inlet stations in shelf side such a pattern is weaker particularly up to first week of may when cold front passages prevail the pattern is more scattered at i 2b and i 5b indicating less influence of ambient current on changing the wave height on the basin side fig 13c and f the analysis shows less scatter in barataria pass fig 13 left panels compared with bay long pass and other inlets though not shown here this could be because of the stronger current at this pass the surface current in barataria pass can reach 1 34 m s which is 72 73 36 and 93 larger than the modeled maximum surface current speed at pass abel quatre bayou pass bay long pass and grand bayou pass respectively the contribution of water surface elevation and ocean surface current on changing the wave field can also be observed through contrasting the numerical model results between wo and wc cases the significant wave height in wo case is smoother than the one in wc case further the significant wave height in wo case is sometimes larger than the one in wc case in shelf and pass stations the major deviation in significant wave height between wc and wo cases occurs at pre frontal stage with moderate to large wind speed 8 m s from southerly quadrants associated with low tidal elevation fig 14c1 and c2 on the shelf side the difference in wave height is mainly due to the dynamics in louisiana bight as discussed in section 5 1 in the pass and bay stations a confluence of propagation of smaller wave height from shelf side as well as additional water level and current in the coupled system is responsible for this discrepancy given a fixed breaking parameter according to battjes and janssen formulation 1978 γ h m a x d in which h m a x is the maximum possible individual wave height and d is the water depth the lower water level during ebb tide would culminate in lower upper bound of maximum significant wave height the wave blocking stretching phenomena can also be detected from instantaneous numerical model results as displayed in fig 15 during the flood period the current direction aligned with wave direction stretches the wave length and therefore reduces the wave height on both sea side and basin side of barataria pass fig 15b3 the model predicts a 15 decrease of significant wave height at following current that is close to the result from smith et al 2000 for wallipa entrance channel 20 however during ebb period when the direction of jet is opposite to the prevalent wave direction the blocking effect of opposing current is manifested in local enhancement of significant wave height about two kilometers offshore blue zone in fig 15a3 followed by a rapid reduction of h s from i 2s to i 2 stations such pattern of onshore decay in wave height is in conformity with findings of chen et al 2015 the numerical model predicts a 20 of increase in significant wave height that is less than the one predicted by smith et al 2000 80 but the same as the simulation results of dodet et al 2013 for albufeira lagoonal inlet aside from jet direction direction and magnitude of local wind governs the pattern of wave current interaction as well for instance though the time instance in fig 15c3 is associated with an ebb time relatively strong northwest wind generates waves that are in the same direction as the jet flow and the resultant wave height on the sea side of the inlet reduces due to wave stretching effect the mean wave direction calculated from wc case is sometimes clearly different from the one predicted by wo case especially in shelf stations fig 14d1 such pattern can also be detected comparing modeled instantaneous mean wave direction for wo and wc simulations fig 15 second and third rows in front of the barataria pass current induced wave refraction as a result of larger velocity in the main channel compared to adjacent shallower regions dictate such a deviation the dynamics of wave current interaction is somewhat different in inlets other than barataria pass as the jet velocity diminishes in those passes and wave current interaction plays a less important role in shallower inlets the significant wave height becomes more sensitive to variation in water surface elevation as depth induced breaking plays a major role consistent with kang and di iorio 2006 and olabarrieta et al 2011 in caminada pass absence of a strong jet obstruction of east to west alongcoast current because of jet flow from barataria pass see fig 4 and shallow depth resulted in abrupt change in significant wave height commensurate to local water depth fig 14c4 thus h s for wc case at tidal and subtidal peaks surpasses the one simulated by wo case 6 summary in this study the wave dynamics and wave current interaction for six major inlets connecting the barataria bay with gulf of mexico was investigated with a three dimensional wave current coupled wetting drying activated numerical model the study was carried out for a three month period in the late spring and summer time period to include both cold front and persistent southeasterly winds common in northern gulf of mexico and the louisiana bight the numerical wave model was validated against observed data at five offshore stations and one coastal station where the wave parameters in the region were successfully reproduced the validated model is used to address the causality of wave at each inlet and their shelf and bay side the detailed spectral analysis and statistical evaluation of wind vs wave direction demonstrate that the wave field on the bay side of the inlets is strongly dependent on the local wind intensity and direction in contrast the shelf side of the inlets is influenced by swells from the gulf of mexico at the inlet the contribution of both local seas and swells is perceived in barataria pass due to its deeper depth the effect of swell from gulf of mexico is more pronounced while the shallow inlets on the east of barataria pass are more governed by locally generated waves the wind driven nature of significant wave height is enhanced during cold front events with an increase in scores of wind vs wave height this result is attributed to rapidly varying circulation inside louisiana bight during this event preventing distant waves to effectively approach coastline differently the contribution of swells is boosted during southeasterly wind event all of the inlets effectively dissipate the wave energy as the wave spectral density dwindles by one order of magnitude from the shelf side to the inlet location the model predicts larger magnitude of wave spectral density during cold front cf event compared with persistent southeasterly se wind event therefore cf event is clearly revealed as a more energetic event the peak frequency in cf event also corresponded to larger peak period the circulation pattern inside louisiana bight controlled by water level forcing wind forcing buoyancy and wind driven alongshore current and the mississippi river plume affects the wave field inside the bight and in front of the inlets as a result current induced refraction and overall wave reduction in fully coupled system is noticed compared with wave only simulation both strong jet velocity and local wind direction impact the wave at the mouth of barataria pass through wave steepening and partial wave blocking during opposing current and decrease in wave height during following current the opposing current could increase the wave height by about 20 during ebb flow and the following current could decrease the wave height on sea side of barataria pass by up to 15 the potential and jet flow at barataria pass blocks the westward movement of the alongshore current reducing the effect of this current at caminada pass at inlets other than barataria pass the wave field is more affected by bottom friction and depth induced breaking rather than wave current interaction the redistribution of wave energy due to triad wave interaction is also more pronounced in these inlets compared with barataria pass particularly during extreme wave events credit authorship contribution statement soroush sorourian

23981,the wave characteristics and wave current interaction in the six tidal inlets connecting the barataria basin and the northern gulf of mexico are investigated during spring summer time period when both cold front passage and persistent southeast wind events exist a fully coupled unstructured grid three dimensional fvcom swave model is employed and validated against observational data during april june 2010 model simulation results indicate that waves in the shelf side of the inlets are mainly wind seas and swells from the gulf of mexico that are modified by ocean currents in the louisiana bight these currents include mississippi river plume buoyancy and wind driven alongshore current as well as the tidal jet in the barataria pass the bay side of the inlets similar to the interior of the barataria basin is dominated by locally generated waves in the middle of the inlets both wind seas and swells are presented at times though different inlets behave differently in terms of contribution from each component the contribution of local wind seas enhances during cold front passage contrastingly the influence of swells from continental shelf is more pronounced during persistent southeast wind event fvcom swave predicts a decrease in significant wave height inside the louisiana bight due to current induced refraction and wave stretching effect caused by clockwise gyre from mississippi plume the modulation of significant wave height at barataria pass due to partial wave blocking for the opposing current and wave stretching for the following current can be up to 20 the effect of depth induced breaking and bottom friction overshadows the one from wave current interaction at other shallower inlets keywords fvcom swave wave current interactions inlet dynamics wave dynamics numerical modeling cold fronts 1 introduction louisiana coast an invaluable resource from economic and ecological perspectives has been prone to severe land loss over the past century coastal protection and restoration authority of louisiana 2017 the barataria basin one of the major coastal bays in the northern gulf of mexico has suffered from the highest rate of land loss losing about 23 1 km2 between 1974 and 1990 lacoast 2002 the chain of barrier islands that protect the basin against the coastal wave action are also subjected to substantial erosion four major barrier islands defending the barataria basin i e west grand terre east grand terre grand pierre and cheniere ronquille have been reduced by 45 in area from 1990 to 2015 with a projected disappearance of east grand terre and grand pierre by 2045 lacoast 2002 this will expose the barataria basin to even larger waves from the continental shelf and consequently exacerbate the erosion in this estuarine system in an inlet barrier island system the inlet opening plays a major role in energy and momentum transfer as affected by local bathymetry tidal forcing wind generated surface gravity waves and wave current interaction xia et al 2011 olabarrieta et al 2014 kang et al 2017 therefore understanding of the inlet hydrodynamics is crucial for establishing a science based sustainable management framework to protect and restore the estuarine system such as the barataria basin in this paper we will mainly focus on wind wave dynamics and the impact of wave current interaction on wave dynamics wave dynamics in tidal inlets have been extensively studied using analytical method ismail and wiegel 1983 flume experiments ismail 1980 in situ measurements wargula et al 2014 orescanin et al 2014

wave current interaction alongshore current ocean swells wind intensity bottom friction and depth dependent wave breaking contribute to inlet wave dynamics olabarrieta et al 2011 ganju et al 2017 in shallow inlets for instance the depth induced breaking and nonlinear triad wave interaction becomes important in wave action balance and can even overshadow wave current interaction in modulation of wave height bertin et al 2009 malhadas et al 2009 van der westhuysen et al 2012 chen et al 2015 ghader et al 2016 haghshenas et al 2018 waves can be modified by current through current induced refraction and wave blocking a strong jet can alter wave propagation direction due to the gradient of the current perpendicular to the wave propagation direction jonsson and skovgaard 1979 wolf and prandle 1999 an opposing current can block the advancement of wave and transfer the wave energy to higher wave numbers provided that the current speed scales the wave group velocity jonsson 1990 chen et al 1998 chawla and kirby 2002 gonzales et al 1985 conducted an observational study at the columbia river entrance and demonstrated wave steepening and wave height increase during opposing current and elongation of wavelength in the presence of a following current smith et al 2000 applied the coupled stwave steady state wave model and adcirc circulation model to willapa bay wa and showed the increase and decrease of wave height at strong 2 m s opposing ebb and subsequent flood current by 80 and 20 respectively using the selfe hydrodynamic model and the simulating wave nearshore swan booij et al 1999 wave model dodet et al 2013 reported a retarding of wave during ebb flow and increase in wave height by 20 in albufeira inlet portugal due to partial wave blocking and current induced refraction the results of the numerical study from chen et al 2015 proved the onshore decrease of wave height and offshore decay of current velocities in spite of recent developments in remote sensing techniques to measure wave height in coastal environment and in absence of sufficient field measurements numerical modeling is still the main tool to tackle complex inlet wave and hydrodynamics chen et al 2015 two categories of numerical wave models exist phase resolving and phase averaging spectral models the application of phase resolving models is limited to relatively small domains due to their computational burden on the other hand spectral action balance models though losing phase information of waves are more practical in medium and large scale domains the wave spectral models have been extensively applied to two dimensional wave models and two dimensional quasi three dimensional and three dimensional coupled wave current modeling systems on complex coastal and inlet regions e g özkan haller and li 2003 newberger and allen 2007 banijamali et al 2009 haas and warner 2009 uchiyama et al 2010 kumar et al 2011 siadatmousavi et al 2012a van der westhuysen et al 2012 dodet et al 2013 olabarrieta et al 2014 allahdadi et al 2017 mao and xia 2018 some studies investigated the wave effect during frontal passages in the south and mid atlantic bight warner et al 2012 wu et al 2017 nonetheless none of the above mentioned studies tackled inlet wave dynamics under extratropical storms further the ambient currents near the inlets of the barataria basin are quite different from other inlet systems in that they are under influence of strong mississippi river plume and the circulation in the louisiana bight the cold front i e extratropical storm is a mid latitude synoptic atmospheric circulation system in which cold high pressure air moving towards the south encounters warm low pressure maritime air a rotational wind pattern accompanies each cold front passage frequent the northern gulf of mexico every three to seven days in winter and spring seasons stone and wang 1999 and sweep through the coastal estuaries of the region especially from the northern sector cold fronts can be categorized into three stages prefrontal frontal and post frontal during the prefrontal stage southerly winds prevail causing coastal water level setup and prolonged wave action from southerly sectors walker 1996 austin and lentz 1999 warner et al 2012 a decrease in barometric pressure a rise in air temperature and an increase in wind speed are common characteristics of this phase roberts et al 2015 wu et al 2018 frontal passage is a short lived event during which barometric pressure drops and wind direction suddenly changes from southerly to northerly the post frontal stage corresponds to strong wind from northerly quadrants accompanied by a quick set down in coastal water level rapid drop in air temperature and an increase in barometric pressure roberts et al 2015 though cold fronts are less energetic compared to hurricanes their impact is more pronounced on the louisiana coast owing to their frequent occurrence roberts et al 1989 mossa and roberts 1990 in spite of several hydrodynamic studies in the northern gulf of mexico and the barataria basin chen et al 1997 justic et al 2007 li et al 2011 das et al 2012 few studies focused on coupled wave current modeling of the louisiana coast and estuaries especially during cold front events xu et al 2011 studied the coupled wave current sediment modeling using the roms model but their study was confined to the continental shelf without sufficient resolution to capture the advection from the mississippi river plume liu 2016 applied the coupled circulation wave delft3d model to the terrebonne and barataria basins but his work only addressed the wave and sediment dynamics under hurricane gustave 2008 everett 2016 applied the swan wave model to investigate the wave field in terrebonne bay none of the aforementioned studies per contra were dedicated to study the wave field and its interaction with current in the tidal inlets of the barataria basin which is the main focus of current study the present study investigates the factors controlling the wave dynamics at major inlets of the barataria basin under cold front passage and fair weather conditions it also studies the current induced wave transformations in the louisiana bight in front of the inlets and the change in wave field from shelf to bay side of these inlets it is based on a three month april may and june 2010 numerical simulation using a high resolution finite volume 3 d fvcom swave finite volume community ocean model surface wave chen et al 2013 model the motivation to select this spring summer time span is that it comprises two typical wind regimes in the northern gulf of mexico i e cold front passage events in april 2010 called cf event hereafter and persistent wind blowing from the south and southeast directions during june 2010 se event nevertheless the intensity and frequency of extratropical storms in late spring are relatively less than those in winter and early spring following the introduction section the remaining of the present paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area section 3 introduces the methodology including the model grid and setup modeling system for waves and hydrodynamics and coupling method between the components section 4 elaborates on model validation the results are presented and discussed in section 5 coping with causality of wave in six major inlets and in their bay and shelf side regions during the whole three month simulation cold front event and persistent southeast wind event respectively in addition the effect of coastal current the tidal jet near the barataria pass and the influence of the mississippi river plume are also discussed in this section section 6 briefly summarizes the major findings of present study 2 study area the barataria basin is a deltaic estuarine system located on the west side of mississippi bird foot delta formed by lobe switching of the mississippi river over the past two thousand years rejmanek et al 1987 it is comprised of several lakes and water bodies fig 1a among which barataria bay is the largest one with average depth of 2 4 m several smaller and shallower bays such as caminada bay bay melville bay ronquille bay long and bastian bay are also distinguished in the southern barataria basin fig 1b wetlands which are prone to inundation due to their small elevation are also depicted as gray filled areas in fig 1a and 1b the basin opens to a mild slope continental shelf of the louisiana bight and mississippi bird foot delta which is created by progradational river dominated delta with a gradient of about 0 4 xu et al 2011 the exchange of water and material between the barataria basin and the continental shelf is through a number of tidal inlets as presented in fig 1b in this study six major tidal inlets namely caminada pass barataria pass pass abel quatre bayou pass bay long pass and grand bayou pass are studied among them barataria pass is the main entrance to the barataria basin between grand isle and grand terre island with width length and maximum depth of about 800 m 430 m and 40 m respectively marmer 1948 estimated that 66 of water exchange between barataria bay and louisiana bight went through barataria pass the rest of the outlets are shallower with the maximum depth of 1 5 m the circulation in the louisiana bight is mainly governed by confluence of buoyancy forcing wind forcing tidal forcing and the buoyant tidal jet from the barataria pass the major buoyancy forcing is from southwest pass of the mississippi river and from various crevasses along the western levee of the bird foot delta the mississippi river exports about 530 km3 yr freshwater into the continental shelf rong et al 2014 45 of which enters through the southwest pass etter et al 2004 the average and maximum mississippi river discharge during april june 2010 was 19730 and 28880 m3 s respectively usgs data the width of southwest pass is much narrower in the order of 700 m than other river systems resulting in a supercritical flow near the mouth of the pass with velocity greater than 2 m s moreover construction of jetties which has been included in our numerical grid and channel dredging in this outlet amplifies the effect of the river plume and generates a prominent clockwise gyre circulation in the louisiana bight rouse and coleman 1976 wiseman et al 1976 walker et al 2005 the river runoff from various crevasses induces a westward alongshore current just south of the barrier islands walker 1996 under special occasions loop current filaments or eddies may influence the circulation patterns adjacent to the bird foot delta wiseman and dinnel 1988 huh and schaudt 1990 fig 1c presents the wind rose for the whole 2010 year from national data buoy center ndbc station 42040 https www ndbc noaa gov see fig 1a for location it has been pointed out that there are two major wind regimes in this region chuang and wiseman 1983 one is wind blowing from a sector spanning from northwest to northeast that are more frequent in the winter time october to april and are mainly associated with cold front passages the other is southerly winds that prevail in the summer season the wind rose for the three month modeling period april june 2010 is shown in fig 1d demonstrating prevalent summer wind patterns the dominant southeasterly winds during this period presumably enforce westward surface current that reinforces the buoyancy induced westward current walker 1996 wind also modulates the mississippi plume this downwelling favorable wind from east and southeast sector pushes the plume closer to the coastline and downcoast zhang et al 2014 as will be shown later this summer wind pattern mostly occurred in june 2010 while the cold front passage events occurred during april 2010 over the louisiana continental shelf as well as inside the barataria basin k 1 and o 1 are the dominant tidal constituents each having an amplitude of 0 11 m at the ndbc grand isle station due to the microtidal condition tidal currents are relatively weak over the continental shelf averaging 0 15 m s murray 1972 at the barataria pass averaged tidal currents are 0 5 m s due to the narrowness of the pass snedden 2006 maximum tidal currents reach as high as 2 m s during tropic tides li et al 2011 inside the barataria basin the tidal range is 0 4 m near the barataria pass and is attenuated by 68 in the northern basin byrne et al 1976 conner et al 1987 except for the extreme events such as hurricanes and extratropical storms the wave regime over the continental shelf is a low wave action the calculated wave parameters for a 23 year time span 1995 2017 at ndbc station 42040 fig 1a show that the mean and standard deviation for significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p are 0 99 0 71 m and 5 64 1 55 s respectively however the maximum values of the same parameters during this period reaches 16 91 m and 23 55 s respectively which must be during a hurricane event in cold front events h s in the open coast can exceed 2 3 m dingler et al 1993 3 the modeling system 3 1 fvcom hydrodynamic model fvcom is a triangular grid 3 d primitive equation ocean model chen et al 2013 which has been extensively applied to coastal and estuarine environments chen et al 2006 2007 huang et al 2008 it solves the governing equations with flux based finite volume discretization algorithms on a horizontal triangular mesh that ensure conservations of mass and momentum in both the whole domain and individual mesh fvcom combines the best of finite difference models for simple code structures and finite element models for geometric flexibility the latter is essential for complex coastal and estuarine modeling modified mellor and yamada level 2 5 galperin et al 1988 and smagorinsky 1963 turbulent closure schemes are incorporated for vertical and horizontal viscosity and diffusivity respectively the governing equations can be numerically solved using either explicit mode splitting scheme or semi implicit scheme chen et al 2013 3 2 fvcom swave wave model fvcom swave is a triangular grid swan based phase averaged wave model developed by qi et al 2009 the model employs the wave action balance equation to calculate the wave spectrum evolution in temporal geographical and spectral spaces booij et al 1999 swan group 2012 the numerical discretization of the equation using the same finite volume scheme on the same triangular mesh as the fvcom model makes it particularly appropriate for coastal and estuarine applications under the wave current interaction condition qi et al 2009 this wave action balance equation in presence of ambient current is written as 1 n t c g u n c θ n θ c σ n σ s t o t σ where n is the wave action density spectrum t is the time θ is the wave direction taken counterclockwise from the geographical east σ is intrinsic radian frequency c σ and c θ are the wave propagation velocities in spectral space σ θ c g is the group velocity u is the ambient water current vector and is the horizontal divergence operator in geographic space an increase a decrease in wave height can be calculated from conservation of wave energy flux equation jonsson 1990 the term c g u n in eq 1 plays a major role in quantification of wave shortening lengthening under adverse favorable currents the propagation velocities are defined as mei 1983 dietrich et al 2013 2 c σ σ h h t u h c g k u s 3 c θ 1 k σ h h m k u m herein the k is the wave number vector s m are left turning spatial coordinates in the wave direction θ and perpendicular to it and h is the total water depth as expressed in eq 3 c θ is composed of two terms the term σ h h m represents the wave refraction due to change in water depth the second term k u m deals with the current induced refraction u m in this equation represents the gradient of current perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation what has similar effect as the shear current in jonsson and skovgaard 1979 the right hand side of eq 1 includes the source and sink terms that balance the change of wave action in temporal geographical and spectral space and can be described as 4 s t o t s i n s n l 3 s n l 4 s w c s b r s b o t where s i n determines the growth of the wind waves due to energy input from wind stresses s n l 3 and s n l 4 characterize nonlinear triad three wave and quadruplet four wave interaction between spectral components the last three terms on right hand side of eq 4 represent the dissipation due to whitecapping shallow water depth induced breaking and bottom friction respectively the triad wave interaction transfers energy from lower frequencies to the higher ones in shallow water the lumped triad approximation lta formulation eldeberky 1996 that approximates this process in swave model calculates the directionally decoupled propagation of energy through the spectrum from lower to higher frequencies the lta formulation expresses the three wave interaction using bi phase of the self interactions of the peak frequency components that is parameterized in terms of ursell number with the following formulation eldeberky 1996 5 β π 2 tanh 0 2 u r 1 where β is the bi phase of wave and u r is the ursell number expressed as 6 u r g 8 2 π 2 h m 0 t m 01 2 h 2 where h m 0 is the zero moment wave height t m 01 is the mean period using zero and first moment of spectrum and h is the water depth the bi phase value varies from β 0 symmetrical wave to β π 2 asymmetric wave and is a measure of wave nonlinearity the sin β governs lta based calculation of three wave interaction 3 3 model coupling and wave current interaction the fvcom and swave models exchange information at each wave time step to maximize accuracy of wave current interactions wave time step is always the product of current time step and an integer number starting from null initialization condition swave calculates the wave action temporal evolution and determines wave parameters namely h s t p mean wave direction average wave length and bottom wave orbital velocity wave radiation stress is thus calculated by swave based on these parameters and passed to fvcom in the next step fvcom computes current and surface elevation fields using momentum and continuity equations with added radiation stress gradient terms then wave action is calculated in swave for the next time step including the feedback of current and surface elevation of the previous time step from fvcom wu et al 2011 the momentum transfer from the wave model to the circulation model is treated through excess flux of momentum in the surf zone expressed as radiation stress gradients as formulated by longuet higgins and stewart 1964 and implemented by mellor 2005 the 3d radiation stress is implemented into fvcom swave as 7 s x x k e k x k x k 2 f c s f c c f s c f s s f c s f c c k x k x k 2 a r r z s y y k e k y k y k 2 f c s f c c f s c f s s f c s f c c k y k y k 2 a r r z s x y k e k x k y k 2 f c s f c c where s x x s y y are depth dependent radiation stress in x and y directions s x y is lateral component of the radiation stress e is the wave energy e g h s 2 16 and k x and k y are components of wave number in x and y directions the expressions for roller area a r roller shape function r z and vertical structure functions f c s f s c f c c and f s s can be found in mellor 2005 the formulation of mellor 2005 was found to produce erroneous flow pattern in non breaking wave propagation over a sloped topography ardhuin et al 2008 however on one hand since the main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of current on the wave field and the water surface and velocity calculated by the numerical model have been successfully validated against observation cui 2018 the spurious current is proved to be minimal on the other hand the error from mellor 2005 formulation is considerably reduced when applying this formulation for shallow environments with mild slopes i e at most in the order of surface wave slope and under realistic mixing kumar et al 2011 moghimi et al 2013 aiki and greatbatch 2013 in present study the bed slope was found to be at least an order of magnitude less than the surface slope of wave for the majority of numerical modeling domain additionally mellor 2013 presented a criterion for applicability of mellor 2005 formulation such that the value of h x sinh k h 2 needs to be smaller or in the order of k a 2 where a is the wave amplitude the analysis for the present application shows that this criterion is met for the whole domain figure not shown therefore the radiation stress algorithm can be applied to present study 3 4 numerical model setup the computational domain which encompasses most of alabama mississippi louisiana texas continental shelf is composed of an unstructured triangular grid with 143546 nodes and 278399 elements the finest mesh resolution is 15 m in shallow estuarine region and inside channels and it gradually enlarges to 8 km near the open boundary over the continental shelf the setting of hydrodynamic model follows exactly cui 2018 in which fvcom is driven by winds at the surface sea level elevation at the open boundary and freshwater inflows from various mississippi river and atchafalaya river passes and the davis pond diversion inside the barataria basin three hourly 0 25 0 25 gridded wind data are obtained from noaa north american regional reanalysis narr products and linearly interpolated to each time step and grid point at the open boundary 6 min interval sea level time series at four stations are downloaded from noaa tides and currents website and piecewise linearly interpolated to prescribe sea surface elevations boundary condition at all open boundary nodes usgs 15 min freshwater discharge data are used to specify flux boundary conditions at river boundary nodes all model forcing functions are ramped up from zero over a period of ten days periodic inundation in the wetlands is incorporated by activating the flooding drying scheme with a threshold of 0 05 m huang et al 2011 salinity is considered as a prognostic variable in the computation as discussed in cui 2018 the initial sea level elevation and velocity were specified as zero throughout the entire computational domain initial salinity was interpolated from two data sources salinities in the barataria estuary were interpolated from observations at the usgs stations while salinities over the continental shelf were interpolated from hycom gulf of mexico 1 25 reanalysis product https hycom org data goml0pt04 expt 20pt1 cui 2018 swave is forced by winds at the sea surface

whitecapping follows the formulation of komen et al 1984 wave growth term of cavaleri and malanotte rizzoli 1981 is activated with proportionality coefficient of 0 0015 both quadruplet hasselmann et al 1985 and triad wave wave interactions eldeberky 1996 are included with parameter values recommended by van der westhuysen et al 2012 for bottom friction the jonswap formulation hasselmann et al 1973 is selected and wave breaking is according to battjes and janssen 1978 the phase decoupled refraction diffraction approximation holthuijsen et al 2003 is not activated as recommended by van der westhuysen et al 2012 other parameters in the wave model also follow van der westhuysen et al 2012 the wave spectrum simulation is divided into 36 intervals in directional space and 44 intervals in frequency logarithmically distributed from 0 05 3 0 hz the maximum cut off frequency in the model is larger than typical value of 0 5 hz recommended for application in the gulf of mexico siadatmousavi et al 2012b that is to capture the anticipated higher frequencies in the interior of the barataria basin and shallow bay side of the inlets three configurations of fvcom swave are considered in this study first fvcom and swave are fully coupled which is called wc case hereinafter second only swave runs excluding fvcom called wo case third a wc case except excluding the sea level elevation forcing in fvcom at the open boundary the last case is named wc ncwl which is only used in section 5 1 to show the effect of water surface variation in changing the shape of mississippi plume and discuss its effect on wave field inside louisiana bight 4 comparison between model simulations and observations the evaluation of fvcom performance is based on 19 noaa and usgs water level stations on the continental shelf and inside the barataria basin as elaborated in cui 2018 in summary all correlation coefficients for water surface elevation between wc case and observations exceed 0 83 with an average of 0 91 characteristic wave parameters of the wc and wo cases are validated against 5 ndbc stations and 1 coastal studies institute csi station as depicted in fig 1a the csi 09 is part of the

to angular nature of wind and mean wave direction a circular correlation coefficient c c c is used to analyze the correlation between these two variables the mathematical expression of c c c is as follows fisher and lee 1983 13 c c c i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sin x i x j sin y i y j i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sin 2 x i x j i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sin 2 y i y j where x and y are numerically calculated wind and wave directions the comparisons between observed and modeled h s and t p are tabulated in table 1 and shown in fig 2 in general the predictive skills of wc case are close to that of wo case indicating that the influence of current and sea level variation over the continental shelf is minimal at these stations owing to large c c and ia value and small mae score it can be concluded that both wc and wo are able to successfully reproduce h s the statistical scores for t p are also reasonable bearing in mind the high sensitivity of measured t p and modeled t p being a stepwise function rather than a smooth one compared with other stations ndbc 42887 station shows low c c and ia scores this is mainly because of the substantial scatter in observed data especially after 20 may fig 2 it is believed that observed t p data at this station may be erroneous the r b i a s and mae scores for t p at nearshore stations ndbc 42035 42040 and csi 09 are markedly better than the two offshore stations ndbc 42369 and 42370 in addition the r b i a s for h s at ndbc 42035 and csi 09 is negative indicating model under estimates h s otherwise model over estimates h s 5 model results and discussion given a degree of model veracity established through observation and model simulation comparisons we now set out to discuss wave characteristics in the various tidal inlets of the barataria basin as inferred from the fvcom swave simulation since the circulation in the louisiana bight affects the sea state in this bight and changes the waves from the continental shelf that may penetrate through the tidal inlets of the barataria basin we first discuss the hydrodynamics in this region 5 1 the effect of louisiana bight circulation on wave field near the passes the circulation in the louisiana bight strongly influences the height and direction of waves that approach various tidal inlets fig 3 presents the distributions of surface current vectors and h s at a prefrontal stage during maximum flood maximum ebb and slack water times for both wo and wc cases due to spatial and temporal uniformity of the wind field during these instances red straight arrows in fig 3 left column waves also uniformly propagate towards the barrier islands from a southeast direction in wo case fig 3 mid column however mean wave direction in the louisiana bight deviates greatly when wave current interaction is added green box in figs 3c and 3f inasmuch as depth induced refraction is relatively insignificant in the time instances studied in fig 3 as shown in wave field for wo cases and in smooth transition of sea surface height in the wc case figure not shown the change in mean wave direction is probably caused by the cumulative effect of current induced wave refraction because both clockwise and counterclockwise gyres inside the louisiana bight induce a current gradient perpendicular to the wave direction k u m term in eq 3 in addition the wc case predicts a h s reduction in the louisiana bight and close to coast green and red boxes in fig 3c and 3f comparing to the wo case such a decrease in h s may be attributed to the following current that stretches the wave height inside the bight when the clockwise freshwater gyre bends toward the coast red curve in fig 3a strong following velocities extend closer to the coastline lessening h s in front of the barrier islands east of grand bayou pass red box in fig 3c as the clockwise gyre moves away from the coast the wave elongation effect diminishes fig 3f and 3i a local h s shoal is also observed on the border of inner and mid shelf green box in fig 3c and 3f which could be explained by wave blocking induced by anticlockwise gyre near the mid shelf blue curved arrow in fig 3 left column in addition to the clockwise gyre from the mississippi river plume the runoff from the channels in west of bird foot delta induces an alongshore current that also changes the wave field on the eastside of barataria pass as a result of interaction between the clockwise gyre inside louisiana bight red curved arrow in fig 3 left column and westward alongshore current smaller scale secondary anticlockwise gyres may form close to the barrier islands green curved arrows in fig 4 fig 4a and 4b correspond to the maximum flood and ebb times respectively as presented in fig 3 the westward alongshore buoyancy driven current in fig 4 is 0 5 m s such currents have a component that follows the mean wave direction and reduces the significant wave height when the main clockwise gyre bends inside inward maximum flood time in fig 3a stronger secondary gyres are generated green curved arrow in fig 4a and the wave stretching influence of alongshore current is more pronounced stronger red color zone in fig 4a compared with fig 4b and 4c depending on relative direction between ocean surface current and mean wave direction these eddies can also block the wave propagation and enhance the significant wave height blue regions in fig 4b and 4c the flow from barataria pass also alters the wave height at this pass and caminada pass the results of the numerical model show that a strong jet or potential flow from barataria pass halts the buoyancy driven westward alongshore current fig 4 the eddies formed downcoast of barataria pass changes the wave height in front of grand isle and caminada pass the influence of jet flow from barataria pass will be further expounded in section 5 5 although tidal and subtidal forcing in louisiana bight is not as prominent as other abovementioned hydrodynamic forces it can still affect the wave field in this region considering typical wave characteristics h s 1 5 m t p 6 s and water level variation 0 5 m of the louisiana continental shelf applying linear wave theory for wave propagation on an average depth of 4 m results in a change of 0 03 m in h s value sea level variation also changes the shape of mississippi plume which modifies the wave field inside louisiana bight fig 5 presents the modeled h s and surface current vectors for the wc nowl case at the same time instances for maximum flood and ebb as in fig 3 in absence of water level forcing the clockwise mississippi river plume is more contracted particularly during maximum ebb flow fig 5b during flood time the gradient of surface current perpendicular to wave direction is dwindled and the effect of current induced refraction is diminished compare fig 5a with fig 3c contrastingly because of the inward bending of the louisiana gyre the local shoal in wave height is shifted to the front of southwest pass fig 5 b and wave stretching is stronger compared to fig 3i moreover the anticlockwise gyre in the mid shelf region blue curved arrow in fig 3 is weaker in the wc nowl case compared to the wc case that could affect the extension of louisiana gyre and the formation of the shoal for significant wave height 5 2 wave field inside the barataria bay the wave characteristics in the barataria basin are elaborated in a separate manuscript there we demonstrate that waves inside the barataria basin are mainly locally wind driven for the sake of comparisons with wave characteristics in various tidal inlets a station near the center of the barataria bay station bb in fig 1 is selected as a representative bay station time series of wind vectors vertically averaged current vectors and wave parameters at this station for the wc case are shown in fig 6 the lines a b c and d associated with four extreme wave events as introduced in fig 2 are also plotted during the three month simulation period two distinct wind patterns were clearly distinguishable in fig 6a first a cold front cf passage event which was characterized by clockwise rotation of wind lasts from 23 april to 3 may 2010 second a wind event with relatively constant wind direction from south or southeast se sector was seen for example from 2 june to 14 june 2010 the maximum wind speed reaches strong breeze to moderate gale beaufort wind scale 6 7 inside barataria bay during this period of time fig 6a fig 6b depicts vertically averaged flow vectors showing a dominant diurnal tidal current as commonly observed over the louisiana texas continental shelf as well as inside coastal bays and estuaries the magnitude of the current rarely exceeds 0 1 m s at this station the seemingly diurnal variation in h s fig 6c is not caused by wave current interaction since at this station wc and wo yield almost the same h s time series figure not shown the cause for this seemingly diurnal pattern in wo case requires further investigation the extreme wave events a b c and d fig 2 are also present in fig 6c though they are not as distinct as in fig 2 as illustrated in fig 6e the range of t p between 0 5 and 2 5 s is much less than typical t p values over the continental shelf 6 s a confirmation that waves in the bay are locally generated the wind and mean wave direction are strongly correlated inside barataria bay further attesting wind driven nature of wave field in this bay fig 6f1 this linear relation is enhanced during cf event fig 6f2 oppositely the statistical benchmarks are deteriorated during se event fig 6f3 the same behavior is also seen when comparing wind speed with h s as illustrated in fig 6g larger correlation coefficients values can be interpreted as strong dependency of wave height on wind intensity at this point thus such waves are mostly local wind seas smaller statistical metrics fig 6g3 on the other hand indicate that the wave at a certain point is rather affected by the wind outside of that location and shows that either a distant wave is propagated to that location or the relationship between wind and wave is nonlinear in summary the waves inside the barataria basin are strong locally generated wind seas especially during cf events 5 3 dynamics of wave and current in inlet passes 5 3 1 overall wave statistics a distinct change in wave characteristics can be observed from shelf side to bay side of the barataria basin inlets therefore for each inlet three stations are chosen that represent inlet location and its shelf and bay sides respectively green black and red dots for each inlet as depicted in fig 1b the shelf side station is influenced by waves from the deep gulf of mexico after transformations on the inner shelf and nearshore zone while the station on the bay side follows more or less similar wave pattern as discussed in section 5 2 fig 7 shows overall wind pattern depth averaged ocean current and wave parameters for pass abel and its shelf and bay sides similar to what has been shown in fig 6b diurnal variation of depth averaged tidal current is also detected at the inlet i 3 and bay stations i 3b fig 7b2 and 7b3 in spite of sporadic spikes in velocity on the shelf side i 3s fig 7b1 the mean magnitude of depth averaged current at the inlet is twice as large as that at the shelf side which can be attributed to smaller cross sectional area at the pass the numerical model predicts a notable reduction in h s from shelf to pass and further inside the basin fig 7c1 to 7c3 a comparison of mean and maximum value of h s and t p is summarized in table 2 the decrease in mean h s is 53 and 75 at i 3 and i 3b compared to i 3s table 2 demonstrates approximately the same amount of h s reduction for all other passes reduction of h s at inlet locations especially for i 3 which is 0 63 m deep is probably due to wave dissipation resulting from bottom friction and depth induced breaking before shelf waves approach the inlets the extreme wave events a b c and d are distinguished at i 3s and i 3 stations fig 7c1 and 7c2 however these events are less clear at i 3b due to dissipation of swells from the continental shelf fig 7c3 the pattern of h s at i 3 is more jagged compared to i 3s and i 3b fig 7c2 that is due to stronger ambient current along with tidal water surface variation this will be further elaborated in section 5 5 the mean wave direction on the shelf side follows somewhat a straight line which is aligned with overall orientation of coastline indicating the effect of refraction process fig 7d1 the occasional spikes in mean wave direction are triggered at frontal stage of cf events associated with an abrupt change in wind direction from southeast to northwest the jumps in mean wave direction become more frequent as we move to inlet or bay side locations fig 7d2 and 7d3 this is because of the growing influence of the seas determined by local wind variability the average value of t p decreases from shelf to pass station by about 10 fig 7e2 and table 2 though this decrease can reach up to 40 in shallow inlets such as quatre bayou pass such a reduction is in part attributed to redistribution of wave energy in shallow water due to triad wave interaction the analysis of the bi phase of the waves at the shelf side reveals strong wave nonlinearity especially during major wave events events a b c and d in fig 8 therefore transfer of energy to higher frequencies due to triad nonlinear wave interaction is more distinct at this region despite lower significant wave height at pass stations compared with shelf stations yet the shallower depth at inlet location increases the ursell number and bi phase is decreased fig 8 the only exception is barataria pass in which the water depth is greater than other passes by more than one order of magnitude therefore the denominator in eq 6 is two to three orders of magnitude greater than the numerator resulting in formation of symmetrical wave at i 2 station inside the inlet t p is reduced up to four times that characterizes locally generated waves on the bay side fig 7e3 here the contribution of three wave interaction is minimal since low h s and t p force small ursell number therefore wave is symmetric and β 0 referring to table 2 the maximum value of t p at bay long and bastian bay stations i 5b and i 6b is much less than their counterparts at other passes indicating that almost no wave from gulf of mexico can enter the barataria basin through these two passes the geometry of bay long pass has a major effect on preventing waves from entering bay long on one hand extension of the barrier island on the east of this pass blocks the more frequent waves from east to south direction and on the other hand the mostly dry wetlands on the north between bay long and bay ronquille height of about 0 5 m above navd88 obstruct the waves from n and nw direction therefore only small amplitude waves with high frequency are formed in this bay similarly the i 6b station is also surrounded by shallow water with the average depth of about 0 25 m therefore most of the wave from continental shelf is dissipated due to bottom friction and depth induced breaking before reaching i 6b station 5 3 2 relationship between wind and mean wave direction the statistical relation between wind and mean wave direction varies from coast to inside the bay at each pass fig 9 provides the analysis for barataria pass and quatre bayou pass as well as their shelf and bay sides at the continental shelf stations the wave direction has a concentrated range examining all the waves for these stations fig 9a1 and a4 when winds are from 0 to 180 wind and wave direction is to zero is due east counterclockwise waves are mostly centered on a constant direction aligned with coastline orientation 130 and 105 for barataria pass and quatre bayou pass respectively these near coastline waves are not locally generated but rather depend on a large scale wind and wave in deep gulf of mexico when wind is from 180 to 360 i e relatively rare northerly wind majority of waves are still refracted ones scattered around a constant wave direction nonetheless in a number of instances local wind waves are predicted whose direction is linearly correlated to the wind direction which is obviously fetch limited young seas fig 9a1 and 9a4 displays that locally generated wind waves are mostly observed when northerly winds are moderately strong between 5 8 m s stronger waves mainly from southern sector have induced agitation wide range of mean wave direction in i2 s station this could be due to current induced wave refraction governed by circulation at louisiana bight alongshore westward current and jet from barataria pass section 5 1 the wave field on the bay side fig 9a3 and a6 follows a pattern akin to the wave field inside the barataria basin fig 6f1 with more pronounced linear relation between wind and wave directions representing local seas the metrics at bay side stations are superior to shelf side stations as wind and wave direction does not obey a linear relationship at open coast fig 10 despite dominance of wind wave on the bay side there still exist some swells in which waves are aligned with overall coastline orientation fig 9a3 which will also be discussed in section 5 4 pass stations are a transition zone between shelf and bay stations fig 9a middle column therefore both wind sea and swells from gulf of mexico are observed nevertheless comparing quatre bayou pass vs barataria pass the scatter plot shows more contribution of wind seas in the former pass in order to investigate similar directional relationship between wind and wave direction for larger waves a threshold was applied to filter out the small waves fig 9b1 to b6 this threshold was considered as 0 1 m for pass and bay stations in shelf side stations since waves are much larger the threshold was raised to 0 5 m in coastal stations the wave pattern becomes swell dominated fig 9b1 and b4 on a contrary fig 9b3 and b6 shows that model skill improves and linear relationship between wind and wave direction is enhanced the c c c and ia in bay ranquille increase from 0 74 and 0 84 to 0 89 and 0 92 from all waves to large waves respectively mae and s i in this pass are also reduced from 31 33 and 0 43 to 19 16 and 0 24 respectively similar amelioration is also observed for other inlets therefore large waves more clearly follow the local wind that describes causality of wave on the bay side the horizontal distribution of mean wave direction for large waves in i 2 emphasizes the more presence of swells at this pass fig 9b2 on a contrary larger waves at shallower quatre bayou pass tend to establish a linear relationship similar to the bay side station fig 9b5 fig 9b1 and b4 also demonstrate that the direction of short period waves is more correlated with the wind direction differently for the waves with a period of larger than 5 s wind direction shows an independency from wind direction attesting that these waves are not generated by ambient wind force the results show a number of waves with a period of greater than 6 s inside barataria bay after barataria pass fig 9b3 such waves occur when wind direction is also southeast to south considering the lack of fetch on the bay side of the inlet they are probably the swells entering the bay when wind direction is aligned with channel direction 5 4 wave characteristics under cold front and persistent southeasterly wind events 5 4 1 wave characteristics during cold front cf event the dissipation of wave energy at the tidal inlets can also be confirmed using the spectral analysis fig 11 illustrates time series of variance density spectra for a point on the continental shelf csi 09 one station inside barataria bay bb and two inlet locations at pass shelf and bay region in addition three time instances associated with more energetic moments are singled out for which energy spectra is plotted for each station the swell sea separation frequency is calculated for each of these three time instances using spectrum integration method with upper frequency limit set as 3 hz hwang et al 2012 fig 11 the separation frequency between the swell sea f s 1 from this method is applied as a f s 1 0 75 f m 1 where f m 1 is the maximum frequency associated with the spectrum integration function based on overall observation of the wave energy spectra three empirical frequency categories are introduced f 1 0 10 0 13 hz t p 8 0 10 0 s f 2 0 25 0 33 hz t p 3 0 4 0 s and f 3 0 33 2 00 hz i e t p 0 5 3 0 s commonly inside the barataria basin these ranges are shaded in fig 11 the wave spectra in open coast fig 11a and in the interior of the barataria basin fig 11b are single peaked ones though the peak frequency and maximum energy is different in magnitude and corresponding frequency category during extratropical storm event the wave field in the continental shelf usually has a single peak at f 1 as could be seen for csi 09 station in fig 11a occasionally a double peaked spectrum is also perceived during this event as illustrated in time instance a in fig 11a inside the barataria basin the maximum peak period resides in f 3 range for the whole simulation time as depicted for bb station in fig 11b the spectrum integration based separation frequencies indicate that waves for csi 09 are mostly swells whereas the one for the station inside the barataria estuary are wind seas the spectral density for the stations at the shelf side of the inlets are in the same order of magnitude as the one for csi 09 station though the magnitude is decreased due to wave energy dissipation from nearshore processes in addition to the dominant frequency in f 1 category fig 11c1 and d1 a secondary peak frequency is also perceived that sometimes resides in wind sea region black dashed line for time instance a in fig 11c1 this demonstrates that even though shelf side of the inlets is determined by waves from continental shelf yet still a small influence from wind seas exists in this region the wave spectral energy drops by an order of magnitude at inlet locations compared with shelf stations signifying significant energy dissipation in tidal inlets as presented in fig 11c2 and d2 the dual peak shape in wave spectra is widely seen in pass stations fig 11c2 the magnitude of the energy corresponding f 3 category becomes as large as or even larger than the spectral density at other two categories e g time instance a in fig 11c2 therefore the influence of local seas is increased at the passes the energy dissipation at the inlets in the i 4 pass is found to be greater in magnitude compared to i 2 station presumably due to shallower depth in these inlets fig 11 displays that although the spectral energy in i 4s is larger than the one at i 2s the wave peak spectral energy in i 4 is about one fourth of the one in i 2 station further reduction in peak spectral density is seen in bay stations compared to pass stations alluding to continued energy dissipation inside the inlets however the magnitude of peak spectral density is in the same order as the pass station only in i 1b station not shown here this magnitude is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the station at caminada pass indicating the highest energy reduction among the passes similar to bb station the value of swell sea separation frequency attests the dominance of locally generated waves in the bay side of the inlets fig 11c3 and 11d3 nonetheless in i 2b station during cold front passage a secondary peak at f 1 range is also seen fig 11c3 the double peak pattern in wave spectra confirms that some swells from continental shelf can penetrate through this inlet due to its larger depth the double peak pattern is rarely seen in i 1b and i 3b stations the range of spectral density in bay stations is smaller compared to bb station further inside barataria bay which could indicate that local seas are relatively less developed in the bay stations in general the statistical measures of wind vs mean wave direction improved during cold front passage compared with the whole simulation time denoting the locally generated wind waves during this event fig 10 nonetheless the model skills are still lower than the one for bb station inside barataria bay fig 6f2 5 4 2 wave characteristics during persistent south east se event similar to the spectral analysis performed for cf event the spectral analysis proves a single peaked spectrum in swell range for csi 09 station fig 12a the peak frequency in se event per contra is larger than the one during cf event and pertains to f 2 range comparing figs 11 and 12 the spectral density at peak frequency is also an order of magnitude smaller than that of cf event denoting comparatively less energetic se event the spectral density of the shelf stations is on par with csi 09 fig 12c1 and d1 however it is at least one order of magnitude smaller at the passes due to bottom friction and wave current interaction fig 12c2 and d2 similar to the discussion pertaining cf event the rate of energy dissipation is larger in i 4 station compared to i 2 the swell sea separation frequency denotes the dominance of the wave from continental shelf in i 2 station during se event fig 12c2 however the concurrent contribution of local seas and swell is manifest in i 4 station fig 12d2 the spectrum integration based separation frequency for bay side stations indicates the growth of waves due to local wind fig 12c3 and fig 12d3 alike the case of cf event the double peak shape is also predicted at some instances for i 2b station alluding to penetration of waves with characteristic peak frequency at f 2 notwithstanding the magnitude of maximum density spectra is larger in bb station showing more wave development as we move further inside barataria bay 5 5 effect of wave current interaction on wave field in front of inlets owing to geometrical restriction current and wave direction at the inlet location are in line with each other where wave blocking stretching is amplified fig 13 depicts the difference between ocean surface current and mean wave direction for barataria pass and bay long pass the 0 and 180 of difference indicate following and opposing current respectively the analysis for other inlets follows the pattern as for bay long pass fig 13 demonstrates that opposing following current is more pronounced at inlet stations in shelf side such a pattern is weaker particularly up to first week of may when cold front passages prevail the pattern is more scattered at i 2b and i 5b indicating less influence of ambient current on changing the wave height on the basin side fig 13c and f the analysis shows less scatter in barataria pass fig 13 left panels compared with bay long pass and other inlets though not shown here this could be because of the stronger current at this pass the surface current in barataria pass can reach 1 34 m s which is 72 73 36 and 93 larger than the modeled maximum surface current speed at pass abel quatre bayou pass bay long pass and grand bayou pass respectively the contribution of water surface elevation and ocean surface current on changing the wave field can also be observed through contrasting the numerical model results between wo and wc cases the significant wave height in wo case is smoother than the one in wc case further the significant wave height in wo case is sometimes larger than the one in wc case in shelf and pass stations the major deviation in significant wave height between wc and wo cases occurs at pre frontal stage with moderate to large wind speed 8 m s from southerly quadrants associated with low tidal elevation fig 14c1 and c2 on the shelf side the difference in wave height is mainly due to the dynamics in louisiana bight as discussed in section 5 1 in the pass and bay stations a confluence of propagation of smaller wave height from shelf side as well as additional water level and current in the coupled system is responsible for this discrepancy given a fixed breaking parameter according to battjes and janssen formulation 1978 γ h m a x d in which h m a x is the maximum possible individual wave height and d is the water depth the lower water level during ebb tide would culminate in lower upper bound of maximum significant wave height the wave blocking stretching phenomena can also be detected from instantaneous numerical model results as displayed in fig 15 during the flood period the current direction aligned with wave direction stretches the wave length and therefore reduces the wave height on both sea side and basin side of barataria pass fig 15b3 the model predicts a 15 decrease of significant wave height at following current that is close to the result from smith et al 2000 for wallipa entrance channel 20 however during ebb period when the direction of jet is opposite to the prevalent wave direction the blocking effect of opposing current is manifested in local enhancement of significant wave height about two kilometers offshore blue zone in fig 15a3 followed by a rapid reduction of h s from i 2s to i 2 stations such pattern of onshore decay in wave height is in conformity with findings of chen et al 2015 the numerical model predicts a 20 of increase in significant wave height that is less than the one predicted by smith et al 2000 80 but the same as the simulation results of dodet et al 2013 for albufeira lagoonal inlet aside from jet direction direction and magnitude of local wind governs the pattern of wave current interaction as well for instance though the time instance in fig 15c3 is associated with an ebb time relatively strong northwest wind generates waves that are in the same direction as the jet flow and the resultant wave height on the sea side of the inlet reduces due to wave stretching effect the mean wave direction calculated from wc case is sometimes clearly different from the one predicted by wo case especially in shelf stations fig 14d1 such pattern can also be detected comparing modeled instantaneous mean wave direction for wo and wc simulations fig 15 second and third rows in front of the barataria pass current induced wave refraction as a result of larger velocity in the main channel compared to adjacent shallower regions dictate such a deviation the dynamics of wave current interaction is somewhat different in inlets other than barataria pass as the jet velocity diminishes in those passes and wave current interaction plays a less important role in shallower inlets the significant wave height becomes more sensitive to variation in water surface elevation as depth induced breaking plays a major role consistent with kang and di iorio 2006 and olabarrieta et al 2011 in caminada pass absence of a strong jet obstruction of east to west alongcoast current because of jet flow from barataria pass see fig 4 and shallow depth resulted in abrupt change in significant wave height commensurate to local water depth fig 14c4 thus h s for wc case at tidal and subtidal peaks surpasses the one simulated by wo case 6 summary in this study the wave dynamics and wave current interaction for six major inlets connecting the barataria bay with gulf of mexico was investigated with a three dimensional wave current coupled wetting drying activated numerical model the study was carried out for a three month period in the late spring and summer time period to include both cold front and persistent southeasterly winds common in northern gulf of mexico and the louisiana bight the numerical wave model was validated against observed data at five offshore stations and one coastal station where the wave parameters in the region were successfully reproduced the validated model is used to address the causality of wave at each inlet and their shelf and bay side the detailed spectral analysis and statistical evaluation of wind vs wave direction demonstrate that the wave field on the bay side of the inlets is strongly dependent on the local wind intensity and direction in contrast the shelf side of the inlets is influenced by swells from the gulf of mexico at the inlet the contribution of both local seas and swells is perceived in barataria pass due to its deeper depth the effect of swell from gulf of mexico is more pronounced while the shallow inlets on the east of barataria pass are more governed by locally generated waves the wind driven nature of significant wave height is enhanced during cold front events with an increase in scores of wind vs wave height this result is attributed to rapidly varying circulation inside louisiana bight during this event preventing distant waves to effectively approach coastline differently the contribution of swells is boosted during southeasterly wind event all of the inlets effectively dissipate the wave energy as the wave spectral density dwindles by one order of magnitude from the shelf side to the inlet location the model predicts larger magnitude of wave spectral density during cold front cf event compared with persistent southeasterly se wind event therefore cf event is clearly revealed as a more energetic event the peak frequency in cf event also corresponded to larger peak period the circulation pattern inside louisiana bight controlled by water level forcing wind forcing buoyancy and wind driven alongshore current and the mississippi river plume affects the wave field inside the bight and in front of the inlets as a result current induced refraction and overall wave reduction in fully coupled system is noticed compared with wave only simulation both strong jet velocity and local wind direction impact the wave at the mouth of barataria pass through wave steepening and partial wave blocking during opposing current and decrease in wave height during following current the opposing current could increase the wave height by about 20 during ebb flow and the following current could decrease the wave height on sea side of barataria pass by up to 15 the potential and jet flow at barataria pass blocks the westward movement of the alongshore current reducing the effect of this current at caminada pass at inlets other than barataria pass the wave field is more affected by bottom friction and depth induced breaking rather than wave current interaction the redistribution of wave energy due to triad wave interaction is also more pronounced in these inlets compared with barataria pass particularly during extreme wave events credit authorship contribution statement soroush sorourian

23982,in this study we developed a fully dispersive boussinesq type wave model in the modelling framework of the public domain boussinesq model funwave tvd the model adopts the fully dispersive boussinesq equations of karambas and memos 2009 and uses a finite volume and finite difference tvd type scheme a well balanced conservative form of the governing equations is derived to facilitate the

scheme nearshore wave processes funwave tvd 1 introduction the success of boussinesq type wave models is noted in modelling the entire evolution process of coastal waves from intermediate water depth to swash zone over the last decades since peregrine 1967 first proposed the classical boussinesq equations including the effect of the bathymetry considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the range of model applicability with respect to classical restrictions to both weak dispersion and weak nonlinearity madsen et al 1991 optimized the model performance by rearranging the dispersion

intermediate water depth i e k h 3 where k is the wavenumber and h is the water depth wei et al 1995 derived so called fully nonlinear boussinesq equations to expand the restriction of weak non linearity of the boussinesq equations by removing the wave height to water depth ratio as a scaling or expansion parameter in the development of approximate governing equations meanwhile as the boussinesq equations do not naturally lead to wave breaking in surf zone empirical breaking models have also been developed in a number of ways e g zelt 1991 sato 1992 schäffer et al 1993 among empirical breaking models an eddy viscosity formulation due to zelt 1991 has been shown highly effective and used most frequently in describing surf zone wave dissipation the ideas of these breakthroughs were soon very popular among wave modellers and the resulting class of boussinesq type models e g kirby et al 1998 chen et al 2000 kennedy et al 2000 chen et al 2003 chen 2006 have become a useful tool for modelling surface wave transformation nearshore as well as wave induced circulation inside the surf zone contributing to a good understanding of water wave behaviours essential for design activities in coastal and ocean engineering nevertheless waves are usually generated and start their travel in deep waters while the depth limitation of the above mentioned class of boussinesq type models still cannot cover adequately the whole domain from deep ocean to the shore when dealing with real life sea states considering this drawback several scholars made attempts to practically eliminate water depth limitations and treat highly nonlinear waves madsen et al 2002 presented a model whose linear and nonlinear characteristics became accurate up to k h 40 lynett and liu 2004 extended the application range of boussinesq type equations to deeper water in a different way that split the vertical domain into multi layers and estimated the velocities by quadratic polynomial in each layer bingham and agnon 2005 also derived a boussinesq type model valid for fully dispersive waves in the sense that the error of approximation is acceptably small for any water depth inspired by lynett and liu 2004 liu and fang 2016 derived a new two layer boussinesq model which is accurate up to kh 53 in linear dispersion and the model exhibits a high accuracy in modelling linear shoaling gradient and highly nonlinear velocity profile liu and fang 2019 more recently liu et al 2018 extended the model to multi layer models and four layer model shows high accuracy up to k h 667 880 however these boussinesq equations include a number of higher order derivatives and the numerical implementation becomes much more complex on the other hand tsutsui et al 1998 derived a system of fully dispersive weakly nonlinear equations replacing the phase velocity terms in the momentum equations by an integral with the kernel of the fourier transform of phase velocity following tsutsui et al 1998 karambas and memos 2009 introduced a system of equations in two horizontal dimensions 2dh for fully dispersive and weakly nonlinear waves this model has significant advantages due to the small number of terms in both continuity and momentum equations and simulates accurately the propagation of fully dispersive water waves combined with empirical wave breaking models the models can also be applied over mildly sloping topography existing approaches to development of numerical implementations for boussinesq type models include a wide range of finite difference finite volume or finite element formulations recently a hybrid method combining the finite volume and finite difference tvd total variation diminishing schemes has been introduced for nonlinear boussinesq equations e g tonelli and petti 2009 roeber et al 2010 shi et al 2012 fang et al 2013 kazolea et al 2014 fang et al 2016 this hybrid approach is reported to be more stable than finite difference and finite element schemes which have been proved to be noisy and require a case dependent filter application to suppress spurious oscillations near shorelines and for breaking waves choi et al 2018 wave breaking can also be treated as shock waves making the implementation of an additional breaking model unnecessary this shock capturing scheme has shown robust performance in simulating nearshore wave processes including wave shoaling refraction diffraction breaking as well as coastal inundation on the plane and sharply varying bathymetries shi et al 2012 ning et al 2019a b in this paper we describe the development of a hybrid finite volume finite difference scheme for the fully dispersive boussinesq equations of karambas and memos 2009 the model is developed in the modelling framework of the public domain model funwave tvd https fengyanshi github io build html index html which has been widely used in the field of coastal engineering and coastal physical oceanography the present work follows the work of shi et al 2012 who developed a hybrid finite volume finite difference tvd type scheme for the fully nonlinear boussinesq model equations of chen 2006 different from the other fully dispersive boussinesq equations karambas and memos 2009 s equations include only one dispersion term in the momentum equation which is expressed by convolution integrals and estimated using appropriate impulse functions in order to facilitate computations with a hybrid scheme the boussinesq equations of karambas and memos 2009 are reorganized into a conservative form the flux terms are computed by a high order tvd hll harten lax van leer scheme and spatial derivative terms are computed by the finite difference scheme instead of a uniform time stepping an adaptive time step based on the strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme is used moreover by taking advantage of this hybrid scheme wave breaking is modelled by locally switching the boussinesq equations to the nonlinear shallow water equations when the froude number exceeds a certain threshold following the method of tonelli and petti 2009 a straightforward wetting drying scheme is used for wave inundation the present model is validated against the linear theory and well documented experimental data to test its capability in simulating wave dispersion shoaling breaking refraction diffraction and run up the remaining of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations are introduced and derivations of the conservative form of the governing equations are presented section 3 describes the hybrid numerical schemes boundary condition and wave generation methods in section 4 the present model is validated against several laboratory experiments including regular waves over 1dh submerged bar and 2dh bathymetry and solitary wave propagation over a sloping beach and a conical island conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 fully dispersive boussinesq equations the fully dispersive boussinesq type equations adopted in the present model are the equations proposed by karambas and memos 2009 the depth integrated continuity equation is given by 1 η t d u x d v y 0 where η is the surface elevation d h η denotes the total water depth h is the still water depth u and v are the depth averaged velocities in the x and y directions respectively the depth averaged horizontal momentum equations are expressed as 2 u t u u x v u y g η x c i x 0 3 v t u v x v v y g η y c i y 0 ci x and ci y represent the convolution integral terms which can be expressed respectively as karambas and memos 2009 4 c i x η x x ξ 1 y ξ 2 t η x k ξ 1 ξ 2 d ξ 1 d ξ 2 5 c i y η y x ξ 1 y ξ 2 t η y k ξ 1 ξ 2 d ξ 1 d ξ 2 in which the fourier transformed kernel k x y is given by tsutsui et al 1998 6 k x y g 2 π h 2 1 r h n 1 1 n 1 n 2 r h 2 4 where r x 2 y 2 by using the convolution integral terms the boussinesq equations of karambas and memos 2009 pose no restriction to the water depth and include smaller number of terms making the numerical implementation easier however since only first order of the nonlinearity parameter is retained their equations should be treated as weakly nonlinear moreover wave current interactions i e the correct doppler shift waves in ambient currents should not be well provided by karambas and memos s equations since they do not include high order terms that can automatically provide correct doppler shift for waves as emphasized by madsen and schäffer 1998 more details about the theoretical equations are referred to karambas and memos 2009 and tsutsui et al 1998 a suitable conservative form of the governing equations is necessary when applying the hybrid numerical scheme in surface wave models to preserve the steady states of flow discontinuities especially in the case of variational topography e g liang and marche 2009 roeber et al 2010 shi et al 2012 fang et al 2016 michel dansac et al 2016 in the present model the horizontal volume flux m m x m y d u d v instead of depth averaged velocity is used as a conserved variable then eqs 1 3 become 7 η t m x x m y y 0 8 m x t x m x 2 d y m x m y d g d η x d c i x 9 m y t x m x m y d y m y 2 d g d η y d c i y similar to shi et al 2012 a surface gradient method proposed by rogers et al 2003 was used to balance the flux and slope source terms arising from the pressure terms in 8 and 9 in which case the surface gradient term can be split as 10 g d η 1 2 g η 2 2 h η g η h where x y denotes the horizontal gradient operator using eq 10 the momentum equations 8 and 9 can be rewritten as 11 m x t x m x 2 d y m x m y d x 1 2 g η 2 2 h η g η h x d c i x 12 m y t x m x m y d y m y 2 d y 1 2 g η 2 2 h η g η h y d c i y eqs 7 11 12 are the governing equations solved in the present model 3 numerical schemes 3 1 compact form of governing equations as the boussinesq equations do not automatically lead to wave breaking in shallow water several empirical breaking models have been proposed to accommodate wave breaking in the surf zone for the boussinesq equations the popular approach is to add an ad hoc dissipation sub model such as roller models e g schäffer et al 1993 madsen et al 1997 and eddy viscosity models e g zelt 1991 kennedy et al 2000 to the momentum equation however these types of breaking models contain several empirical parameters which may need to be tuned over different bathymetries on the other hand it is well known the nonlinear shallow water equations have the ability of treating bores and shock waves based on the shock capturing scheme wave breaking and swash oscillations can be easily modelled by the models based on the nonlinear shallow water equations considering the merits of the boussinesq equations and nonlinear shallow water equations the boussinesq type models with the shock capturing capability are expected fortunately the boussinesq equations are constructed by basic terms of the nonlinear shallow water equations which can be handled using the shock capturing scheme following shi et al 2012 the conservative nswe form of eqs 7 11 and 12 can be written as 13 ψ t θ ψ s where ψ and θ ψ are the conserved variables vector and the flux vector and s is the source terms 14 ψ η m x m y θ ψ m x i m y j m x m x d 1 2 g η 2 2 η h i m x m y d j m x m y d i m y m y d 1 2 g η 2 2 η h j s 0 g η h x d c i x g η h y d c i y with the conservative form the governing equations can be solved by a local riemann solver and wave breaking can be modelled by removing the convolution integral terms when the ratio of surface elevation to local water depth exceeds a certain threshold which is 0 8 suggested by tonelli and petti 2009 3 2 spatial and temporal discretization spatial discretization and time stepping are the same as in funwave tvd shi et al 2012 for spatial discretization a hybrid finite volume finite difference scheme is implemented the modified fourth order muscl tvd scheme with van leer limiter erduran et al 2005 is adopted to obtain constructed values of the conserved variables at the left and right sides of the interfaces followed by an hll approximate riemann solver harten et al 1983 to compute the numerical fluxes meanwhile the spatial derivatives are solved by the finite difference scheme the convolution integrals 4 and 5 are calculated numerically by high order accurate methods the complex simpson s rule due to the exponential decay with distances of the fourier transformed kernel of eq 6 the integral limits in 2dh situation are set as 4h instead of tsutsui et al 1998 karambas and memos 2009 furthermore using euler s transformation due to van wijngaarden press et al 1986 the alternative series in eq 6 can reach convergence with sum of 25 terms at most these strategies significantly improve the computational efficiency on the other hand our numerical tests showed that the convolutional interval can be specified as a function of the grid size resulting in a small number of numerical iterations it also coincides with klonaris et al 2013 that the integration limits do not necessarily dictate the grid spacing but the number of the summation terms replacing the integral in terms of temporal discretization the third order strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme gottlieb et al 2001 is adopted in the model the scheme is shown as 15 ψ 1 ψ n δ t θ ψ n s 1 16 ψ 2 3 4 ψ n 1 4 ψ 1 δ t θ ψ 1 s 2 17 ψ n 1 1 3 ψ n 2 3 ψ 2 δ t θ ψ 2 s n 1 where the superscript n indicates the present time level and the superscripts 1 and 2 indicate the intermediate stages in the runge kutta integration for the purpose of numerical stability an adaptive time step is implemented following the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition 18 δ t c min min δ x u i j g h i j η i j min δ y v i j g h i j η i j where c is the courant number 3 3 boundary condition and wave generation the moving boundary is handled conveniently as part of the riemann solver underlying the finite volume scheme a mirror boundary condition is applied to the muscl tvd scheme and the wave speeds of the riemann solver for a dry cell are modified following shi et al 2012 a minimum total water depth is applied to detect the end point of the moving shoreline if the calculated d is less than a specified threshold the cell is considered as a dry cell with normal flux at the interface set to zero besides general wall boundary conditions and absorbing sponge layers are implemented following kirby et al 1998 the regular and irregular wave generation follows the method of zhang et al 2014 who used generating absorbing sponge layers with a generation layer at the left boundary and absorbing layer at the right boundary of the computational field as there is no mixed space time terms in shallow water type equations linear source terms with only two influential coefficients the sponge length l s and the integrated sponge strengths ω 1 are added to the right side of the governing equations at each time step to impose surface elevations and corresponding velocities values of these two coefficients are case dependent to reproduce the target waves accurately the internal solitary wave maker is also implemented following the first order solitary wave theory with initial values of surface elevation η and velocity u defined as 19 η h 0 sech 2 3 h 0 4 h 3 x x st 20 u g h η h h 0 g h sech 2 3 h 0 4 h 3 x x st where h 0 is the incident wave height and x st is the position of initial wave crest along the propagation direction to demonstrate the dispersive property of the present model 1 dh regular wave and irregular wave propagation over the flat bed were tested first the incident wave height h 0 wave period t and water depth d of the regular wave test are 2 m 6 s and 100 m k h 10 3 fig 1 shows a snapshot of the surface elevation from the present model funwave tvd and linear wave theory for the regular wave test the grid size δ x 1 5 m was used as seen in fig 1 the present model agrees well with the linear wave theory while phase discrepancy is clearly observed from funwave tvd which indicates the dispersion is well preserved in the present model conditions of the irregular wave test are the same as that in karambas and memos 2009 three cosine waves h 1 1 7 m t 1 9 s h 2 1 9 m t 2 12 s h 3 1 0 m t 3 6 s were superposed over a constant depth of 25 m fig 2 shows a snapshot of the surface elevations from the present model and linear wave theory for the irregular wave test the grid size δ x 2 m was used as seen in fig 2 model results agree with analytical solutions well which indicate the capability of the model to simulate irregular linear wave propagation for the regular wave test we also compared the computational cost of the present model and funwave tvd both models computed regular wave propagation for 200 s with the same model setup the computation time of the present model and funwave tvd is about 32 h 42 min and 2 h 54 min respectively cpu intel e3 1225 v5 4 coreprocessors we have to confess that the computation efficiency of the present model is lower than funwave tvd mainly because the computational cost of convolution integral terms in the present model is still higher than that of the dispersive terms in funwave tvd 4 model validations with benchmark test data 4 1 regular wave propagating over a 1dh submerged bar the laboratory experiments conducted by beji and battjes 1993 and luth et al 1994 have been widely used for benchmark tests of nonlinear numerical models e g gobbi and kirby 1999 shiach and mingham 2009 ai et al 2011 ma et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 the bathymetries of their experiments have identical geometric characteristics except the length scale of luth et al 1994 is double that in beji and battjes 1993 here we chose luth et al s data for model validation because more wave gauges and an active wave absorption at the end of water flume were adopted in luth et al s experiments for simplicity we re scaled the length scale to the scale of beji and battjes 1993 and extended the boundary of both sides for applying generating absorbing sponge layers fig 3 shows the numerical setup based on luth et al s experiments the computational domain is 40 m long a flat bottom with the water depth of 0 4 m and a submerged trapezoidal bar with an upslope of 1 20 a downslope of 1 10 and a 2 m platform were implemented in the numerical tank the depth over the platform of the submerged bar is 0 1 m in luth et al s experiments 10 wave gauges were placed along the flume to record the surface elevations regular waves with the period of 2 02 s and wave amplitude of 1 0 cm were generated the case was a non breaking case and selected to test the model ability in predicting the wave shoaling and dispersion characteristics the grid size of 0 02 m was used and bottom friction was neglected in the numerical simulation time series of surface elevations for measured and predicted results at 10 gauges are demonstrated in fig 4 the model results generally agree well with the experimental data in particular the model reasonably predicted wave shoaling and amplification of bond higher harmonics as waves propagate on the slope of the bar as shown at g3 g5 a small over prediction of wave peaks can be found at g4 which was probably caused by the weak nonlinearity of the model as waves propagate into the deeper water behind the bar the higher harmonics are released as free waves the model basically captured the processes but with large errors as shown at g6 g8 the large discrepancies between model and data may be induced by the poor nonlinear characteristics of the model 4 2 regular wave propagation over a 2dh bathymetry in order to test the model s ability in reproducing wave refraction and diffraction over a 2dh bathymetry the present model was applied to simulate the experimental cases conducted by berkhoff et al 1982 the corresponding experimental layout is presented in fig 5 an elliptic shoal is situated over a 1 50 plane beach and the slope is oriented at an angle of 20 the minimum depth at the east boundary was set to 0 1 m in the simulation monochromatic waves with wave period t 1 s and incident wave height h 0 4 64 cm were generated at the west boundary and the sponge layer was set at the east boundary by using the method of generating absorbing sponge layers zhang et al 2014 wall boundary conditions were set at the north and south boundaries based on the experimental setup grid sizes δ x δ y 0 03 m were used and bottom friction was neglected in the numerical simulation the total simulation time is 40 s fig 6 shows the comparison of relative wave height h h 0 between the experimental data and the numerical results along eight transections s1 s8 as indicated in fig 5 the last five wave cycles were used to estimate the wave height due to wave refraction and diffraction around the shoal as seen from the experimental data of s3 s5 wave focusing occurs behind the shoal with a maximum wave height of approximately 2 2 times larger than the incident wave height in general the model predicted wave refraction and diffraction processes in good agreement with the data the model under predicted the peak wave height at s3 and slightly over predicted the wave height at s4 4 3 solitary wave run up on a beach in the present model wave breaking is modelled by the shock capturing method and the moving boundary is handled conveniently as part of the riemann solver underlying the finite volume scheme to examine the ability of the present model in predicting wave breaking and moving shoreline solitary wave run up on a sloping beach was modelled experiments of synolakis 1986 were adopted for model validation fig 7 shows the numerical setup based on synolakis s experiments the internal solitary wave maker was implemented with initial crest at 18 25 h 0 from the initial shoreline the slope of the beach was set to 1 19 85 both non breaking and breaking solitary waves were simulated the constant water depth h 0 is 100 m and bottom friction was neglected in both cases for the non breaking wave case a solitary wave with the relative amplitude h 0 h 0 0 019 was tested using the grid size δ x 5 m the computed free surface profiles at different non dimensional times were compared to experimental data as shown in fig 8 due to the weak nonlinearity of non breaking solitary wave simulated results show good agreement to the experimental data except the snapshot at t g h 0 1 2 70 i e fig 8 j which shows a slight overestimate of run down at the shoreline fig 9 compares the modelled time series of surface elevation with the non linear theoretical solutions at two wave gauges located at x h 0 9 95 and x h 0 0 25 respectively the incident and reflected waves are shown as two separated humps at the first wave gauge fig 9 a while the two waves collide and create one corresponding hump with a temporary dry period at the second wave gauge near the initial shoreline during the backwash fig 9 b the numerical results agree well with the analytical solutions for the breaking wave case a solitary wave with the relative amplitude h 0 h 0 0 28 was tested using the grid size δ x 5 m the computed free surface profiles at different non dimensional times are compared to experimental data as shown in fig 10 the solitary wave breaks twice one happens during the run up around t g h 0 1 2 35 fig 10 c and the other occurs during the backwash around t g h 0 1 2 65 fig 10 i due to the weak nonlinearity of the governing equations the model over predicted the wave crest of the large solitary wave before the first breaking as shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 b however the shock capturing scheme implemented in the present model which allows the model to switch boussinesq equations to nonlinear shallow water equations seems to correct the model performance in which case the wave breaking and subsequent run up down are predicted well as seen in the rest of the comparisons of fig 10 in addition small oscillations of numerical results are observed in fig 10 h and fig 10 i since breaking also occurs during the backwash we attribute these oscillations to the numerical instability caused by sharply deactivating or reactivating dispersive terms as reported in fang et al 2016 who added a lower limit to the criterion of tonelli and petti 2009 to avoid the instability but it seems the oscillations do not affect the performance of the present model much in this case 4 4 solitary wave run up on a conical island briggs et al 1995 conducted a series of laboratory experiments for solitary wave propagations around a conical island the schematic layout of the briggs et al s experiments is shown in fig 11 the constant water depth is 0 32 m and the slope of the conical island is 1 4 three solitary waves with incident wave heights h 0 0 014 m case a 0 029 m case b and 0 058 m case c were generated respectively from the west side of the conical island water surface elevations were recorded by several wave gauges around the island and the measured data have been used for validations in many other studies e g lynett et al 2002 zijlema et al 2011 ai and jin 2012 cui et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 in the present study the measured data at four gauges were selected for model validation the locations of these wave gauges are denoted in fig 11 gauge 6 is located right above the toe of the island and encounters the wave firstly gauges 9 16 and 22 stand near the initial shoreline in which gauge 9 is on the frontage gauge 16 is on the right side and gauge 22 is on the lee side of the island in numerical simulation the grid size δ x δ y 0 05 m was employed and bottom friction was neglected the comparisons of predicted and measured time series of surface elevations at four gauges are shown in fig 12 for cases a b and c the overall agreement is satisfied the model overestimates the wave crests at gauge 9 for all cases probably due to the weakly nonlinear property in addition surface elevations after wave crests are underestimated by the model at all gauges this mismatch in model data comparisons has also been noticed by other authors e g briggs et al 1995 kânoğlu and synolakis 1998 and fuhrman and madsen 2008 who explained that the water leakage appeared on the rear side of the solitary wave and the wave maker cannot generate a precise solitary wave in the experiments the measured and computed maximum run up distribution around the conical island are presented in fig 13 it can be seen that the model reasonably predicts the maximum run ups including the increase in maximum run ups at the lee side of the island 5 conclusion in this paper a 2dh fully dispersive weakly nonlinear boussinesq type wave model was developed based on a hybrid tvd type scheme the fully dispersive boussinesq equations proposed by karambas and memos 2009 which include only one dispersion term expressed through convolution integrals in the momentum equation were adopted a well balanced compact form of the equations was derived to facilitate the hybrid finite difference finite volume scheme flux terms were computed by the muscl tvd scheme up to the fourth order accuracy within the riemann solver the third order strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme was used for time stepping the convolution integral terms were estimated by the numerical evaluation and the spatial derivative terms were computed by the finite difference scheme based on the hybrid scheme wave breaking can be treated as shock waves by switching the boussinesq equations to nonlinear shallow water equations when the ratio of surface elevation to local water depth exceeds a certain threshold validated with analytical solutions and several laboratory experiments the present model demonstrates the capability of maintaining the dispersive property and simulating wave transformations and run ups over 1dh and 2dh bathymetries in particular the model shows reasonable accuracy after wave breaking probably due to the shock capturing scheme which can introduce the merits of nonlinear shallow water equations to a weakly nonlinear boussinesq

23982,in this study we developed a fully dispersive boussinesq type wave model in the modelling framework of the public domain boussinesq model funwave tvd the model adopts the fully dispersive boussinesq equations of karambas and memos 2009 and uses a finite volume and finite difference tvd type scheme a well balanced conservative form of the governing equations is derived to facilitate the hybrid numerical scheme flux terms were computed by the muscl tvd scheme up to the fourth order accuracy within the riemann solver the third order strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme was used for time stepping the convolution integral terms were estimated by the numerical evaluation and the spatial derivative terms were computed by the finite difference scheme wave breaking is predicted by locally switching the boussinesq equations to nonlinear shallow water equations with a froude number criterion the model is validated against the linear wave theory and various experiments to examine the capability of the model in simulating wave dispersion shoaling breaking refraction diffraction and run up keywords fully dispersive model boussinesq equations tvd type scheme nearshore wave processes funwave tvd 1 introduction the success of boussinesq type wave models is noted in modelling the entire evolution process of coastal waves from intermediate water depth to swash zone over the last decades since peregrine 1967 first proposed the classical boussinesq equations including the effect of the bathymetry considerable efforts have been devoted to improving the range of model applicability with respect to classical restrictions to both weak dispersion and weak nonlinearity madsen et al 1991 optimized the model performance by rearranging the dispersion terms based on the characteristics of pade s approximation nwogu 1993 introduced a reference velocity as dependent variable and demonstrated a significant improvement of dispersion properties in intermediate water depth i e k h 3 where k is the wavenumber and h is the water depth wei et al 1995 derived so called fully nonlinear boussinesq equations to expand the restriction of weak non linearity of the boussinesq equations by removing the wave height to water depth ratio as a scaling or expansion parameter in the development of approximate governing equations meanwhile as the boussinesq equations do not naturally lead to wave breaking in surf zone empirical breaking models have also been developed in a number of ways e g zelt 1991 sato 1992 schäffer et al 1993 among empirical breaking models an eddy viscosity formulation due to zelt 1991 has been shown highly effective and used most frequently in describing surf zone wave dissipation the ideas of these breakthroughs were soon very popular among wave modellers and the resulting class of boussinesq type models e g kirby et al 1998 chen et al 2000 kennedy et al 2000 chen et al 2003 chen 2006 have become a useful tool for modelling surface wave transformation nearshore as well as wave induced circulation inside the surf zone contributing to a good understanding of water wave behaviours essential for design activities in coastal and ocean engineering nevertheless waves are usually generated and start their travel in deep waters while the depth limitation of the above mentioned class of boussinesq type models still cannot cover adequately the whole domain from deep ocean to the shore when dealing with real life sea states considering this drawback several scholars made attempts to practically eliminate water depth limitations and treat highly nonlinear waves madsen et al 2002 presented a model whose linear and nonlinear characteristics became accurate up to k h 40 lynett and liu 2004 extended the application range of boussinesq type equations to deeper water in a different way that split the vertical domain into multi layers and estimated the velocities by quadratic polynomial in each layer bingham and agnon 2005 also derived a boussinesq type model valid for fully dispersive waves in the sense that the error of approximation is acceptably small for any water depth inspired by lynett and liu 2004 liu and fang 2016 derived a new two layer boussinesq model which is accurate up to kh 53 in linear dispersion and the model exhibits a high accuracy in modelling linear shoaling gradient and highly nonlinear velocity profile liu and fang 2019 more recently liu et al 2018 extended the model to multi layer models and four layer model shows high accuracy up to k h 667 880 however these boussinesq equations include a number of higher order derivatives and the numerical implementation becomes much more complex on the other hand tsutsui et al 1998 derived a system of fully dispersive weakly nonlinear equations replacing the phase velocity terms in the momentum equations by an integral with the kernel of the fourier transform of phase velocity following tsutsui et al 1998 karambas and memos 2009 introduced a system of equations in two horizontal dimensions 2dh for fully dispersive and weakly nonlinear waves this model has significant advantages due to the small number of terms in both continuity and momentum equations and simulates accurately the propagation of fully dispersive water waves combined with empirical wave breaking models the models can also be applied over mildly sloping topography existing approaches to development of numerical implementations for boussinesq type models include a wide range of finite difference finite volume or finite element formulations recently a hybrid method combining the finite volume and finite difference tvd total variation diminishing schemes has been introduced for nonlinear boussinesq equations e g tonelli and petti 2009 roeber et al 2010 shi et al 2012 fang et al 2013 kazolea et al 2014 fang et al 2016 this hybrid approach is reported to be more stable than finite difference and finite element schemes which have been proved to be noisy and require a case dependent filter application to suppress spurious oscillations near shorelines and for breaking waves choi et al 2018 wave breaking can also be treated as shock waves making the implementation of an additional breaking model unnecessary this shock capturing scheme has shown robust performance in simulating nearshore wave processes including wave shoaling refraction diffraction breaking as well as coastal inundation on the plane and sharply varying bathymetries shi et al 2012 ning et al 2019a b in this paper we describe the development of a hybrid finite volume finite difference scheme for the fully dispersive boussinesq equations of karambas and memos 2009 the model is developed in the modelling framework of the public domain model funwave tvd https fengyanshi github io build html index html which has been widely used in the field of coastal engineering and coastal physical oceanography the present work follows the work of shi et al 2012 who developed a hybrid finite volume finite difference tvd type scheme for the fully nonlinear boussinesq model equations of chen 2006 different from the other fully dispersive boussinesq equations karambas and memos 2009 s equations include only one dispersion term in the momentum equation which is expressed by convolution integrals and estimated using appropriate impulse functions in order to facilitate computations with a hybrid scheme the boussinesq equations of karambas and memos 2009 are reorganized into a conservative form the flux terms are computed by a high order tvd hll harten lax van leer scheme and spatial derivative terms are computed by the finite difference scheme instead of a uniform time stepping an adaptive time step based on the strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme is used moreover by taking advantage of this hybrid scheme wave breaking is modelled by locally switching the boussinesq equations to the nonlinear shallow water equations when the froude number exceeds a certain threshold following the method of tonelli and petti 2009 a straightforward wetting drying scheme is used for wave inundation the present model is validated against the linear theory and well documented experimental data to test its capability in simulating wave dispersion shoaling breaking refraction diffraction and run up the remaining of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations are introduced and derivations of the conservative form of the governing equations are presented section 3 describes the hybrid numerical schemes boundary condition and wave generation methods in section 4 the present model is validated against several laboratory experiments including regular waves over 1dh submerged bar and 2dh bathymetry and solitary wave propagation over a sloping beach and a conical island conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 fully dispersive boussinesq equations the fully dispersive boussinesq type equations adopted in the present model are the equations proposed by karambas and memos 2009 the depth integrated continuity equation is given by 1 η t d u x d v y 0 where η is the surface elevation d h η denotes the total water depth h is the still water depth u and v are the depth averaged velocities in the x and y directions respectively the depth averaged horizontal momentum equations are expressed as 2 u t u u x v u y g η x c i x 0 3 v t u v x v v y g η y c i y 0 ci x and ci y represent the convolution integral terms which can be expressed respectively as karambas and memos 2009 4 c i x η x x ξ 1 y ξ 2 t η x k ξ 1 ξ 2 d ξ 1 d ξ 2 5 c i y η y x ξ 1 y ξ 2 t η y k ξ 1 ξ 2 d ξ 1 d ξ 2 in which the fourier transformed kernel k x y is given by tsutsui et al 1998 6 k x y g 2 π h 2 1 r h n 1 1 n 1 n 2 r h 2 4 where r x 2 y 2 by using the convolution integral terms the boussinesq equations of karambas and memos 2009 pose no restriction to the water depth and include smaller number of terms making the numerical implementation easier however since only first order of the nonlinearity parameter is retained their equations should be treated as weakly nonlinear moreover wave current interactions i e the correct doppler shift waves in ambient currents should not be well provided by karambas and memos s equations since they do not include high order terms that can automatically provide correct doppler shift for waves as emphasized by madsen and schäffer 1998 more details about the theoretical equations are referred to karambas and memos 2009 and tsutsui et al 1998 a suitable conservative form of the governing equations is necessary when applying the hybrid numerical scheme in surface wave models to preserve the steady states of flow discontinuities especially in the case of variational topography e g liang and marche 2009 roeber et al 2010 shi et al 2012 fang et al 2016 michel dansac et al 2016 in the present model the horizontal volume flux m m x m y d u d v instead of depth averaged velocity is used as a conserved variable then eqs 1 3 become 7 η t m x x m y y 0 8 m x t x m x 2 d y m x m y d g d η x d c i x 9 m y t x m x m y d y m y 2 d g d η y d c i y similar to shi et al 2012 a surface gradient method proposed by rogers et al 2003 was used to balance the flux and slope source terms arising from the pressure terms in 8 and 9 in which case the surface gradient term can be split as 10 g d η 1 2 g η 2 2 h η g η h where x y denotes the horizontal gradient operator using eq 10 the momentum equations 8 and 9 can be rewritten as 11 m x t x m x 2 d y m x m y d x 1 2 g η 2 2 h η g η h x d c i x 12 m y t x m x m y d y m y 2 d y 1 2 g η 2 2 h η g η h y d c i y eqs 7 11 12 are the governing equations solved in the present model 3 numerical schemes 3 1 compact form of governing equations as the boussinesq equations do not automatically lead to wave breaking in shallow water several empirical breaking models have been proposed to accommodate wave breaking in the surf zone for the boussinesq equations the popular approach is to add an ad hoc dissipation sub model such as roller models e g schäffer et al 1993 madsen et al 1997 and eddy viscosity models e g zelt 1991 kennedy et al 2000 to the momentum equation however these types of breaking models contain several empirical parameters which may need to be tuned over different bathymetries on the other hand it is well known the nonlinear shallow water equations have the ability of treating bores and shock waves based on the shock capturing scheme wave breaking and swash oscillations can be easily modelled by the models based on the nonlinear shallow water equations considering the merits of the boussinesq equations and nonlinear shallow water equations the boussinesq type models with the shock capturing capability are expected fortunately the boussinesq equations are constructed by basic terms of the nonlinear shallow water equations which can be handled using the shock capturing scheme following shi et al 2012 the conservative nswe form of eqs 7 11 and 12 can be written as 13 ψ t θ ψ s where ψ and θ ψ are the conserved variables vector and the flux vector and s is the source terms 14 ψ η m x m y θ ψ m x i m y j m x m x d 1 2 g η 2 2 η h i m x m y d j m x m y d i m y m y d 1 2 g η 2 2 η h j s 0 g η h x d c i x g η h y d c i y with the conservative form the governing equations can be solved by a local riemann solver and wave breaking can be modelled by removing the convolution integral terms when the ratio of surface elevation to local water depth exceeds a certain threshold which is 0 8 suggested by tonelli and petti 2009 3 2 spatial and temporal discretization spatial discretization and time stepping are the same as in funwave tvd shi et al 2012 for spatial discretization a hybrid finite volume finite difference scheme is implemented the modified fourth order muscl tvd scheme with van leer limiter erduran et al 2005 is adopted to obtain constructed values of the conserved variables at the left and right sides of the interfaces followed by an hll approximate riemann solver harten et al 1983 to compute the numerical fluxes meanwhile the spatial derivatives are solved by the finite difference scheme the convolution integrals 4 and 5 are calculated numerically by high order accurate methods the complex simpson s rule due to the exponential decay with distances of the fourier transformed kernel of eq 6 the integral limits in 2dh situation are set as 4h instead of tsutsui et al 1998 karambas and memos 2009 furthermore using euler s transformation due to van wijngaarden press et al 1986 the alternative series in eq 6 can reach convergence with sum of 25 terms at most these strategies significantly improve the computational efficiency on the other hand our numerical tests showed that the convolutional interval can be specified as a function of the grid size resulting in a small number of numerical iterations it also coincides with klonaris et al 2013 that the integration limits do not necessarily dictate the grid spacing but the number of the summation terms replacing the integral in terms of temporal discretization the third order strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme gottlieb et al 2001 is adopted in the model the scheme is shown as 15 ψ 1 ψ n δ t θ ψ n s 1 16 ψ 2 3 4 ψ n 1 4 ψ 1 δ t θ ψ 1 s 2 17 ψ n 1 1 3 ψ n 2 3 ψ 2 δ t θ ψ 2 s n 1 where the superscript n indicates the present time level and the superscripts 1 and 2 indicate the intermediate stages in the runge kutta integration for the purpose of numerical stability an adaptive time step is implemented following the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition 18 δ t c min min δ x u i j g h i j η i j min δ y v i j g h i j η i j where c is the courant number 3 3 boundary condition and wave generation the moving boundary is handled conveniently as part of the riemann solver underlying the finite volume scheme a mirror boundary condition is applied to the muscl tvd scheme and the wave speeds of the riemann solver for a dry cell are modified following shi et al 2012 a minimum total water depth is applied to detect the end point of the moving shoreline if the calculated d is less than a specified threshold the cell is considered as a dry cell with normal flux at the interface set to zero besides general wall boundary conditions and absorbing sponge layers are implemented following kirby et al 1998 the regular and irregular wave generation follows the method of zhang et al 2014 who used generating absorbing sponge layers with a generation layer at the left boundary and absorbing layer at the right boundary of the computational field as there is no mixed space time terms in shallow water type equations linear source terms with only two influential coefficients the sponge length l s and the integrated sponge strengths ω 1 are added to the right side of the governing equations at each time step to impose surface elevations and corresponding velocities values of these two coefficients are case dependent to reproduce the target waves accurately the internal solitary wave maker is also implemented following the first order solitary wave theory with initial values of surface elevation η and velocity u defined as 19 η h 0 sech 2 3 h 0 4 h 3 x x st 20 u g h η h h 0 g h sech 2 3 h 0 4 h 3 x x st where h 0 is the incident wave height and x st is the position of initial wave crest along the propagation direction to demonstrate the dispersive property of the present model 1 dh regular wave and irregular wave propagation over the flat bed were tested first the incident wave height h 0 wave period t and water depth d of the regular wave test are 2 m 6 s and 100 m k h 10 3 fig 1 shows a snapshot of the surface elevation from the present model funwave tvd and linear wave theory for the regular wave test the grid size δ x 1 5 m was used as seen in fig 1 the present model agrees well with the linear wave theory while phase discrepancy is clearly observed from funwave tvd which indicates the dispersion is well preserved in the present model conditions of the irregular wave test are the same as that in karambas and memos 2009 three cosine waves h 1 1 7 m t 1 9 s h 2 1 9 m t 2 12 s h 3 1 0 m t 3 6 s were superposed over a constant depth of 25 m fig 2 shows a snapshot of the surface elevations from the present model and linear wave theory for the irregular wave test the grid size δ x 2 m was used as seen in fig 2 model results agree with analytical solutions well which indicate the capability of the model to simulate irregular linear wave propagation for the regular wave test we also compared the computational cost of the present model and funwave tvd both models computed regular wave propagation for 200 s with the same model setup the computation time of the present model and funwave tvd is about 32 h 42 min and 2 h 54 min respectively cpu intel e3 1225 v5 4 coreprocessors we have to confess that the computation efficiency of the present model is lower than funwave tvd mainly because the computational cost of convolution integral terms in the present model is still higher than that of the dispersive terms in funwave tvd 4 model validations with benchmark test data 4 1 regular wave propagating over a 1dh submerged bar the laboratory experiments conducted by beji and battjes 1993 and luth et al 1994 have been widely used for benchmark tests of nonlinear numerical models e g gobbi and kirby 1999 shiach and mingham 2009 ai et al 2011 ma et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 the bathymetries of their experiments have identical geometric characteristics except the length scale of luth et al 1994 is double that in beji and battjes 1993 here we chose luth et al s data for model validation because more wave gauges and an active wave absorption at the end of water flume were adopted in luth et al s experiments for simplicity we re scaled the length scale to the scale of beji and battjes 1993 and extended the boundary of both sides for applying generating absorbing sponge layers fig 3 shows the numerical setup based on luth et al s experiments the computational domain is 40 m long a flat bottom with the water depth of 0 4 m and a submerged trapezoidal bar with an upslope of 1 20 a downslope of 1 10 and a 2 m platform were implemented in the numerical tank the depth over the platform of the submerged bar is 0 1 m in luth et al s experiments 10 wave gauges were placed along the flume to record the surface elevations regular waves with the period of 2 02 s and wave amplitude of 1 0 cm were generated the case was a non breaking case and selected to test the model ability in predicting the wave shoaling and dispersion characteristics the grid size of 0 02 m was used and bottom friction was neglected in the numerical simulation time series of surface elevations for measured and predicted results at 10 gauges are demonstrated in fig 4 the model results generally agree well with the experimental data in particular the model reasonably predicted wave shoaling and amplification of bond higher harmonics as waves propagate on the slope of the bar as shown at g3 g5 a small over prediction of wave peaks can be found at g4 which was probably caused by the weak nonlinearity of the model as waves propagate into the deeper water behind the bar the higher harmonics are released as free waves the model basically captured the processes but with large errors as shown at g6 g8 the large discrepancies between model and data may be induced by the poor nonlinear characteristics of the model 4 2 regular wave propagation over a 2dh bathymetry in order to test the model s ability in reproducing wave refraction and diffraction over a 2dh bathymetry the present model was applied to simulate the experimental cases conducted by berkhoff et al 1982 the corresponding experimental layout is presented in fig 5 an elliptic shoal is situated over a 1 50 plane beach and the slope is oriented at an angle of 20 the minimum depth at the east boundary was set to 0 1 m in the simulation monochromatic waves with wave period t 1 s and incident wave height h 0 4 64 cm were generated at the west boundary and the sponge layer was set at the east boundary by using the method of generating absorbing sponge layers zhang et al 2014 wall boundary conditions were set at the north and south boundaries based on the experimental setup grid sizes δ x δ y 0 03 m were used and bottom friction was neglected in the numerical simulation the total simulation time is 40 s fig 6 shows the comparison of relative wave height h h 0 between the experimental data and the numerical results along eight transections s1 s8 as indicated in fig 5 the last five wave cycles were used to estimate the wave height due to wave refraction and diffraction around the shoal as seen from the experimental data of s3 s5 wave focusing occurs behind the shoal with a maximum wave height of approximately 2 2 times larger than the incident wave height in general the model predicted wave refraction and diffraction processes in good agreement with the data the model under predicted the peak wave height at s3 and slightly over predicted the wave height at s4 4 3 solitary wave run up on a beach in the present model wave breaking is modelled by the shock capturing method and the moving boundary is handled conveniently as part of the riemann solver underlying the finite volume scheme to examine the ability of the present model in predicting wave breaking and moving shoreline solitary wave run up on a sloping beach was modelled experiments of synolakis 1986 were adopted for model validation fig 7 shows the numerical setup based on synolakis s experiments the internal solitary wave maker was implemented with initial crest at 18 25 h 0 from the initial shoreline the slope of the beach was set to 1 19 85 both non breaking and breaking solitary waves were simulated the constant water depth h 0 is 100 m and bottom friction was neglected in both cases for the non breaking wave case a solitary wave with the relative amplitude h 0 h 0 0 019 was tested using the grid size δ x 5 m the computed free surface profiles at different non dimensional times were compared to experimental data as shown in fig 8 due to the weak nonlinearity of non breaking solitary wave simulated results show good agreement to the experimental data except the snapshot at t g h 0 1 2 70 i e fig 8 j which shows a slight overestimate of run down at the shoreline fig 9 compares the modelled time series of surface elevation with the non linear theoretical solutions at two wave gauges located at x h 0 9 95 and x h 0 0 25 respectively the incident and reflected waves are shown as two separated humps at the first wave gauge fig 9 a while the two waves collide and create one corresponding hump with a temporary dry period at the second wave gauge near the initial shoreline during the backwash fig 9 b the numerical results agree well with the analytical solutions for the breaking wave case a solitary wave with the relative amplitude h 0 h 0 0 28 was tested using the grid size δ x 5 m the computed free surface profiles at different non dimensional times are compared to experimental data as shown in fig 10 the solitary wave breaks twice one happens during the run up around t g h 0 1 2 35 fig 10 c and the other occurs during the backwash around t g h 0 1 2 65 fig 10 i due to the weak nonlinearity of the governing equations the model over predicted the wave crest of the large solitary wave before the first breaking as shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 b however the shock capturing scheme implemented in the present model which allows the model to switch boussinesq equations to nonlinear shallow water equations seems to correct the model performance in which case the wave breaking and subsequent run up down are predicted well as seen in the rest of the comparisons of fig 10 in addition small oscillations of numerical results are observed in fig 10 h and fig 10 i since breaking also occurs during the backwash we attribute these oscillations to the numerical instability caused by sharply deactivating or reactivating dispersive terms as reported in fang et al 2016 who added a lower limit to the criterion of tonelli and petti 2009 to avoid the instability but it seems the oscillations do not affect the performance of the present model much in this case 4 4 solitary wave run up on a conical island briggs et al 1995 conducted a series of laboratory experiments for solitary wave propagations around a conical island the schematic layout of the briggs et al s experiments is shown in fig 11 the constant water depth is 0 32 m and the slope of the conical island is 1 4 three solitary waves with incident wave heights h 0 0 014 m case a 0 029 m case b and 0 058 m case c were generated respectively from the west side of the conical island water surface elevations were recorded by several wave gauges around the island and the measured data have been used for validations in many other studies e g lynett et al 2002 zijlema et al 2011 ai and jin 2012 cui et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 in the present study the measured data at four gauges were selected for model validation the locations of these wave gauges are denoted in fig 11 gauge 6 is located right above the toe of the island and encounters the wave firstly gauges 9 16 and 22 stand near the initial shoreline in which gauge 9 is on the frontage gauge 16 is on the right side and gauge 22 is on the lee side of the island in numerical simulation the grid size δ x δ y 0 05 m was employed and bottom friction was neglected the comparisons of predicted and measured time series of surface elevations at four gauges are shown in fig 12 for cases a b and c the overall agreement is satisfied the model overestimates the wave crests at gauge 9 for all cases probably due to the weakly nonlinear property in addition surface elevations after wave crests are underestimated by the model at all gauges this mismatch in model data comparisons has also been noticed by other authors e g briggs et al 1995 kânoğlu and synolakis 1998 and fuhrman and madsen 2008 who explained that the water leakage appeared on the rear side of the solitary wave and the wave maker cannot generate a precise solitary wave in the experiments the measured and computed maximum run up distribution around the conical island are presented in fig 13 it can be seen that the model reasonably predicts the maximum run ups including the increase in maximum run ups at the lee side of the island 5 conclusion in this paper a 2dh fully dispersive weakly nonlinear boussinesq type wave model was developed based on a hybrid tvd type scheme the fully dispersive boussinesq equations proposed by karambas and memos 2009 which include only one dispersion term expressed through convolution integrals in the momentum equation were adopted a well balanced compact form of the equations was derived to facilitate the hybrid finite difference finite volume scheme flux terms were computed by the muscl tvd scheme up to the fourth order accuracy within the riemann solver the third order strong stability preserving ssp runge kutta scheme was used for time stepping the convolution integral terms were estimated by the numerical evaluation and the spatial derivative terms were computed by the finite difference scheme based on the hybrid scheme wave breaking can be treated as shock waves by switching the boussinesq equations to nonlinear shallow water equations when the ratio of surface elevation to local water depth exceeds a certain threshold validated with analytical solutions and several laboratory experiments the present model demonstrates the capability of maintaining the dispersive property and simulating wave transformations and run ups over 1dh and 2dh bathymetries in particular the model shows reasonable accuracy after wave breaking probably due to the shock capturing scheme which can introduce the merits of nonlinear shallow water equations to a weakly nonlinear boussinesq

23983,jra55 do the new atmospheric dataset for driving ocean sea ice models based on the japanese 55 year atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 has been recently proffered for use in future ocean sea ice hindcast simulations including those under the ocean model intercomparison project omip umbrella thereby replacing the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core interannual forcing dataset the jra55 do dataset contains numerous and substantial improvements over the existing core dataset including refined resolution self consistency of forcing fields and duration however one feature of core that is not available in jra55 do is the normal year forcing core nyf a single repeating annual cycle of all forcing fields necessary to run an ocean sea ice model without imposed interannual variability here we propose a process for obtaining and evaluating repeat year forcing ryf datasets based on the jra55 do dataset for driving ocean sea ice models this process involves the identification of 12 month periods not necessarily a single calendar year that are most neutral in terms of major climate modes of variability three candidate periods are identified and evaluated with three global ocean sea ice models we find that the largest differences between the simulations arise from model biases indicating the ultimate choice of the candidate repeat year is not critical by referencing to the respective core nyf simulations in an attempt to account for model bias we find the differences between the three ryf periods to be generally consistent across the models except for an anthropogenic warming signal for later candidate years based on the analysis presented here we find all three candidate periods to be suitable for use as ryf datasets subject to application and we recommend the period from 1st may 1990 to 30th april 1991 to be the best available ryf dataset for driving ocean sea ice models keywords jra55 do repeat year forcing core nyf 1 introduction tsujino et al 2018 recently presented jra55 do a new atmospheric dataset for driving ocean sea ice models that is based on the japanese 55 year atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 jra55 do is proffered as the new standard for forcing global ocean sea ice models with the intention that it be adopted for future ocean sea ice hindcast simulations including those of the ocean model intercomparison project omip griffies et al 2016 thereby replacing the coordinated ocean ice reference experiment interannual forcing core iaf griffies et al 2009 dataset developed by large and yeager 2004 2009 jra55 do has numerous major improvements over the core iaf forcing including refined spatial and temporal resolutions greater self consistency amongst the forcing fields and a development workflow that enables it to be continually updated in near real time so that it extends from 1958 to the present such improvements are necessary steps to ensure the continued efforts in ocean sea ice model development are complemented and importantly not undermined by appropriate high quality forcing sets and establishes jra55 do as the state of the art dataset for forcing global ocean sea ice models an important supplement to the core iaf dataset has been the normal year forcing core nyf large and yeager 2004 the core nyf consists of a synthetically constructed single annual cycle of all forcing fields necessary to run an ocean sea ice model table 1 the core nyf was designed with the intention that its resulting fluxes are as close as possible to the observed climatological fluxes so that when the core nyf is applied repeatedly forced interannual variability is eliminated and the mean model solution is representative of the observed climatological mean the core nyf has proved to be scientifically useful for the purposes of model spin up towards an equilibrated climatologically meaningful ocean state driving control simulations in perturbation experiments and sensitivity studies evaluating internal variability on interannual and longer timescales and estimating model drift in core simulations however unlike the core based forcing datasets a jra55 do based repeat year forcing has not been developed this is our objective here large and yeager 2004 state that the core nyf was developed to satisfy where practical six specific criteria 1 the forcing infrastructure remains unaltered between core iaf and core nyf products with the core nyf datasets restricted to four times daily atmospheric state data daily incoming shortwave and longwave radiation monthly precipitation and daily sea ice concentration the latter for ocean only models 2 the seasonal cycle is retained 3 the realistic propagation of high frequency forcing weather over the oceans throughout the core nyf is retained 4 the climatological average fluxes obtained from coupling the core nyf to observed sst are as close as possible to the observed climatological fluxes so that the mean model state is meaningful 5 there is a smooth transition from december of the year to its beginning in january so that the year can be repeated without initiating spurious transients 6 the core nyf is not overly weighted to any individual year and hence to the atmospheric state of that year the first criterion while important for running ocean sea ice model comparisons between the core nyf and core iaf is technical and trivial the second criterion simply excludes the use of annual averages for forcing fields while the third requires the temporal resolution of core nyf be sufficient to represent and coherently propagate synoptic variability clearly the simplest way to meet these first three criteria would be to select a single year of forcing from the core iaf however as noted by large and yeager 2004 this approach would not satisfy the criteria 4 and 6 even if there is some blending to satisfy criterion 5 therefore a spectral averaging technique was employed to synthetically generate the atmospheric state air temperature winds specific humidity fields of core nyf from those of the ncep ncar reanalysis product kalnay et al 1996 this spectral approach detailed in large and yeager 2004 is complicated and difficult to perform and to repeat in essence the atmospheric state for 43 years 1958 2000 of the 6 hourly ncep ncar product and observed monthly sea surface temperatures was used to construct a timeseries of pseudo wind stresses and surface heat fluxes these pseudo terms were fourier transformed and their spectra obtained these spectra represent the variability at specific frequencies throughout the 43 year record in this space the phases of the spectra correspond to the temporal location of the variability thus for given a set of phases specific frequencies i e greater than biennial of the spectra can then be used to generate surface stress and flux fields that preserve the intra annular variability of the original record the exercise then became one of obtaining a set of realistic phases for this the post 1983 period of the ncep ncar product was inspected to find the most moderate year in terms the north atlantic oscillation north pacific index el niño southern oscillation and antarctic oscillation indices this inspection revealed the calendar year 1995 to be perhaps the most moderate year of the record to satisfy criterion 5 the phases of 1995 were modified to give a smooth transition from december back to january that is the phases between 15 and 31 december became linear combinations of those from 1994 and 1995 with weightings linearly ramping between 0 and 1 these phases were then populated with the spectra of frequencies greater than biennial returning atmospheric state fields that retained the variability characteristics of the 1958 2000 ncep ncar record a consequence of employing the phases of 1995 was that the high frequency and high variability events i e storms will resemble those of 1995 but with magnitudes representative of all storms in the full 43 year record thereby satisfying criterion 6 in addition to the spectrally generated 6 hourly atmospheric state fields the core nyf is also comprised of daily longwave and shortwave radiation monthly liquid and solid precipitation and continental runoff fields which are derived from several different observational based products the core nyf radiation fields are daily climatologies of the goddard institute for space studies international satellite cloud climatology project radiative flux profile dataset giss isccp fd zhang et al 2004 these radiation fields have no diurnal cycle and are not able to represent high frequency variability associated with for instance cloud coverage or air temperature anomalies the precipitation fields of core nyf are monthly averages of a latitudinally blended estimate from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 1997 climate prediction centre merged analysis of precipitation cmap xie and arkin 1996 and the serreze products as detailed by serreze and hurst 2000 and yang 1999 as they are monthly averages the precipitation fields of core nyf are not able to reflect the propagation of high frequency weather events represented in the atmospheric state runoff in core nyf is also monthly at 1 spatial resolution and derived from the dai climatology products as detailed by dai and trenberth 2002 and dai et al 2009 the construction of the core nyf reflects its initial intended purpose as well as the standard practices resolutions and uses of global ocean sea ice models and the computing capabilities of the early 2000s needless to say the state of global ocean sea ice modelling has progressed since the inception of core nyf and routinely extends into the mesoscale and beyond model improvements in resolutions dynamics and parameterisations are the result of substantial collaborative effort and investment and it is vital that these improvements are not undermined by existing aspects and elements of the system including the imposed forcing product employed to drive the model that said it is important that any modification to the forcing protocols be approached with careful and deliberate forethought as there is great scientific value in the continued use of a given forcing product especially in the interests of monitoring for spurious changes in model behaviour that may arise from ongoing modelling and computational developments compared to the early 2000s there is presently a greater need for versatility on the part of the forcing product for a global ocean sea ice model modelling groups routinely run simulations at a hierarchy of resolutions with a common forcing product e g barnier et al 2014 kiss et al 2019 for the highest resolution simulations usually the flagship simulations of a given modelling group the ability of a forcing product to realistically energise the mesoscales can be arguably more important than it having an annually balanced set of fluxes especially considering the unlikelihood that these high resolution simulations will even be run to a global equilibrium concurrently the lower resolution simulations will typically be run for extended durations in which case it is preferable to have a forcing set that is climatologically representative and close to being globally and annually flux balanced thereby minimising long term model drifts presented with this broadened range of intended purposes it is a considerable challenge to develop an ryf product that is able to satisfy all purposes therefore requiring that compromises are made irrespective of the intended purpose it is desirable that the forcing dataset be of the highest quality available indeed the new jra55 do datasets are of a higher quality than the existing core datasets based simply on their substantially higher spatial and temporal resolutions and the fact that the jra55 do forcing fields are self consistent regardless of whether driven by interannual or repeated year forcing datasets it has become common practice for modern global ocean sea ice simulations to be initialised from a standard ocean state usually a climatological hydrography at rest and run for a spin up period of undetermined duration typically subject to computational resources the ill defined duration of this spin up period varies from years to millennia depending on the model and dynamics of interest for instance studies that examine surface and or ventilated thermocline dynamics will generally employ a shorter spin up than those concerned with abyssal processes and or meridional overturning recently formalised methodologies for multi century simulations reflect these practices and recognise the ambiguity of the spin up duration and accept that full equilibrium is not required for meaningful science e g danabasoglu et al 2014 griffies et al 2014 2016 indeed the physical relevance of a truly equilibrated global ocean sea ice model is unclear such a state will be model and forcing dependent and the real ocean sea ice system itself or indeed its forcing is certainly not equilibrated relaxing the requirement of an equilibrated ocean sea ice state for meaningful science has two primary consequences i the forcing dataset is no longer required to be exactly flux balanced globally and or annually and ii there is a greater need to quantify the ongoing behaviours and drifts of a given simulation that is control simulations run in parallel become essential for de trending and or diagnosing the dynamical responses to forcing or configuration changes for this purpose there remains great scientific utility in a high quality control forcing product that is suitable for use with the highest resolution global ocean sea ice simulations so considering that the broadened range of intended purposes for a new ryf product extends into the mesoscale and beyond and the relaxed requirement of hydrographic equilibrium it makes sense to give more weight to the forcing resolution and dynamical integrity of a candidate ryf dataset than to its degree of flux balance relaxing the requirement that a forcing dataset is flux balanced raises an obvious question what is a reasonable level of flux imbalance quantifying the imbalance of a given forcing dataset is challenging as it is model and parameterisation dependent one can diagnose the imbalance for a specific model configuration through the analysis of temperature salinity drifts and or trends however these will be different for different models and configurations e g see fig 7 and figures 3 of griffies et al 2009 2014 alternatively bounds on annual or longer imbalances can be obtained from timeseries of hydrographic observations although these bounds would likely be skewed by anthropogenic influences perhaps a more pragmatic definition of not reasonable imbalance can be found in the climatological relevance of the simulated ocean sea ice state for example if the forcing imbalance is such that the simulated arctic becomes ice free or that simulated north atlantic deep water becomes denser than simulated antarctic bottom water it should be considered an unreasonable imbalance the release of the jra55 do forcing dataset provides an opportunity to reconsider the protocols and strategies of repeat year forcing simulations in the interests of maintaining the fidelity of the mesoscale the spatial and temporal resolution of all fields of the jra55 do repeated year forcing should remain as high as possible and these fields should also be as self consistent as possible as per the jra55 do itself in fact any modification or manipulation of the jra55 do forcing product should be avoided so as to maintain the physical integrity of the forcing product and its simplicity this includes the transition period when the forcing year repeats itself with these factors in mind we detail the criteria for the repeat year forcing to be developed from the jra55 do product 1 the repeated year forcing is an unaltered subset of the interannually varying jra55 do product 2 the full seasonal cycle is retained in the repeated year 3 the realistic propagation of high frequency forcing weather is retained including dynamical consistency between the forcing fields 4 the transition period should be as smooth as possible to minimise i the disturbances arising from the step change in forcing between the end of year and beginning of year and ii the violation of criterion 3 5 the repeated year should be quasi climatological with neutral values for major climate indices 6 the repeated year should be both recent post 1970s so as to be in the era of satellite based observations of sea surface temperature but not too recent so as to minimise any contamination by anthropogenic warming it follows that a well chosen 12 month period taken directly from the jra55 do product could meet these criteria and serve as the repeat year forcing ryf for jra55 do our approach for developing the ryf abandons criterion 4 of large and yeager 2004 which requires that the mean model solution resulting from core nyf represents the mean climatological state the mean model solution resulting from any given 12 month period of the jra55 do will not reflect observed climatology therefore any comparison between the ryf model solution and that resulting from the interannually variable jra55 do cannot be achieved in a climatologically meaningful way indeed the observed ocean sea ice climatology itself as uncertain as it is is both transient and is the integrated result of its dynamics over its entire forcing history employing such an uncertain moving target as a metric of measure for idealised ocean sea ice simulations is of little scientific value and any success by this method will certainly not be due to the accurate representation of the dynamical system or its forcing by a given model irrespective of parameter tuning or optimisation efforts undertaken within that model so rather than attempting to achieve a simulated climatology that is close to that observed or modelled with interannually varying forcing the mean model solution of the ryf should be considered as an idealised reference ocean sea ice state that is specific to that model and its configurations furthermore the ryf state can be employed for scientifically meaningful purposes such as model intercomparisons configuration parameterisation sensitivity studies and perturbation experiments here we present a procedure for selecting the 12 month period of the jra55 do for use as the repeat year forcing three candidate periods are identified section 2 1 and compared section 2 2 the three ryf candidate periods as well as the existing core nyf are used to run global ocean sea ice models from three different modelling groups section 3 these simulations are first compared with hydrographic observations followed by a comparison of the ryf simulations with their respective core nyf simulations section 3 1 these comparisons focus on the large scale global zonally averaged and surface metrics further analysis compares their mixed layer depths sea ice fields circulations and transports sections 3 2 4 we then present our conclusions and recommendations section 4 2 repeat year forcing for jra55 do 2 1 identifying ryf periods criteria 1 3 will be satisfied by taking a 12 month period directly from the jra55 do record with no modifications or blending of the transition period to satisfy criterion 4 as objectively as possible we analyse the 1958 2016 period of the jra55 do record to identify the day of the year that has the least variability in the forcing set we compute the zonal standard deviations for each day of the year excluding february 29 for 10 m air temperature sea level pressure slp 10 m wind speed long and shortwave radiations and total precipitation liquid and solid all fields exhibit seasonal and latitudinal distributions to their daily variabilities fig 1 for the air temperature slp wind speed and longwave radiation fields the variability tends to increase with latitude and to peak during winter fig 1a d shortwave radiation variability tends to be largest in the tropics and peak during summer fig 1e precipitation variability is high near the equator and during autumn at 30 n and 30 s presumably reflecting the locations of the intertropical convergence zone and stormtracks fig 1f given the seasonality and latitudinal distributions of zonal standard deviations of the forcing fields the ideal day of the year for the transition period is not obvious and we therefore look to specific regions that are known to influence model simulations we focus our analysis on regions of dense water formation where ocean convection occurs that is sensitive to sudden changes in forcing conditions e g snow et al 2016 garcia quintana et al 2019 our focus on regions of dense water formation does not imply that the ryf is being developed specifically for studies of the meridional overturning circulation instead we aim to minimise long term model temperature drift which is dominated by deep abyssal ocean adjustments for this reason we seek to minimise the impact of the transition day upon regions that set the upstream conditions of deep watermasses fig 2 shows the average standard deviations for the north atlantic and weddell sea regions compared with the global average for 10 m air temperature wind speed long and shortwave radiation and total precipitation the calculated variabilities of these high latitude regions exhibit seasonal cycles that peaks in winter except in the case of shortwave radiation which obviously peaks in summer fig 2 the global average of the variabilities is less seasonal our aim now is to select the transition day to balance the anti phase seasonality of the hemispheres the transition day should be close to an equinox to avoid the high latitude variability evident in many of the forcing fields the standard deviation of total precipitation fig 2f over the north atlantic is a minimum approximately one month after the northern hemisphere vernal equinox furthermore may is a time of minimal dense water formation and ocean convection which both peak during winter for these reasons we propose may 1 dashed line in fig 2 as a good transition day of year to begin repeat year forcing we next look for forcing years that best satisfy criteria 5 and 6 above we plot timeseries of the 12 month running means of the southern oscillation index soi north atlantic oscillation nao index and southern annular mode sam index each calculated directly from the jra55 do record in fig 3 the decision to depict these three specific climate indices here whilst subjective is an effort to demonstrate that the major modes of climate variability are represented in our identification of candidate ryf periods additional major modes of variability exist such as the el niño southern oscillation enso or the arctic oscillation ao however their phases are well correlated with the soi and nao indices respectively 1 1 the 1980 2016 monthly soi and niño 3 4 anomaly index have a correlation of 0 70 and the nao and ao indices have a correlation of 0 64 global climate observing system working group on surface pressure https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp the climate indices selected are based on sea level pressure anomalies see appendix and are obtained directly from the jra55 do record other major climate modes such as the enso are calculated from sea surface temperature anomalies which are not part of jra55 do product we also plot the global average 10 m atmospheric temperature from the jra55 do record black line highlighting the anthropogenic warming signal and the average soi nao and sam of the core nyf dashed lines it is apparent from this figure that there are few years in which all 3 of the selected climate indices are close to their mean values a qualitative comparison to the climate indices identifies 3 candidate periods that are the most climatically neutral 1984 85 1990 91 and 2003 04 which are referred to as ryf8485 ryf9091 and ryf0304 respectively of these ryf8485 has the advantage of occurring early in the record with the lowest global temperature but both the nao and sam are more negative than the other candidate years ryf0304 has the smallest anomaly across all the modes but the global surface air temperature in this year is almost 0 5 c higher than in ryf8485 ryf9091 may be a good compromise but it occurs during a year in which the sam transitions from positive to negative and the change of the nao is the largest of the three candidate years note that the sam indices of all three candidate years are more neutral than that of core nyf dashed blue line with these candidate years in mind we revisit criterion 4 and examine the sudden changes in forcing associated with the transition day in regions of dense water formation for each candidate year fig 4 plots the 10 m air temperature longwave radiation precipitation and wind speed averaged over the north atlantic a d and weddell sea e h regions as 72 h timeseries spanning the annual transition e g noon april 29 to noon may 2 for the ryf periods and noon december 30 to noon january 2 for core nyf as well as the differences in the regional means either side of the transition i p table 2 to demonstrate the advantages of shifting the transition to april 30 may 1 we also include the december 31 january 1 transitions of the two calendar years that form each of the three ryf candidate periods e g 1984 1985 for ryf8485 etc compare the relative magnitudes of the forcing discontinuities at the transition day between the ryf and calendar years indicated by the a h solid and dashed dotted lines respectively and the i p circles and plusses crosses respectively for the north atlantic region the april 30 may 1 transition of ryf8485 exhibits an obvious reduced discontinuity about the transition day compared to the december 31 january 1 transitions of the 1984 and 1985 calendar years for ryf9091 and ryf0304 the change in discontinuity is less obvious these relatively smoother transitions of the ryf8485 as compared to its calendar years are to be expected given the winter maximum in variability shown in figs 1 and 2 for the weddell sea region shifting the transition day from january 1 to may 1 increases the discontinuity in forcing this increase in the forcing discontinuity for the ryf periods is to expected given the summer minimum in variability shown in figs 1 and 2 may is however not a time of substantial dense water formation in the weddell sea so these abrupt changes are unlikely to effect bottom water production thus the increased discontinuity of surface forcing in the weddell sea region for may 1 transition day is a compromise that we make for the smoothed transition evident in the north atlantic region an overall comparison of the forcing discontinuities of the three ryf periods table 2 indicates the ryf8485 exhibits the smallest discontinuity in forcing and ryf9091 the largest 2 2 comparison of ryf periods here we compare several climate fields from the three candidate periods identified from the jra55 do record as well as those from the core nyf this comparison will inform our initial expectation and eventual interpretation of the ocean sea ice simulations forced with the different ryf periods fig 5 shows latitudinal distributions of the mean 10 m atmospheric temperature longwave radiation total precipitation sea level pressure slp wind speed and wind stress curl calculated assuming no ocean surface velocity and constant drag coefficient for each of the ryf periods presented as anomalies relative to the 1978 2016 mean of jra55 do the difference between the core nyf and 1978 2016 mean of jra55 do is included for reference note that the fields of core nyf are developed to represent the mean states of different reanalysis and climatological products table 1 so that the core nyf differences relative to the mean state of jra55 do reflect differences in the mean states of jra55 do and the core development products therefore the focus for these anomaly comparisons should be on the relative magnitudes and distributions of the ryf anomalies and the core nyf differences rather than their proximity to the jra55 do mean the 10 m temperature and longwave radiation fields fig 5a b exhibit a general warming trends from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 that are consistent with the mean global atmospheric temperature trend in fig 3 the zonal averages of the anomalies of 10 m temperature and longwave radiation for each ryf period are consistent in sign such that latitudes with a cool temperature anomaly also have a negative longwave radiation anomaly the distributions of precipitation anomalies are relatively less coherent with the exception of equatorial and tropical signals and without an obvious trend across the ryf years fig 5c ryf8485 exhibits a negative anomaly in equatorial precipitation and a positive anomaly over the southern tropics both ryf9091 and ryf0304 have an increased precipitation over the equatorial latitudes and in the case of ryf9091 a negative precipitation anomaly over the southern tropics the total precipitation in the core nyf is smaller than that of the 1978 2016 mean of jra55 do this is likely because jra55 do precipitation has been enhanced by approximately 2 1 to achieve a global surface fresh water flux balance with evaporation and runoff after it was adjusted with respect to the precipitation of core considering these precipitation differences we can expect the ryf periods to result in a less salty ocean surface relative to the core nyf in the absence of any surface salinity restoring evaporation differences and precipitation adjustments the zonally averaged slp and wind speed anomalies of the ryf periods are small between 60 s and 60 n the anomalies are less than 1hpa and 0 2 m s respectively with the exception of weaker southern ocean westerlies in ryf8485 consistent with a negative sam index fig 5d e the magnitudes of the differences between the core nyf and 1978 2016 mean of jra55 do for slp and wind speed are much larger than the anomalies of the ryf periods especially southward of 60 s the wind stress curl anomaly distributions calculated assuming no ocean surface velocity and constant drag coefficient can offer insight into the expected differences in ekman transport including wind driven up downwelling fig 5f positive negative wind stress curl anomalies in the northern southern hemisphere correspond to enhanced wind driven upwelling whilst the zonally averaged wind stress curl anomaly tends to be noisy it is clear that the core nyf differences exhibit substantially more noise and meridional variability than that of the ryf period anomalies the standard deviation of the mean wind stress curl for core nyf is 1 7 1 0 8 n m 3 compared with 6 4 1 0 9 4 0 1 0 9 and 4 8 1 0 9 n m 3 for the ryf8485 ryf9091 and ryf0304 respectively this increased noise in the core nyf wind stress curl can be attributed to the spectral method for populating the core nyf wind field large and yeager 2004 there is evidence of a positive anomaly between 50 70 s in the ryf8485 suggesting a reduction in the wind driven upwelling of the southern ocean apart from the increased noise in core nyf differences and the southern ocean anomaly in ryf8485 the wind stress curl anomalies do not give clear indications for global ekman velocity differences between ryf periods it is obvious that a substantial advantage of the jra55 do over the core nyf is its self consistency and increased resolution an example of this is presented in fig 6 which compares snapshots of slp wind speed precipitation and shortwave radiation from one of the ryf periods ryf8485 and core nyf these snapshots are taken at a time when a major atlantic hurricane is making landfall in the usa diana crossed the carolina s coastlines on 12 september 1984 for jra55 do and opal crossed the florida coastline near pensacola on 4 october 1995 for core nyf 2 2 while the atmospheric state of core nyf is a spectral reconstruction of the ncep ncar reanalysis the phases needed to come from a single moderate year of the record for which 1995 was chosen meaning the storm patterns of core nyf tend to follow those of 1995 see large and yeager 2004 for more details hurricane diana along with other synoptic and diurnal events are coherent in all fields of the ryf for example the strong precipitation events evident in the eastern pacific fig 6e have a discernible signal in both wind speed and shortwave radiation for core nyf however these fields are constructed independently from different reanalysis and monthly daily climatological products and therefore bear no relationship with one another comparisons of the forcing fields of the candidate ryf periods reveal differences in the fields but they do not provide a clear indication of which of these periods is best suited for extended duration ocean sea ice simulations we now look to test each of these ryf periods with several global ocean sea ice models to evaluate the biases and forcing issues that may arise 3 evaluation of candidate ryf years in access om2 ncar and mri gondola 100 models the three candidate ryf periods identified from the jra 55 climate record ryf8485 ryf9091 and ryf0304 are evaluated in 500 year long spin up simulations using three models access om2 ncar and mri gondola 100 analysis of equivalent core nyf simulations with the three models is also presented for reference these simulations are compared by their t s characteristics bulk circulations and sea ice representations for ease of presentation we frame the comparison of the simulations by way of their forcings and models differences arising from different forcings are referred to as inter forcing differences and differences arising from different models are referred to as inter model differences see fig 7a the inter model differences include model biases this distinction between inter forcing and inter model differences is important given that our objective here is to evaluate the inter forcing differences of the candidate ryf periods each simulation including those with core nyf begins with a hydrographic initial condition developed from world ocean atlas 2013 woa13 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 using january climatology above 1500 m and boreal winter climatology for the deep ocean sea surface salinity is restored to a condition developed from monthly woa13 data and with a piston velocity of 50m over one year 300 days for access om2 access om2 the australian community climate and earth system simulator access suite includes global ocean sea ice model configurations with a hierarchy of horizontal resolutions nominally 1 0 25 and 0 1 grid spacings developed by the consortium for ocean sea ice modelling in australia cosima see kiss et al 2019 access om2 is the 1 global ocean sea ice model which will be used in the access climate model access cm2 being developed for cmip6 the access om2 global ocean sea ice model uses the modular ocean model version 5 1 mom5 1 griffies 2012 with a z generalised vertical coordinate the community ice code version 5 cice5 hunke et al 2015 a file based atmosphere known as yatm and coupled with oasis3 mct the nominally 1 horizontal resolution uses a mercator grid in the southern hemisphere to 65 s with smooth latitudinal compression extending the domain to 78 s and a tripolar arctic with 50 vertical levels and a minimum vertical grid length of 2 3 m vertical grid kds50 from stewart et al 2017 the access om2 is initialised with a 2 5m thick sea ice field in regions poleward of 70 n and 60 s where the sea surface temperature is less than 1 c above freezing ncar the ncar contribution uses the community earth system model version 2 cesm2 framework with its ocean and sea ice components as the only active models specifically these components are the parallel ocean program version 2 pop2 smith et al 2010 and the cice5 sea ice model version 5 1 2 hunke et al 2015 respectively pop2 is a level coordinate model with a displaced north pole grid the horizontal resolution is nominal 1 with increased meridional resolution of 0 27 near the equator there are 60 vertical levels monotonically increasing from 10 m in the upper ocean to 250 m in the deep ocean the pop2 version used in this study is similar to the one used in previous core studies danabasoglu et al 2014 2016 see also danabasoglu et al 2012 for further details however there are a few new features that include a new parameterisation for mixing effects in estuaries increased mesoscale eddy diffusivities at depth use of salinity dependent freezing point together with the sea ice model a new langmuir mixing parameterisation and a new time filtering scheme based on an adaption of the robert filter to enable sub diurnal coupling of the ocean model danabasoglu et al 2020 cice5 1 2 initialised with a sea ice state from a previous simulation incorporates a mushy layer thermodynamics approach turner and hunke 2015 in which the vertical profile of salinity within the ice is prognostic the sea ice vertical resolution in the model has been enhanced from four layers in its previous versions to eight layers in order to better resolve the salinity and temperature profiles additionally the snow model now resolves three layers to represent the vertical temperature profile the melt pond parameterisation has also been updated hunke et al 2013 and now accounts for the fact that ponds preferentially form on undeformed sea ice mri gondola 100 mri gondola 100 is the ocean sea ice component of the earth system model developed for cmip6 in meteorological research institute japan meteorological agency mri esm2 yukimoto et al 2019 the model domain extends from 78 5 s to 90 n with a murray s 1996 tripolar grid over the arctic ocean north of 64 n the horizontal resolution is 1 in longitude and 0 5 in latitude with refinement to 0 3 from 10 s to 10 n this model has 60 layers in vertical whose thickness ranges from 2 m for the top layer to 700 m for the bottom layer with an additional bottom boundary layer of 50 m thickness around antarctica and iceland nakano and suginohara 2002 the sea ice model is initialised by a january distribution of a preliminary experiment refer to yukimoto et al 2019 and urakawa et al 2020 for further details 3 1 t s characteristics comparison with woa13 considering the model resolution and intended purpose our comparison of the t s properties of the simulations focusses on differences in global depth and zonally averages and surface distributions other t s differences exist but these tend to be localised or region specific the timeseries of globally averaged potential temperature sea surface temperature sst salinity anomaly and sea surface salinity sss fig 7 show relatively small inter forcing differences compared to inter model differences here the inter model differences can be due to either different model configurations e g differences in model maximum depths or land sea masks or different model dynamics parameterisations the extent to which the different model configurations influence the inter model differences is apparent at initialisation for the global mean temperature the inter model difference at initialisation is relatively small 0 05 c and broadens over time suggesting that the inter model differences are dominated by model dynamics parameterisations in terms of the inter forcing differences the relative trends of ryf8485 and ryf9091 are consistent across the three models with ryf8485 0 05 c cooler than ryf9091 by year 500 and all simulations cooling by 0 01 0 04 c between years 400 and 500 the behaviour of ryf0304 is different between the three models and exhibits centennial variability in its trend indicative of a large scale watermass adjustment to the ryf0304 forcing the core nyf simulations track with ryf8485 in access om2 and mri gondola 100 in ncar the core nyf is cooler than all ryf simulations the globally averaged sst for all simulations initially experience a rapid adjustment in the first decade and subsequently remain steady the globally averaged sst for the ncar and mri gondola 100 models are in good agreement with each other with the access om2 simulations approximately 0 3 c cooler for the inter forcing differences the ryf8485 simulations tend to be coldest with the ryf0304 simulations as the warmest the globally averaged salinity anomaly global mean salinity minus initial global mean salinity evaluates the degree to which the salinity freshwater fluxes are balanced for the access om2 and mri gondola 100 simulations there is negligible drift in the global mean salinity after an initial adjustment period of a few decades the ncar simulations exhibit a global freshening trend of approximately 10 4 psu century the globally averaged sss tends to increase slightly throughout the simulations and inter model differences are larger than the inter forcing differences the ryf8485 simulations exhibit the freshest globally averaged sss with the ryf0304 being the saltiest the vertical structure of the globally averaged potential temperature trends can be examined with time series of horizontally averaged temperature anomalies from woa13 fig 8 note that unlike core nyf which is developed to be representative of climatological forcing the ryf periods are specific years of the jra55 do record and are thereby not expected to reproduce the observed hydrographic climatology nevertheless the inter model differences dominate the inter forcing differences with the pattern of temperature anomalies of the ryf periods closely resembling those of their respective core nyf case for each model all simulations exhibit a general warming of the upper 1000 m and cooling beneath this with a 200 year delayed onset of deep cooling in the case of mri gondola 100 the relative strengths of the deep cooling trends reflect the trends of the globally averaged temperatures compare figs 7a 8 indicating the long term evolution of the latter is a thermal adjustment of the deep ocean the patterns and structure of the trends in each model are consistent across the three ryf periods and core nyf and different to those of the other models that is the inter forcing differences are small compared with the inter model differences the warming signal in the upper 1000 m appears weakest for ryf8485 and strongest for ryf0304 with core nyf between ryf8485 and ryf9091 comparing equivalent time series of horizontally averaged salinity anomalies from woa13 fig 9 with the relatively constant globally averaged salinity fig 7c suggests a global redistribution of salt from deeper waters beneath 2000 m to the upper waters upper 1000 m the patterns and structures of these salinity trends demonstrate that the inter forcing differences are small compared with the inter model differences as with the depth dependent temperature trends the relative trends in ryf8485 are the weakest and gradually increase through core nyf ryf9091 and ryf0304 fig 10 presents the distributions of the 490 500 year mean sea surface temperature sst anomalies relative to woa13 climatology note that we should not expect the individual simulations to reproduce the climatological mean sst for the sst anomaly distributions the inter model differences are larger than the inter forcing differences the access om2 simulations tend to be the coolest and the mri gondola 100 simulations the warmest all models exhibit a general sst warming trend from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 with the core nyf simulation between ryf8485 and ryf9091 regional biases are apparent across both forcings and models especially in the north atlantic north pacific and southern ocean indicative of systematic differences between the observational based woa13 and the dynamical simulations zonally averaged transects of the 490 500 year mean temperature anomalies relative to woa13 are presented in fig 11 the general trends are consistent across all simulations the southern ocean and depths 3 km are cooler than woa13 with the upper 1 km between 50 n and 50 s becoming warmer than woa13 the details of these anomalies including the depth latitude distributions of the strongest signals demonstrate that the inter model differences are larger than the inter forcing differences such analyses that compare the simulations with woa13 highlight the dominance that individual model biases have in determining the ultimate t s characteristics of each model that is the dominance of inter model differences obscure any systematic inter forcing differences between the simulations with given ryf periods thereby hindering the comparison of the candidate years comparison between ryfs and core nyf given that individual model biases dominate the watermass differences between the simulations we seek an alternative methodology for evaluating the ryf periods the approach we take is to employ the t s characteristics of the core nyf simulations as references for the three ryf simulations of a given model the underlying motivation for this approach is the assumption that the t s properties of the core nyf simulations themselves are influenced by the model bias such that the difference between the ryf and core nyf simulations can account for individual model biases and return a less biased evaluation of the ryf candidate years note that this approach has caveats differences or lack thereof between the ryf and core nyf simulations for a given model do not necessarily reflect an improved representation of the t s characteristics for a given simulation biases in the core nyf simulation of a given model will likely manifest as common anomalies in its three ryf simulations additionally biases in the core nyf dataset itself will likely appear as common anomalies present across models and forcings remaining cognisant of such biases is especially pertinent for interpreting the anomalies of fields that are in direct contact with the model forcing as these fields bear the direct imprint of inter forcing differences e g the anomalies relative to core nyf in the sst distribution will tend to reflect the differences in the 10 m air temperature and radiation fields the intention of this approach is to isolate and highlight inter forcing differences between the t s properties achieved by the ryf candidate years that are common to all models fig 12 presents the distributions of 490 500 year mean sst anomalies of the ryf simulations referenced to their respective core nyf simulation the inter forcing differences between ryf years are now consistent across the models and dominate the inter model differences compare with fig 10 as expected there is a general surface warming from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 especially in the north atlantic features common to all models and ryf years that are likely reflecting thermal biases in core nyf include cool anomalies along the central south america coast and warm anomalies in the eastern equatorial and northwestern pacific and northeastern atlantic oceans these common features are consistent with the latitudinal distribution of annually averaged atmospheric temperature anomaly in core nyf fig 5a equivalent distributions for sss anomalies relative to core nyf again show larger inter forcing differences compared with inter model differences fig 13 especially between the access om2 and mri gondola 100 simulations in general the sss becomes saltier from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 presumably due to increased evaporation resulting from the increased sst features common to all simulations include positive anomalies in the equatorial and northwest pacific ocean including the kuroshio region the former being consistent with the reduced total precipitation of the core nyf fig 5c global transects of the 490 500 year mean zonally averaged temperature and salinity anomalies relative to core nyf are presented in figs 14 and 15 unlike the surface distributions figs 12 and 13 the bulk of the ocean model is not in direct contact with the atmospheric forcing so anomaly signals here have been integrated and propagated via model dynamics and are more susceptible to model biases especially their different approaches to dense water formation and convection this difference between the surface and deep anomalies is apparent in the zonal averages especially between 50 s and 50 n anomaly signals in the upper 500 m exhibit small inter model differences whilst deeper anomalies have large inter model and inter forcing differences another point of interest arising from the transects is the bi modal distributions of the temperature anomalies relative to core nyf these distributions tend to fall into one of two categories either a relatively warm southern ocean and abyss with upper ocean cooling between 50 s and 50 n or vice versa arguably this bi modal distribution is indicative of the relative differences between southern ocean convection in the ryf and core nyf simulations for ryf8485 the temperature anomaly of all models exhibits similar distributions while ryf9091 and ryf0304 are split across categories 3 2 mixed layer depth insight into the influence of open ocean convection on deep ventilation can be gained by comparing the mixed layer depths mlds figs 16 and 17 these are calculated as the 400 500 year winter means december may and june november for the north and south respectively using the criterion in h 24 of griffies et al 2016 this criterion is based on a depth at which a threshold surface to depth buoyancy difference is obtained corresponding to a critical density difference of δ σ 0 03 kg m 3 for reference we include equivalent distributions from the ifremer los mixed layer depth climatology product of de boyer montégut et al 2004 obtained using the same mld criterion the distributions and magnitudes of winter mld exhibit larger inter model differences compared to inter forcing differences all simulations exhibit extensive winter mld in the norwegian sea south of svalbard and in the labrador sea extending eastward into the north atlantic off the southeast greenland shelf while the general distributions of the northern deep winter mld are similar across all simulations the local structures appear model dependent for instance the access om2 simulations all have deep mld overlying the mid atlantic ridge south of iceland for the ncar simulations these deep mlds are in the labrador sea and for mri gondola 100 these deep mlds round southern greenland but remain near the shelf compared to the ifremer product the simulations exhibit a general agreement in terms of the mld distributions including the three locations with the deepest mlds but all simulations overestimate mld relative to climatology all models exhibit a decreasing mld from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 with core nyf bearing closest resemblance to ryf0304 in the southern hemisphere the inter model differences are more apparent even in the general distributions of mld access om2 exhibits extensive winter mld in the weddell and ross seas and throughout the antarctic circumpolar current acc ncar winter mlds are relatively shallower in both the weddell and ross seas and acc extending past 2500 m in the core nyf simulation only this is consistent with the relatively warmer deep oceans in the ryf8485 and ryf9091 simulations which can be linked to weaker bottom water formation in these ryfs compared to core nyf mri gondola 100 winter mld exhibit a similar distribution to those of access om2 and are extensive in the weddell sea the distributions of the southern hemisphere mlds exhibit generally good agreement with those of the ifremer product except in regions of substantial sea ice especially the weddell and ross seas which are also regions of limited observational coverage 3 3 sea ice distributions of the 400 500 year average winter sea ice thickness exhibit greater inter forcing differences than inter model differences figs 18 and 19 with the sea ice of all ryf simulations vastly improved over the core nyf simulations we attribute the larger sensitivity to forcing rather than model to the fact that the sea ice extent and thickness especially seasonal sea ice are directly influenced by the imposed forcing and as such bear the imprint of forcing differences more than model biases it is also important to remember that the sea ice models of access om2 and ncar are almost identical close versions of cice5 and the sea ice model of mri gondola 100 has much in common with the cice based models as such differences in sea ice fields are likely to arise from different ocean conditions the sea ice extent in all simulations exhibits good agreement with observations from the national snow and ice data center nsidc for the relevant ryf periods of the ryf years ryf8485 has the most sea ice with substantial buildups of multi year sea ice against the northern coastlines of greenland and ellesmere island extending westwards to banks island and into the beaufort and east siberian seas ryf9091 has a similar distribution to ryf8485 in the western arctic and a substantial buildup of multi year sea ice along the eastern coastline of the antarctic peninsula and into the weddell sea ryf0304 has the least amount of sea ice in both hemispheres the distribution and thickness of antarctic sea ice in the core nyf simulations resemble that of ryf8485 and of ryf9091 in the arctic a comparison of the arctic multi year sea ice thickness distributions defined here as sea ice greater than 3 m thick with those obtained from the icesat product kwok et al 2009 demonstrates sea ice improvements in all ryf simulations over the core nyf simulations note that the multi year sea ice distributions are compared because the measurement period of the icesat product twice per year in autumn and late winter for 2003 2008 is different from that of the simulations december to may for the final century and the multi year sea ice distribution is generally insensitive to the measurement period a comparison of the 400 500 year means of monthly sea ice area provides an indication of the extent of sea ice model biases fig 20 across all three ryf periods ncar consistently exhibits the best skill during winter being closest to the nsidc observations of sea ice area access om2 and mri gondola 100 both over estimate arctic sea ice and winter antarctic sea ice extents the core nyf simulations exhibit greater winter sea ice areas than their respective ryf cases of the ryf candidates the sea ice areas of the ryf9091 simulations are all closer to the nsidc observations than either of the other ryf candidates in addition the sea ice thickness distributions of the ryf9091 simulations appear to exhibit the least amount of inter model difference compared to the other candidates 3 4 circulation transports the characteristics of the bulk transports and circulation of the major gyres and current systems exhibit greater inter model differences compared to inter forcing differences so for this analysis we again employ the core nyf simulations as references to account for model biases the 400 500 year means of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc streamfunctions in latitude depth coordinates ψ z sv are contoured in fig 21 coloured by anomalies from their respective core nyf simulation the differences in the structure and characteristics of the contoured streamfunctions across models is greater than that across ryf years the anomalies relative to core nyf show the streamfunctions of the access om2 model and ncar ryf9091 are strengthened while those of mri gondola 100 are weakened fig 22 shows the global meridional overturning circulation streamfunctions contoured in latitude σ 2 coordinates ψ σ 2 sv again coloured by anomalies from their respective core nyf simulation this analysis in latitude σ 2 coordinates grants an opportunity to compare the dense antarctic bottom water aabw production and subsequent northward transport of the simulations for the ryf years the structures and distributions of ψ σ 2 exhibit greater inter model differences than inter forcing differences the lower overturning cells of the access om2 and mri gondola 100 simulations all have a single maxima around 60 s and extend northward to the equator for ncar the lower overturning cell is divided with two maxima around 60 s and 35 s in all simulations except ncar ryf0304 the density of the lower cell has lightened relative to core nyf this is most apparent in the access om2 simulations the latitudinal distribution of the 400 500 year means of global meridional heat transport mht are shown in fig 23a it is clear that the mht especially in the southern hemisphere has larger inter model differences than inter forcing differences once again reflecting the dominant role of model bias in this study comparing the mht anomalies of the ryf simulations relative to their respective core nyf simulation delineates between the ryf periods ryf9091 exhibits the strongest northward mht anomaly in both hemispheres while ryf8485 and ryf0304 show reduced poleward mht fig 23b for reference in the southern hemisphere the mht of all simulations falls within the range of uncertainty of the observational based estimates of ganachaud and wunsch 2003 for the tropical northern hemisphere the mht of all simulations is smaller than the observational estimates and reasonable for mid latitudes the 400 500 year means of the quasi barotropic streamfunctions qbs calculated as per h 26 of griffies et al 2016 are contoured in fig 24 coloured by anomalies from their respective core nyf simulation the general distributions of the mean qbs are consistent across all simulations with all major ocean gyres and current systems represented the relative strengths and locations of the specific gyres and current systems however exhibit greater inter model differences than inter forcing differences qbs anomalies of the ryf simulations relative to the core nyf simulations show similar distributions throughout all simulations in the western pacific and indian basins suggesting these arise from biases in the core nyf in the case of the northwest pacific these biases in the core nyf simulations have corresponding biases in sst fig 12 the southern ocean and acc regions exhibit the greatest variability across the simulations and tending to be weakest in ryf8485 and strongest in ryf0304 consistent with the recent positive trend of the sam fig 3 timeseries of the drake passage amoc at 26 n and aabw at 30 s transports are shown in fig 25 with observational estimates for reference donohue et al 2016 smeed et al 2017 ganachaud and wunsch 2000 respectively all transports exhibit an initial adjustment period during the first century with the amoc and aabw subsequently becoming relatively stable the drake passage transport however continues to evolve indicative of its dependence on stratification and the associated timescales of adjustment and the trends are model dependent ncar exhibits a gradual decrease mri gondola 100 a gradual increase with access om2 relatively stable the drake passage transports also tend to be relatively weak especially for the ryf8485 simulations indicative of the weaker sam which fall below the lower uncertainty bound of the donohue et al 2016 estimates the ryf0304 and core nyf simulations exhibit relatively stronger drake passage transports for the amoc at 26 n all simulations are weaker than the mean but most are within the range of the observational estimates derived from smeed et al 2017 as the 2004 2017 mean and standard deviations of the 12 hourly rapid array data see rayner et al 2011 the aabw transport at 30 s of all simulations is weak and outside the uncertainty of the ganachaud and wunsch 2000 estimate itself likely to be an underestimate of aabw this weak aabw transport presumably reflects the poor representation of deep convection in these relatively coarse resolution ocean models the 400 500 year means of transports in major current and circulation systems are shown in fig 26 with observational estimates for reference these transports are more dependent on the model than the forcing except when the transport depends on regional features or local scale dynamics such as the separation location of a western boundary current for example the kuroshio current of all three simulations with ryf8485 is weak these simulations also exhibit an anomalous kuroshio current separation latitude and cold sst bias in the mid north western pacific fig 10 the kuroshio current transport in the other simulations is in good agreement with the observational estimates of imawaki et al 2001 it is strongest in the core nyf simulations followed by ryf9091 and ryf0304 other western boundary currents such as the gulf stream and east australian current exhibit good agreement with observational estimates smeed et al 2017 sloyan et al 2016 respectively however there are no consistent differences between the transports by forcing and the differences between models dominate the differences between forcings in summary the transports of regional local current systems tend to exhibit good agreement with observations unless influenced by specific localised biases in the forcing period while those of the gyre basin scale tend to be weak by way of an overall comparison of the ocean circulations and transports presented here the systematically weak kuroshio current and drake passage transport of ryf8485 would indicate it is the least favourable ryf candidate the transports of the ryf9091 and ryf0304 simulations exhibit good agreement in the mri gondola 100 simulations for the regions examined here this is also the case for the access om2 simulations with the exception of the amoc where the transport in ryf9091 simulation is closer to the observed mean the transports of the ncar simulations with ryf9091 and ryf0304 however exhibit differences especially in the amoc ryf9091 closer to observed transport and the drake passage ryf0304 closer to observed transport in all models the meridional heat transport at 26 n is largest and closest to the observed transport for ryf9091 4 conclusions recommendation we propose a process for obtaining repeat year forcing ryf periods from the jra55 do dataset for the purposes of spin up and perturbation experiments with global ocean sea ice models this process involves identifying 12 month periods in the jra55 do record that are most neutral in terms of major climate modes of variability we identify three candidate ryf periods the atmospheric states radiation and hydrological fluxes of these periods are compared and are subsequently used to drive three different global ocean sea ice models the t s characteristics ocean circulation and sea ice fields of these simulations are compared and evaluated with the objective of proffering a recommendation for a repeat year forcing period from the jra55 do dataset the largest differences in the simulations here arise from model biases these inter model differences obscure the comparison of the three ryf candidates and suggest that the ultimate choice of the candidate repeat year is not critical these inter model differences may be largely accounted for by comparing the relative differences between the ryf simulations and their respective core nyf simulation this core nyf referenced analysis isolates the inter forcing differences revealing good agreement across the models for each of the ryf candidates including a warming trend from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 we find all three ryf candidates to be adequate for use as repeated year forcing datasets this finding offers a range of simulated ocean sea ice reference states from which perturbation experiments can be performed for instance should a given experiment benefit from a control ocean that contains a modern anthropogenic warming signal the ryf0304 would be preferable alternatively if a cooler ocean control state is desirable or an ocean state that is least affected by the ongoing positive trend in the sam index the ryf8485 is ideal nevertheless considering the relatively strong anthropogenic influence in the ryf0304 conditions and the evidence of the weakly negative sam in ryf8485 we recommend the ryf9091 period from 1st may 1990 to 30th april 1991 to offer the best available repeat year forcing set of jra55 do for driving ocean sea ice models we conclude with a reminder that the simulated ocean sea ice states of the ryf candidates should be considered the products of idealised numerical experiments and be interpreted and employed accordingly these model solutions are not designed to reproduce the observed climatology or that resulting from the interannually varying jra55 do so comparisons with these products are not climatologically meaningful that said the upcoming release and publication of the omip contributions to cmip6 e g griffies et al 2016 will provide an opportunity to examine whether the inter model differences found here also exist in simulations forced with the jra55 do such a model intercomparison study into model biases across repeat year and interannually varying forcings will be of great

23983,jra55 do the new atmospheric dataset for driving ocean sea ice models based on the japanese 55 year atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 has been recently proffered for use in future ocean sea ice hindcast simulations including those under the ocean model intercomparison project omip umbrella thereby replacing the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core interannual forcing dataset the jra55 do dataset contains numerous and substantial improvements over the existing core dataset including refined resolution self consistency of forcing fields and duration however one feature of core that is not available in jra55 do is the normal year forcing core nyf a single repeating annual cycle of all forcing fields necessary to run an ocean sea ice model without imposed interannual variability here we propose a process for obtaining and evaluating repeat year forcing ryf datasets based on the jra55 do dataset for driving ocean sea ice models this process involves the identification of 12 month periods not necessarily a single calendar year that are most neutral in terms of major climate modes of variability three candidate periods are identified and evaluated with three global ocean sea ice models we find that the largest differences between the simulations arise from model biases indicating the ultimate choice of the candidate repeat year is not critical by referencing to the respective core nyf simulations in an attempt to account for model bias we find the differences between the three ryf periods to be generally consistent across the models except for an anthropogenic warming signal for later candidate years based on the analysis presented here we find all three candidate periods to be suitable for use as ryf datasets subject to application and we recommend the period from 1st may 1990 to 30th april 1991 to be the best available ryf dataset for driving ocean sea ice models keywords jra55 do repeat year forcing core nyf 1 introduction tsujino et al 2018 recently presented jra55 do a new atmospheric dataset for driving ocean sea ice models that is based on the japanese 55 year atmospheric reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 jra55 do is proffered as the new standard for forcing global ocean sea ice models with the intention that it be adopted for future ocean sea ice hindcast simulations including those of the ocean model intercomparison project omip griffies et al 2016 thereby replacing the coordinated ocean ice reference experiment interannual forcing core iaf griffies et al 2009 dataset developed by large and yeager 2004 2009 jra55 do has numerous major improvements over the core iaf forcing including refined spatial and temporal resolutions greater self consistency amongst the forcing fields and a development workflow that enables it to be continually updated in near real time so that it extends from 1958 to the present such improvements are necessary steps to ensure the continued efforts in ocean sea ice model development are complemented and importantly not undermined by appropriate high quality forcing sets and establishes jra55 do as the state of the art dataset for forcing global ocean sea ice models an important supplement to the core iaf dataset has been the normal year forcing core nyf large and yeager 2004 the core nyf consists of a synthetically constructed single annual cycle of all forcing fields necessary to run an ocean sea ice model table 1 the core nyf was designed with the intention that its resulting fluxes are as close as possible to the observed climatological fluxes so that when the core nyf is applied repeatedly forced interannual variability is eliminated and the mean model solution is representative of the observed climatological mean the core nyf has proved to be scientifically useful for the purposes of model spin up towards an equilibrated climatologically meaningful ocean state driving control simulations in perturbation experiments and sensitivity studies evaluating internal variability on interannual and longer timescales and estimating model drift in core simulations however unlike the core based forcing datasets a jra55 do based repeat year forcing has not been developed this is our objective here large and yeager 2004 state that the core nyf was developed to satisfy where practical six specific criteria 1 the forcing infrastructure remains unaltered between core iaf and core nyf products with the core nyf datasets restricted to four times daily atmospheric state data daily incoming shortwave and longwave radiation monthly precipitation and daily sea ice concentration the latter for ocean only models 2 the seasonal cycle is retained 3 the realistic propagation of high frequency forcing weather over the oceans throughout the core nyf is retained 4 the climatological average fluxes obtained from coupling the core nyf to observed sst are as close as possible to the observed climatological fluxes so that the mean model state is meaningful 5 there is a smooth transition from december of the year to its beginning in january so that the year can be repeated without initiating spurious transients 6 the core nyf is not overly weighted to any individual year and hence to the atmospheric state of that year the first criterion while important for running ocean sea ice model comparisons between the core nyf and core iaf is technical and trivial the second criterion simply excludes the use of annual averages for forcing fields while the third requires the temporal resolution of core nyf be sufficient to represent and coherently propagate synoptic variability clearly the simplest way to meet these first three criteria would be to select a single year of forcing from the core iaf however as noted by large and yeager 2004 this approach would not satisfy the criteria 4 and 6 even if there is some blending to satisfy criterion 5 therefore a spectral averaging technique was employed to synthetically generate the atmospheric state air temperature winds specific humidity fields of core nyf from those of the ncep ncar reanalysis product kalnay et al 1996 this spectral approach detailed in large and yeager 2004 is complicated and difficult to perform and to repeat in essence the atmospheric state for 43 years 1958 2000 of the 6 hourly ncep ncar product and observed monthly sea surface temperatures was used to construct a timeseries of pseudo wind stresses and surface heat fluxes these pseudo terms were fourier transformed and their spectra obtained these spectra represent the variability at specific frequencies throughout the 43 year record in this space the phases of the spectra correspond to the temporal location of the variability thus for given a set of phases specific frequencies i e greater than biennial of the spectra can then be used to generate surface stress and flux fields that preserve the intra annular variability of the original record the exercise then became one of obtaining a set of realistic phases for this the post 1983 period of the ncep ncar product was inspected to find the most moderate year in terms the north atlantic oscillation north pacific index el niño southern oscillation and antarctic oscillation indices this inspection revealed the calendar year 1995 to be perhaps the most moderate year of the record to satisfy criterion 5 the phases of 1995 were modified to give a smooth transition from december back to january that is the phases between 15 and 31 december became linear combinations of those from 1994 and 1995 with weightings linearly ramping between 0 and 1 these phases were then populated with the spectra of frequencies greater than biennial returning atmospheric state fields that retained the variability characteristics of the 1958 2000 ncep ncar record a consequence of employing the phases of 1995 was that the high frequency and high variability events i e storms will resemble those of 1995 but with magnitudes representative of all storms in the full 43 year record thereby satisfying criterion 6 in addition to the spectrally generated 6 hourly atmospheric state fields the core nyf is also comprised of daily longwave and shortwave radiation monthly liquid and solid precipitation and continental runoff fields which are derived from several different observational based products the core nyf radiation fields are daily climatologies of the goddard institute for space studies international satellite cloud climatology project radiative flux profile dataset giss isccp fd zhang et al 2004 these radiation fields have no diurnal cycle and are not able to represent high frequency variability associated with for instance cloud coverage or air temperature anomalies the precipitation fields of core nyf are monthly averages of a latitudinally blended estimate from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 1997 climate prediction centre merged analysis of precipitation cmap xie and arkin 1996 and the serreze products as detailed by serreze and hurst 2000 and yang 1999 as they are monthly averages the precipitation fields of core nyf are not able to reflect the propagation of high frequency weather events represented in the atmospheric state runoff in core nyf is also monthly at 1 spatial resolution and derived from the dai climatology products as detailed by dai and trenberth 2002 and dai et al 2009 the construction of the core nyf reflects its initial intended purpose as well as the standard practices resolutions and uses of global ocean sea ice models and the computing capabilities of the early 2000s needless to say the state of global ocean sea ice modelling has progressed since the inception of core nyf and routinely extends into the mesoscale and beyond model improvements in resolutions dynamics and parameterisations are the result of substantial collaborative effort and investment and it is vital that these improvements are not undermined by existing aspects and elements of the system including the imposed forcing product employed to drive the model that said it is important that any modification to the forcing protocols be approached with careful and deliberate forethought as there is great scientific value in the continued use of a given forcing product especially in the interests of monitoring for spurious changes in model behaviour that may arise from ongoing modelling and computational developments compared to the early 2000s there is presently a greater need for versatility on the part of the forcing product for a global ocean sea ice model modelling groups routinely run simulations at a hierarchy of resolutions with a common forcing product e g barnier et al 2014 kiss et al 2019 for the highest resolution simulations usually the flagship simulations of a given modelling group the ability of a forcing product to realistically energise the mesoscales can be arguably more important than it having an annually balanced set of fluxes especially considering the unlikelihood that these high resolution simulations will even be run to a global equilibrium concurrently the lower resolution simulations will typically be run for extended durations in which case it is preferable to have a forcing set that is climatologically representative and close to being globally and annually flux balanced thereby minimising long term model drifts presented with this broadened range of intended purposes it is a considerable challenge to develop an ryf product that is able to satisfy all purposes therefore requiring that compromises are made irrespective of the intended purpose it is desirable that the forcing dataset be of the highest quality available indeed the new jra55 do datasets are of a higher quality than the existing core datasets based simply on their substantially higher spatial and temporal resolutions and the fact that the jra55 do forcing fields are self consistent regardless of whether driven by interannual or repeated year forcing datasets it has become common practice for modern global ocean sea ice simulations to be initialised from a standard ocean state usually a climatological hydrography at rest and run for a spin up period of undetermined duration typically subject to computational resources the ill defined duration of this spin up period varies from years to millennia depending on the model and dynamics of interest for instance studies that examine surface and or ventilated thermocline dynamics will generally employ a shorter spin up than those concerned with abyssal processes and or meridional overturning recently formalised methodologies for multi century simulations reflect these practices and recognise the ambiguity of the spin up duration and accept that full equilibrium is not required for meaningful science e g danabasoglu et al 2014 griffies et al 2014 2016 indeed the physical relevance of a truly equilibrated global ocean sea ice model is unclear such a state will be model and forcing dependent and the real ocean sea ice system itself or indeed its forcing is certainly not equilibrated relaxing the requirement of an equilibrated ocean sea ice state for meaningful science has two primary consequences i the forcing dataset is no longer required to be exactly flux balanced globally and or annually and ii there is a greater need to quantify the ongoing behaviours and drifts of a given simulation that is control simulations run in parallel become essential for de trending and or diagnosing the dynamical responses to forcing or configuration changes for this purpose there remains great scientific utility in a high quality control forcing product that is suitable for use with the highest resolution global ocean sea ice simulations so considering that the broadened range of intended purposes for a new ryf product extends into the mesoscale and beyond and the relaxed requirement of hydrographic equilibrium it makes sense to give more weight to the forcing resolution and dynamical integrity of a candidate ryf dataset than to its degree of flux balance relaxing the requirement that a forcing dataset is flux balanced raises an obvious question what is a reasonable level of flux imbalance quantifying the imbalance of a given forcing dataset is challenging as it is model and parameterisation dependent one can diagnose the imbalance for a specific model configuration through the analysis of temperature salinity drifts and or trends however these will be different for different models and configurations e g see fig 7 and figures 3 of griffies et al 2009 2014 alternatively bounds on annual or longer imbalances can be obtained from timeseries of hydrographic observations although these bounds would likely be skewed by anthropogenic influences perhaps a more pragmatic definition of not reasonable imbalance can be found in the climatological relevance of the simulated ocean sea ice state for example if the forcing imbalance is such that the simulated arctic becomes ice free or that simulated north atlantic deep water becomes denser than simulated antarctic bottom water it should be considered an unreasonable imbalance the release of the jra55 do forcing dataset provides an opportunity to reconsider the protocols and strategies of repeat year forcing simulations in the interests of maintaining the fidelity of the mesoscale the spatial and temporal resolution of all fields of the jra55 do repeated year forcing should remain as high as possible and these fields should also be as self consistent as possible as per the jra55 do itself in fact any modification or manipulation of the jra55 do forcing product should be avoided so as to maintain the physical integrity of the forcing product and its simplicity this includes the transition period when the forcing year repeats itself with these factors in mind we detail the criteria for the repeat year forcing to be developed from the jra55 do product 1 the repeated year forcing is an unaltered subset of the interannually varying jra55 do product 2 the full seasonal cycle is retained in the repeated year 3 the realistic propagation of high frequency forcing weather is retained including dynamical consistency between the forcing fields 4 the transition period should be as smooth as possible to minimise i the disturbances arising from the step change in forcing between the end of year and beginning of year and ii the violation of criterion 3 5 the repeated year should be quasi climatological with neutral values for major climate indices 6 the repeated year should be both recent post 1970s so as to be in the era of satellite based observations of sea surface temperature but not too recent so as to minimise any contamination by anthropogenic warming it follows that a well chosen 12 month period taken directly from the jra55 do product could meet these criteria and serve as the repeat year forcing ryf for jra55 do our approach for developing the ryf abandons criterion 4 of large and yeager 2004 which requires that the mean model solution resulting from core nyf represents the mean climatological state the mean model solution resulting from any given 12 month period of the jra55 do will not reflect observed climatology therefore any comparison between the ryf model solution and that resulting from the interannually variable jra55 do cannot be achieved in a climatologically meaningful way indeed the observed ocean sea ice climatology itself as uncertain as it is is both transient and is the integrated result of its dynamics over its entire forcing history employing such an uncertain moving target as a metric of measure for idealised ocean sea ice simulations is of little scientific value and any success by this method will certainly not be due to the accurate representation of the dynamical system or its forcing by a given model irrespective of parameter tuning or optimisation efforts undertaken within that model so rather than attempting to achieve a simulated climatology that is close to that observed or modelled with interannually varying forcing the mean model solution of the ryf should be considered as an idealised reference ocean sea ice state that is specific to that model and its configurations furthermore the ryf state can be employed for scientifically meaningful purposes such as model intercomparisons configuration parameterisation sensitivity studies and perturbation experiments here we present a procedure for selecting the 12 month period of the jra55 do for use as the repeat year forcing three candidate periods are identified section 2 1 and compared section 2 2 the three ryf candidate periods as well as the existing core nyf are used to run global ocean sea ice models from three different modelling groups section 3 these simulations are first compared with hydrographic observations followed by a comparison of the ryf simulations with their respective core nyf simulations section 3 1 these comparisons focus on the large scale global zonally averaged and surface metrics further analysis compares their mixed layer depths sea ice fields circulations and transports sections 3 2 4 we then present our conclusions and recommendations section 4 2 repeat year forcing for jra55 do 2 1 identifying ryf periods criteria 1 3 will be satisfied by taking a 12 month period directly from the jra55 do record with no modifications or blending of the transition period to satisfy criterion 4 as objectively as possible we analyse the 1958 2016 period of the jra55 do record to identify the day of the year that has the least variability in the forcing set we compute the zonal standard deviations for each day of the year excluding february 29 for 10 m air temperature sea level pressure slp 10 m wind speed long and shortwave radiations and total precipitation liquid and solid all fields exhibit seasonal and latitudinal distributions to their daily variabilities fig 1 for the air temperature slp wind speed and longwave radiation fields the variability tends to increase with latitude and to peak during winter fig 1a d shortwave radiation variability tends to be largest in the tropics and peak during summer fig 1e precipitation variability is high near the equator and during autumn at 30 n and 30 s presumably reflecting the locations of the intertropical convergence zone and stormtracks fig 1f given the seasonality and latitudinal distributions of zonal standard deviations of the forcing fields the ideal day of the year for the transition period is not obvious and we therefore look to specific regions that are known to influence model simulations we focus our analysis on regions of dense water formation where ocean convection occurs that is sensitive to sudden changes in forcing conditions e g snow et al 2016 garcia quintana et al 2019 our focus on regions of dense water formation does not imply that the ryf is being developed specifically for studies of the meridional overturning circulation instead we aim to minimise long term model temperature drift which is dominated by deep abyssal ocean adjustments for this reason we seek to minimise the impact of the transition day upon regions that set the upstream conditions of deep watermasses fig 2 shows the average standard deviations for the north atlantic and weddell sea regions compared with the global average for 10 m air temperature wind speed long and shortwave radiation and total precipitation the calculated variabilities of these high latitude regions exhibit seasonal cycles that peaks in winter except in the case of shortwave radiation which obviously peaks in summer fig 2 the global average of the variabilities is less seasonal our aim now is to select the transition day to balance the anti phase seasonality of the hemispheres the transition day should be close to an equinox to avoid the high latitude variability evident in many of the forcing fields the standard deviation of total precipitation fig 2f over the north atlantic is a minimum approximately one month after the northern hemisphere vernal equinox furthermore may is a time of minimal dense water formation and ocean convection which both peak during winter for these reasons we propose may 1 dashed line in fig 2 as a good transition day of year to begin repeat year forcing we next look for forcing years that best satisfy criteria 5 and 6 above we plot timeseries of the 12 month running means of the southern oscillation index soi north atlantic oscillation nao index and southern annular mode sam index each calculated directly from the jra55 do record in fig 3 the decision to depict these three specific climate indices here whilst subjective is an effort to demonstrate that the major modes of climate variability are represented in our identification of candidate ryf periods additional major modes of variability exist such as the el niño southern oscillation enso or the arctic oscillation ao however their phases are well correlated with the soi and nao indices respectively 1 1 the 1980 2016 monthly soi and niño 3 4 anomaly index have a correlation of 0 70 and the nao and ao indices have a correlation of 0 64 global climate observing system working group on surface pressure https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp the climate indices selected are based on sea level pressure anomalies see appendix and are obtained directly from the jra55 do record other major climate modes such as the enso are calculated from sea surface temperature anomalies which are not part of jra55 do product we also plot the global average 10 m atmospheric temperature from the jra55 do record black line highlighting the anthropogenic warming signal and the average soi nao and sam of the core nyf dashed lines it is apparent from this figure that there are few years in which all 3 of the selected climate indices are close to their mean values a qualitative comparison to the climate indices identifies 3 candidate periods that are the most climatically neutral 1984 85 1990 91 and 2003 04 which are referred to as ryf8485 ryf9091 and ryf0304 respectively of these ryf8485 has the advantage of occurring early in the record with the lowest global temperature but both the nao and sam are more negative than the other candidate years ryf0304 has the smallest anomaly across all the modes but the global surface air temperature in this year is almost 0 5 c higher than in ryf8485 ryf9091 may be a good compromise but it occurs during a year in which the sam transitions from positive to negative and the change of the nao is the largest of the three candidate years note that the sam indices of all three candidate years are more neutral than that of core nyf dashed blue line with these candidate years in mind we revisit criterion 4 and examine the sudden changes in forcing associated with the transition day in regions of dense water formation for each candidate year fig 4 plots the 10 m air temperature longwave radiation precipitation and wind speed averaged over the north atlantic a d and weddell sea e h regions as 72 h timeseries spanning the annual transition e g noon april 29 to noon may 2 for the ryf periods and noon december 30 to noon january 2 for core nyf as well as the differences in the regional means either side of the transition i p table 2 to demonstrate the advantages of shifting the transition to april 30 may 1 we also include the december 31 january 1 transitions of the two calendar years that form each of the three ryf candidate periods e g 1984 1985 for ryf8485 etc compare the relative magnitudes of the forcing discontinuities at the transition day between the ryf and calendar years indicated by the a h solid and dashed dotted lines respectively and the i p circles and plusses crosses respectively for the north atlantic region the april 30 may 1 transition of ryf8485 exhibits an obvious reduced discontinuity about the transition day compared to the december 31 january 1 transitions of the 1984 and 1985 calendar years for ryf9091 and ryf0304 the change in discontinuity is less obvious these relatively smoother transitions of the ryf8485 as compared to its calendar years are to be expected given the winter maximum in variability shown in figs 1 and 2 for the weddell sea region shifting the transition day from january 1 to may 1 increases the discontinuity in forcing this increase in the forcing discontinuity for the ryf periods is to expected given the summer minimum in variability shown in figs 1 and 2 may is however not a time of substantial dense water formation in the weddell sea so these abrupt changes are unlikely to effect bottom water production thus the increased discontinuity of surface forcing in the weddell sea region for may 1 transition day is a compromise that we make for the smoothed transition evident in the north atlantic region an overall comparison of the forcing discontinuities of the three ryf periods table 2 indicates the ryf8485 exhibits the smallest discontinuity in forcing and ryf9091 the largest 2 2 comparison of ryf periods here we compare several climate fields from the three candidate periods identified from the jra55 do record as well as those from the core nyf this comparison will inform our initial expectation and eventual interpretation of the ocean sea ice simulations forced with the different ryf periods fig 5 shows latitudinal distributions of the mean 10 m atmospheric temperature longwave radiation total precipitation sea level pressure slp wind speed and wind stress curl calculated assuming no ocean surface velocity and constant drag coefficient for each of the ryf periods presented as anomalies relative to the 1978 2016 mean of jra55 do the difference between the core nyf and 1978 2016 mean of jra55 do is included for reference note that the fields of core nyf are developed to represent the mean states of different reanalysis and climatological products table 1 so that the core nyf differences relative to the mean state of jra55 do reflect differences in the mean states of jra55 do and the core development products therefore the focus for these anomaly comparisons should be on the relative magnitudes and distributions of the ryf anomalies and the core nyf differences rather than their proximity to the jra55 do mean the 10 m temperature and longwave radiation fields fig 5a b exhibit a general warming trends from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 that are consistent with the mean global atmospheric temperature trend in fig 3 the zonal averages of the anomalies of 10 m temperature and longwave radiation for each ryf period are consistent in sign such that latitudes with a cool temperature anomaly also have a negative longwave radiation anomaly the distributions of precipitation anomalies are relatively less coherent with the exception of equatorial and tropical signals and without an obvious trend across the ryf years fig 5c ryf8485 exhibits a negative anomaly in equatorial precipitation and a positive anomaly over the southern tropics both ryf9091 and ryf0304 have an increased precipitation over the equatorial latitudes and in the case of ryf9091 a negative precipitation anomaly over the southern tropics the total precipitation in the core nyf is smaller than that of the 1978 2016 mean of jra55 do this is likely because jra55 do precipitation has been enhanced by approximately 2 1 to achieve a global surface fresh water flux balance with evaporation and runoff after it was adjusted with respect to the precipitation of core considering these precipitation differences we can expect the ryf periods to result in a less salty ocean surface relative to the core nyf in the absence of any surface salinity restoring evaporation differences and precipitation adjustments the zonally averaged slp and wind speed anomalies of the ryf periods are small between 60 s and 60 n the anomalies are less than 1hpa and 0 2 m s respectively with the exception of weaker southern ocean westerlies in ryf8485 consistent with a negative sam index fig 5d e the magnitudes of the differences between the core nyf and 1978 2016 mean of jra55 do for slp and wind speed are much larger than the anomalies of the ryf periods especially southward of 60 s the wind stress curl anomaly distributions calculated assuming no ocean surface velocity and constant drag coefficient can offer insight into the expected differences in ekman transport including wind driven up downwelling fig 5f positive negative wind stress curl anomalies in the northern southern hemisphere correspond to enhanced wind driven upwelling whilst the zonally averaged wind stress curl anomaly tends to be noisy it is clear that the core nyf differences exhibit substantially more noise and meridional variability than that of the ryf period anomalies the standard deviation of the mean wind stress curl for core nyf is 1 7 1 0 8 n m 3 compared with 6 4 1 0 9 4 0 1 0 9 and 4 8 1 0 9 n m 3 for the ryf8485 ryf9091 and ryf0304 respectively this increased noise in the core nyf wind stress curl can be attributed to the spectral method for populating the core nyf wind field large and yeager 2004 there is evidence of a positive anomaly between 50 70 s in the ryf8485 suggesting a reduction in the wind driven upwelling of the southern ocean apart from the increased noise in core nyf differences and the southern ocean anomaly in ryf8485 the wind stress curl anomalies do not give clear indications for global ekman velocity differences between ryf periods it is obvious that a substantial advantage of the jra55 do over the core nyf is its self consistency and increased resolution an example of this is presented in fig 6 which compares snapshots of slp wind speed precipitation and shortwave radiation from one of the ryf periods ryf8485 and core nyf these snapshots are taken at a time when a major atlantic hurricane is making landfall in the usa diana crossed the carolina s coastlines on 12 september 1984 for jra55 do and opal crossed the florida coastline near pensacola on 4 october 1995 for core nyf 2 2 while the atmospheric state of core nyf is a spectral reconstruction of the ncep ncar reanalysis the phases needed to come from a single moderate year of the record for which 1995 was chosen meaning the storm patterns of core nyf tend to follow those of 1995 see large and yeager 2004 for more details hurricane diana along with other synoptic and diurnal events are coherent in all fields of the ryf for example the strong precipitation events evident in the eastern pacific fig 6e have a discernible signal in both wind speed and shortwave radiation for core nyf however these fields are constructed independently from different reanalysis and monthly daily climatological products and therefore bear no relationship with one another comparisons of the forcing fields of the candidate ryf periods reveal differences in the fields but they do not provide a clear indication of which of these periods is best suited for extended duration ocean sea ice simulations we now look to test each of these ryf periods with several global ocean sea ice models to evaluate the biases and forcing issues that may arise 3 evaluation of candidate ryf years in access om2 ncar and mri gondola 100 models the three candidate ryf periods identified from the jra 55 climate record ryf8485 ryf9091 and ryf0304 are evaluated in 500 year long spin up simulations using three models access om2 ncar and mri gondola 100 analysis of equivalent core nyf simulations with the three models is also presented for reference these simulations are compared by their t s characteristics bulk circulations and sea ice representations for ease of presentation we frame the comparison of the simulations by way of their forcings and models differences arising from different forcings are referred to as inter forcing differences and differences arising from different models are referred to as inter model differences see fig 7a the inter model differences include model biases this distinction between inter forcing and inter model differences is important given that our objective here is to evaluate the inter forcing differences of the candidate ryf periods each simulation including those with core nyf begins with a hydrographic initial condition developed from world ocean atlas 2013 woa13 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 using january climatology above 1500 m and boreal winter climatology for the deep ocean sea surface salinity is restored to a condition developed from monthly woa13 data and with a piston velocity of 50m over one year 300 days for access om2 access om2 the australian community climate and earth system simulator access suite includes global ocean sea ice model configurations with a hierarchy of horizontal resolutions nominally 1 0 25 and 0 1 grid spacings developed by the consortium for ocean sea ice modelling in australia cosima see kiss et al 2019 access om2 is the 1 global ocean sea ice model which will be used in the access climate model access cm2 being developed for cmip6 the access om2 global ocean sea ice model uses the modular ocean model version 5 1 mom5 1 griffies 2012 with a z generalised vertical coordinate the community ice code version 5 cice5 hunke et al 2015 a file based atmosphere known as yatm and coupled with oasis3 mct the nominally 1 horizontal resolution uses a mercator grid in the southern hemisphere to 65 s with smooth latitudinal compression extending the domain to 78 s and a tripolar arctic with 50 vertical levels and a minimum vertical grid length of 2 3 m vertical grid kds50 from stewart et al 2017 the access om2 is initialised with a 2 5m thick sea ice field in regions poleward of 70 n and 60 s where the sea surface temperature is less than 1 c above freezing ncar the ncar contribution uses the community earth system model version 2 cesm2 framework with its ocean and sea ice components as the only active models specifically these components are the parallel ocean program version 2 pop2 smith et al 2010 and the cice5 sea ice model version 5 1 2 hunke et al 2015 respectively pop2 is a level coordinate model with a displaced north pole grid the horizontal resolution is nominal 1 with increased meridional resolution of 0 27 near the equator there are 60 vertical levels monotonically increasing from 10 m in the upper ocean to 250 m in the deep ocean the pop2 version used in this study is similar to the one used in previous core studies danabasoglu et al 2014 2016 see also danabasoglu et al 2012 for further details however there are a few new features that include a new parameterisation for mixing effects in estuaries increased mesoscale eddy diffusivities at depth use of salinity dependent freezing point together with the sea ice model a new langmuir mixing parameterisation and a new time filtering scheme based on an adaption of the robert filter to enable sub diurnal coupling of the ocean model danabasoglu et al 2020 cice5 1 2 initialised with a sea ice state from a previous simulation incorporates a mushy layer thermodynamics approach turner and hunke 2015 in which the vertical profile of salinity within the ice is prognostic the sea ice vertical resolution in the model has been enhanced from four layers in its previous versions to eight layers in order to better resolve the salinity and temperature profiles additionally the snow model now resolves three layers to represent the vertical temperature profile the melt pond parameterisation has also been updated hunke et al 2013 and now accounts for the fact that ponds preferentially form on undeformed sea ice mri gondola 100 mri gondola 100 is the ocean sea ice component of the earth system model developed for cmip6 in meteorological research institute japan meteorological agency mri esm2 yukimoto et al 2019 the model domain extends from 78 5 s to 90 n with a murray s 1996 tripolar grid over the arctic ocean north of 64 n the horizontal resolution is 1 in longitude and 0 5 in latitude with refinement to 0 3 from 10 s to 10 n this model has 60 layers in vertical whose thickness ranges from 2 m for the top layer to 700 m for the bottom layer with an additional bottom boundary layer of 50 m thickness around antarctica and iceland nakano and suginohara 2002 the sea ice model is initialised by a january distribution of a preliminary experiment refer to yukimoto et al 2019 and urakawa et al 2020 for further details 3 1 t s characteristics comparison with woa13 considering the model resolution and intended purpose our comparison of the t s properties of the simulations focusses on differences in global depth and zonally averages and surface distributions other t s differences exist but these tend to be localised or region specific the timeseries of globally averaged potential temperature sea surface temperature sst salinity anomaly and sea surface salinity sss fig 7 show relatively small inter forcing differences compared to inter model differences here the inter model differences can be due to either different model configurations e g differences in model maximum depths or land sea masks or different model dynamics parameterisations the extent to which the different model configurations influence the inter model differences is apparent at initialisation for the global mean temperature the inter model difference at initialisation is relatively small 0 05 c and broadens over time suggesting that the inter model differences are dominated by model dynamics parameterisations in terms of the inter forcing differences the relative trends of ryf8485 and ryf9091 are consistent across the three models with ryf8485 0 05 c cooler than ryf9091 by year 500 and all simulations cooling by 0 01 0 04 c between years 400 and 500 the behaviour of ryf0304 is different between the three models and exhibits centennial variability in its trend indicative of a large scale watermass adjustment to the ryf0304 forcing the core nyf simulations track with ryf8485 in access om2 and mri gondola 100 in ncar the core nyf is cooler than all ryf simulations the globally averaged sst for all simulations initially experience a rapid adjustment in the first decade and subsequently remain steady the globally averaged sst for the ncar and mri gondola 100 models are in good agreement with each other with the access om2 simulations approximately 0 3 c cooler for the inter forcing differences the ryf8485 simulations tend to be coldest with the ryf0304 simulations as the warmest the globally averaged salinity anomaly global mean salinity minus initial global mean salinity evaluates the degree to which the salinity freshwater fluxes are balanced for the access om2 and mri gondola 100 simulations there is negligible drift in the global mean salinity after an initial adjustment period of a few decades the ncar simulations exhibit a global freshening trend of approximately 10 4 psu century the globally averaged sss tends to increase slightly throughout the simulations and inter model differences are larger than the inter forcing differences the ryf8485 simulations exhibit the freshest globally averaged sss with the ryf0304 being the saltiest the vertical structure of the globally averaged potential temperature trends can be examined with time series of horizontally averaged temperature anomalies from woa13 fig 8 note that unlike core nyf which is developed to be representative of climatological forcing the ryf periods are specific years of the jra55 do record and are thereby not expected to reproduce the observed hydrographic climatology nevertheless the inter model differences dominate the inter forcing differences with the pattern of temperature anomalies of the ryf periods closely resembling those of their respective core nyf case for each model all simulations exhibit a general warming of the upper 1000 m and cooling beneath this with a 200 year delayed onset of deep cooling in the case of mri gondola 100 the relative strengths of the deep cooling trends reflect the trends of the globally averaged temperatures compare figs 7a 8 indicating the long term evolution of the latter is a thermal adjustment of the deep ocean the patterns and structure of the trends in each model are consistent across the three ryf periods and core nyf and different to those of the other models that is the inter forcing differences are small compared with the inter model differences the warming signal in the upper 1000 m appears weakest for ryf8485 and strongest for ryf0304 with core nyf between ryf8485 and ryf9091 comparing equivalent time series of horizontally averaged salinity anomalies from woa13 fig 9 with the relatively constant globally averaged salinity fig 7c suggests a global redistribution of salt from deeper waters beneath 2000 m to the upper waters upper 1000 m the patterns and structures of these salinity trends demonstrate that the inter forcing differences are small compared with the inter model differences as with the depth dependent temperature trends the relative trends in ryf8485 are the weakest and gradually increase through core nyf ryf9091 and ryf0304 fig 10 presents the distributions of the 490 500 year mean sea surface temperature sst anomalies relative to woa13 climatology note that we should not expect the individual simulations to reproduce the climatological mean sst for the sst anomaly distributions the inter model differences are larger than the inter forcing differences the access om2 simulations tend to be the coolest and the mri gondola 100 simulations the warmest all models exhibit a general sst warming trend from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 with the core nyf simulation between ryf8485 and ryf9091 regional biases are apparent across both forcings and models especially in the north atlantic north pacific and southern ocean indicative of systematic differences between the observational based woa13 and the dynamical simulations zonally averaged transects of the 490 500 year mean temperature anomalies relative to woa13 are presented in fig 11 the general trends are consistent across all simulations the southern ocean and depths 3 km are cooler than woa13 with the upper 1 km between 50 n and 50 s becoming warmer than woa13 the details of these anomalies including the depth latitude distributions of the strongest signals demonstrate that the inter model differences are larger than the inter forcing differences such analyses that compare the simulations with woa13 highlight the dominance that individual model biases have in determining the ultimate t s characteristics of each model that is the dominance of inter model differences obscure any systematic inter forcing differences between the simulations with given ryf periods thereby hindering the comparison of the candidate years comparison between ryfs and core nyf given that individual model biases dominate the watermass differences between the simulations we seek an alternative methodology for evaluating the ryf periods the approach we take is to employ the t s characteristics of the core nyf simulations as references for the three ryf simulations of a given model the underlying motivation for this approach is the assumption that the t s properties of the core nyf simulations themselves are influenced by the model bias such that the difference between the ryf and core nyf simulations can account for individual model biases and return a less biased evaluation of the ryf candidate years note that this approach has caveats differences or lack thereof between the ryf and core nyf simulations for a given model do not necessarily reflect an improved representation of the t s characteristics for a given simulation biases in the core nyf simulation of a given model will likely manifest as common anomalies in its three ryf simulations additionally biases in the core nyf dataset itself will likely appear as common anomalies present across models and forcings remaining cognisant of such biases is especially pertinent for interpreting the anomalies of fields that are in direct contact with the model forcing as these fields bear the direct imprint of inter forcing differences e g the anomalies relative to core nyf in the sst distribution will tend to reflect the differences in the 10 m air temperature and radiation fields the intention of this approach is to isolate and highlight inter forcing differences between the t s properties achieved by the ryf candidate years that are common to all models fig 12 presents the distributions of 490 500 year mean sst anomalies of the ryf simulations referenced to their respective core nyf simulation the inter forcing differences between ryf years are now consistent across the models and dominate the inter model differences compare with fig 10 as expected there is a general surface warming from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 especially in the north atlantic features common to all models and ryf years that are likely reflecting thermal biases in core nyf include cool anomalies along the central south america coast and warm anomalies in the eastern equatorial and northwestern pacific and northeastern atlantic oceans these common features are consistent with the latitudinal distribution of annually averaged atmospheric temperature anomaly in core nyf fig 5a equivalent distributions for sss anomalies relative to core nyf again show larger inter forcing differences compared with inter model differences fig 13 especially between the access om2 and mri gondola 100 simulations in general the sss becomes saltier from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 presumably due to increased evaporation resulting from the increased sst features common to all simulations include positive anomalies in the equatorial and northwest pacific ocean including the kuroshio region the former being consistent with the reduced total precipitation of the core nyf fig 5c global transects of the 490 500 year mean zonally averaged temperature and salinity anomalies relative to core nyf are presented in figs 14 and 15 unlike the surface distributions figs 12 and 13 the bulk of the ocean model is not in direct contact with the atmospheric forcing so anomaly signals here have been integrated and propagated via model dynamics and are more susceptible to model biases especially their different approaches to dense water formation and convection this difference between the surface and deep anomalies is apparent in the zonal averages especially between 50 s and 50 n anomaly signals in the upper 500 m exhibit small inter model differences whilst deeper anomalies have large inter model and inter forcing differences another point of interest arising from the transects is the bi modal distributions of the temperature anomalies relative to core nyf these distributions tend to fall into one of two categories either a relatively warm southern ocean and abyss with upper ocean cooling between 50 s and 50 n or vice versa arguably this bi modal distribution is indicative of the relative differences between southern ocean convection in the ryf and core nyf simulations for ryf8485 the temperature anomaly of all models exhibits similar distributions while ryf9091 and ryf0304 are split across categories 3 2 mixed layer depth insight into the influence of open ocean convection on deep ventilation can be gained by comparing the mixed layer depths mlds figs 16 and 17 these are calculated as the 400 500 year winter means december may and june november for the north and south respectively using the criterion in h 24 of griffies et al 2016 this criterion is based on a depth at which a threshold surface to depth buoyancy difference is obtained corresponding to a critical density difference of δ σ 0 03 kg m 3 for reference we include equivalent distributions from the ifremer los mixed layer depth climatology product of de boyer montégut et al 2004 obtained using the same mld criterion the distributions and magnitudes of winter mld exhibit larger inter model differences compared to inter forcing differences all simulations exhibit extensive winter mld in the norwegian sea south of svalbard and in the labrador sea extending eastward into the north atlantic off the southeast greenland shelf while the general distributions of the northern deep winter mld are similar across all simulations the local structures appear model dependent for instance the access om2 simulations all have deep mld overlying the mid atlantic ridge south of iceland for the ncar simulations these deep mlds are in the labrador sea and for mri gondola 100 these deep mlds round southern greenland but remain near the shelf compared to the ifremer product the simulations exhibit a general agreement in terms of the mld distributions including the three locations with the deepest mlds but all simulations overestimate mld relative to climatology all models exhibit a decreasing mld from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 with core nyf bearing closest resemblance to ryf0304 in the southern hemisphere the inter model differences are more apparent even in the general distributions of mld access om2 exhibits extensive winter mld in the weddell and ross seas and throughout the antarctic circumpolar current acc ncar winter mlds are relatively shallower in both the weddell and ross seas and acc extending past 2500 m in the core nyf simulation only this is consistent with the relatively warmer deep oceans in the ryf8485 and ryf9091 simulations which can be linked to weaker bottom water formation in these ryfs compared to core nyf mri gondola 100 winter mld exhibit a similar distribution to those of access om2 and are extensive in the weddell sea the distributions of the southern hemisphere mlds exhibit generally good agreement with those of the ifremer product except in regions of substantial sea ice especially the weddell and ross seas which are also regions of limited observational coverage 3 3 sea ice distributions of the 400 500 year average winter sea ice thickness exhibit greater inter forcing differences than inter model differences figs 18 and 19 with the sea ice of all ryf simulations vastly improved over the core nyf simulations we attribute the larger sensitivity to forcing rather than model to the fact that the sea ice extent and thickness especially seasonal sea ice are directly influenced by the imposed forcing and as such bear the imprint of forcing differences more than model biases it is also important to remember that the sea ice models of access om2 and ncar are almost identical close versions of cice5 and the sea ice model of mri gondola 100 has much in common with the cice based models as such differences in sea ice fields are likely to arise from different ocean conditions the sea ice extent in all simulations exhibits good agreement with observations from the national snow and ice data center nsidc for the relevant ryf periods of the ryf years ryf8485 has the most sea ice with substantial buildups of multi year sea ice against the northern coastlines of greenland and ellesmere island extending westwards to banks island and into the beaufort and east siberian seas ryf9091 has a similar distribution to ryf8485 in the western arctic and a substantial buildup of multi year sea ice along the eastern coastline of the antarctic peninsula and into the weddell sea ryf0304 has the least amount of sea ice in both hemispheres the distribution and thickness of antarctic sea ice in the core nyf simulations resemble that of ryf8485 and of ryf9091 in the arctic a comparison of the arctic multi year sea ice thickness distributions defined here as sea ice greater than 3 m thick with those obtained from the icesat product kwok et al 2009 demonstrates sea ice improvements in all ryf simulations over the core nyf simulations note that the multi year sea ice distributions are compared because the measurement period of the icesat product twice per year in autumn and late winter for 2003 2008 is different from that of the simulations december to may for the final century and the multi year sea ice distribution is generally insensitive to the measurement period a comparison of the 400 500 year means of monthly sea ice area provides an indication of the extent of sea ice model biases fig 20 across all three ryf periods ncar consistently exhibits the best skill during winter being closest to the nsidc observations of sea ice area access om2 and mri gondola 100 both over estimate arctic sea ice and winter antarctic sea ice extents the core nyf simulations exhibit greater winter sea ice areas than their respective ryf cases of the ryf candidates the sea ice areas of the ryf9091 simulations are all closer to the nsidc observations than either of the other ryf candidates in addition the sea ice thickness distributions of the ryf9091 simulations appear to exhibit the least amount of inter model difference compared to the other candidates 3 4 circulation transports the characteristics of the bulk transports and circulation of the major gyres and current systems exhibit greater inter model differences compared to inter forcing differences so for this analysis we again employ the core nyf simulations as references to account for model biases the 400 500 year means of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc streamfunctions in latitude depth coordinates ψ z sv are contoured in fig 21 coloured by anomalies from their respective core nyf simulation the differences in the structure and characteristics of the contoured streamfunctions across models is greater than that across ryf years the anomalies relative to core nyf show the streamfunctions of the access om2 model and ncar ryf9091 are strengthened while those of mri gondola 100 are weakened fig 22 shows the global meridional overturning circulation streamfunctions contoured in latitude σ 2 coordinates ψ σ 2 sv again coloured by anomalies from their respective core nyf simulation this analysis in latitude σ 2 coordinates grants an opportunity to compare the dense antarctic bottom water aabw production and subsequent northward transport of the simulations for the ryf years the structures and distributions of ψ σ 2 exhibit greater inter model differences than inter forcing differences the lower overturning cells of the access om2 and mri gondola 100 simulations all have a single maxima around 60 s and extend northward to the equator for ncar the lower overturning cell is divided with two maxima around 60 s and 35 s in all simulations except ncar ryf0304 the density of the lower cell has lightened relative to core nyf this is most apparent in the access om2 simulations the latitudinal distribution of the 400 500 year means of global meridional heat transport mht are shown in fig 23a it is clear that the mht especially in the southern hemisphere has larger inter model differences than inter forcing differences once again reflecting the dominant role of model bias in this study comparing the mht anomalies of the ryf simulations relative to their respective core nyf simulation delineates between the ryf periods ryf9091 exhibits the strongest northward mht anomaly in both hemispheres while ryf8485 and ryf0304 show reduced poleward mht fig 23b for reference in the southern hemisphere the mht of all simulations falls within the range of uncertainty of the observational based estimates of ganachaud and wunsch 2003 for the tropical northern hemisphere the mht of all simulations is smaller than the observational estimates and reasonable for mid latitudes the 400 500 year means of the quasi barotropic streamfunctions qbs calculated as per h 26 of griffies et al 2016 are contoured in fig 24 coloured by anomalies from their respective core nyf simulation the general distributions of the mean qbs are consistent across all simulations with all major ocean gyres and current systems represented the relative strengths and locations of the specific gyres and current systems however exhibit greater inter model differences than inter forcing differences qbs anomalies of the ryf simulations relative to the core nyf simulations show similar distributions throughout all simulations in the western pacific and indian basins suggesting these arise from biases in the core nyf in the case of the northwest pacific these biases in the core nyf simulations have corresponding biases in sst fig 12 the southern ocean and acc regions exhibit the greatest variability across the simulations and tending to be weakest in ryf8485 and strongest in ryf0304 consistent with the recent positive trend of the sam fig 3 timeseries of the drake passage amoc at 26 n and aabw at 30 s transports are shown in fig 25 with observational estimates for reference donohue et al 2016 smeed et al 2017 ganachaud and wunsch 2000 respectively all transports exhibit an initial adjustment period during the first century with the amoc and aabw subsequently becoming relatively stable the drake passage transport however continues to evolve indicative of its dependence on stratification and the associated timescales of adjustment and the trends are model dependent ncar exhibits a gradual decrease mri gondola 100 a gradual increase with access om2 relatively stable the drake passage transports also tend to be relatively weak especially for the ryf8485 simulations indicative of the weaker sam which fall below the lower uncertainty bound of the donohue et al 2016 estimates the ryf0304 and core nyf simulations exhibit relatively stronger drake passage transports for the amoc at 26 n all simulations are weaker than the mean but most are within the range of the observational estimates derived from smeed et al 2017 as the 2004 2017 mean and standard deviations of the 12 hourly rapid array data see rayner et al 2011 the aabw transport at 30 s of all simulations is weak and outside the uncertainty of the ganachaud and wunsch 2000 estimate itself likely to be an underestimate of aabw this weak aabw transport presumably reflects the poor representation of deep convection in these relatively coarse resolution ocean models the 400 500 year means of transports in major current and circulation systems are shown in fig 26 with observational estimates for reference these transports are more dependent on the model than the forcing except when the transport depends on regional features or local scale dynamics such as the separation location of a western boundary current for example the kuroshio current of all three simulations with ryf8485 is weak these simulations also exhibit an anomalous kuroshio current separation latitude and cold sst bias in the mid north western pacific fig 10 the kuroshio current transport in the other simulations is in good agreement with the observational estimates of imawaki et al 2001 it is strongest in the core nyf simulations followed by ryf9091 and ryf0304 other western boundary currents such as the gulf stream and east australian current exhibit good agreement with observational estimates smeed et al 2017 sloyan et al 2016 respectively however there are no consistent differences between the transports by forcing and the differences between models dominate the differences between forcings in summary the transports of regional local current systems tend to exhibit good agreement with observations unless influenced by specific localised biases in the forcing period while those of the gyre basin scale tend to be weak by way of an overall comparison of the ocean circulations and transports presented here the systematically weak kuroshio current and drake passage transport of ryf8485 would indicate it is the least favourable ryf candidate the transports of the ryf9091 and ryf0304 simulations exhibit good agreement in the mri gondola 100 simulations for the regions examined here this is also the case for the access om2 simulations with the exception of the amoc where the transport in ryf9091 simulation is closer to the observed mean the transports of the ncar simulations with ryf9091 and ryf0304 however exhibit differences especially in the amoc ryf9091 closer to observed transport and the drake passage ryf0304 closer to observed transport in all models the meridional heat transport at 26 n is largest and closest to the observed transport for ryf9091 4 conclusions recommendation we propose a process for obtaining repeat year forcing ryf periods from the jra55 do dataset for the purposes of spin up and perturbation experiments with global ocean sea ice models this process involves identifying 12 month periods in the jra55 do record that are most neutral in terms of major climate modes of variability we identify three candidate ryf periods the atmospheric states radiation and hydrological fluxes of these periods are compared and are subsequently used to drive three different global ocean sea ice models the t s characteristics ocean circulation and sea ice fields of these simulations are compared and evaluated with the objective of proffering a recommendation for a repeat year forcing period from the jra55 do dataset the largest differences in the simulations here arise from model biases these inter model differences obscure the comparison of the three ryf candidates and suggest that the ultimate choice of the candidate repeat year is not critical these inter model differences may be largely accounted for by comparing the relative differences between the ryf simulations and their respective core nyf simulation this core nyf referenced analysis isolates the inter forcing differences revealing good agreement across the models for each of the ryf candidates including a warming trend from ryf8485 through to ryf0304 we find all three ryf candidates to be adequate for use as repeated year forcing datasets this finding offers a range of simulated ocean sea ice reference states from which perturbation experiments can be performed for instance should a given experiment benefit from a control ocean that contains a modern anthropogenic warming signal the ryf0304 would be preferable alternatively if a cooler ocean control state is desirable or an ocean state that is least affected by the ongoing positive trend in the sam index the ryf8485 is ideal nevertheless considering the relatively strong anthropogenic influence in the ryf0304 conditions and the evidence of the weakly negative sam in ryf8485 we recommend the ryf9091 period from 1st may 1990 to 30th april 1991 to offer the best available repeat year forcing set of jra55 do for driving ocean sea ice models we conclude with a reminder that the simulated ocean sea ice states of the ryf candidates should be considered the products of idealised numerical experiments and be interpreted and employed accordingly these model solutions are not designed to reproduce the observed climatology or that resulting from the interannually varying jra55 do so comparisons with these products are not climatologically meaningful that said the upcoming release and publication of the omip contributions to cmip6 e g griffies et al 2016 will provide an opportunity to examine whether the inter model differences found here also exist in simulations forced with the jra55 do such a model intercomparison study into model biases across repeat year and interannually varying forcings will be of great

23984,abundant and diverse cold water coral and fish communities can be found in the deep waters of the florida straits which are believed to be living under suboptimal conditions impacted by increasing oceanic co2 levels yet little is known regarding the spatial temporal variability of bottom carbonate chemistry parameters and their dynamic drivers in this area to address this issue we present results from numerical simulations of a coupled physical biogeochemical model for the south florida shelf and florida straits our exploratory analysis focuses on two well known deep coral habitats pourtalès terrace 200 450 m and miami terrace 270 600 m results suggest that bottom waters along the northern western slope of the straits are comprised primarily of the north atlantic central water nwcw and antarctic intermediate water aaiw driven by upwelling associated with the bottom ekman transport of the florida current over the pourtalès terrace both the meandering of the florida current and mesoscale eddies modulate the upwelling downwelling of cold warm waters in contrast florida current makes a sharp turn at the southern end of the miami terrace leading to persistent island wakes frequent occurrences of a transient eddy and strong upwelling of deep waters toward the platform of the terrace passage of the transient eddy often accompanies strong downwelling of warm waters and a return southward flow on top of the platform overall bottom water properties including temperature t dissolved inorganic carbon dic and total alkalinity ta show strong variability on weekly to monthly time scales over entire pourtalès terrace and on the platform of miami terrac mostly driven by physics in deeper areas 400 m bottom water properties are fairly stable with both dic and ta showing narrow ranges interestingly waters over the southeastern portion of the pourtalès terrace show consistently warmer temperature lower dic and higher ta than those on top of this terrace the aragonite saturation state ω ranges 1 2 2 on top of the pourtalès terrace and 1 2 1 7 both on top of miami terrace and on the upper slope of pourtalès terrace in the deeper slope areas 400 m it is nearly constant at 1 2 1 3 this modeling effort suggests that remote forcing and biogeochemical processes along the transport paths from the gulf of mexico to the straits are significant but second order contributors to the variability of bottom carbonate chemistry the impacts of benthic biogeochemical processes along the transit paths are not resolved keywords coupled physical biogeochemical model mesoscale eddies upwelling aragonite saturation state deep corals florida straits 1 introduction in the north atlantic ocean deep sea coral ecosystems dsces are found

al 2005 2006 ross and quattrini 2007 and have been increasingly appreciated over the past decades as their extensive footprint is better understood for example the deep water oculina coral reefs off

noaa designated five new deep water chapcs in the seus covering 62 714 km2 noaa 2010 the majority of these dsces occur within continental shelves and slopes which are expected to experience the greatest changes in environmental stressors e g temperature ph due to climate change ocean acidification and deoxygenation on top of the large natural variability as compared to other portions of the deep sea e g mora et al 2013 lunden et al 2014 perez et al 2018 it has been widely recognized that warming water temperatures and increasing co2 pose serious threats to the health of shallow coral reefs e g bellwood et al 2004 kleypas and yates 2009 anthony et al 2011 less attention has been paid to deep water reefs that are already living under high co2 conditions the potential impacts of ocean acidification on deep corals and the deep coral ecosystems remain poorly understood e g hoegh guldberg et al 2017 limited experimental studies focused mainly on the growth and calcification

potential impacts may also include metabolism reproduction capability and the dissolution of coral reefs structures thus it is important to better characterize the current mean state and variability of bottom carbonate chemistry over deep water reefs significant progress has been made in observing environmental conditions of dsces including hydrodynamic and biogeochemical conditions e g mienis et al 2012 2014 lunden et al 2013 ross et al 2015 georgian et al 2016b yet information about carbonate chemistry conditions over the dsces remains scarce this limits our capability to properly understand the potential threat of rising oceanic co2 to these communities limited studies suggest that the aragonite saturation state ω ar is only marginally higher than 1 0 over the shelf slope in the gulf of mexico gom and the straits of florida regions lunden et al 2013 wang et al 2013 wanninkhof et al 2015 the three gulf of mexico and east coast carbon cruises gomecc 1 2 3 conducted in july 2007 2012 and 2017 respectively surveyed the same transect 27 n in the northern florida straits yielding very similar ω ar measurements with values near the sea floor being only slightly higher than 1 for example the minimum ω ar was 1 19 and 1 36 respectively for the west and east florida slope during gomecc2 thus progressive ocean acidification poses a significant threat to deep coral reefs by further lowering ph and reducing the availability of carbonate ions co 3 2 particularly for aragonite which is incorporated into scleractinian skeletons cohen and holcomb 2009 perez et al 2018 deep reef systems in this region are subjected to strong physical disturbances including upwelling eddy entrainment and mixing and the meandering of the florida current fc in the straits of florida the fc is the dominant current with speeds that can exceed 2 m s 1 this current originates from the loop current lc in the gom and feeds into the gulf stream in the south atlantic bight the fc impinges on the shelf of the florida keys and its core is mainly situated over the northwestern slope of the straits with persistent upwelling driven by the current induced bottom ekman transport e g pietrafesa 1990 garrett et al 1993 the fc also exhibits mesoscale meanders with periods of 5 and 12 days and with wavelengths of respectively 170 and 340 km johns and schott 1987 which can substantially vary the bottom temperature salinity and velocities over these timescales the fc also generates mesoscale 30 100 km cyclonic eddies and sub mesoscale 10 30 km features along the shelf break e g lee 1975 lee

shipboard surveys and bottom moorings we focus on two key coral habitats the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace e g reed et al 2013 2014 the pourtalès terrace lies in the southern slope of the florida keys at depths between 200 450 m and a maximum width of 32 km this 213 km long terrace consists of extensive high relief hard bottom and essential fish habitats covering 3429 km2 fig 1 the southeastern flank of this terrace between 81 12 80 24 w is located in the lee of florida current and is a chapc benthic communities on this terrace are dominated by stylasterid hydrocorals gorgonian alcyonaceans black corals and sponges the scleractinian corals include lophelia pertusa enallopsammia profunda madracis myriaster madrepora oculata solenosmilia variabilis and dendrophylliidae and one l pertusa mound was recently discovered on the terrace slope reed et al 2005 2014 the fish communities consist of 62 species including eleven commercially and recreationally important fish species reed et al 2014 to the north of the pourtalès terrace is the miami terrace 25 18 26 30 n which extends 145 km long at depths from 275 to 600 m the terrace covers 2329 km2 and has similar benthic biota as pourtalès terrace and lophelia enallopsammia coral mounds and coral rubble are common at the foot of the escarpment reed et al 2006 vinick et al 2012 the objectives of this manuscript are two fold 1 further assessment of model skills in simulating the deep water upwelling mesoscale eddies and near bottom water properties in the florida straits and 2 characterization of spatial temporal variability of bottom water properties especially carbonate chemistry and controlling processes including mesoscale eddies and current meandering the numerical model and in situ data used for assessing model skills are described in section 2 model results including a comparison with in situ data key physical and carbonate chemistry features and the variability of near bottom water properties are presented in section 3 in section 4 key controlling processes for this variability are discussed including meso and submesoscale eddies and associated upwelling large scale transport and mixing and biogeochemical processes such as local export and remineralization of organic carbon finally some concluding remarks are made in section 5 2 methods 2 1 model the numerical model is based on the regional ocean modeling system roms a three dimensional primitive equation ocean model system e g shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the model domain covers the south florida shelf florida straits northern cuban coastal region and western great bahamas bank with a horizontal resolution 1 5 km and 35 sigma layers vertically concentrating near the surface fig 1 the numerical schemes for momentum equations and tracers are third order upstream for horizontal advection and fourth order centered difference for vertical advection vertical turbulent mixing is computed with the generic length scale gls turbulent closure umlauf and burchard 2003 a uniform horizontal and viscosity and mixing coefficient of 10 m2 s were applied on the geopotential surfaces haidvogel and beckmann 1999

at tidal frequencies are small with the standard deviations at 0 16 c and 0 09 c respectively as observed at the t2 and t3 stations in order to avoid drift of sea surface temperature sst on the continental shelf particularly shallow areas model sst is relaxed to observed daily sst from satellite observed sst http podaac jpl nasa gov the modeled period was chosen as 2011 2012 more details for the physical model can be found in pan et al 2017 unlike the previous simulations reported in pan et al 2017 the model bathymetry cut off is now 2000 m instead of 1500 m the physical model is coupled with a biogeochemical model developed by fennel et al 2006 2008 with some modifications made to parameter values see table 1 this model has 6 functional groups that describe the nitrogen cycle through the lower food web nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 phytoplankton zooplankton small detritus and large detritus chlorophyll is a diagnostic variable based on the phytoplankton chlorophyll to carbon ratio which is computed following the light acclimation model by geider et al 1997 it also includes dic dissolved oxygen do and ta in our implementation we adjusted some key parameters such as light attenuation and half saturation constants table 1 in order to better simulate deep ocean phytoplankton dynamics including the reproduction of the deep chlorophyll maximum the simulation of the carbon cycle largely follows the nitrogen cycle with a fixed redfield carbon to nitrogen ratio of 6 625 the air sea co2 flux is determined by the air sea partial pressure of co2 pco2 multiplied by the gas transfer or piston velocity which is computed following the formulation of wanninkhof 1992 alkalinity is assumed to be unaffected by air sea gas exchange of co2 but instead altered by a number of biogeochemical processes including calcite formation and dissolution nitrate uptake and regeneration and sulfate reduction in this model only the nitrate uptake and remineralization of organic nitrogen are included based on the model output ph and ω ar were computed from dic and ta using a matlab co2sys package with k1 and k2 constants from mehrbach et al 1973 and k so4 from dickson 1990 see lewis and wallace 1998 van heuven et al 2011 the biogeochemical parameters in the river inputs to the model include nutrients no3 nh4 dissolved organic matter dic and ta there are only very limited measurements for biogeochemical parameters in the rivers for simplicity in this simulation we used constant values 5 μ m ol l for no3 4 μ m ol l for nh4 120 μ m ol kg for doc 2100 μ m ol kg for dic and 2300 μ m ol kg for ta based on the available data compiled by the south florida water management district http my sfwmd gov dbhydroplsql show dbkey info main menu this choice will affect the biogeochemical results including nutrients phytoplankton biomass dic and ta in nearshore and coastal areas but we do not expect it to significantly affect water properties in the offshore areas particularly bottom waters in the florida straits where river influences are minimal construction of more detailed river inputs is currently underway the boundary conditions for nitrate dic and ta were prescribed based on their respective nonlinear regressions with temperature derived from observed concentrations along the west florida slope transect during gomecc2 cruise fig 2 the boundary temperature field was derived from gomex model output as described above the assumption is that these water properties along the western boundary are generally similar because all waters in the gom come from the subtropical north atlantic through the caribbean sea rivas et al 2005 local physical biogeochemical processes will undoubtedly modify the water properties there is insufficient information to specify more details e g spatial gradients along the boundary the no3 dic and ta concentrations are all strong correlated with both the temperature and salinity as observed along the western florida shelf slope during gomecc2 cruise figure s1 yet both the no3 and dic correlations with temperature r 0 99 no3 and r 0 98 for dic were much stronger than those with salinity r 0 93 for no3 and r 0 9 for dic while the ta correlation with temperature was similar with that with salinity therefore temperature was used to construct the model boundary conditions for the no3 dic and ta the boundary conditions for other biogeochemical variables are derived from the output of the coupled roms cosine carbon silicon nitrogen ecosystem model developed by dr chai at the university of maine chai pers comm the cosine model was originally developed for the pacific ocean but was adapted for the northwest atlantic ocean xiu and chai 2014 the model consists of 31 state variables describing 3 types of nutrients n p si 3 phytoplankton functional groups picoplankton diatoms and coccolithophorids 2 size classes of zooplankton microzooplankton mesozooplankton bacteria several groups of organic matter dissolved oxygen do total alkalinity and tco2 the model was coupled with a 7 km roms model with a domain covering the northwest atlantic region including the gulf of mexico a 50 yr 1957 2007 simulation of the coupled model has been performed and the physical model has been calibrated indicating satisfactory model skills including capturing the gulf stream dynamics kang and curchitser 2013 no systematic calibration or validation however has yet been made for the biogeochemical simulation we used the biogeochemical results from the last two years 2006 2007 an arbitrary choice to derive biogeochemical boundary conditions for our modeling period 2011 2012 because the roms cosine simulation for this period is not available we do not however expect this temporal miss match to significantly impact model calculations as the three key parameters nitrate dic and ta were specified separately from the cosine results at present we have no sufficient observed data for specifying other biological variables pon poc don doc plankton biomass in the gulf of mexico the justification of our choices for these boundary parameters is provided in the supplement materials which include a figure showing the temporal variability of key biogeochemical variables along the western boundary on the west florida slope figure s3 the time mismatch in boundary conditions and lack of validation of the biological parameters means that the results should be viewed with a degree of uncertainty due to the previously mentioned factors as much of the carbon dynamics are driven by well constrained physical variability in the domain the processes and patterns are representative of actual conditions 2 2 data extensive model calibration has been performed for the physical model using available data from various sources pan et al 2017 in this manuscript we compare model results with data collected in the florida straits from four sources which have not been used in the calibration by pan et al 2017 1 integrated transport between west palm beach and grand bahamas island between 26 27 n through the northern florida straits meinen et al 2010 2 the second florida shelf edge experiment flosee

current profilers adcps at two mooring stations on the miami terrace fig 1 we also compare the model output of biogeochemical variables with limited data collected during the flosee and gomecc2 cruises the transport by florida current through the northern florida straits has been measured using various methods at around 27 n here we use the estimates based on the voltage change to a submarine telephone cable due to the current induced changes in magnetic field which covered various periods from 1970 to present meinen et al 2010 the transport was calibrated with the more accurate estimates based on the time lapse of a free falling dropsonde at a series of stations across the straits that took place about once per month niiler and richardson 1973 garcia and meinen 2014 tidal signals were removed from the final transport estimate the flosee cruise onboard the noaa ship nancy foster focused on the pulley ridge mesophotic coral reef ecosystem on the southwest florida shelf with the objective of studying the potential impacts of the deepwater horizon oil spill event on south florida coral reefs reed et al 2012 in addition to benthic surveys e g coral species video of benthic habitats images from side scan sonars with a remotely operated vehicle rov a bluefin spray glider was deployed for measuring water properties t s over the outer shelf of the southwest florida shelf see pan et al 2017 traditional ctd casts were also made over pulley ridge the pourtalès terrace 4 stations and southern slope off key west 1 station fig 1 water properties measured using a sea bird 911plus ctd rosette system included temperature salinity turbidity fluorescence ph and dissolve oxygen do collected data were binned into 1 m depth intervals for this manuscript we only used the data from the ctd stations over the pourtalès terrace the gomecc cruises were funded by noaa s ocean acidification program oap with cruises conducted in summers of 2007 2012 and 2017 to measure hydrological and carbonate chemistry parameters in the gulf of mexico and u s east coast only first two cruises wang et al 2013 wanninkhof et al 2015 these cruises covered the gom and us east coast with 18 transects that ran from the coast to deep oceans two other noaa sponsored cruises east coast ocean acidification ecoa i and ii were conducted in 2015 and 2018 respectively which occupied most of the gomecc stations on the east coast but with more detailed surveys in some selected coastal areas during all of these cruises a number of physical biogeochemical parameters were measured with bottled samples including temperature t salinity s chlorophyll chl macro nutrients dic ta and do among others the analysis for chlorophyll samples was limited to the upper 250 m results from the first and second gomecc cruises can be found in wang et al 2013 and wanninkhof et al 2015 respectively yang et al 2015 examined the variability of total alkalinity in the northeastern gulf of mexico using the gomecc2 data and other historical measurements here we will use the data from the bottle samples collected between july 22 august 13 2012 during gomecc2 along two transects that are located inside our model domain transect 1 extending from tampa bay to the shelf break hereafter referred to as wfl and transect 2 across the northern florida straits hereafter referred to as efl along the ft pierce fl segment at 27 n fig 1 these data indicate strong nonlinear correlations between temperature dic ta and no3 especially below the thermocline fig 2 in order to corroborate bottom water masses we also use a portion of the data along a22 transect 70 65 w of the woce survey which took place in march 24 april 17 2012 http whp atlas ucsd edu atlantic index htm data used below were from stations 66 81 between 12 36 16 19 7 n which were within the caribbean current that feeds into the gulf of mexico to further evaluate the model predictions particularly on the temporal dimension we compare model output with observed time series of near bottom 12 m above the sea floor temperatures and current profiles between 2009 and 2015 adcp moorings have been periodically deployed on the northern miami terrace latitude 26 4 n at 4 locations from 260 m to 640 m fig 1 two temperature time series collected from moorings t2 b2 320 m total water depth and t3 b3 290 m total water depth and one water velocity time series measured from mooring t2 b2 measurement depth of 156 m are utilized in this study it is noted that the temperature sensor elevation above the sea floor 12 m is similar to the water depth of the first model layer from the bottom for more details about these instruments and measurements please see machado et al 2016 3 results 3 1 model skills extensive calibration of the physical model has been conducted using the following four datasets pan et al 2017 1 flosee ship deployed ctd data 2 ctd measurements onboard a spray glider during two month long surveys over western florida shelf 3 satellite altimetry measured sea surface height ssh and 4 satellite infrared imaged sea surface temperature sst results indicate that the model is able to reproduce the spatial temporal variability of water properties as well as key dynamic processes including lc fc dynamics formation and propagation of mesoscale eddies associate with the current instability interactions between eddies and the shelf slope and upwelling associated with the eddies and lc fc meandering e g johns and schott 1987 kourafalou and kang 2012 this previous comparison however focuses on the west florida shelf particularly in the pulley ridge area here we provide an additional assessment on the model skills with a focus on the florida straits figs 2 6 the relevant statistics of these model data comparisons are shown in table 2 where the last column shows the mean model data differences along with the confidence interval based on the paired student t test we first present the comparison between model and observed transport at 27 n fig 3 the result indicates that the model captures the magnitude of volume transport along this section with mean transport at 30 3 versus 31 2 m3 s both are close to recent estimates of the mean transport however for unclear reasons the model under estimates the variability of volume transport on a monthly timescale fig 3a modeled variability of volume transport on shorter timescales 11 day due to meso and submesoscale activities is similar to measured data with standard deviation std at 0 8 m3 s for model versus 1 1 m3 s for data fig 3b model volume transport also has a weak correlation with measured data with the correlation coefficient r 0 19 p 0 05 and r 0 27 p 0 01 respectively for the low frequency 11 day and high frequency 11 day components a comparison of model and observed key parameters from july 30 31 2012 along the gomecc 2 efl transect is shown in fig 4 both modeled results and observations indicate strong bottom upwelling of cold and relatively low salinity waters along the western slope left side of the current looking downstream of the transect as shown in the upward tilting of the isotherms and isopleths of other water properties this is consistent with the well known feature of the florida current that its main axis is located mid slope on the west side of the straits e g seim et al 1999 the modeled upwelling in this instance however is weaker than the observations with the modeled temperature of the upper slope water about 3 c warmer than the measurements fig 4a and b upwelling was unusually strong during the gomecc 2 cruise zhang et al 2017 on average however model temperature along this transect is only about 0 3 c lower than the observed which is not statistically significant table 2 the model is also able to reproduce the general pattern of salinity including the high salinity subsurface layer between 50 300 m along the central right flank of the florida current which represents the north atlantic salinity maximum waters smw from the subtropical north atlantic ocean see e g roson et al 2003 modeled salinity over the upper western slope is higher than the observed salinity by about 0 25 psu but the average modeled salinity along this transect agrees well with observations both model temperature and salinity show a strong point to point correlation with data r 0 93 and 0 65 respectively table 2 a comparison between model and observed key biogeochemical parameters dic nitrate and ta along the same transect tells a similar story fig 4e j the model reproduces the general patterns and ranges of these parameters however over the upper slope modeled no3 and dic concentrations are lower than the observed zhang et al 2017 whereas modeled alkalinity is about 10 20 μ m ol kg higher than the observed fig 4i j in accord with higher observed upwelling the point to point correlation coefficients and root mean square error rmse between the model and observed values are respectively 0 9 and 4 5 μ m ol kg for nitrate 0 96 and 20 4 μ m ol kg for dic and 0 69 and 18 4 μ m ol kg for ta table 2 on average modeled dic is 8 μ m ol kg higher than the observed and modeled ta is 10 μ m ol kg higher than the observed the gomecc measurement errors for dic and ta are respectively 2 μ m ol kg and 4 μ m ol kg therefore we believe these mismatches are mostly due to model biases only a subset of water samples was analyzed for chlorophyll concentration along this transect the data also clearly shows a subsurface maximum with increasing depth at around 30 m at the shelf edge to 100 m offshore generally in agreement with the model vertical distribution the overall a point to point correlation between model and data is r 0 37 p 0 01 and r 0 74 after excluding a few outlier see figure s2 the temporal variability of model temperature and current fields are compared with data collected from two adcp moorings t2 and t3 fig 5 overall the model reproduces near bottom temporal patterns e g dominant periods reasonably well over weekly to monthly timescales a simple spectral analysis indicates that the model and observed bottom temperatures at t2 and t3 have very similar power spectra with no obvious peak at low frequency 11 day but prominent peaks at the 7 day period for high frequency variability 11 days not shown modeled and observed temperatures at both locations have similar magnitudes in high frequency variability fig 5a b the model and observed stds are 0 52 and 0 67 c respectively at t2 and 0 66 versus 0 68 c respectively at t3 the model however over estimates the magnitudes of low frequency variability at both locations as reflected in the differences between modeled and observed standard deviations table 2 the model and observed n svelocities at t2 agree on the short term variability in terms of both mean values and the amplitude of variability fig 5c e table 2 moreover in the upper layer modeled n s velocity strongly correlates with observed values e g r 0 66 at 68 m however the model data correlation decreases with depth both model and observed e w velocities show a persistent eastward component but the model average is only about 50 60 of the observed fig 5 d f table 2 also the observed e w velocity shows much stronger variability than the modeled comparisons of modeled and observed currents at other depths above this same location and at two other mooring sites yield similar conclusions not shown as another check on modeled vertical structures of water properties we compared model and observed temperature and salinity profiles at several stations over the pourtalès terrace during the flosee survey table 2 modeled temperature agrees well with these measured data with a correlation coefficient r 0 97 however the model data agreement for salinity is less strong r 0 75 in particular the model under estimates salinity by 0 3 0 6 psu in the upper 150 m modeled chlorophyll profiles show a prominent subsurface chlorophyll maximum scm at all of the flosee stations whose depth is quite variable between stations no direct comparison however was made for the modeled chlorophyll with flosee data which only reported fluorescence the observed fluorescence however shows a consistent depth of maximum at 65 m for all of these comparisons model skills are quantitatively evaluated with three metrics correlation coefficient r standard deviation std and normalized root mean squared error rmse these can be summarized with the taylor diagram as shown in fig 6 taylor 2001 here a is the reference point representing the perfect match between model and data and other letters represent the cases evaluated table 2 the closer the triad is to a the better model skill it is clear that the poorest agreement is from the comparison with mooring data cases k p indicating the challenge of the model in reproducing both the phase and magnitude of the temporal variability on small scales overall this diagram indicates a reasonable performance of the model 3 2 upwelling driven by florida current and mesoscale eddies florida current typically tilts up to the left flank due to the bottom ekman transport and associated geostrophic adjustment fig 4 in a steady state bottom friction acting on the current would lead to bottom ekman transport which moves to the left of the current and drives near bottom upwelling of nutrient rich cold waters up the slope hsueh and o brien 1971 garrett et al 1993 seim et al 1999 zhang et al 2017 thus upwelling or downwelling due to current meandering and eddies will be superimposed on this background because variability in the florida current or the presences of eddies will change bottom ekman transport leading to enhanced upwelling or reduced upwelling i e downwelling moreover upwelling generally accompanies strong and persistent phytoplankton blooms near the slope area e g llopiz 2008 which is also seen from our model results not shown the export of the organic matter produced in these blooms can be critical food sources for the abundant deep corals found in the straits the formation and evolution of mesoscale and sub mesoscale eddies associated with the fc have been well documented e g lee 1975 lee and mayer 1977 lee et al 1995 fratantoni et al 1998 kourafalou and kang 2012 richardson et al 2009 elongated mesoscale and sub mesoscale eddies with low temperatures near their cores are frequently produced locally or pass through this area elevated chlorophyll concentrations are frequently observed along the edge and near the center of these eddies using satellite images e g kourafalou and kang 2012 this model is able to produce similar mesoscale and sub mesoscale eddies in the straits although sub mesoscale activities might be under represented in the model because of its relatively coarse model resolution 1 5 km we will focus on mesoscale eddies in the following sections modeled results suggest mesoscale eddies could have significant impacts on bottom water properties over the pourtalès terrace as an example we present a series of currents maps at 150 m and bottom temperature over the pourtalès terrace fig 7 left as well as the companion vertical distributions of temperature and along channel w e velocity along the 81 w transect across the shelf slope of pourtalès terrace fig 7 right between february 16 25 2012 a mesoscale eddy passes through the area fig 7c e g on feb 4 2012 before the eddy bottom temperature and 150 m currents indicate persistent cross slope transport at the western end of the pourtalès terrace leading to cold waters 10 c residing over the inner side of the platform fig 7a b this is in addition to the upwelling driven by the bottom ekman transport induced by the florida current as noted above as a result bottom temperature over the outer slope of the terrace is typically warmer than on the platform on feb 16 2012 an eddy is seen encountering the western edge of the terrace which appears to have blocked cold water intrusion onto the inner platform but instead brings deep water directly through the outer slope fig 7c d the eddy takes about one week to propagate through the terrace both the leading front and eddy center drive strong upwelling uplifting the isopycnals and flushing the terrace with deep cold waters fig 7e f after the eddy passes through the area significant downwelling takes place along the trailing edge of the eddy which flattens the thermocline and the western part of the terrace is covered with warmer waters 16 c fig 7g h thus the temperature change over the terrace before and after the passage of the eddy is 3 7 c an examination of model results over the two year period suggests that similar events have happened 3 times in 2011 and 4 times in 2012 all occurring during spring and fall seasons 3 3 island wakes around the miami terrace the dynamics of currents bathymetry interactions over the miami terrace is different from those over the pourtalès terrace this can be illustrated with a series of temperature and currents maps at 300 m fig 8 left panels and temperature and n s water velocity maps along a cross slope transect at 25 25 n fig 8 right panel for february 14 24 2012 in this area the florida current changes its direction from northeastward to northward and therefore the current axis often meanders significantly in the upper layer however the florida current typically follows the nearly straight n s shelf slope thus strong upwelling is primarily due to the bottom ekman transport in deeper areas the bathymetry contour takes a sharp turn from northeast to north at around 25 12 n and then another turn to the east at around 25 45 n as a result the left flank of the florida current frequently overshoots creating island wakes with an area of low flow and significant upwelling over the pourtalès drift an area between 25 n and the miami terrace fig 8c f consistent with our results kourafalou and kang 2012 also found that stronger upwelling takes place in this area as the core of the current shifts eastward away from the western slope unlike their analysis which focused on the top 200 m our focus here is deeper areas clearly the upwelled cold deep waters will be transported downstream toward the terrace this effect can be illustrated in fig 9 which shows the maps of bottom temperature and currents fig 9 left panels and temperature and n s velocity along a cross slope transect at the south end of the miami terrace 25 40 n fig 9 right panel during the same period as in fig 8 it is notable that the overshoot of florida current on february 18 2012 leads to a cyclonic eddy of approximately 20 km wide and 50 km long in the wakes along with strong upwelling that further uplifts the thermocline fig 9c d the eddy propagates slowly downstream but only lasts a few days disappearing within a 30 40 km distance of the spawning area fig 9e f an examination of modeled results over the 2 year period indicates frequent occurrences of this eddy approximately once per week each lasting about 2 5 days the occurrence of this eddy significantly affects the bottom water properties over the miami terrace without an eddy bottom water temperature on the platform is typically 2 4 c warmer than over the slope fig 9a b when an eddy is present both the isothermals over the center and along the leading edge of the eddy are further uplifted fig 8d f and 9d f allowing more upwelling of cold waters over the platform and reducing the bottom temperature fig 9c f as the eddy propagates downstream it induces significant downwelling of warmer upper layer waters in its wake fig 9g h sometimes a return flow at between 200 300 m water depth is present likely due to the geostrophic adjustment soloviev et al 2017 also noted the presences of an intermittent countercurrent down to 244 m over the miami terrace island wakes and associated upwelling of deep cold waters are ubiquitous phenomena when oceanic currents encounter topographic obstacles in the deep oceans e g dong et al 2007 in our case this is largely a subsurface phenomenon because the wakes and eddy are mostly below the thermocline several previous studies have reported that a countercurrent southward existed between 400 700 m and 25 40 n 25 50 n based on data collected at moorings and from auv surveys düing and johnson 1971 lee and mooers 1977 correa et al 2012 the maximum speed of the countercurrent can sometimes exceed 50 cm s and the current can extend vertically about 200 m above the bottom submersible dives on the coral mounds at the foot of the terrace show that their steeper slopes and live coral colonies tend to occur on the northern slopes of the mounds correa et al 2012 this is evidence of fairly persistent southerly currents as elsewhere in the straits the coral growth is on the current facing south slopes of the mounds our model results however do not show such a persistent countercurrent rather reverse currents on the western side of transient eddy occur frequently over a broad area between 400 700 m and spanning 20 30 km in n s distance however these earlier surveys are either relying on spatially sparse stations lee and mooers 1977 or limited to small areas of auv mapping or a few mooring stations thus while it is possible that the model missed producing this countercurrent another possibility is that what they observed is the return currents along the west side of a cyclonic eddy 3 4 bottom dic and ta distributions modeled variability of near bottom carbonate chemistry is closely associated with the physical processes particularly upwelling of deep cold waters in fact the bottom dic pattern largely mirrors bottom temperature while bottom ta pattern largely follows temperature because of the nearly opposite relationships between ta and dic to temperature in these waters i e lower temperature corresponding to lower ta but higher dic within the range of the bottom temperature in these areas 8 c t 16 c fig 2b c we focus on bottom and cross sectional dic distributions on the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace during the same periods as shown in figs 7 9 figs 10 11 during normal situations without the presences of eddies cold dic rich waters cover most of the pourtalès terrace with the exception being the southeastern flank due to persistent upwelling noted above fig 10a b the passage of a mesoscale eddy clearly brings more deep water onto the terrace increasing the spatial coverage of high dic waters including flooding the southeastern part of the terrace fig 10e f after the eddy passes downwelling brings warm and reduced dic waters over western part of the terrace fig 10g h in the deeper areas 400 m where temperature is lower than 12 c however there is little change in dic concentration over time and space fig 10 right panels this is because within this temperature range 4 12 c waters are within the salinity minimum zone fig 2a and both dic and ta concentrations are in the neighborhood of their local extrema with a narrow range of variations 25 μ m ol kg over the miami terrace bottom dic concentrations are also closely associated with bottom temperature following the development of island wakes and the upwelling of deep cold waters fig 11 when the transient eddy is not present upwelling is already strong and high dic waters cover much of the terrace but the outer edge of the platform is covered by relatively warmer water with lower dic concentration fig 11a b when an eddy is formed in the wakes strengthened upwelling brings up more cold dic rich waters and the entire terrace is flushed with high dic waters fig 11c f similarly the downwelling after the passage of the eddy reduces the dic concentrations over the much of the terrace fig 11g h yet again there is little change 10 μ m ol kg in dic concentrations over the deeper areas 400 m where temperature is lower than 12 c fig 11 right panels 3 5 temporal variability of bottom water properties in order to understand the temporal variability of bottom water properties we chose four representative locations one on the platform 160 m and another on upper slope 296 m below the platform of the pourtalès terrace one on the platform 280 m and another on the upper slope 417 m of the miami terrace fig 1 the time series of t s dic and ta concentrations and aragonite saturation at these locations are shown in fig 12 the modeled results suggest somewhat larger ranges of temperature 8 17 9 c on top of the platform than that 8 2 14 2 c over the upper slope over the pourtalès terrace fig 12a b the salinity shows a similar range 35 1 35 8 psu at both locations it is interesting to note that bottom temperature on the platform of the pourtalès terrace is normally lower than that over the upper slope area throughout the modeling period except during a few episodic events spatially the warmer area generally covers the southeast part of the terrace between 200 m and 400 m isobaths fig 7a c a close examination indicates most of the events are due to the passage of mesoscale eddies which first induce strong upwelling along the leading fronts to greatly reduce the bottom temperature over the upper slope fig 7c f and then drive strong downwelling along their trailing edges to greatly increase temperature on the platform fig 7g h the bottom temperature and salinity changes during these events can be up to 6 c and 0 6 psu respectively at both locations in comparison both bottom temperature and salinity on the platform of the miami terrace also show strong temporal variability with a temperature range of 6 14 5 c and a salinity range of 34 9 35 9 psu fig 12a b overall waters at this location are 2 4 c colder and fresher than waters on both the platform and upper slope of pourtalès terrace even though the water depth here is comparable to the upper slope site of pourtalès terrace suggesting stronger impacts of upwelling due to the island wakes and associated eddies at the deeper site 417 m both temperature and salinity are very stable showing little changes over time 6 c t 9 7 c 34 9 s 35 3 bottom temperature and salinity at the two sites on the miami terrace are quite similar except during a few downwelling events when temperature and salinity on the platform increase up to 6 c and 0 75 psu and during a prolonged warm period 2012 from mid august through the end of november those downwelling events typically last from a few days to more than 1 week mostly due to the passage of transient eddies spun off from the island wakes the temporal variability of near bottom dic and ta concentrations are also closely associated with water movements as seen in figs 7 10 fig 12c d both dic and ta concentrations on the platform of pourtalès terrace show a wide range on short term weekly 2140 2 210 μ m ol kg for dic and 2305 2 360 μ m ol kg for ta respectively in contrast both dic and ta show much narrower ranges 30 μ m ol kg over the upper slope of the pourtalès terrace consistent with the variability of bottom temperature bottom dic ta concentration on the platform is normally higher lower than that over the upper slope area throughout the modeling period except during a few episodic events such as when an eddy passes through the area this is consistent with the spatial pattern seen in fig 10a and c which show that waters with relatively low dic concentration cover much of the southeastern part of the terrace between 200 m and 400 m isobaths coincidently this relatively low dic area overlaps with most of the noaa designated hapc for the pourtalès terrace e g reed et al 2013 on the platform of the miami terrace dic and ta concentrations show somewhat larger ranges 45 μ m ol kg for dic and 35 μ m ol kg for ta than those on the upper slope of pourtalès terrace on the upper slope of the miami terrace both parameters are fairly stable with a narrow range 10 μ m ol kg throughout the modeling period in deep areas 400 m bottom values of these two parameters are effectively constant throughout the straits as shown in figs 10 11 a simply correlation analysis of these time series indicates that temperature alone explains 76 of low frequency variability in bottom dic and ta in these areas except for the upper slope of miami terrace 56 for both dic and ta for short term high frequency variability temperature explains 64 of dic and ta short term variability for the two sites on the platform of the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace see table 3 the correlations between high frequency t and dic variability for the two upper slope sites of the terraces are either weak or non existent reflecting the low dic range 15 μ m ol kg for these water masses fig 2b in contrast the t ta correlation for the high frequency variability remains strong r 0 92 on the upper slope of the pourtalès terrace however it is significantly weaker at r 0 69 on the upper slope of the miami terrace we note that these ranges of temperature variations particularly at those stations on top of the platforms of both terraces may be somewhat exaggerated based on the model data comparisons at the t2 and t3 mooring stations and assuming the model performances over these two terraces are similar we can roughly estimate the variability of bottom temperature measured with the standard deviation at the two stations on top of the platforms pt 160m and mt 280m are roughly over predicted by 20 30 however we do not have data to gauge the performance of temperature simulation in deeper areas given the modeled temperature ranges are smaller in these areas we shall expect less model biases from the modeled temperature at the two deeper stations pt 296m and mt 417m both dic and ta show nearly linear relationships with the temperature within the modeled temperature ranges at the two stations on top of the platforms pt 160m and mt 280m thus the over predictions of dic and ta ranges at these two stations are likely similar to that of temperature at 20 30 in deeper areas pt 296m and mt 417m both the dic and ta relationships with temperature are much weaker within the temperature ranges 6 12 c at these depths see e g fig 2 therefore we shall expect the model over prediction of dic and ta ranges in these areas are likely small the temporal variability of t dic and ta over the pourtalès terrace leads to significant variability in ω ar with the annual range between 1 2 2 fig 11e on top of the miami terrace ω ar shows a similar pattern but with a smaller annual range between 1 2 1 7 on the upper slope of the pourtalès terrace the ω ar ranges 1 3 1 6 whereas on the upper slope of the miami terrace and all of the deeper area 400 m ω ar is nearly constant between 1 2 1 3 throughout the year the narrow range of ω a for deep waters is associated with the narrow ranges of ta and dic concentrations around the salinity minimum interestingly ω ar is also strongly correlated with temperature r 0 81 for both low and high frequencies at all of the sites except for the upper slope site of the miami terrace where the correlation is strong at low frequency r 0 74 but much weaker for high frequency r 0 57 table 3 as noted above the variability of the key variables t dic ta for ω ar is somewhat over predicted for the two shallower stations pt 160m and mt 280m assuming a 20 over prediction of temperature dic and ta variability measured as std see table 1 a simple calculation using co2sys lewis and wallace 1998 van heuven et al 2011 suggests that the variability of ω ar may have also been over predicted by 20 for the two deeper stations pt 296m and mt 417m assuming a 10 over prediction of temperature would mean 5 over prediction of dic and ta variability because the dic t and ta t relationships are mostly flat for the temperature ranges experienced at these stations 6 12 c therefore we shall expect the predicted ranges of ω ar at these stations are fairly close to the actual range because small change in temperature alone does not change ω ar very much in brief variability of water masses over these terraces driven by meso scale eddies and fc meandering are strongest during spring and fall of the model period and their impacts on the ω ar variability are significant for the areas on top of the terraces but likely small for deeper areas 3 6 bottom distribution of aragonite saturation state ω a r to further understand the bottom carbonate chemistry in these deep coral habitats we present the annual mean bottom ω ar value and its standard deviation for 2012 which were computed based on the daily bottom ω ar derived from bottom temperature salinity dic and ta fig 13 the results for 2011 are very similar not shown model results indicate dynamic upper slope regions including the platform and upper slope areas where fc meandering eddies and associated upwelling downwelling all contribute to the variability of bottom water properties and relatively stable lower slope regions on top of the platforms of both terraces between approximately 200 400 m ω ar is typically higher than 1 4 due to the presence of deep cold waters ω ar is relatively low over the inner platform of pourtalès terrace and southern miami terrace in contrast the ω ar value over the southeastern part of pourtalès terrace and northern part of miami terrace is significantly higher these are the areas less affected by upwelling driven by bottom ekman transport and island wakes as discussed above on average the slope regions for the two terraces experience low to moderate aragonite saturation between 1 4 and 2 fig 12a consistent with the variability of bottom water properties aragonite saturation on the platforms of both terraces and over the upper slope 400 m regions shows much more variability than in deeper areas fig 13b 4 discussion the modeled results indicate that the variability of bottom water properties including carbonate chemistry in the florida straits particularly over the two deep coral habitats is strongly affected by the movements of deep waters such as upwelling and downwelling these upwelling and downwelling events are due to mesoscale processes and meandering of the florida current and are also influenced by water properties in the source waters in the following we first discuss the bottom water masses in the florida straits and then evaluate the respective roles of mesoscale eddies large scale transport and biogeochemical processes in these variability 4 1 bottom water masses over the deep coral habitats water masses in the florida straits are ultimately derived from the caribbean current which becomes the lc as it enters the gom through yucatan channel rivas et al 2005 the lc either flows directly into the florida straits or loops into the northern gom its recirculation loop impinges on the florida shelf near the dry tortugas gordon 1967 and becomes the fc in the southern straits of florida therefore depending on the mode of the loop current water properties in the fc may more closely resemble gom waters or caribbean waters to date there are no reported measurements for dic and ta concentrations in the caribbean waters thus we assume that their values are similar to those observed in the northern gom fig 14 also see fig 2 based on the t s diagrams for the gomecc2 survey along the wfl and efl transect and our modeled results at the four chosen sites over the two deep coral habitats it is clear that bottom waters over these habitats primarily comprise of two types of water masses the north atlantic central water nacw 10 c t 16 c 35 2 s 36 4 and the gom central waters gomcw 6 c t 10 c 34 9 s 35 3 fig 14a the gomcw is lying beneath the nacw and its origin can be traced back to aaiw atkinson 1983 in deeper 400 m areas however it seems that the water mass is primarily from the gomcw in both the gom and the straits above the nacw is the north atlantic salinity maximum water smw s 36 which is not present in the bottom waters over these coral habitats these water properties are largely consistent with the water masses observed at the stations between 10 20 n along the woce a20 transect in summer 1997 however salinity in the aaiw observed along a22 is about 0 15 psu lower than that in gomecc2 cruise suggesting either change in the source waters or modification along the transit path from the western tropical atlantic ocean within north brazilian current through the caribbean seas the modeled ta and dic concentrations over these deep coral habitats are largely consistent with those observed along the gomecc2 wfl and efl transects fig 14b c modeled dic concentration on the platform of pourtales terrace however is about 0 15 μ m ol kg higher than those observed along the two gomecc2 transects suggesting local enrichment also consistent with water mass changes between woce a22 transect and gomecc2 observations noted above the gomcw has about the same dic concentration but 5 10 μ m ol kg higher ta concentrations the loop current penetrated deeply into the northern gom during most of 2011 2012 except during summer fall2012 based on the satellite altimetry https www aviso altimetry fr en my aviso html therefore co2 concentrations in both nacw and aaiw are likely further increased as a result of remineralization of organic matter from the gom shelf waters wang et al 2013 wanninkhof et al 2015 once entering the florida straits the waters are compressed upward as the current passes through the straits due to the dramatic shoaling 1000 m within a distance of 200 km of bottom topography the low temperature and high dic nacw and aaiw waters are further steered upward over the slope of the left flank due to fc meandering and eddies while being transported through the straits as noted above these explain the modeled results that bottom water masses over the upper portion of these coral habitats despite being relatively shallow 400 m are comprise primarily of nacw and aaiw whereas bottom waters over the deep areas 400 m are primarily from the aaiw fig 14 global models have suggested that the equatorial north atlantic will experience shoaling of aragonite saturation horizon ash in the future due to the ocean acidification orr et al 2005 orr 2011 higher co2 concentrations are present in the aaiw because high anthropogenic co2 uptake in the southern ocean sabine et al 2004 gruber et al 2019 contributes to ocean acidification in the straights given the close correlation of bottom water properties in the straits with the gomcw and aaiw ocean acidification will likely greatly shift the bottom carbonate chemistry in these areas including more frequent low aragonite saturation and will possibly breach the ω ar 1 threshold moreover a recent study indicates that the atlantic meridional overturning circulation will provide a fast track delivery of acidified cold waters through high latitude deep water formation and subsequently spreading over the deep oceans perez et al 2018 this implies that the deep coral reefs in our study region may experience more stress due to the lower availability of carbonate ions however potential impacts of lowering ω ar on deep corals remain poorly understood e g hoegh guldberg et al 2017 so far there are only limited direct experiments testing the effects of ocean acidification mostly focusing on calcification rates and these results are mixed e g maier et al 2009 2012 form and riebesell 2012 lunden et al 2014 georgian et al 2016a low ω ar may also affect other aspects of deep corals including reproduction larval growth and dissolution of dead skeleton yet the exact effects of these are largely unknown warming temperature and deoxygenation are also expected as a result of global warming lunden et al 2014 both of which will potentially add to the stress to deep corals global warming may also lead to a reduction in the volume transport of florida current as a result of the weakening north atlantic meridional overturning circulation caesar et al 2018 this could potentially lead to weaker interactions between florida current and the bathymetry and the nonlinear instability both in turn likely lead to reduced upwelling and less vigorous mesoscale activity it is not immediately clear how increased vertical stratification of florida current may affect upwelling or mesoscale processes 4 2 mesoscale eddies versus large scale processes several processes are involved in the current and eddy topography interactions and deep water transport over the pourtalès and miami terraces all of these processes are operating on the background of persistent upwelling due to bottom ekman transport hsueh and o brien 1971 garrett et al 1993 weisberg and he 2003 roughan and middleton 2004 and also topographic steering due to the alongshore changes of bottom topography e g janowitz and pietrafesa 1982 gula et al 2015a b furthermore much of this also depends on the position and orientation of the florida current kourafalou and kang 2012 suggested that eddy formation in the southern florida straits is strongly tied to the latitudinal position of the florida current over the miami terrace our modeled results suggest that the dominant mesoscale process is the island wakes and associated transient eddy production the island wakes and eddy formation however are also likely largely modulated by the meandering and strength of florida current taken together these results indicate the importance of large scale processes in modulating bottom water properties over these deep coral habitats the relative effects of large scale processes and eddies in driving the upwelling or cross shelf transport however have not been quantified here we explore this quantitatively through a correlation analysis between the bottom temperature and relative vorticity at mid depths on the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace fig 15 here we show the results for the two upper slope sites the results for the shallower sites are similar but more complicated due to transport of upwelled waters from upstream we used a lanczos low passed filter to split the variability of these two parameters into high frequency 11 days which is assumed to be due to mesoscale processes the most significant of which is eddies and low frequency 11 days which is largely due to the variability of the florida current position and transport an 11 day cut off is a somewhat arbitrary choice as the time scale separating the low and high frequency this kind of partition is commonly used but does not completely isolate mesoscale effects because the fc meandering may indirectly affect mesoscale activities or vice versa kourafalou and kang 2012 it is worth noting that a previous study indicated that the florida current meandering has two dominant periods 5 and 12 days johns and schott 1987 in the northern florida straits meinen et al 2010 indicated that significant energy for the variability of fc transport lies within the periods of 10 days a longer cut off time e g 15 day does not significantly affect the results of our analysis below see figure s3 it is clear that both low frequency fc variability and mesoscale processes contribute positively negative correlation to the upwelling of cold waters onto the pourtalès terrace the fc meandering however shows somewhat stronger impacts than the eddies on the bottom temperature variability r 0 59 versus r 0 39 respectively by contrast the upwelling over the miami terrace is positively correlated to the relative vorticity the longitudinal position i e when the current core moves closer to the terrace higher relative vorticity the near bottom temperature is higher and vice versa r 0 57 similar influences on temperature anomaly come from short term processes due to the effects of island wakes and the transient eddy positive correlation r 0 58 more specifically high anomaly of relative vorticity positive anomaly indicates that the fc is close to the slope and that there is a lack of wakes associated with the positive temperature anomaly a lack of upwelling on the contrary negative vorticity anomaly indicates a well developed island wake or the presence of the transient eddy associated with strong upwelling negative temperature anomaly these results suggest the important roles of both local physical processes and remote forcing on the bottom carbonate chemistry which is strongly correlated with the bottom temperature particularly for the low frequency variability and or areas over the platforms table 3 however impacts become nonlinear when upwelling is strong and near bottom cold waters at the base of the slope are upwelled to mid slope due to the nonlinear t dic and t ta relationships at the low temperature end for aaiw fig 2 on the other hand changes of water properties t s ta dic in the source areas gom or caribbean seas will affect the bottom water properties in the florida straits the impacts of these however are likely largely on the low frequency variability there is a significant but weak correlation r 0 6 between the bottom water temperature over both the habitats and subsurface temperature in the gulf on the low frequency time scale 11 days whereas no significant correlation is found for high frequency signals not shown 4 3 contributions of biological export and remineralization to bottom carbonate chemistry biological processes including phytoplankton photosynthesis remineralization of organic matter and calcification could also contribute to the change of total co2 and alkalinity in the water column see e g wanninkhof et al 2015 here we only consider the phytoplankton photosynthesis and remineralization which would respectively decrease and increase dic by 1 μ m ol kg per μ mol kg uptake or remineralization assuming these processes follow a 6 625 c n redfield ratio for photosynthesis and remineralization photosynthesis remineralization incorporating releasing nitrate would slightly increase decrease alkalinity by 1 6 625 μ m ol kg per μ mol kg carbon change phytoplankton photosynthesis is low with phytoplankton biomass being typically 4 μ m olc l chlorophyll 1 μ g l due to the limitation of low dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration in the upper layer e g llopiz 2008 figure s2 therefore the variability of this term is unlikely a major factor to the variability of water column dic concentration for near bottom waters over these deep coral reefs there is no photosynthesis and only remineralization of organic carbon takes place our model results indicate that particulate organic carbon poc concentration in the deep waters is typically an order lower than the dissolve organic carbon doc concentration not shown this is consistent with the observed poc concentrations in the upper 150 m along a cross slope transect off jacksonville fl about 100 mile north of our northern boundary during the july 2015 ecoa cruise which indicate a range of 2 6 μ m olc kg https www nodc noaa gov oads data 0157080 xml therefore the overall contribution of poc remineralization to dic is small as for the doc contribution during the transit from the upstream boundary in the gulf of mexico to the southern florida straits we shall expect an increase of dic by 1 δ d i c r d o c d o c δ t where r d o c is the remineralization rate and δ t is the transit time the measured doc concentration was at 40 60 μ m ol kg along the efl transect during the gomecc 2 survey hansel et al 2004 reported a similar range of 40 50 μ m ol kg along the same transect during a survey in january february 1998 leichter et al 2007 surveyed several transects from the keys to offshore up to 250 m water depth in september 11 19 2003 and reported doc concentrations between 40 55 μ m ol kg for waters with temperature between 12 15 c therefore it seems reasonable to assume that near bottom doc concentration has a range of 40 50 μ m ol kg our model results indicate that the near bottom doc concentration in this area is 30 40 μ m ol kg not shown which is lower than the observed value based on our model it takes about 5 10 days for gom water to transit from the model gom boundary to the pourtalès and miami terrace area we assume r d o c 0 01 0 03 day 1 at 10 c water temperature which is lower than the 0 03 day 1 used in fennel et al 2006 therefore based on eq 1 and assuming doc 40 μ m ol kg we shall expect an increase of dic 4 10 μ m ol kg during the transit from the gom during the same transit period a small 1 2 μ m ol kg decrease in ta is expected we have not included the contributions of sediment fluxes to the near bottom dic and alkalinity which may be significant because of active sediment diagenesis and strong sediment transport due to the strong near bottom currents up to 50 cm s that these reefs experience strong currents are expected to be the main mechanism for sediment input from upstream however little is known regarding the related benthic biogeochemical processes 5 summary and conclusions a numerical model was developed to simulate the coupled physical biogeochemical processes on the south florida shelf and in the florida straits and a two year 2011 2012 simulation was carried out built on previous work by pan et al 2017 we further gauge the model performance by comparing the model results with limited available data from two research cruises transport measurements along 27 n and several deployments of two adcp moorings that took place during the model period the results show overall agreement between model output and observations including the magnitudes of high frequency 11 days variability in temperature currents and fc volume transport however there are also discrepancies including over predicting the magnitude of the temporal variability of water properties such as a temperature at the two mooring sites over estimating the bottom w e velocity at the two mooring sites and under predicting the low frequency transport variability one possible reason for these discrepancies is that the model does not fully capture the interactions of low frequency rossby waves with the complex bathymetry in this area due to the model resolution the model reproduces the general vertical structure of key parameters t s ta and dic including the near permanent upwelling over the western slope along the 27 n transect observed during the gomecc 2 survey model results were then used to examine the spatial temporal variability of key physical and carbonate chemistry parameters temperature salinity dic and ta over the pourtalès and miami terraces two large deep coral reef habitats in the florida straits and the associated mesoscale and large scale processes four representative sites were chosen for an analysis of the temporal variability of bottom water properties over the two deep coral habitats the results indicate that the near bottom carbonate chemistry over both the pourtalès and miami terraces is strongly impacted by the meandering of the florida current and associated mesoscale eddies with differing effects in the two areas as a general background the florida current forces strong near bottom upwelling over the pourtalès terrace resulting from bottom ekman transport as the current moves northward and gets closer to the slope the bottom upwelling strengthens and vice versa as reflected in the negative correlation between bottom temperature and relative vorticity mesoscale eddies further enhance the upwelling by lifting up the thermocline along their leading front and eddy center together these processes bring cold co2 rich but low alkalinity deep waters onto the platform the trailing edge of these eddies however drives significant downwelling which leads to significantly warmer temperature and lower co2 concentration on top of the platform over the miami terrace by contrast island wakes behind the sharp topographic change and the frequent spin off of the transient eddy over the pourtalès drift play a dominant role in driving the upwelling of co2 rich deep waters the meandering and transport variability of the florida current together modulate the instability of island wakes and the production of mesoscale eddies at the southern end of the terrace overall stronger upwelling is seen when the florida current shifts eastward away from the slope leading to lower temperature and higher dic concentration over to the upper slope and the platform previous studies suggest the presence of a persistent near bottom countercurrent between 400 700 m in this area our model results did not show this current this is can be either that the model failed to reproduce this current or that the southward flow is part west side of the spin off eddy from the island wakes modeled results suggest that the bottom water masses over the pourtalès terrace and upper miami terrace comprise largely of nacw and aaiw as a result of the complex physical processes however bottom water properties t dic ta on top of both the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace exhibit strong temporal variability over weekly to monthly timescales with a significant range of aragonite saturation state 1 2 2 0 in contrast deeper 400 m areas in the florida straits are flushed with aaiw and the bottom water properties are very stable within the neighborhood of the salinity minimum and with nearly constant aragonite saturation state between 1 2 1 3 the bottom carbonate chemistry in the straits is likely also significantly influenced by changes in the water properties in their sources gom or caribbean through large scale transport and by the biogeochemical processes remineralization of organic matter sediment inputs along the paths our estimate suggests that remineralization may further contribute to a dic increase 4 10 μ m ol kg as waters transit from the gom to the deep coral habitats there is however significant uncertainty in this estimate and it does not take into account the possible sediment fluxes of dic and alkalinity along the transport paths which depends on the mode of loop current and sediment diagenesis processes ocean acidification in the future will likely further reduce the ph and ω ar leading to greater stress on the deep coral reef ecosystems in this region however here we did not directly examine the potential impacts of ocean acidification which would require additional simulations incorporating the long term ocean

23984,abundant and diverse cold water coral and fish communities can be found in the deep waters of the florida straits which are believed to be living under suboptimal conditions impacted by increasing oceanic co2 levels yet little is known regarding the spatial temporal variability of bottom carbonate chemistry parameters and their dynamic drivers in this area to address this issue we present results from numerical simulations of a coupled physical biogeochemical model for the south florida shelf and florida straits our exploratory analysis focuses on two well known deep coral habitats pourtalès terrace 200 450 m and miami terrace 270 600 m results suggest that bottom waters along the northern western slope of the straits are comprised primarily of the north atlantic central water nwcw and antarctic intermediate water aaiw driven by upwelling associated with the bottom ekman transport of the florida current over the pourtalès terrace both the meandering of the florida current and mesoscale eddies modulate the upwelling downwelling of cold warm waters in contrast florida current makes a sharp turn at the southern end of the miami terrace leading to persistent island wakes frequent occurrences of a transient eddy and strong upwelling of deep waters toward the platform of the terrace passage of the transient eddy often accompanies strong downwelling of warm waters and a return southward flow on top of the platform overall bottom water properties including temperature t dissolved inorganic carbon dic and total alkalinity ta show strong variability on weekly to monthly time scales over entire pourtalès terrace and on the platform of miami terrac mostly driven by physics in deeper areas 400 m bottom water properties are fairly stable with both dic and ta showing narrow ranges interestingly waters over the southeastern portion of the pourtalès terrace show consistently warmer temperature lower dic and higher ta than those on top of this terrace the aragonite saturation state ω ranges 1 2 2 on top of the pourtalès terrace and 1 2 1 7 both on top of miami terrace and on the upper slope of pourtalès terrace in the deeper slope areas 400 m it is nearly constant at 1 2 1 3 this modeling effort suggests that remote forcing and biogeochemical processes along the transport paths from the gulf of mexico to the straits are significant but second order contributors to the variability of bottom carbonate chemistry the impacts of benthic biogeochemical processes along the transit paths are not resolved keywords coupled

1 off eastern florida alone it is estimated that deep water coral habitats may extend over 13 440 km2 reed et al 2013 these dsces support diverse and abundant invertebrate and fish communities reed et al 2005 2006 ross and quattrini 2007 and have been increasingly appreciated over the past decades as their extensive footprint is better understood for example the deep water oculina coral reefs off

noaa designated five new deep water chapcs in the seus covering 62 714 km2 noaa 2010 the majority of these dsces occur within continental shelves and slopes which are expected to experience the greatest changes in environmental stressors e g temperature ph due to climate change ocean acidification and deoxygenation on top of the large natural variability as compared to other portions of the deep sea e g mora et al 2013 lunden et al 2014 perez et al 2018 it has been widely recognized that warming water temperatures and increasing co2 pose serious threats to the health of shallow coral reefs e g bellwood et al 2004 kleypas and yates 2009 anthony et al 2011 less attention has been paid to deep water reefs that are already living under high co2 conditions the potential impacts of ocean acidification on deep corals and the deep coral ecosystems remain poorly understood e g hoegh guldberg et al 2017 limited experimental studies focused mainly on the growth and calcification

potential impacts may also include metabolism reproduction capability and the dissolution of coral reefs structures thus it is important to better characterize the current mean state and variability of bottom carbonate chemistry over deep water reefs significant progress has been made in observing environmental conditions of dsces including hydrodynamic and biogeochemical conditions e g mienis et al 2012 2014 lunden et al 2013 ross et al 2015 georgian et al 2016b yet information about carbonate chemistry conditions over the dsces remains scarce this limits our capability to properly understand the potential threat of rising oceanic co2 to these communities limited studies suggest that the aragonite saturation state ω ar is only marginally higher than 1 0 over the shelf slope in the gulf of mexico gom and the straits of florida regions lunden et al 2013 wang et al 2013 wanninkhof et al 2015 the three gulf of mexico and east coast carbon cruises gomecc 1 2 3 conducted in july 2007 2012 and 2017 respectively surveyed the same transect 27 n in the northern florida straits yielding very similar ω ar measurements with values near the sea floor being only slightly higher than 1 for example the minimum ω ar was 1 19 and 1 36 respectively for the west and east florida slope during gomecc2 thus progressive ocean acidification poses a significant threat to deep coral reefs by further lowering ph and reducing the availability of carbonate ions co 3 2 particularly for aragonite which is incorporated into scleractinian skeletons cohen and holcomb 2009 perez et al 2018 deep reef systems in this region are subjected to strong physical disturbances including upwelling eddy entrainment and mixing and the meandering of the florida current fc in the straits of florida the fc is the dominant current with speeds that can exceed 2 m s 1 this current originates from the loop current lc in the gom and feeds into the gulf stream in the south atlantic bight the fc impinges on the shelf of the florida keys and its core is mainly situated over the northwestern slope of the straits with persistent upwelling driven by the current induced bottom ekman transport e g pietrafesa 1990 garrett et al 1993 the fc also exhibits mesoscale meanders with periods of 5 and 12 days and with wavelengths of respectively 170 and 340 km johns and schott 1987 which can substantially vary the bottom temperature salinity and velocities over these timescales the fc also generates mesoscale 30 100 km cyclonic eddies and sub mesoscale 10 30 km features along the shelf break e g lee 1975 lee and mayer 1977 lee et al 1995 fratantoni et al 1998 these dynamic features can further drive strong upwelling of co2 rich cold waters up the slope and onto the shelf e g smith 1981 pitts and smith

dissolved inorganic carbon dic total alkalinity ta ph and ω ar in the deep waters of the florida straits using a newly developed coupled physical biogeochemical model and in situ measurements from shipboard surveys and bottom moorings we focus on two key coral habitats the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace e g reed et al 2013 2014 the pourtalès terrace lies in the southern slope of the florida keys at depths between 200 450 m and a maximum width of 32 km this 213 km long terrace consists of extensive high relief hard bottom and essential fish habitats covering 3429 km2 fig 1 the southeastern flank of this terrace between 81 12 80 24 w is located in the lee of florida current and is a chapc benthic communities on this terrace are dominated by stylasterid hydrocorals gorgonian alcyonaceans black corals and sponges the scleractinian corals include lophelia pertusa enallopsammia profunda madracis myriaster madrepora oculata solenosmilia variabilis and dendrophylliidae and one l pertusa mound was recently discovered on the terrace slope reed et al 2005 2014 the fish communities consist of 62 species including eleven commercially and recreationally important fish species reed et al 2014 to the north of the pourtalès terrace is the miami terrace 25 18 26 30 n which extends 145 km long at depths from 275 to 600 m the terrace covers 2329 km2 and has similar benthic biota as pourtalès terrace and lophelia enallopsammia coral mounds and coral rubble are common at the foot of the escarpment reed et al 2006 vinick et al 2012 the objectives of this manuscript are two fold 1 further assessment of model skills in simulating the deep water upwelling mesoscale eddies and near bottom water properties in the florida straits and 2 characterization of spatial temporal variability of bottom water properties especially carbonate chemistry and controlling processes including mesoscale eddies and current meandering the numerical model and in situ data used for assessing model skills are described in section 2 model results including a comparison with in situ data key physical and carbonate chemistry features and the variability of near bottom water properties are presented in section 3 in section 4 key controlling processes for this variability are discussed including meso and submesoscale eddies and associated upwelling large scale transport and mixing and biogeochemical processes such as local export and remineralization of organic carbon finally some concluding remarks are made in section 5 2 methods 2 1 model the numerical model is based on the regional ocean modeling system roms a three dimensional primitive equation ocean model system e g shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 the model domain covers the south florida shelf florida

momentum equations and tracers are third order upstream for horizontal advection and fourth order centered difference for vertical advection vertical turbulent mixing is computed with the generic length scale gls turbulent closure umlauf and burchard 2003 a uniform horizontal and viscosity and mixing coefficient of 10 m2 s were applied on the geopotential surfaces haidvogel and beckmann 1999

continental shelf particularly shallow areas model sst is relaxed to observed daily sst from satellite observed sst http podaac jpl nasa gov the modeled period was chosen as 2011 2012 more details for the physical model can be found in pan et al 2017 unlike the previous simulations reported in pan et al 2017 the model bathymetry cut off is now 2000 m instead of 1500 m the physical model is coupled with a biogeochemical model developed by fennel et al 2006 2008 with some modifications made to parameter values see table 1 this model has 6 functional groups that describe the nitrogen cycle through the lower food web nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 phytoplankton zooplankton small detritus and large detritus chlorophyll is a diagnostic variable based on the phytoplankton chlorophyll to carbon ratio which is computed following the light acclimation model by geider et al 1997 it also includes dic dissolved oxygen do and ta in our implementation we adjusted some key parameters such as light attenuation and half saturation constants table 1 in order to better simulate deep ocean phytoplankton dynamics including the reproduction of the deep chlorophyll maximum the simulation of the carbon cycle largely follows the nitrogen cycle with a fixed redfield carbon to nitrogen ratio of 6 625 the air sea co2 flux is determined by the air sea partial pressure of co2 pco2 multiplied by the gas transfer or piston velocity which is computed following the formulation of wanninkhof 1992 alkalinity is assumed to be unaffected by air sea gas exchange of co2 but instead altered by a number of biogeochemical processes including calcite formation and dissolution nitrate uptake and regeneration and sulfate reduction in this model only the nitrate uptake and remineralization of organic nitrogen are included based on the model output ph and ω ar were computed from dic and ta using a matlab co2sys package with k1 and k2 constants from mehrbach et al 1973 and k so4 from dickson 1990 see lewis and wallace 1998 van heuven et al 2011 the biogeochemical parameters in the river inputs to the model include nutrients no3 nh4 dissolved organic matter dic and ta there are only very limited measurements for biogeochemical parameters in the rivers for simplicity in this simulation we used constant values 5 μ m ol l for no3 4 μ m ol l for nh4 120 μ m ol kg for doc 2100 μ m ol kg for dic and 2300 μ m ol kg for ta based on the available data compiled by the south florida water management district http my sfwmd gov dbhydroplsql show dbkey info main menu this choice will affect the biogeochemical results including nutrients phytoplankton biomass dic and ta in nearshore and coastal areas but we do not expect it to significantly affect water properties in the offshore areas particularly bottom waters in the florida straits where river influences are minimal construction of more detailed river inputs is currently underway the boundary conditions for nitrate dic and ta were prescribed based on their respective nonlinear regressions with temperature derived from observed concentrations along the west florida slope transect during gomecc2 cruise fig 2 the boundary temperature field was derived from gomex model output as described above the assumption is that these water properties along the western boundary are generally similar because all waters in the gom come from the subtropical north atlantic through the caribbean sea rivas et al 2005 local physical biogeochemical processes will undoubtedly modify the water properties there is insufficient information to specify more details e g spatial gradients along the boundary the no3 dic and ta concentrations are all strong correlated with both the temperature and salinity as observed along the western florida shelf slope during gomecc2 cruise figure s1 yet both the no3 and dic correlations with temperature r 0 99 no3 and r 0 98 for dic were much stronger than those with salinity r 0 93 for no3 and r 0 9 for dic while the ta correlation with temperature was similar with that with salinity therefore temperature was used to construct the model boundary conditions for the no3 dic and ta the boundary conditions for other biogeochemical variables are derived from the output of the coupled roms cosine carbon silicon nitrogen ecosystem model developed by dr chai at the university of maine chai pers comm the cosine model was originally developed for the pacific ocean but was adapted for the northwest atlantic ocean xiu and chai 2014 the model consists of 31 state variables describing 3 types of nutrients n p si 3 phytoplankton functional groups picoplankton diatoms and coccolithophorids 2 size classes of zooplankton microzooplankton mesozooplankton bacteria several groups of organic matter dissolved oxygen do total alkalinity and tco2 the model was coupled with a 7 km roms model with a domain covering the northwest atlantic region including the gulf of mexico a 50 yr 1957 2007 simulation of the coupled model has been performed and the physical model has been calibrated indicating satisfactory model skills including capturing the gulf stream dynamics kang and curchitser 2013 no systematic calibration or validation however has yet been made for the biogeochemical simulation we used the biogeochemical results from the last two years 2006 2007 an arbitrary choice to derive biogeochemical boundary conditions for our modeling period 2011 2012 because the roms cosine simulation for this period is not available we do not however expect this temporal miss match to significantly impact model calculations as the three key parameters nitrate dic and ta were specified separately from the cosine results at present we have no sufficient observed data for specifying other biological variables pon poc don doc plankton biomass in the gulf of mexico the justification of our choices for these boundary parameters is provided in the supplement materials which include a figure showing the temporal variability of key biogeochemical variables along the western boundary on the west florida slope figure s3 the time mismatch in boundary conditions and lack of validation of the biological parameters means that the results should be viewed with a degree of uncertainty due to the previously mentioned factors as much of the carbon dynamics are driven by well constrained physical variability in the domain the processes and patterns are representative of actual conditions 2 2 data extensive model calibration has been performed for the physical model using available data from various sources pan et al 2017 in this manuscript we compare model results with data collected in the florida straits from four sources which have not been used in the calibration by pan et al 2017 1 integrated transport between west palm beach and grand bahamas island between 26 27 n through the northern florida straits meinen et al 2010 2 the second florida shelf edge experiment flosee

current profilers adcps at two mooring stations on the miami terrace fig 1 we also compare the model output of biogeochemical variables with limited data collected during the flosee and gomecc2 cruises the transport by florida current through the northern florida straits has been measured using various methods at around 27 n here we use the estimates based on the voltage change to a submarine telephone cable due to the current induced changes in magnetic field which covered various periods from 1970 to present meinen et al 2010 the transport was calibrated with the more accurate estimates based on the time lapse of a free falling dropsonde at a series of stations across the straits that took place about once per month niiler and richardson 1973 garcia and meinen 2014 tidal signals were removed from the final transport estimate the flosee cruise onboard the noaa ship nancy foster focused on the pulley ridge mesophotic coral reef ecosystem on the southwest florida shelf with the objective of studying the potential impacts of the deepwater horizon oil spill event on south florida coral reefs reed et al 2012 in addition to benthic surveys e g coral species video of benthic habitats images from side scan sonars with a remotely operated vehicle rov a bluefin spray glider was deployed for measuring water properties t s over the outer shelf of the southwest florida shelf see pan et al 2017 traditional ctd casts were also made over pulley ridge the pourtalès terrace 4 stations and southern slope off key west 1 station fig 1 water properties measured using a sea bird 911plus ctd rosette system included temperature salinity turbidity fluorescence ph and dissolve oxygen do collected data were binned into 1 m depth intervals for this manuscript we only used the data from the ctd stations over the pourtalès terrace the gomecc cruises were funded by noaa s ocean acidification program oap with cruises conducted in summers of 2007 2012 and 2017 to measure hydrological and carbonate chemistry parameters in the gulf of mexico and u s east coast only first two cruises wang et al 2013 wanninkhof et al 2015 these cruises covered the gom and us east coast with 18 transects that ran from the coast to deep oceans two other noaa sponsored cruises east coast ocean acidification ecoa i and ii were conducted in 2015 and 2018 respectively which occupied most of the gomecc stations on the east coast but with more detailed surveys in some selected coastal areas during all of these cruises a number of physical biogeochemical parameters were measured with bottled samples including temperature t salinity s chlorophyll chl macro nutrients dic ta and do among others the analysis for chlorophyll samples was limited to the upper 250 m results from the first and second gomecc cruises can be found in wang et al 2013 and wanninkhof et al 2015 respectively yang et al 2015 examined the variability of total alkalinity in the northeastern gulf of mexico using the gomecc2 data and other historical measurements here we will use the data from the bottle samples collected between july 22 august 13 2012 during gomecc2 along two transects that are located inside our model domain transect 1 extending from tampa bay to the shelf break hereafter referred to as wfl and transect 2 across the northern florida straits hereafter referred to as efl along the ft pierce fl segment at 27 n fig 1 these data indicate strong nonlinear correlations between temperature dic ta and no3 especially below the thermocline fig 2 in order to corroborate bottom water masses we also use a portion of the data along a22 transect 70 65 w of the woce survey which took place in march 24 april 17 2012 http whp atlas ucsd edu atlantic index htm data used below were from stations 66 81 between 12 36 16 19 7 n which were within the caribbean current that feeds into the gulf of mexico to further evaluate the model predictions particularly on the temporal dimension we compare model output with observed time series of near bottom 12 m above the sea floor temperatures and current profiles between 2009 and 2015 adcp moorings have been periodically deployed on the northern miami terrace latitude 26 4 n at 4 locations from 260 m to 640 m fig 1 two temperature time series collected from moorings t2 b2 320 m total water depth and t3 b3 290 m total water depth and one water velocity time series measured from mooring t2 b2 measurement depth of 156 m are utilized in this study it is noted that the temperature sensor elevation above the sea floor 12 m is similar to the water depth of the first model layer from the bottom for more details about these instruments and measurements please see machado et al 2016 3 results 3 1 model skills extensive calibration of the physical model has been conducted using the following four datasets pan et al 2017 1 flosee ship deployed ctd data 2 ctd measurements onboard a spray glider during two month long surveys over western florida shelf 3 satellite altimetry measured sea surface height ssh and 4 satellite infrared imaged sea surface temperature sst results indicate that the model is able to reproduce the spatial temporal variability of water properties as well as key dynamic processes including lc fc dynamics formation and propagation of mesoscale eddies associate with the current instability interactions between eddies and the shelf slope and upwelling associated with the eddies and lc fc meandering e g johns and schott 1987 kourafalou and kang 2012 this previous comparison however focuses on the west florida shelf particularly in the pulley ridge area here we provide an additional assessment on the model skills with a focus on the florida straits figs 2 6 the relevant statistics of these model data comparisons are shown in table 2 where the last column shows the mean model data differences along with the confidence interval based on the paired student t test we first present the comparison between model and observed transport at 27 n fig 3 the result indicates that the model captures the magnitude of volume transport along this section with mean transport at 30 3 versus 31 2 m3 s both are close to recent estimates of the mean transport however for unclear reasons the model under estimates the variability of volume transport on a monthly timescale fig 3a modeled variability of volume transport on shorter timescales 11 day due to meso and submesoscale activities is similar to measured data with standard deviation std at 0 8 m3 s for model versus 1 1 m3 s for data fig 3b model volume transport also has a weak correlation with measured data with the correlation coefficient r 0 19 p 0 05 and r 0 27 p 0 01 respectively for the low frequency 11 day and high frequency 11 day components a comparison of model and observed key parameters from july 30 31 2012 along the gomecc 2 efl transect is shown in fig 4 both modeled results and observations indicate strong bottom upwelling of cold and relatively low salinity waters along the western slope left side of the current looking downstream of the transect as shown in the upward tilting of the isotherms and isopleths of other water properties this is consistent with the well known feature of the florida current that its main axis is located mid slope on the west side of the straits e g seim et al 1999 the modeled upwelling in this instance however is weaker than the observations with the modeled temperature of the upper slope water about 3 c warmer than the measurements fig 4a and b upwelling was unusually strong during the gomecc 2 cruise zhang et al 2017 on average however model temperature along this transect is only about 0 3 c lower than the observed which is not statistically significant table 2 the model is also able to reproduce the general pattern of salinity including the high salinity subsurface layer between 50 300 m along the central right flank of the florida current which represents the north atlantic salinity maximum waters smw from the subtropical north atlantic ocean see e g roson et al 2003 modeled salinity over the upper western slope is higher than the observed salinity by about 0 25 psu but the average modeled salinity along this transect agrees well with observations both model temperature and salinity show a strong point to point correlation with data r 0 93 and 0 65 respectively table 2 a comparison between model and observed key biogeochemical parameters dic nitrate and ta along the same transect tells a similar story fig 4e j the model reproduces the general patterns and ranges of these parameters however over the upper slope modeled no3 and dic concentrations are lower than the observed zhang et al 2017 whereas modeled alkalinity is about 10 20 μ m ol kg higher than the observed fig 4i j in accord with higher observed upwelling the point to point correlation coefficients and root mean square error rmse between the model and observed values are respectively 0 9 and 4 5 μ m ol kg for nitrate 0 96 and 20 4 μ m ol kg for dic and 0 69 and 18 4 μ m ol kg for ta table 2 on average modeled dic is 8 μ m ol kg higher than the observed and modeled ta is 10 μ m ol kg higher than the observed the gomecc measurement errors for dic and ta are respectively 2 μ m ol kg and 4 μ m ol kg therefore we believe these mismatches are mostly due to model biases only a subset of water samples was analyzed for chlorophyll concentration along this transect the data also clearly shows a subsurface maximum with increasing depth at around 30 m at the shelf edge to 100 m offshore generally in agreement with the model vertical distribution the overall a point to point correlation between model and data is r 0 37 p 0 01 and r 0 74 after excluding a few outlier see figure s2 the temporal variability of model temperature and current fields are compared with data collected from two adcp moorings t2 and t3 fig 5 overall the model reproduces near bottom temporal patterns e g dominant periods reasonably well over weekly to monthly timescales a simple spectral analysis indicates that the model and observed bottom temperatures at t2 and t3 have very similar power spectra with no obvious peak at low frequency 11 day but prominent peaks at the 7 day period for high frequency variability 11 days not shown modeled and observed temperatures at both locations have similar magnitudes in high frequency variability fig 5a b the model and observed stds are 0 52 and 0 67 c respectively at t2 and 0 66 versus 0 68 c respectively at t3 the model however over estimates the magnitudes of low frequency variability at both locations as reflected in the differences between modeled and observed standard deviations table 2 the model and observed n svelocities at t2 agree on the short term variability in terms of both mean values and the amplitude of variability fig 5c e table 2 moreover in the upper layer modeled n s velocity strongly correlates with observed values e g r 0 66 at 68 m however the model data correlation decreases with depth both model and observed e w velocities show a persistent eastward component but the model average is only about 50 60 of the observed fig 5 d f table 2 also the observed e w velocity shows much stronger variability than the modeled comparisons of modeled and observed currents at other depths above this same location and at two other mooring sites yield similar conclusions not shown as another check on modeled vertical structures of water properties we compared model and observed temperature and salinity profiles at several stations over the pourtalès terrace during the flosee survey table 2 modeled temperature agrees well with these measured data with a correlation coefficient r 0 97 however the model data agreement for salinity is less strong r 0 75 in particular the model under estimates salinity by 0 3 0 6 psu in the upper 150 m modeled chlorophyll profiles show a prominent subsurface chlorophyll maximum scm at all of the flosee stations whose depth is quite variable between stations no direct comparison however was made for the modeled chlorophyll with flosee data which only reported fluorescence the observed fluorescence however shows a consistent depth of maximum at 65 m for all of these comparisons model skills are quantitatively evaluated with three metrics correlation coefficient r standard deviation std and normalized root mean squared error rmse these can be summarized with the taylor diagram as shown in fig 6 taylor 2001 here a is the reference point representing the perfect match between model and data and other letters represent the cases evaluated table 2 the closer the triad is to a the better model skill it is clear that the poorest agreement is from the comparison with mooring data cases k p indicating the challenge of the model in reproducing both the phase and magnitude of the temporal variability on small scales overall this diagram indicates a reasonable performance of the model 3 2 upwelling driven by florida current and mesoscale eddies florida current typically tilts up to the left flank due to the bottom ekman transport and associated geostrophic adjustment fig 4 in a steady state bottom friction acting on the current would lead to bottom ekman transport which moves to the left of the current and drives near bottom upwelling of nutrient rich cold waters up the slope hsueh and o brien 1971 garrett et al 1993 seim et al 1999 zhang et al 2017 thus upwelling or downwelling due to current meandering and eddies will be superimposed on this background because variability in the florida current or the presences of eddies will change bottom ekman transport leading to enhanced upwelling or reduced upwelling i e downwelling moreover upwelling generally accompanies strong and persistent phytoplankton blooms near the slope area e g llopiz 2008 which is also seen from our model results not shown the export of the organic matter produced in these blooms can be critical food sources for the abundant deep corals found in the straits the formation and evolution of mesoscale and sub mesoscale eddies associated with the fc have been well documented e g lee 1975 lee and mayer 1977 lee et al 1995 fratantoni et al 1998 kourafalou and kang 2012 richardson et al 2009 elongated mesoscale and sub mesoscale eddies with low temperatures near their cores are frequently produced locally or pass through this area elevated chlorophyll concentrations are frequently observed along the edge and near the center of these eddies using satellite images e g kourafalou and kang 2012 this model is able to produce similar mesoscale and sub mesoscale eddies in the straits although sub mesoscale activities might be under represented in the model because of its relatively coarse model resolution 1 5 km we will focus on mesoscale eddies in the following sections modeled results suggest mesoscale eddies could have significant impacts on bottom water properties over the pourtalès terrace as an example we present a series of currents maps at 150 m and bottom temperature over the pourtalès terrace fig 7 left as well as the companion vertical distributions of temperature and along channel w e velocity along the 81 w transect across the shelf slope of pourtalès terrace fig 7 right between february 16 25 2012 a mesoscale eddy passes through the area fig 7c e g on feb 4 2012 before the eddy bottom temperature and 150 m currents indicate persistent cross slope transport at the western end of the pourtalès terrace leading to cold waters 10 c residing over the inner side of the platform fig 7a b this is in addition to the upwelling driven by the bottom ekman transport induced by the florida current as noted above as a result bottom temperature over the outer slope of the terrace is typically warmer than on the platform on feb 16 2012 an eddy is seen encountering the western edge of the terrace which appears to have blocked cold water intrusion onto the inner platform but instead brings deep water directly through the outer slope fig 7c d the eddy takes about one week to propagate through the terrace both the leading front and eddy center drive strong upwelling uplifting the isopycnals and flushing the terrace with deep cold waters fig 7e f after the eddy passes through the area significant downwelling takes place along the trailing edge of the eddy which flattens the thermocline and the western part of the terrace is covered with warmer waters 16 c fig 7g h thus the temperature change over the terrace before and after the passage of the eddy is 3 7 c an examination of model results over the two year period suggests that similar events have happened 3 times in 2011 and 4 times in 2012 all occurring during spring and fall seasons 3 3 island wakes around the miami terrace the dynamics of currents bathymetry interactions over the miami terrace is different from those over the pourtalès terrace this can be illustrated with a series of temperature and currents maps at 300 m fig 8 left panels and temperature and n s water velocity maps along a cross slope transect at 25 25 n fig 8 right panel for february 14 24 2012 in this area the florida current changes its direction from northeastward to northward and therefore the current axis often meanders significantly in the upper layer however the florida current typically follows the nearly straight n s shelf slope thus strong upwelling is primarily due to the bottom ekman transport in deeper areas the bathymetry contour takes a sharp turn from northeast to north at around 25 12 n and then another turn to the east at around 25 45 n as a result the left flank of the florida current frequently overshoots creating island wakes with an area of low flow and significant upwelling over the pourtalès drift an area between 25 n and the miami terrace fig 8c f consistent with our results kourafalou and kang 2012 also found that stronger upwelling takes place in this area as the core of the current shifts eastward away from the western slope unlike their analysis which focused on the top 200 m our focus here is deeper areas clearly the upwelled cold deep waters will be transported downstream toward the terrace this effect can be illustrated in fig 9 which shows the maps of bottom temperature and currents fig 9 left panels and temperature and n s velocity along a cross slope transect at the south end of the miami terrace 25 40 n fig 9 right panel during the same period as in fig 8 it is notable that the overshoot of florida current on february 18 2012 leads to a cyclonic eddy of approximately 20 km wide and 50 km long in the wakes along with strong upwelling that further uplifts the thermocline fig 9c d the eddy propagates slowly downstream but only lasts a few days disappearing within a 30 40 km distance of the spawning area fig 9e f an examination of modeled results over the 2 year period indicates frequent occurrences of this eddy approximately once per week each lasting about 2 5 days the occurrence of this eddy significantly affects the bottom water properties over the miami terrace without an eddy bottom water temperature on the platform is typically 2 4 c warmer than over the slope fig 9a b when an eddy is present both the isothermals over the center and along the leading edge of the eddy are further uplifted fig 8d f and 9d f allowing more upwelling of cold waters over the platform and reducing the bottom temperature fig 9c f as the eddy propagates downstream it induces significant downwelling of warmer upper layer waters in its wake fig 9g h sometimes a return flow at between 200 300 m water depth is present likely due to the geostrophic adjustment soloviev et al 2017 also noted the presences of an intermittent countercurrent down to 244 m over the miami terrace island wakes and associated upwelling of deep cold waters are ubiquitous phenomena when oceanic currents encounter topographic obstacles in the deep oceans e g dong et al 2007 in our case this is largely a subsurface phenomenon because the wakes and eddy are mostly below the thermocline several previous studies have reported that a countercurrent southward existed between 400 700 m and 25 40 n 25 50 n based on data collected at moorings and from auv surveys düing and johnson 1971 lee and mooers 1977 correa et al 2012 the maximum speed of the countercurrent can sometimes exceed 50 cm s and the current can extend vertically about 200 m above the bottom submersible dives on the coral mounds at the foot of the terrace show that their steeper slopes and live coral colonies tend to occur on the northern slopes of the mounds correa et al 2012 this is evidence of fairly persistent southerly currents as elsewhere in the straits the coral growth is on the current facing south slopes of the mounds our model results however do not show such a persistent countercurrent rather reverse currents on the western side of transient eddy occur frequently over a broad area between 400 700 m and spanning 20 30 km in n s distance however these earlier surveys are either relying on spatially sparse stations lee and mooers 1977 or limited to small areas of auv mapping or a few mooring stations thus while it is possible that the model missed producing this countercurrent another possibility is that what they observed is the return currents along the west side of a cyclonic eddy 3 4 bottom dic and ta distributions modeled variability of near bottom carbonate chemistry is closely associated with the physical processes particularly upwelling of deep cold waters in fact the bottom dic pattern largely mirrors bottom temperature while bottom ta pattern largely follows temperature because of the nearly opposite relationships between ta and dic to temperature in these waters i e lower temperature corresponding to lower ta but higher dic within the range of the bottom temperature in these areas 8 c t 16 c fig 2b c we focus on bottom and cross sectional dic distributions on the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace during the same periods as shown in figs 7 9 figs 10 11 during normal situations without the presences of eddies cold dic rich waters cover most of the pourtalès terrace with the exception being the southeastern flank due to persistent upwelling noted above fig 10a b the passage of a mesoscale eddy clearly brings more deep water onto the terrace increasing the spatial coverage of high dic waters including flooding the southeastern part of the terrace fig 10e f after the eddy passes downwelling brings warm and reduced dic waters over western part of the terrace fig 10g h in the deeper areas 400 m where temperature is lower than 12 c however there is little change in dic concentration over time and space fig 10 right panels this is because within this temperature range 4 12 c waters are within the salinity minimum zone fig 2a and both dic and ta concentrations are in the neighborhood of their local extrema with a narrow range of variations 25 μ m ol kg over the miami terrace bottom dic concentrations are also closely associated with bottom temperature following the development of island wakes and the upwelling of deep cold waters fig 11 when the transient eddy is not present upwelling is already strong and high dic waters cover much of the terrace but the outer edge of the platform is covered by relatively warmer water with lower dic concentration fig 11a b when an eddy is formed in the wakes strengthened upwelling brings up more cold dic rich waters and the entire terrace is flushed with high dic waters fig 11c f similarly the downwelling after the passage of the eddy reduces the dic concentrations over the much of the terrace fig 11g h yet again there is little change 10 μ m ol kg in dic concentrations over the deeper areas 400 m where temperature is lower than 12 c fig 11 right panels 3 5 temporal variability of bottom water properties in order to understand the temporal variability of bottom water properties we chose four representative locations one on the platform 160 m and another on upper slope 296 m below the platform of the pourtalès terrace one on the platform 280 m and another on the upper slope 417 m of the miami terrace fig 1 the time series of t s dic and ta concentrations and aragonite saturation at these locations are shown in fig 12 the modeled results suggest somewhat larger ranges of temperature 8 17 9 c on top of the platform than that 8 2 14 2 c over the upper slope over the pourtalès terrace fig 12a b the salinity shows a similar range 35 1 35 8 psu at both locations it is interesting to note that bottom temperature on the platform of the pourtalès terrace is normally lower than that over the upper slope area throughout the modeling period except during a few episodic events spatially the warmer area generally covers the southeast part of the terrace between 200 m and 400 m isobaths fig 7a c a close examination indicates most of the events are due to the passage of mesoscale eddies which first induce strong upwelling along the leading fronts to greatly reduce the bottom temperature over the upper slope fig 7c f and then drive strong downwelling along their trailing edges to greatly increase temperature on the platform fig 7g h the bottom temperature and salinity changes during these events can be up to 6 c and 0 6 psu respectively at both locations in comparison both bottom temperature and salinity on the platform of the miami terrace also show strong temporal variability with a temperature range of 6 14 5 c and a salinity range of 34 9 35 9 psu fig 12a b overall waters at this location are 2 4 c colder and fresher than waters on both the platform and upper slope of pourtalès terrace even though the water depth here is comparable to the upper slope site of pourtalès terrace suggesting stronger impacts of upwelling due to the island wakes and associated eddies at the deeper site 417 m both temperature and salinity are very stable showing little changes over time 6 c t 9 7 c 34 9 s 35 3 bottom temperature and salinity at the two sites on the miami terrace are quite similar except during a few downwelling events when temperature and salinity on the platform increase up to 6 c and 0 75 psu and during a prolonged warm period 2012 from mid august through the end of november those downwelling events typically last from a few days to more than 1 week mostly due to the passage of transient eddies spun off from the island wakes the temporal variability of near bottom dic and ta concentrations are also closely associated with water movements as seen in figs 7 10 fig 12c d both dic and ta concentrations on the platform of pourtalès terrace show a wide range on short term weekly 2140 2 210 μ m ol kg for dic and 2305 2 360 μ m ol kg for ta respectively in contrast both dic and ta show much narrower ranges 30 μ m ol kg over the upper slope of the pourtalès terrace consistent with the variability of bottom temperature bottom dic ta concentration on the platform is normally higher lower than that over the upper slope area throughout the modeling period except during a few episodic events such as when an eddy passes through the area this is consistent with the spatial pattern seen in fig 10a and c which show that waters with relatively low dic concentration cover much of the southeastern part of the terrace between 200 m and 400 m isobaths coincidently this relatively low dic area overlaps with most of the noaa designated hapc for the pourtalès terrace e g reed et al 2013 on the platform of the miami terrace dic and ta concentrations show somewhat larger ranges 45 μ m ol kg for dic and 35 μ m ol kg for ta than those on the upper slope of pourtalès terrace on the upper slope of the miami terrace both parameters are fairly stable with a narrow range 10 μ m ol kg throughout the modeling period in deep areas 400 m bottom values of these two parameters are effectively constant throughout the straits as shown in figs 10 11 a simply correlation analysis of these time series indicates that temperature alone explains 76 of low frequency variability in bottom dic and ta in these areas except for the upper slope of miami terrace 56 for both dic and ta for short term high frequency variability temperature explains 64 of dic and ta short term variability for the two sites on the platform of the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace see table 3 the correlations between high frequency t and dic variability for the two upper slope sites of the terraces are either weak or non existent reflecting the low dic range 15 μ m ol kg for these water masses fig 2b in contrast the t ta correlation for the high frequency variability remains strong r 0 92 on the upper slope of the pourtalès terrace however it is significantly weaker at r 0 69 on the upper slope of the miami terrace we note that these ranges of temperature variations particularly at those stations on top of the platforms of both terraces may be somewhat exaggerated based on the model data comparisons at the t2 and t3 mooring stations and assuming the model performances over these two terraces are similar we can roughly estimate the variability of bottom temperature measured with the standard deviation at the two stations on top of the platforms pt 160m and mt 280m are roughly over predicted by 20 30 however we do not have data to gauge the performance of temperature simulation in deeper areas given the modeled temperature ranges are smaller in these areas we shall expect less model biases from the modeled temperature at the two deeper stations pt 296m and mt 417m both dic and ta show nearly linear relationships with the temperature within the modeled temperature ranges at the two stations on top of the platforms pt 160m and mt 280m thus the over predictions of dic and ta ranges at these two stations are likely similar to that of temperature at 20 30 in deeper areas pt 296m and mt 417m both the dic and ta relationships with temperature are much weaker within the temperature ranges 6 12 c at these depths see e g fig 2 therefore we shall expect the model over prediction of dic and ta ranges in these areas are likely small the temporal variability of t dic and ta over the pourtalès terrace leads to significant variability in ω ar with the annual range between 1 2 2 fig 11e on top of the miami terrace ω ar shows a similar pattern but with a smaller annual range between 1 2 1 7 on the upper slope of the pourtalès terrace the ω ar ranges 1 3 1 6 whereas on the upper slope of the miami terrace and all of the deeper area 400 m ω ar is nearly constant between 1 2 1 3 throughout the year the narrow range of ω a for deep waters is associated with the narrow ranges of ta and dic concentrations around the salinity minimum interestingly ω ar is also strongly correlated with temperature r 0 81 for both low and high frequencies at all of the sites except for the upper slope site of the miami terrace where the correlation is strong at low frequency r 0 74 but much weaker for high frequency r 0 57 table 3 as noted above the variability of the key variables t dic ta for ω ar is somewhat over predicted for the two shallower stations pt 160m and mt 280m assuming a 20 over prediction of temperature dic and ta variability measured as std see table 1 a simple calculation using co2sys lewis and wallace 1998 van heuven et al 2011 suggests that the variability of ω ar may have also been over predicted by 20 for the two deeper stations pt 296m and mt 417m assuming a 10 over prediction of temperature would mean 5 over prediction of dic and ta variability because the dic t and ta t relationships are mostly flat for the temperature ranges experienced at these stations 6 12 c therefore we shall expect the predicted ranges of ω ar at these stations are fairly close to the actual range because small change in temperature alone does not change ω ar very much in brief variability of water masses over these terraces driven by meso scale eddies and fc meandering are strongest during spring and fall of the model period and their impacts on the ω ar variability are significant for the areas on top of the terraces but likely small for deeper areas 3 6 bottom distribution of aragonite saturation state ω a r to further understand the bottom carbonate chemistry in these deep coral habitats we present the annual mean bottom ω ar value and its standard deviation for 2012 which were computed based on the daily bottom ω ar derived from bottom temperature salinity dic and ta fig 13 the results for 2011 are very similar not shown model results indicate dynamic upper slope regions including the platform and upper slope areas where fc meandering eddies and associated upwelling downwelling all contribute to the variability of bottom water properties and relatively stable lower slope regions on top of the platforms of both terraces between approximately 200 400 m ω ar is typically higher than 1 4 due to the presence of deep cold waters ω ar is relatively low over the inner platform of pourtalès terrace and southern miami terrace in contrast the ω ar value over the southeastern part of pourtalès terrace and northern part of miami terrace is significantly higher these are the areas less affected by upwelling driven by bottom ekman transport and island wakes as discussed above on average the slope regions for the two terraces experience low to moderate aragonite saturation between 1 4 and 2 fig 12a consistent with the variability of bottom water properties aragonite saturation on the platforms of both terraces and over the upper slope 400 m regions shows much more variability than in deeper areas fig 13b 4 discussion the modeled results indicate that the variability of bottom water properties including carbonate chemistry in the florida straits particularly over the two deep coral habitats is strongly affected by the movements of deep waters such as upwelling and downwelling these upwelling and downwelling events are due to mesoscale processes and meandering of the florida current and are also influenced by water properties in the source waters in the following we first discuss the bottom water masses in the florida straits and then evaluate the respective roles of mesoscale eddies large scale transport and biogeochemical processes in these variability 4 1 bottom water masses over the deep coral habitats water masses in the florida straits are ultimately derived from the caribbean current which becomes the lc as it enters the gom through yucatan channel rivas et al 2005 the lc either flows directly into the florida straits or loops into the northern gom its recirculation loop impinges on the florida shelf near the dry tortugas gordon 1967 and becomes the fc in the southern straits of florida therefore depending on the mode of the loop current water properties in the fc may more closely resemble gom waters or caribbean waters to date there are no reported measurements for dic and ta concentrations in the caribbean waters thus we assume that their values are similar to those observed in the northern gom fig 14 also see fig 2 based on the t s diagrams for the gomecc2 survey along the wfl and efl transect and our modeled results at the four chosen sites over the two deep coral habitats it is clear that bottom waters over these habitats primarily comprise of two types of water masses the north atlantic central water nacw 10 c t 16 c 35 2 s 36 4 and the gom central waters gomcw 6 c t 10 c 34 9 s 35 3 fig 14a the gomcw is lying beneath the nacw and its origin can be traced back to aaiw atkinson 1983 in deeper 400 m areas however it seems that the water mass is primarily from the gomcw in both the gom and the straits above the nacw is the north atlantic salinity maximum water smw s 36 which is not present in the bottom waters over these coral habitats these water properties are largely consistent with the water masses observed at the stations between 10 20 n along the woce a20 transect in summer 1997 however salinity in the aaiw observed along a22 is about 0 15 psu lower than that in gomecc2 cruise suggesting either change in the source waters or modification along the transit path from the western tropical atlantic ocean within north brazilian current through the caribbean seas the modeled ta and dic concentrations over these deep coral habitats are largely consistent with those observed along the gomecc2 wfl and efl transects fig 14b c modeled dic concentration on the platform of pourtales terrace however is about 0 15 μ m ol kg higher than those observed along the two gomecc2 transects suggesting local enrichment also consistent with water mass changes between woce a22 transect and gomecc2 observations noted above the gomcw has about the same dic concentration but 5 10 μ m ol kg higher ta concentrations the loop current penetrated deeply into the northern gom during most of 2011 2012 except during summer fall2012 based on the satellite altimetry https www aviso altimetry fr en my aviso html therefore co2 concentrations in both nacw and aaiw are likely further increased as a result of remineralization of organic matter from the gom shelf waters wang et al 2013 wanninkhof et al 2015 once entering the florida straits the waters are compressed upward as the current passes through the straits due to the dramatic shoaling 1000 m within a distance of 200 km of bottom topography the low temperature and high dic nacw and aaiw waters are further steered upward over the slope of the left flank due to fc meandering and eddies while being transported through the straits as noted above these explain the modeled results that bottom water masses over the upper portion of these coral habitats despite being relatively shallow 400 m are comprise primarily of nacw and aaiw whereas bottom waters over the deep areas 400 m are primarily from the aaiw fig 14 global models have suggested that the equatorial north atlantic will experience shoaling of aragonite saturation horizon ash in the future due to the ocean acidification orr et al 2005 orr 2011 higher co2 concentrations are present in the aaiw because high anthropogenic co2 uptake in the southern ocean sabine et al 2004 gruber et al 2019 contributes to ocean acidification in the straights given the close correlation of bottom water properties in the straits with the gomcw and aaiw ocean acidification will likely greatly shift the bottom carbonate chemistry in these areas including more frequent low aragonite saturation and will possibly breach the ω ar 1 threshold moreover a recent study indicates that the atlantic meridional overturning circulation will provide a fast track delivery of acidified cold waters through high latitude deep water formation and subsequently spreading over the deep oceans perez et al 2018 this implies that the deep coral reefs in our study region may experience more stress due to the lower availability of carbonate ions however potential impacts of lowering ω ar on deep corals remain poorly understood e g hoegh guldberg et al 2017 so far there are only limited direct experiments testing the effects of ocean acidification mostly focusing on calcification rates and these results are mixed e g maier et al 2009 2012 form and riebesell 2012 lunden et al 2014 georgian et al 2016a low ω ar may also affect other aspects of deep corals including reproduction larval growth and dissolution of dead skeleton yet the exact effects of these are largely unknown warming temperature and deoxygenation are also expected as a result of global warming lunden et al 2014 both of which will potentially add to the stress to deep corals global warming may also lead to a reduction in the volume transport of florida current as a result of the weakening north atlantic meridional overturning circulation caesar et al 2018 this could potentially lead to weaker interactions between florida current and the bathymetry and the nonlinear instability both in turn likely lead to reduced upwelling and less vigorous mesoscale activity it is not immediately clear how increased vertical stratification of florida current may affect upwelling or mesoscale processes 4 2 mesoscale eddies versus large scale processes several processes are involved in the current and eddy topography interactions and deep water transport over the pourtalès and miami terraces all of these processes are operating on the background of persistent upwelling due to bottom ekman transport hsueh and o brien 1971 garrett et al 1993 weisberg and he 2003 roughan and middleton 2004 and also topographic steering due to the alongshore changes of bottom topography e g janowitz and pietrafesa 1982 gula et al 2015a b furthermore much of this also depends on the position and orientation of the florida current kourafalou and kang 2012 suggested that eddy formation in the southern florida straits is strongly tied to the latitudinal position of the florida current over the miami terrace our modeled results suggest that the dominant mesoscale process is the island wakes and associated transient eddy production the island wakes and eddy formation however are also likely largely modulated by the meandering and strength of florida current taken together these results indicate the importance of large scale processes in modulating bottom water properties over these deep coral habitats the relative effects of large scale processes and eddies in driving the upwelling or cross shelf transport however have not been quantified here we explore this quantitatively through a correlation analysis between the bottom temperature and relative vorticity at mid depths on the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace fig 15 here we show the results for the two upper slope sites the results for the shallower sites are similar but more complicated due to transport of upwelled waters from upstream we used a lanczos low passed filter to split the variability of these two parameters into high frequency 11 days which is assumed to be due to mesoscale processes the most significant of which is eddies and low frequency 11 days which is largely due to the variability of the florida current position and transport an 11 day cut off is a somewhat arbitrary choice as the time scale separating the low and high frequency this kind of partition is commonly used but does not completely isolate mesoscale effects because the fc meandering may indirectly affect mesoscale activities or vice versa kourafalou and kang 2012 it is worth noting that a previous study indicated that the florida current meandering has two dominant periods 5 and 12 days johns and schott 1987 in the northern florida straits meinen et al 2010 indicated that significant energy for the variability of fc transport lies within the periods of 10 days a longer cut off time e g 15 day does not significantly affect the results of our analysis below see figure s3 it is clear that both low frequency fc variability and mesoscale processes contribute positively negative correlation to the upwelling of cold waters onto the pourtalès terrace the fc meandering however shows somewhat stronger impacts than the eddies on the bottom temperature variability r 0 59 versus r 0 39 respectively by contrast the upwelling over the miami terrace is positively correlated to the relative vorticity the longitudinal position i e when the current core moves closer to the terrace higher relative vorticity the near bottom temperature is higher and vice versa r 0 57 similar influences on temperature anomaly come from short term processes due to the effects of island wakes and the transient eddy positive correlation r 0 58 more specifically high anomaly of relative vorticity positive anomaly indicates that the fc is close to the slope and that there is a lack of wakes associated with the positive temperature anomaly a lack of upwelling on the contrary negative vorticity anomaly indicates a well developed island wake or the presence of the transient eddy associated with strong upwelling negative temperature anomaly these results suggest the important roles of both local physical processes and remote forcing on the bottom carbonate chemistry which is strongly correlated with the bottom temperature particularly for the low frequency variability and or areas over the platforms table 3 however impacts become nonlinear when upwelling is strong and near bottom cold waters at the base of the slope are upwelled to mid slope due to the nonlinear t dic and t ta relationships at the low temperature end for aaiw fig 2 on the other hand changes of water properties t s ta dic in the source areas gom or caribbean seas will affect the bottom water properties in the florida straits the impacts of these however are likely largely on the low frequency variability there is a significant but weak correlation r 0 6 between the bottom water temperature over both the habitats and subsurface temperature in the gulf on the low frequency time scale 11 days whereas no significant correlation is found for high frequency signals not shown 4 3 contributions of biological export and remineralization to bottom carbonate chemistry biological processes including phytoplankton photosynthesis remineralization of organic matter and calcification could also contribute to the change of total co2 and alkalinity in the water column see e g wanninkhof et al 2015 here we only consider the phytoplankton photosynthesis and remineralization which would respectively decrease and increase dic by 1 μ m ol kg per μ mol kg uptake or remineralization assuming these processes follow a 6 625 c n redfield ratio for photosynthesis and remineralization photosynthesis remineralization incorporating releasing nitrate would slightly increase decrease alkalinity by 1 6 625 μ m ol kg per μ mol kg carbon change phytoplankton photosynthesis is low with phytoplankton biomass being typically 4 μ m olc l chlorophyll 1 μ g l due to the limitation of low dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration in the upper layer e g llopiz 2008 figure s2 therefore the variability of this term is unlikely a major factor to the variability of water column dic concentration for near bottom waters over these deep coral reefs there is no photosynthesis and only remineralization of organic carbon takes place our model results indicate that particulate organic carbon poc concentration in the deep waters is typically an order lower than the dissolve organic carbon doc concentration not shown this is consistent with the observed poc concentrations in the upper 150 m along a cross slope transect off jacksonville fl about 100 mile north of our northern boundary during the july 2015 ecoa cruise which indicate a range of 2 6 μ m olc kg https www nodc noaa gov oads data 0157080 xml therefore the overall contribution of poc remineralization to dic is small as for the doc contribution during the transit from the upstream boundary in the gulf of mexico to the southern florida straits we shall expect an increase of dic by 1 δ d i c r d o c d o c δ t where r d o c is the remineralization rate and δ t is the transit time the measured doc concentration was at 40 60 μ m ol kg along the efl transect during the gomecc 2 survey hansel et al 2004 reported a similar range of 40 50 μ m ol kg along the same transect during a survey in january february 1998 leichter et al 2007 surveyed several transects from the keys to offshore up to 250 m water depth in september 11 19 2003 and reported doc concentrations between 40 55 μ m ol kg for waters with temperature between 12 15 c therefore it seems reasonable to assume that near bottom doc concentration has a range of 40 50 μ m ol kg our model results indicate that the near bottom doc concentration in this area is 30 40 μ m ol kg not shown which is lower than the observed value based on our model it takes about 5 10 days for gom water to transit from the model gom boundary to the pourtalès and miami terrace area we assume r d o c 0 01 0 03 day 1 at 10 c water temperature which is lower than the 0 03 day 1 used in fennel et al 2006 therefore based on eq 1 and assuming doc 40 μ m ol kg we shall expect an increase of dic 4 10 μ m ol kg during the transit from the gom during the same transit period a small 1 2 μ m ol kg decrease in ta is expected we have not included the contributions of sediment fluxes to the near bottom dic and alkalinity which may be significant because of active sediment diagenesis and strong sediment transport due to the strong near bottom currents up to 50 cm s that these reefs experience strong currents are expected to be the main mechanism for sediment input from upstream however little is known regarding the related benthic biogeochemical processes 5 summary and conclusions a numerical model was developed to simulate the coupled physical biogeochemical processes on the south florida shelf and in the florida straits and a two year 2011 2012 simulation was carried out built on previous work by pan et al 2017 we further gauge the model performance by comparing the model results with limited available data from two research cruises transport measurements along 27 n and several deployments of two adcp moorings that took place during the model period the results show overall agreement between model output and observations including the magnitudes of high frequency 11 days variability in temperature currents and fc volume transport however there are also discrepancies including over predicting the magnitude of the temporal variability of water properties such as a temperature at the two mooring sites over estimating the bottom w e velocity at the two mooring sites and under predicting the low frequency transport variability one possible reason for these discrepancies is that the model does not fully capture the interactions of low frequency rossby waves with the complex bathymetry in this area due to the model resolution the model reproduces the general vertical structure of key parameters t s ta and dic including the near permanent upwelling over the western slope along the 27 n transect observed during the gomecc 2 survey model results were then used to examine the spatial temporal variability of key physical and carbonate chemistry parameters temperature salinity dic and ta over the pourtalès and miami terraces two large deep coral reef habitats in the florida straits and the associated mesoscale and large scale processes four representative sites were chosen for an analysis of the temporal variability of bottom water properties over the two deep coral habitats the results indicate that the near bottom carbonate chemistry over both the pourtalès and miami terraces is strongly impacted by the meandering of the florida current and associated mesoscale eddies with differing effects in the two areas as a general background the florida current forces strong near bottom upwelling over the pourtalès terrace resulting from bottom ekman transport as the current moves northward and gets closer to the slope the bottom upwelling strengthens and vice versa as reflected in the negative correlation between bottom temperature and relative vorticity mesoscale eddies further enhance the upwelling by lifting up the thermocline along their leading front and eddy center together these processes bring cold co2 rich but low alkalinity deep waters onto the platform the trailing edge of these eddies however drives significant downwelling which leads to significantly warmer temperature and lower co2 concentration on top of the platform over the miami terrace by contrast island wakes behind the sharp topographic change and the frequent spin off of the transient eddy over the pourtalès drift play a dominant role in driving the upwelling of co2 rich deep waters the meandering and transport variability of the florida current together modulate the instability of island wakes and the production of mesoscale eddies at the southern end of the terrace overall stronger upwelling is seen when the florida current shifts eastward away from the slope leading to lower temperature and higher dic concentration over to the upper slope and the platform previous studies suggest the presence of a persistent near bottom countercurrent between 400 700 m in this area our model results did not show this current this is can be either that the model failed to reproduce this current or that the southward flow is part west side of the spin off eddy from the island wakes modeled results suggest that the bottom water masses over the pourtalès terrace and upper miami terrace comprise largely of nacw and aaiw as a result of the complex physical processes however bottom water properties t dic ta on top of both the pourtalès terrace and miami terrace exhibit strong temporal variability over weekly to monthly timescales with a significant range of aragonite saturation state 1 2 2 0 in contrast deeper 400 m areas in the florida straits are flushed with aaiw and the bottom water properties are very stable within the neighborhood of the salinity minimum and with nearly constant aragonite saturation state between 1 2 1 3 the bottom carbonate chemistry in the straits is likely also significantly influenced by changes in the water properties in their sources gom or caribbean through large scale transport and by the biogeochemical processes remineralization of organic matter sediment inputs along the paths our estimate suggests that remineralization may further contribute to a dic increase 4 10 μ m ol kg as waters transit from the gom to the deep coral habitats there is however significant uncertainty in this estimate and it does not take into account the possible sediment fluxes of dic and alkalinity along the transport paths which depends on the mode of loop current and sediment diagenesis processes ocean acidification in the future will likely further reduce the ph and ω ar leading to greater stress on the deep coral reef ecosystems in this region however here we did not directly examine the potential impacts of ocean acidification which would require additional simulations incorporating the long term ocean
