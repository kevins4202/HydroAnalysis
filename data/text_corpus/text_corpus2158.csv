10790,vietnam is one of several countries that suffer from climate change and is encountering increased frequency and severity of droughts its climate risks have led to concerns about water security prompting policymakers to assess the value add of water in irrigation here we measure the value add of irrigation water for non compulsory food crops in vietnam by formalising a crop choice model and fit it to data from a national household survey our results indicate that irrigator profits would fall on average by 0 56 us 2016 value if water diverted for irrigation were reduced by one cubic meter per irrigator we also find that some 16 of surveyed irrigators could reduce the water they divert for irrigation without reducing their profits as a response to water scarcity effective water pricing could reduce irrigation water extractions by around 84 while the average profit per farmer would be reduced by some 17 our findings highlight the importance of water pricing as a possible policy

sustainable development goals sdgs given that water availability and quality connect to many of the sdgs world bank 2016 vietnam belongs to the tropical wet climate zone of the world but it is among the most vulnerable to climate change countries it already suffers an increased frequency and severity of droughts for example the historic drought in 2016 damaged some 477 thousand hectares of agricultural land and affected 52 over 63 provinces of the country of which 18 declared the state of emergency the drought also caused two million people or 400 thousand households to experience acute water storage and require humanitarian assistance fao 2016 1 this worst drought in nearly a century has in turn triggered debates and concerns about the water security risk faced by vietnam wyrwoll et al 2018 in 2005 vietnam s agricultural sector required on average nearly 7 0 m3 of freshwater together with other inputs to produce us 1 of output calculated from wb s world development indicators by contrast the ratios for the world and for australia are only 2 2 and 0 6 respectively as calculated from wb s world development indicators and wada and bierkens 2014 f2 current regulations in vietnam virtually exempt farmers from paying for water diverted for irrigation 1 1 for example decree 154 2007 nd cp decree 115 2008 nd cp decree 67 2012 nd cp and ordinance 41 2013 tt btc and appear to have contributed to excessive extraction of freshwater resources further because there are virtually no payments for the water diverted the agencies responsible for maintaining current water supplies or upgrading water supplies have not had the funds necessary to deliver their responsibilities thus a failure to have water pricing for diverted water for irrigation has also contributed to a degradation of irrigation water supply infrastructure yet the primary objective of not implementing water pricing for irrigators was to improve farmers livelihoods e g song 2009 hoàng 2010 nguyễn 2015 for a water allocation to be economically efficient given a volumetric water price it requires that the water price paid be equal to the marginal economic cost of supply james and pollock 1988 such an allocation provides incentives for users to divert water up until to the point where further diversion is no longer beneficial thus marginal cost pricing that sends a signal about the cost of supplying water hanemann et al 1997 increases the overall economic surplus from the use of water liu 2002 letsoalo et al 2007 luckmann et al 2016 consequently as a benchmark evaluating the effects of different prices charged to water users is important from the perspective of water reallocation even if in practice the price charged for water is designed to achieve multiple social and political objectives bithas 2008 here we measure the marginal benefit or the value add of irrigation water and evaluate the effects of irrigation water pricing in vietnam that is to say we measure how much farmers would lose in reduced profits if they had to reduce their water extractions for irrigation by a marginal amount or pay a certain price for each cubic water they diverted this is accomplished by formalising a crop choice model fitted to a national household survey dataset our crop choice model allows farmers to vary the choice of crop combinations to maximize their profit in response to changes in water quantity given their current and heterogeneous production techniques and thus it allows us to calculate the value add of irrigation water given the estimated value add of irrigation water of households we then quantify the relationship between the value add of water and household characteristics and simulate the impact of different water prices in section 2 we describe the methods and data including the crop choice model and also the calibration process in section 3 we present the estimates of the value add of water in irrigation the distribution of the value add across different household groups and the possible effects of water pricing on households section 4 discusses the implications of the findings and highlights possible policy options to improve the efficiency of irrigation water extractions section 5 concludes 2 methods and material 2 1 crop choice optimization model our model considers a community of f households indexed by f 1 f where each can choose to produce any combination of c crops indexed by c 1 c households are heterogenous in terms of input availability e g land water and capital including capital to hire non entrepreneurial labour and entrepreneurial labour input defined by the time together with knowledge and experience of famers to organise and manage production e g deciding the combination of inputs for a crop along with any of its risks in order to make a profit given the heterogeneity in inputs including the entrepreneurial labour households will typically have different production scale and productivity for a crop crops are heterogeneous varying in quality and cost structures households might decide on different combinations of inputs including their entrepreneurial time among their chosen crops a crop produced by a household can be either saved for family consumption or sold on the market when a crop is sold households might be offered different sale prices due to the heterogeneous quality we assume all households pay the same cost if any for one unit of non entrepreneurial inputs used i e per hectare of land per cubic meter of water or per dollar of capital in addition all households are assumed to choose the crop combination that maximises their profit subject to their available inputs we use the superscript f for households subscript c for crops p for prices q for crop output and u is the family consumption we define the vector x l w k e to denote respectively the input vector for land water capital and entrepreneurial labour under this notation x f represents the inputs available to households f x c f represents the input required by household f to produce 1 unit output of crop c which can be considered as the technology parameters or production skill of the household u c f is the consumption of crop c by household f p c f represents the price of crop c offered to household f and z z l z w z k is the vector of the unit cost of land water and capital if any the crop choice

household is given by eq 2 which is defined as the reduction in profit caused by a marginal reduction in the available quantity of irrigation water when faced with a reduction in water availability households might reconsider their optimal crop choice e g switch to less water demanding crops in order to maximise the profit as specified in optimization problem 1 the calculation of the value add in eq 2 assumes that each household is a price taker unable to influence the sales price of the crop or the prices of inputs 2 v a f x f p c f z π f l f w f k f e f p c f z π f l f w f δ w k f e f p c

households choose to increase irrigation water extractions to the point where the added value via the crop choice can be balanced with the price together with the constraints of other inputs in this equation d f x f p c f z a vector of input demands including an element for irrigation water specifies how much irrigation water will be used by a household in response to the price and also other factors given this notation the response of the demand for irrigation water to price can be evaluated via eq 4 which calculates the percentage change in water demand when the water price is increased by a certain amount δ z w in eq 4 the response to water price assumes that only the price of water increases and the crop choice will respond to this change all else remains unchanged 3 d f z w x f p

data cleaning process and summary statistics we fit the data of vietnam s household living standard survey 2016 vhlss to the crop choice model to calculate the value add of irrigation water in vietnam vhlss is a bi annual household survey currently the largest household survey for vietnam in 2016 the survey included 9399 households in all 63 provinces of the country the information covered in the survey is comprehensive ranging from income generating activities education consumption financial status as well as other social and economic characteristics we undertook a data verification exercise to extract relevant information from the 2016 vhlss survey not all of the 9399 households in the survey grew crops for sales thus we excluded households who were not involved in crop production or who produced crops mainly for family consumption i e the crop retained for consumption is more than 75 of the total output also not all crop choices could be determined by households in other words households might not have complete control over what they could grow in response to profit to take into account this possibility we exclude the rice crop because it is a required crop as stipulated by the national assembly resolution 17 2011 qh13 and also multi year crops that require longer term investment and commitment such that farmers might not be able to adjust the crop choice at a point in time the final step in our data verification is to remove apparent errors in data e g zero inputs producing positive outputs the verified dataset includes 1 207 households each producing any combinations of 23 non compulsory annual crops table 1 provides a summary of the household characteristics that may be associated with crop production decisions and can be extracted from the dataset we classify these characteristics into three categories i social connection ii financial status and iii other characteristics including education access to the internet gender and location the characteristics in the social connection category record whether the household has a member in vietnam s communist party the ruling party of the single party political regime in the veteran association a state run social group for veterans and in the farmers association also a state run social group but only for farmers table 1 shows that around 10 of the households have a household member in the communist party while the numbers for the veteran association and farmers association were respectively around 15 and 58 the social association memberships may have an impact in the irrigation efficiency of households as suggested by the literature in both developed and developing countries e g zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2016 yohannes et al 2017 the second category in table 1 includes four characteristics of the financial status of a household the summary shows that 35 of the households were classified as poor but only 4 received subsidized credits 35 had borrowed from formal credit sources and 6 of the households had loans from informal credit sources these characteristics might influence the value add of irrigation water as previous studies suggested that the financial status and access to credit could determine the attitude of vietnamese farmers when adapting to drought and flood e g thoai et al 2018 the last category in table 1 includes some other characteristics that might be associated with irrigation efficiency and can be extracted from the available dataset for example training and education level and gender of the household head were among factors that might influence the production decisions of vietnamese farmers e g thoai et al 2018 huy and nguyen 2019 also included is information about whether the household had access to the internet and whether it was located in the two agricultural hubs of vietnam the red river delta and the mekong river delta 2 4 model calibration and group comparison analysis for each household we calibrate the technology parameters x c f following the approach explained by dawkins et al 2007 the calibration process uses us 1 as the measurement unit and scales other variables accordingly for each crop produced by a household for example if household f used 0 5 ton of fertiliser at 200 ton to produce 5 tons of crop c and sold it at the price of 100 ton the measurement unit of fertiliser would be 0 005 ton i e 1 and the quantity of fertiliser would be 100 units in a similar way the measurement unit of crop output would be scaled down to 0 01 ton and the quantity of the harvested crop would be 500 units the coefficient of the input requirement for fertilisers would be x c f 100 500 0 2 this calibration approach allows us to take into account the fact that the input and output quality might vary across households and across crops and these variations are incorporated in the price and the total value after the calibration the value add of irrigation water and response to water pricing for each of the 1207 households are calculated following eq s 2 and 4 we compare the average value added of irrigation water extractions across the household groups in table 1 with a t test to take into account a sizable fraction of possible zero values the level of statistical significance for a group difference is estimated in two approaches for robustness namely i using zero below censored distributions for all the 1 207 households and ii including only households that have a positive value add alternatively one can fit the value added and the household characteristics to multiple regression models the regression technique can help estimate a causal relationship x causes y ceteris paribus but it will likely be subject to simultaneity bias and the available dataset does not provide a strong instrument variable to overcome this possible bias for instance while the financial status of a household could influence the value add of irrigation water it is possible that the reverse causal relationship might also be true e g the value add of irrigation water could influence the financial status and the borrowing capacity of a household similar issues may arise with other variables e g poor households with a low value add of production inputs could join the state run farmers association for extra assistance in addition the regression technique might be subject to the common specification search biases franco et al 2014 brodeur et al 2016 ioannidis et al 2017 where the true specification is unknown and the reported specifications are usually the one with the desired result leamer 1978 in sum our group comparison approach is a simpler more transparent and replicable method science editorials 2013 and does not necessarily impose a causal relationship between variables we employ the crop choice model to estimate the price elasticity of irrigation water extractions the price elasticity measures the percentage change in water extracted or diverted when the water price increases by 1 the price elasticity can be measured using mathematical programming or by experiments econometric techniques scheierling et al 2006 t1 or estimated from preference surveys zuo et al 2015 here we use the mathematical programming approach to estimate the price elasticity at different price levels in particular we use eq 4 to calculate how each household when already paying a volumetric price for irrigation water would respond to an increase in the price 3 results 3 1 value add of water in irrigation the value add of irrigation water across the 1207 households is summarised in fig 1 with domestic currency converted to us at the 2016 exchange rate 1us 21 935vnd source imf s international financial statistics there are 198 households or 16 4 of the sample that have zero added value for irrigation water this fact does not necessarily mean that these 198 households could grow crops without water but rather it implies that the households could reduce irrigation water without sacrificing their profits by optimising their crop choice the estimated mean of the value add across all 1207 households is around 0 56 us m3 the 95 confidence interval of the mean is estimated to be 0 49 us m3 0 63 us m3 these statistical estimates are based on zero below censored distributions to take into account the fact that a fraction of households have zero added value for irrigation water 3 2 value add of water and household characteristics we summarise the results of the group comparison in table 2 and provide the detailed test statistics in the appendix the first column of the table is the group classification criteria which are clustered into three categories i whether any member of a household joined a social or political organization ii the financial and creditability status and iii education training level access to the internet gender and household locations the second and third columns show the difference between an average household inside and outside of a group for the two alternative ways of controlling zero values together with stars showing the level of significance if any the signs of the numbers in these two columns are the same in all rows suggesting some robustness in the overall conclusion some large numbers might not appear statistically significant because the group comparison takes into account the relative sizes of the treatment and control groups thus if the size of one group is only a small proportion of the other the comparison outcome may be considered less certain even when the estimated difference is large both testing approaches i e using zero below censored distributions for all households and including only households with positive value add support similar trends the first section of table 2 shows that there are some differences between members and non members of the social and political originations regarding the value add of irrigation water the value add of irrigation water in households with a member in the communist party on average exceeds those in the remaining households by about 50 the veteran association also has its members with a higher value add for the water they divert than non members the members of the farmers association have a lower average value added for water diverted but the difference is not significantly different from zero at the 10 level these results do not necessarily imply a causal relationship that joining an organisation will increase or decrease the value add of water rather they are evidence of underlying reasons such as self selection e g less advantaged households were more likely to join the farmers association or confounding factors e g people with more social connections were more likely to join the communist party the next section of table 2 shows how the value add of irrigation water is correlated with the financial and creditability status of households the value add of water in poor households is only around 50 of that in the non poor group of interest households who borrowed from formal credit sources such as banks and credit unions generated less value add for irrigation water compared to other households further those who borrowed from informal sources such as friends and relatives have on average a higher value add from irrigation water the final four rows of table 2 show the significant positive relationship between the value add of irrigation water and the education level access to the internet gender as well as household locations households with at least a member having attended professional training outperformed all other households and have on average between about 50 and 60 higher value add for water households with access to the internet appear to have between about 40 and 50 greater value add of irrigation water the value add is not significantly different across the gender of the household the final row of the table shows that farmers in the red river delta and the mekong delta had a higher average value added for water they extracted or diverted possibly because of the more advanced production techniques in these two agricultural hubs of vietnam 3 3 response to water pricing we examine the response of farmers to a number of possible levels of water prices when confronted with a price farmers are expected to use less water to maximise their profit they would only extract water when the added benefit of a cubic meter exceeds the charged price in other words farmers should not intentionally extract or divert more water if the added benefit were less than the cost the response of farmers to water pricing is summarised in table 3 along the row is a number of possible price levels and the columns predict the impacts on the total water use by farmers and their profitability the first column represents the business as usual bau scenario where this is no water charge other pricing scenarios are evaluated in a comparison to this bau scenario so we normalise the quantity of water and the profit of farmers at the bau scenario to 100 also at the bau the pricing revenue is 0 of the bau profit as there is no charge for water the result shows that water pricing can significantly reduce the amount of water diverted for irrigation for example it is estimated that setting the price of irrigation water at 0 1 us m3 would reduce irrigation water to only 15 8 of the water quantity at the bau scenario i e a reduction of some 84 this is because many farmers have a zero value add of water and thus would respond to the price and should not divert water as much as in the bau scenario moving from left to right the water price increases the water quantity extracted declines the results in table 3 show the financial impact of water pricing if the water price were set at us0 1 m3 the overall profit of farmers would decline from 100 to 83 01 of the bau profit most of this decline in the farmers profit 16 78 of the bau profit would be transformed into the pricing revenue that could be made available for maintenance and upgrades for water supply infrastructure and the unmatched shortfall would be 0 21 this gap however does not mean that water pricing would cause an overall welfare loss when the pricing revenue collected by the government was less than the loss incurred by farmers water not extracted or diverted by irrigators could be reallocated for other purposes e g hydropower generation or environmental uses that could generate higher economic and non economic value and benefit which are not calculated in table 3 3 4 measuring water price elasticity the estimated price elasticity of irrigation water is summarised in table 4 here the average elasticity coefficients across all households were estimated using both simple mean and quantity weighted together with their 95 confidence intervals the table shows that the average value ranges from 0 04 to 0 94 inside the range suggested by the literature scheierling et al 2006 but the price elasticity varies across price levels for both the simple mean and weighted mean estimates the higher price the more quantity reduction associated with 1 increase in the price this is because the absolute value of the 1 increase of a high price is more than that of a low price so 1 increase of a higher price has more impact on profit maximising farmers at least in this particular case thus the slope of water demand functions depends on the contextual choice of farmers such that a constant elasticity demand function might be inappropriate for example the constant elasticity hypothesis can easily be rejected here where the price elasticity at 0 1 us m3 is significantly lower than that at 0 2 us 2 m3 even without any intersection of their 95 confidence intervals in this situation the demand for irrigation water may be represented by a piece wise linear function rather than a constant elasticity specification 4 discussion and policy implications our analysis estimates a significant value add of irrigation water for non rice annual crops in vietnam at 0 56 us m3 in 2016 while we acknowledge that the value added of irrigation water depends on many contextual factors such as weather conditions and the output price of agricultural products finger 2012 we contend that our range of values provides preliminary evidence for effective water pricing in vietnam in other words our framework can inform policy makers about the potential impacts of water pricing including the impact on water quantity extracted and the distributional impact on farmers profit and pricing revenue the results show that the value add of irrigation water could be increased if water were reallocated to alternative economically beneficial uses other than irrigation for instance more than 16 of the surveyed households have a zero value add which indicates irrigation water is mispriced at its current level of zero this evidence is supported by the simulated outcome of water pricing which shows that changing a zero to a relatively low water price could reduce the irrigation water by around 84 while still leaving the total economic welfare more or less the same the estimated gain of water pricing reported in table 3 is likely to be a conservative estimate this is because our estimate is based on the assumption that farmers are able to make optimal choices in crop productions in practice excessive irrigation in vietnam is possible due to a farmer s risk aversion world bank group 2016 36 and this may affect crop quality and reduce yields steduto et al 2012 6 in this case water pricing would be an effective solution because it would provide incentives for farmers to irrigate their crops more efficiently as they would only use water when the added benefit of a cubic meter exceeds the charged price and to adopt new water saving technology as the literature on water resources shows renzetti 2009 1 grafton et al 2020 mispriced water can result in long term consequences such as excessive abstraction overextended infrastructure stifled innovation and diminished water quality our findings suggest that water pricing could be an effective policy option to improve the value add of irrigation water indeed irrigation water pricing is not uncommon and its effectiveness has been observed in several countries e g australia western united states chile italy jordan and south africa although institutional legal and cultural arrangements may vary as do the impacts of water pricing grafton et al 2011a toan 2016 setting a volumetric price for surface water diverted for irrigation does not have to result in a significant negative impact on net incomes if appropriately complemented by other policies while empirical evidence shows crop profit may decline speelman et al 2009 the revenue from water pricing could be used to provide income support to compensate farmers for higher water prices while retaining their incentive to conserve water flexible pricing schemes could also be developed to minimise the negative impacts on poor farmers such as block pricing wherein water prices are low and fixed below a specific volume and rise rapidly for higher water diversions further there needs to be transparency and a regular two way flow of information i e farmers need to factor water prices and support into their production planning and decision makers need to consult farmers on the level of support needed to balance efficiency and equity objectives we contend that at least in vietnam re imposing a price on irrigation water is feasible toan et al 2016 irrigation water pricing is not new in vietnam because irrigation water did incur a price by farmers until the early 2000s further irrigators who pump groundwater are already paying for substantial electricity costs and have had these costs rise as aquifer levels have fallen in some provinces especially in the dry seasons grafton et al 2016 in addition the day to day experience with pricing schemes of treated water which allow for heterogeneity and differentiate among water users has also made households more familiar with water pricing a necessary condition to implement irrigation water pricing is that households or groups of households must be individually metered and charged a volumetric price for the water they extract this might require an upfront investment and implementation cost e g installing meter devices but previous studies show that the benefit of water pricing can also compensate the cost see e g a review by johansson 2000 evidence based policies that allow a reallocation of water from less to more highly valued uses in other countries can also lead to economic gains worth billions of dollars grafton et al 2011b provided that all water sources were metered then a series of dialogues could commence over how water prices might be established wyrwoll et al 2018 many possible water pricing options are available a block amount free of charge with a volumetric charge above this amount dynamic pricing e g seasonal pricing in response to water scarcity chu and grafton 2019 and differential water prices based on where the water is being used or for what purpose these pricing options can also be combined to meet multiple policy objectives if required in terms of implementation irrigation water pricing in vietnam could be piloted at a smaller scale before any large scale or national roll out pilot projects could also assist in accumulating the knowledge and experience needed to undertake provincial level irrigation water pricing the precise pricing policies however would depend on the context of the location and should be tailored to account for pricing design income support policies and business models for upfront investments for additional infrastructure practical implementation considerations for water pricing would include procedures to deal with non compliance revenue collection information provision property rights and mitigation for negative impacts in terms of equity it may also be preferable to pilot scheme irrigation water pricing in relatively high income agricultural regions where farmers may be better able to invest in new techniques and have a greater ability to innovate policy options for improving the value add of water should also include options to improve water use decision making at the farm level for instance training and access to the internet are strongly connected to the value add of water diverted for irrigation thus knowledge transfer and sharing possibly as part of farmer extension services should also assist in improving production technique crop choice and the value add of water 5 conclusions water scarcity especially in relation to water diversions for irrigation is an important and on going challenge in many countries including vietnam charging farmers for the water they divert for irrigation from public irrigation schemes provides a means to cover the costs of maintaining and increasing water supplies while providing incentives for water conservation while in theory water pricing can allow for water conservation and water reallocation that will increase the overall economic surplus from water use key concerns of decision makers are the possible negative consequences for both food production and the profitability of irrigators we employ a crop choice optimisation model and use an extensive household survey data to provide estimates of the value of add of water diverted for irrigation in vietnam our approach allows us to evaluate the response of farmers to water pricing including the reduction in water quantity and distributional impacts on crop profitability and pricing revenue our results show that an appropriate volumetric water price could reduce water extractions for irrigation to around a sixth of the business as usual level with only a relatively small impact on average irrigator profitability further irrigation water pricing also allows for the possibility that a high proportion of the revenue collected to be invested in water supply maintenance and upgrades complementary policies such as enhancing farm level skills via knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing could further promote the value add of surface water in vietnamese agriculture while our methods and calculations apply only to vietnam we contend that this approach offers a practical means to assess the possible consequences of different irrigation water prices in other countries declaration of competing interest none

the most vulnerable to climate change countries it already suffers an increased frequency and severity of droughts for example the historic drought in 2016 damaged some 477 thousand hectares of agricultural land and affected 52 over 63 provinces of the country of which 18 declared the state of emergency the drought also caused two million people or 400 thousand households to experience acute water storage and require humanitarian assistance fao 2016 1 this worst drought in nearly a century has in turn triggered debates and concerns about the water security risk faced by vietnam wyrwoll et al 2018 in 2005 vietnam s agricultural sector required on average nearly 7 0 m3 of freshwater together with other inputs to produce us 1 of output calculated from wb s world development indicators by contrast the ratios for the world and for australia are only 2 2 and 0 6 respectively as calculated from wb s world development indicators and wada and bierkens 2014 f2 current regulations in vietnam virtually exempt farmers from paying for water diverted for irrigation 1 1 for example decree 154 2007 nd cp decree 115 2008 nd cp decree 67 2012 nd cp and ordinance 41 2013 tt btc and appear to have contributed to excessive extraction of freshwater resources further because there are virtually no payments for the water diverted the agencies responsible for maintaining current water supplies or upgrading water supplies have not had the funds necessary to deliver their responsibilities thus a failure to have water pricing for diverted water for irrigation has also contributed to a degradation of irrigation water supply infrastructure yet the primary objective of not implementing water pricing for irrigators was to improve farmers livelihoods e g song 2009 hoàng 2010 nguyễn 2015 for a water allocation to be economically efficient given a volumetric water price it requires that the water price paid be equal to the marginal economic cost of supply james and pollock 1988 such an allocation provides incentives for users to divert water up until to the point where further diversion is no longer beneficial thus marginal cost pricing that sends a signal about the cost of supplying water hanemann et al 1997 increases the overall economic surplus from the use of water liu 2002 letsoalo et al 2007 luckmann et al 2016 consequently as a benchmark evaluating the effects of different prices charged to water users is important from the perspective of water reallocation even if in practice the price charged for water is designed to achieve multiple social and political objectives bithas 2008 here we measure the marginal benefit or the value add of irrigation water and evaluate the effects of irrigation water pricing in vietnam that is to say we measure how much farmers would lose in reduced profits if they had to reduce their water extractions for irrigation by a marginal amount or pay a certain price for each cubic water they diverted this is accomplished by formalising a crop choice model fitted to a national household survey dataset our crop choice model allows farmers to vary the choice of crop combinations to maximize their profit in response to changes in water quantity given their current and heterogeneous production techniques and thus it allows us to calculate the value add of irrigation water given the estimated value add of irrigation water of households we then quantify the relationship between the value add of water and household characteristics and simulate the impact of different water prices in section 2 we describe the methods and data including the crop choice model and also the calibration process in section 3 we present the estimates of the value add of water in irrigation the distribution of the value add across different household groups and the possible effects of water pricing on households section 4 discusses the implications of the findings and highlights possible policy options to improve the efficiency of irrigation water extractions section 5 concludes 2 methods and material 2 1 crop choice optimization model our model considers a community of f households indexed by f 1 f where each can choose to produce any combination of c crops indexed by c 1 c households are heterogenous in terms of input availability e g land water and capital including capital to hire non entrepreneurial labour and entrepreneurial labour input defined by the time together with knowledge and experience of famers to organise and manage production e g deciding the combination of inputs for a crop along with any of its risks in order to make a profit given the heterogeneity in inputs including the entrepreneurial labour households will typically have different production scale and productivity for a crop crops are heterogeneous varying in quality and cost structures households might decide on different combinations of inputs including their entrepreneurial time among their chosen crops a crop produced by a household can be either saved for family consumption or sold on the market when a crop is sold households might be offered different sale prices due to the heterogeneous quality we assume all households pay the same cost if any for one unit of non entrepreneurial inputs used i e per hectare of land per cubic meter of water or per dollar of capital in addition all households are assumed to choose the crop combination that maximises their profit subject to their available inputs we use the superscript f for households subscript c for crops p for prices q for crop output and u is the family consumption we define the vector x l w k e to denote respectively the input vector for land water capital and entrepreneurial labour under this notation x f represents the inputs available to households f x c f represents the input required by household f to produce 1 unit output of crop c which can be considered as the technology parameters or production skill of the household u c f is the consumption of crop c by household f p c f represents the price of crop c offered to household f and z z l z w z k is the vector of the unit cost of land water and capital if any the crop choice

household is given by eq 2 which is defined as the reduction in profit caused by a marginal reduction in the available quantity of irrigation water when faced with a reduction in water availability households might reconsider their optimal crop choice e g switch to less water demanding crops in order to maximise the profit as specified in optimization problem 1 the calculation of the value add in eq 2 assumes that each household is a price taker unable to influence the sales price of the crop or the prices of inputs 2 v a f x f p c f z π f l f w f k f e f p c f z π f l f w f δ w k f e f p c

households choose to increase irrigation water extractions to the point where the added value via the crop choice can be balanced with the price together with the constraints of other inputs in this equation d f x f p c f z a vector of input demands including an element for irrigation water specifies how much irrigation water will be used by a household in response to the price and also other factors given this notation the response of the demand for irrigation water to price can be evaluated via eq 4 which calculates the percentage change in water demand when the water price is increased by a certain amount δ z w in eq 4 the response to water price assumes that only the price of water increases and the crop choice will respond to this change all else remains unchanged 3 d f z w x f p

data cleaning process and summary statistics we fit the data of vietnam s household living standard survey 2016 vhlss to the crop choice model to calculate the value add of irrigation water in vietnam vhlss is a bi annual household survey currently the largest household survey for vietnam in 2016 the survey included 9399 households in all 63 provinces of the country the information covered in the survey is comprehensive ranging from income generating activities education consumption financial status as well as other social and economic characteristics we undertook a data verification exercise to extract relevant information from the 2016 vhlss survey not all of the 9399 households in the survey grew crops for sales thus we excluded households who were not involved in crop production or who produced crops mainly for family consumption i e the crop retained for consumption is more than 75 of the total output also not all crop choices could be determined by households in other words households might not have complete control over what they could grow in response to profit to take into account this possibility we exclude the rice crop because it is a required crop as stipulated by the national assembly resolution 17 2011 qh13 and also multi year crops that require longer term investment and commitment such that farmers might not be able to adjust the crop choice at a point in time the final step in our data verification is to remove apparent errors in data e g zero inputs producing positive outputs the verified dataset includes 1 207 households each producing any combinations of 23 non compulsory annual crops table 1 provides a summary of the household characteristics that may be associated with crop production decisions and can be extracted from the dataset we classify these characteristics into three categories i social connection ii financial status and iii other characteristics including education access to the internet gender and location the characteristics in the social connection category record whether the household has a member in vietnam s communist party the ruling party of the single party political regime in the veteran association a state run social group for veterans and in the farmers association also a state run social group but only for farmers table 1 shows that around 10 of the households have a household member in the communist party while the numbers for the veteran association and farmers association were respectively around 15 and 58 the social association memberships may have an impact in the irrigation efficiency of households as suggested by the literature in both developed and developing countries e g zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2016 yohannes et al 2017 the second category in table 1 includes four characteristics of the financial status of a household the summary shows that 35 of the households were classified as poor but only 4 received subsidized credits 35 had borrowed from formal credit sources and 6 of the households had loans from informal credit sources these characteristics might influence the value add of irrigation water as previous studies suggested that the financial status and access to credit could determine the attitude of vietnamese farmers when adapting to drought and flood e g thoai et al 2018 the last category in table 1 includes some other characteristics that might be associated with irrigation efficiency and can be extracted from the available dataset for example training and education level and gender of the household head were among factors that might influence the production decisions of vietnamese farmers e g thoai et al 2018 huy and nguyen 2019 also included is information about whether the household had access to the internet and whether it was located in the two agricultural hubs of vietnam the red river delta and the mekong river delta 2 4 model calibration and group comparison analysis for each household we calibrate the technology parameters x c f following the approach explained by dawkins et al 2007 the calibration process uses us 1 as the measurement unit and scales other variables accordingly for each crop produced by a household for example if household f used 0 5 ton of fertiliser at 200 ton to produce 5 tons of crop c and sold it at the price of 100 ton the measurement unit of fertiliser would be 0 005 ton i e 1 and the quantity of fertiliser would be 100 units in a similar way the measurement unit of crop output would be scaled down to 0 01 ton and the quantity of the harvested crop would be 500 units the coefficient of the input requirement for fertilisers would be x c f 100 500 0 2 this calibration approach allows us to take into account the fact that the input and output quality might vary across households and across crops and these variations are incorporated in the price and the total value after the calibration the value add of irrigation water and response to water pricing for each of the 1207 households are calculated following eq s 2 and 4 we compare the average value added of irrigation water extractions across the household groups in table 1 with a t test to take into account a sizable fraction of possible zero values the level of statistical significance for a group difference is estimated in two approaches for robustness namely i using zero below censored distributions for all the 1 207 households and ii including only households that have a positive value add alternatively one can fit the value added and the household characteristics to multiple regression models the regression technique can help estimate a causal relationship x causes y ceteris paribus but it will likely be subject to simultaneity bias and the available dataset does not provide a strong instrument variable to overcome this possible bias for instance while the financial status of a household could influence the value add of irrigation water it is possible that the reverse causal relationship might also be true e g the value add of irrigation water could influence the financial status and the borrowing capacity of a household similar issues may arise with other variables e g poor households with a low value add of production inputs could join the state run farmers association for extra assistance in addition the regression technique might be subject to the common specification search biases franco et al 2014 brodeur et al 2016 ioannidis et al 2017 where the true specification is unknown and the reported specifications are usually the one with the desired result leamer 1978 in sum our group comparison approach is a simpler more transparent and replicable method science editorials 2013 and does not necessarily impose a causal relationship between variables we employ the crop choice model to estimate the price elasticity of irrigation water extractions the price elasticity measures the percentage change in water extracted or diverted when the water price increases by 1 the price elasticity can be measured using mathematical programming or by experiments econometric techniques scheierling et al 2006 t1 or estimated from preference surveys zuo et al 2015 here we use the mathematical programming approach to estimate the price elasticity at different price levels in particular we use eq 4 to calculate how each household when already paying a volumetric price for irrigation water would respond to an increase in the price 3 results 3 1 value add of water in irrigation the value add of irrigation water across the 1207 households is summarised in fig 1 with domestic currency converted to us at the 2016 exchange rate 1us 21 935vnd source imf s international financial statistics there are 198 households or 16 4 of the sample that have zero added value for irrigation water this fact does not necessarily mean that these 198 households could grow crops without water but rather it implies that the households could reduce irrigation water without sacrificing their profits by optimising their crop choice the estimated mean of the value add across all 1207 households is around 0 56 us m3 the 95 confidence interval of the mean is estimated to be 0 49 us m3 0 63 us m3 these statistical estimates are based on zero below censored distributions to take into account the fact that a fraction of households have zero added value for irrigation water 3 2 value add of water and household characteristics we summarise the results of the group comparison in table 2 and provide the detailed test statistics in the appendix the first column of the table is the group classification criteria which are clustered into three categories i whether any member of a household joined a social or political organization ii the financial and creditability status and iii education training level access to the internet gender and household locations the second and third columns show the difference between an average household inside and outside of a group for the two alternative ways of controlling zero values together with stars showing the level of significance if any the signs of the numbers in these two columns are the same in all rows suggesting some robustness in the overall conclusion some large numbers might not appear statistically significant because the group comparison takes into account the relative sizes of the treatment and control groups thus if the size of one group is only a small proportion of the other the comparison outcome may be considered less certain even when the estimated difference is large both testing approaches i e using zero below censored distributions for all households and including only households with positive value add support similar trends the first section of table 2 shows that there are some differences between members and non members of the social and political originations regarding the value add of irrigation water the value add of irrigation water in households with a member in the communist party on average exceeds those in the remaining households by about 50 the veteran association also has its members with a higher value add for the water they divert than non members the members of the farmers association have a lower average value added for water diverted but the difference is not significantly different from zero at the 10 level these results do not necessarily imply a causal relationship that joining an organisation will increase or decrease the value add of water rather they are evidence of underlying reasons such as self selection e g less advantaged households were more likely to join the farmers association or confounding factors e g people with more social connections were more likely to join the communist party the next section of table 2 shows how the value add of irrigation water is correlated with the financial and creditability status of households the value add of water in poor households is only around 50 of that in the non poor group of interest households who borrowed from formal credit sources such as banks and credit unions generated less value add for irrigation water compared to other households further those who borrowed from informal sources such as friends and relatives have on average a higher value add from irrigation water the final four rows of table 2 show the significant positive relationship between the value add of irrigation water and the education level access to the internet gender as well as household locations households with at least a member having attended professional training outperformed all other households and have on average between about 50 and 60 higher value add for water households with access to the internet appear to have between about 40 and 50 greater value add of irrigation water the value add is not significantly different across the gender of the household the final row of the table shows that farmers in the red river delta and the mekong delta had a higher average value added for water they extracted or diverted possibly because of the more advanced production techniques in these two agricultural hubs of vietnam 3 3 response to water pricing we examine the response of farmers to a number of possible levels of water prices when confronted with a price farmers are expected to use less water to maximise their profit they would only extract water when the added benefit of a cubic meter exceeds the charged price in other words farmers should not intentionally extract or divert more water if the added benefit were less than the cost the response of farmers to water pricing is summarised in table 3 along the row is a number of possible price levels and the columns predict the impacts on the total water use by farmers and their profitability the first column represents the business as usual bau scenario where this is no water charge other pricing scenarios are evaluated in a comparison to this bau scenario so we normalise the quantity of water and the profit of farmers at the bau scenario to 100 also at the bau the pricing revenue is 0 of the bau profit as there is no charge for water the result shows that water pricing can significantly reduce the amount of water diverted for irrigation for example it is estimated that setting the price of irrigation water at 0 1 us m3 would reduce irrigation water to only 15 8 of the water quantity at the bau scenario i e a reduction of some 84 this is because many farmers have a zero value add of water and thus would respond to the price and should not divert water as much as in the bau scenario moving from left to right the water price increases the water quantity extracted declines the results in table 3 show the financial impact of water pricing if the water price were set at us0 1 m3 the overall profit of farmers would decline from 100 to 83 01 of the bau profit most of this decline in the farmers profit 16 78 of the bau profit would be transformed into the pricing revenue that could be made available for maintenance and upgrades for water supply infrastructure and the unmatched shortfall would be 0 21 this gap however does not mean that water pricing would cause an overall welfare loss when the pricing revenue collected by the government was less than the loss incurred by farmers water not extracted or diverted by irrigators could be reallocated for other purposes e g hydropower generation or environmental uses that could generate higher economic and non economic value and benefit which are not calculated in table 3 3 4 measuring water price elasticity the estimated price elasticity of irrigation water is summarised in table 4 here the average elasticity coefficients across all households were estimated using both simple mean and quantity weighted together with their 95 confidence intervals the table shows that the average value ranges from 0 04 to 0 94 inside the range suggested by the literature scheierling et al 2006 but the price elasticity varies across price levels for both the simple mean and weighted mean estimates the higher price the more quantity reduction associated with 1 increase in the price this is because the absolute value of the 1 increase of a high price is more than that of a low price so 1 increase of a higher price has more impact on profit maximising farmers at least in this particular case thus the slope of water demand functions depends on the contextual choice of farmers such that a constant elasticity demand function might be inappropriate for example the constant elasticity hypothesis can easily be rejected here where the price elasticity at 0 1 us m3 is significantly lower than that at 0 2 us 2 m3 even without any intersection of their 95 confidence intervals in this situation the demand for irrigation water may be represented by a piece wise linear function rather than a constant elasticity specification 4 discussion and policy implications our analysis estimates a significant value add of irrigation water for non rice annual crops in vietnam at 0 56 us m3 in 2016 while we acknowledge that the value added of irrigation water depends on many contextual factors such as weather conditions and the output price of agricultural products finger 2012 we contend that our range of values provides preliminary evidence for effective water pricing in vietnam in other words our framework can inform policy makers about the potential impacts of water pricing including the impact on water quantity extracted and the distributional impact on farmers profit and pricing revenue the results show that the value add of irrigation water could be increased if water were reallocated to alternative economically beneficial uses other than irrigation for instance more than 16 of the surveyed households have a zero value add which indicates irrigation water is mispriced at its current level of zero this evidence is supported by the simulated outcome of water pricing which shows that changing a zero to a relatively low water price could reduce the irrigation water by around 84 while still leaving the total economic welfare more or less the same the estimated gain of water pricing reported in table 3 is likely to be a conservative estimate this is because our estimate is based on the assumption that farmers are able to make optimal choices in crop productions in practice excessive irrigation in vietnam is possible due to a farmer s risk aversion world bank group 2016 36 and this may affect crop quality and reduce yields steduto et al 2012 6 in this case water pricing would be an effective solution because it would provide incentives for farmers to irrigate their crops more efficiently as they would only use water when the added benefit of a cubic meter exceeds the charged price and to adopt new water saving technology as the literature on water resources shows renzetti 2009 1 grafton et al 2020 mispriced water can result in long term consequences such as excessive abstraction overextended infrastructure stifled innovation and diminished water quality our findings suggest that water pricing could be an effective policy option to improve the value add of irrigation water indeed irrigation water pricing is not uncommon and its effectiveness has been observed in several countries e g australia western united states chile italy jordan and south africa although institutional legal and cultural arrangements may vary as do the impacts of water pricing grafton et al 2011a toan 2016 setting a volumetric price for surface water diverted for irrigation does not have to result in a significant negative impact on net incomes if appropriately complemented by other policies while empirical evidence shows crop profit may decline speelman et al 2009 the revenue from water pricing could be used to provide income support to compensate farmers for higher water prices while retaining their incentive to conserve water flexible pricing schemes could also be developed to minimise the negative impacts on poor farmers such as block pricing wherein water prices are low and fixed below a specific volume and rise rapidly for higher water diversions further there needs to be transparency and a regular two way flow of information i e farmers need to factor water prices and support into their production planning and decision makers need to consult farmers on the level of support needed to balance efficiency and equity objectives we contend that at least in vietnam re imposing a price on irrigation water is feasible toan et al 2016 irrigation water pricing is not new in vietnam because irrigation water did incur a price by farmers until the early 2000s further irrigators who pump groundwater are already paying for substantial electricity costs and have had these costs rise as aquifer levels have fallen in some provinces especially in the dry seasons grafton et al 2016 in addition the day to day experience with pricing schemes of treated water which allow for heterogeneity and differentiate among water users has also made households more familiar with water pricing a necessary condition to implement irrigation water pricing is that households or groups of households must be individually metered and charged a volumetric price for the water they extract this might require an upfront investment and implementation cost e g installing meter devices but previous studies show that the benefit of water pricing can also compensate the cost see e g a review by johansson 2000 evidence based policies that allow a reallocation of water from less to more highly valued uses in other countries can also lead to economic gains worth billions of dollars grafton et al 2011b provided that all water sources were metered then a series of dialogues could commence over how water prices might be established wyrwoll et al 2018 many possible water pricing options are available a block amount free of charge with a volumetric charge above this amount dynamic pricing e g seasonal pricing in response to water scarcity chu and grafton 2019 and differential water prices based on where the water is being used or for what purpose these pricing options can also be combined to meet multiple policy objectives if required in terms of implementation irrigation water pricing in vietnam could be piloted at a smaller scale before any large scale or national roll out pilot projects could also assist in accumulating the knowledge and experience needed to undertake provincial level irrigation water pricing the precise pricing policies however would depend on the context of the location and should be tailored to account for pricing design income support policies and business models for upfront investments for additional infrastructure practical implementation considerations for water pricing would include procedures to deal with non compliance revenue collection information provision property rights and mitigation for negative impacts in terms of equity it may also be preferable to pilot scheme irrigation water pricing in relatively high income agricultural regions where farmers may be better able to invest in new techniques and have a greater ability to innovate policy options for improving the value add of water should also include options to improve water use decision making at the farm level for instance training and access to the internet are strongly connected to the value add of water diverted for irrigation thus knowledge transfer and sharing possibly as part of farmer extension services should also assist in improving production technique crop choice and the value add of water 5 conclusions water scarcity especially in relation to water diversions for irrigation is an important and on going challenge in many countries including vietnam charging farmers for the water they divert for irrigation from public irrigation schemes provides a means to cover the costs of maintaining and increasing water supplies while providing incentives for water conservation while in theory water pricing can allow for water conservation and water reallocation that will increase the overall economic surplus from water use key concerns of decision makers are the possible negative consequences for both food production and the profitability of irrigators we employ a crop choice optimisation model and use an extensive household survey data to provide estimates of the value of add of water diverted for irrigation in vietnam our approach allows us to evaluate the response of farmers to water pricing including the reduction in water quantity and distributional impacts on crop profitability and pricing revenue our results show that an appropriate volumetric water price could reduce water extractions for irrigation to around a sixth of the business as usual level with only a relatively small impact on average irrigator profitability further irrigation water pricing also allows for the possibility that a high proportion of the revenue collected to be invested in water supply maintenance and upgrades complementary policies such as enhancing farm level skills via knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing could further promote the value add of surface water in vietnamese agriculture while our methods and calculations apply only to vietnam we contend that this approach offers a practical means to assess the possible consequences of different irrigation water prices in other countries declaration of competing interest none

10791,automated software tools are required to undertake the routine tasks and decision making involved in scheduling irrigation a key issue in this topic is how to integrate sensors in the scheduling approach the objectives of this research were to test in the context of drip irrigated orchards a the suitability of fao s water balance method locally adjusted by sensors as the basis for the scheduling algorithm b the suitability of capacitance type soil moisture sensors and an approach for their automated interpretation for providing feedback to the scheduling algorithm and c the performance of these combined approaches in the autonomous scheduling of irrigation in an apple orchard with heterogeneous vigour the trial consisted of applying for two years the proposed approaches using an experimental web application irrix which scheduled irrigation of two irrigation sectors which differed in tree size the automated system was compared with manual scheduling by a classical water balance and with the actual evapotranspiration determined by a weighing lysimeter located in the same orchard results show that the irrigation applied by the automated approach in the sector of larger trees agreed with the et determined by the lysimeter and overall with the scheduling by an experienced irrigator using a classical water balance meanwhile as a result of a different feedback from soil moisture sensors the same system reduced irrigation in the sector of smaller trees by a similar amount to that expected from the differences between the two sectors in the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation this study illustrates that the method of water balance complemented with capacitance type soil moisture sensors provides a sound basis for automated irrigation scheduling in orchards keywords irrigation control drip irrigation 10hs sensor internet of things orchard automation precision agriculture 1 introduction at the plot level an appropriate irrigation scheduling promote benefits such as saving water decreasing environmental impacts and generating sustainable agriculture smith et al 1996 in this context the paradigm of precision irrigation emphasizes the variable rate application of water according with the variability in weather soil crop properties and topography daccache et al 2015 in practice the variety of factors to take into account together with the sequence of routine steps involved in scheduling irrigation requires of farmers too much dedication perseverance and expertise for conducting an optimized irrigation strategy consequently digital tools are required to alleviate those requirements and enable commercial orchards apply precision irrigation with a feasible effort as a basis for determining the irrigation schedules the most common method for calculating irrigation requirements follows the approach of fao s soil water balance where the water inputs in the soil plant system are compared with the outputs doorenbos and pruitt 1977 the major output is the evapotranspiration by the crop etc which under non stress conditions can be predicted from etc eto kc where the evapotranspiration of a reference crop eto is estimated by the penman monteith method and kc is the crop coefficient characteristic of each crop allen et all 1998 however in horticultural crops this approach can be quite uncertain since for a given crop species its kc may vary with factors such as spacing and orientation of the rows intrieri et al 1998 the plant variety higgins et al 1992 crop load wünsche et al 2000 naor et al 2008 and the size and shape of the canopy wünsche et al 1995 ayars et al 2003 girona et al 2011 marsal et al 2014 in particular the dependence of kc on the solar radiation intercepted by the canopy has previously being studied in apple orchards girona et al 2011 auzmendi et al 2011 marsal et al 2013 furthermore automated dosing of irrigation proportional to the daily amount of solar radiation intercepted by the canopy has experimentally been tested in apple casadesús et al 2011 on the other hand given the practical difficulties for a precise parameterization of the water balance sensors can be used for an empirical site specific adjustment a simple approach is to set in the irrigation automata a general irrigation program based on a conservative water balance and then an automated system suppresses irrigation when the soil moisture exceeds a determined threshold muñoz carpena et al 2005 cáceres et al 2008 a more elaborated approach is to determine irrigation doses by water balance but using the feedback from sensors for the empirical adjustment of kc bacci et al 2008 casadesús et al 2012 this combination of water balance and sensors sums up the ability to calculate irrigation volumes by water balance with the site specific adaptive response to sensors the choice of the sensing method for providing feedback must trade off its reliability with the feasibility of its usage in farms one of the most widely used types of sensors for irrigation management are soil water sensors of capacitance type kojima et al 2016 bogena et al 2017 domínguez niño et al 2019 their functioning relies on the determination of the dielectric permittivity of the soil around the sensor which mostly depends on the soil water content capacitance sensors have the advantage of being low cost and require little maintenance campbell 1990 kizito et al 2008 visconti et al 2014 however the response of these sensors varies with soil texture presence of coarse elements macropores roots and soil compaction hignett and evett 2008 furthermore the dielectric permittivity is influenced by the temperature and by the electrical conductivity of the medium kizito et al 2008 kargas and soulis 2019 an additional complication in scenarios of localized irrigation is the heterogeneous distribution of soil water in contrast with flood and sprinkler irrigation where the water infiltrates on the most or all soil surface in localized irrigation infiltration takes place directly in the area around the emitter cote et al 2003 irmak et al 2016 this creates wet bulbs in the soil whose size and shape depend on many factors such as the soil hydraulic characteristics the absorption by the roots the evaporation from the soil surface as well as the irrigation depth relative position of the dripper drip line sources spacing and quantity and frequency of the irrigation lazarovitch et al 2007 nafchi et al 2011 elmaloglou et al 2013 hao et al 2007 all of these factors lead to one of the major difficulties in using capacitance sensors which is the high variability between sensors even if installed at equivalent positions in the soil intrigliolo and castel 2004 nevertheless once a sensor has been installed the effects associated with its exact position including the properties of the soil around it will be nearly constant rolston et al 1991 hence one approach to deal with the variability between sensors is to field calibrate each individual sensor after installation evett et al 2008 2009 mittelbach et al 2012 singh et al 2018 a simplified field calibration approach for practical use in irrigation is to rescale the measurements by each sensor as relative to the measurements recorded by the same sensor under conditions of soil water at field capacity in addition to simplify dealing with the daily pattern of soil water content the interpretation can focus in the driest measurement recorded each day casadesús et al 2012 the trend of this value between consecutive days has been proposed as an indicator of the resulting water balance in that period and has been used for tuning the water balance in an algorithm of automated irrigation scheduling casadesús et al 2012 the overall goal of this research was to demonstrate the feasibility of automated scheduling irrigation in orchards where in practice size and structure of the canopy can be a common source of variation in particular this study focused at testing a the suitability of water balance locally tuned by sensors as the basis for irrigation scheduling in drip irrigated orchards b the unmanned interpretation of soil moisture measured by capacitance sensors as a source of feedback for the scheduling algorithm and c the performance of these combined approaches in the autonomous scheduling of irrigation in an apple orchard with heterogeneous vigour the study was conducted with an experimental web application irrix which implements the proposed algorithms and the methods for unmanned interpretation of capacitance sensors on an apple orchard with heterogeneous vigour sectors with larger and smaller trees were scheduled during two seasons by the automated system using capacitance sensors the trial looked at how the automated system behaved on sectors with different tree vigour and whether with identical configuration it was able to provide differential irrigation according to the differences in tree vigour additionally the automated system was compared with manual scheduling by a classical water balance and with the actual evapotranspiration determined by a weighing lysimeter located in the same orchard 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and irrigation treatments the apple orchard malus domestica borkh cv golden reinders was located at the irta lleida experimental station in mollerussa 41 6 n 0 8 e 260 m above sea level lleida spain with a dry continental mediterranean climate apple trees had been planted in 2011 spaced at 3 63 m x 1 2 m oriented north south irrigation was provided by means of a single pipe with drippers every 0 6 m whose delivery rate was 3 5 dm3 h 1 some properties of the soil are shown in table 1 one fraction of this plantation had been replanted after a previous apple plantation and in this area the trees were homogeneously smaller than in the rest of the orchard because of the apple tree replant disease laurent et al 2010 singh et al 2017 the average trunk cross sectional area tcsa in the unaffected area was 40 55 cm2 while in the affected area it was 27 94 cm2 the trial consisted of the automated scheduling of two independent irrigation sectors one in the area of larger trees auto l and the other in an area with smaller trees auto s these were compared with two sectors scheduled manually following a classical water balance one with larger trees manual l and the other with smaller trees manual s manual irrigation scheduling consisted of the application of the fao s water balance allen et al 1998 on a weekly basis by an experienced irrigator using eto from the previous week recorded by a weather station located in the same farm and crop coefficients kc determined in previous years by the weighing lysimeter included in the same orchard in these sectors irrigation was controlled by solenoid valves operated by a commercial automata agronic 4000 sistemes electrònics progrés palau d anglesola lleida spain which was programmed remotely every monday through the desktop application provided by the manufacturer all irrigation sectors were equipped with the same model of water meter cz3000 contazara zaragoza spain that were recorded at least twice per week apart from the scheduling application the manual scheduling made no distinction between manual l and manual s and applied a homogeneous irrigation program to the whole orchard based on the estimated requirements of the larger trees which mirrors the expected practice in a commercial farm 2 2 deployment and management of the automated scheduling one datalogger model cr800 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was used in the automated sectors for both recording sensors and commanding irrigation valves the datalogger was equipped with a multiplexer am16 32 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa to increase the number of sensor channels which were measured every 15 s and the average of 5 min was stored a 3 g modem mtx 3 g java mtx flexitron group madrid spain allowed remote communication through internet protocol in addition a four channel latching relay lr4 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa enabled the datalogger open and close the irrigation valves of the auto sectors model ¾ aquanet plus netafim the program in the datalogger written in cr basic campbell scientific inc logan ut usa implemented the functionalities of an irrigation automata four times per day the web application polled the datalogger for new sensor data and once per day typically at 02 30 gmt irrix sent to the datalogger the irrigation doses of each sector in mm for the new day communication between the irrix server and the datalogger used the api packbus sdk campbell scientific inc logan ut usa during the day independently for each sector at the appointed time 8 00 am the datalogger started irrigation and ended it when it had measured the scheduled dose each automated sector was equipped with six capacitance type soil moisture sensors 10hs meter group pullman wa usa which were recorded by the datalogger in units of soil water content m3 m 3 using the general calibration for mineral soils proposed by the manufacturer these sensors have one body with two 14 5 cm long prong spaced 3 3 cm which gives an apparent permittivity measurement volume of around 1 dm3 sakaki et al 2008 all soil sensors were installed at 30 cm depth three of them centered 15 cm from the vertical of the dripper perpendicular to the irrigation pipe and the other three at the mid point between two drippers each automated sector was equipped with a water meter with a resolution of one pulse per litter model multijet m15 arad group dalia israel which were used by the datalogger for controlling the delivery of the appointed doses in addition a temperature sensor model vp3 meter group pullman wa usa provided a continuous measurement of air temperature that was used by irrix for the estimation of eto using hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 the settings of auto l and auto s in the automated scheduling application were exactly the same while they were equipped with separate sets of soil moisture sensors which would provide independent feedback to the scheduling algorithm 2 3 web platform for irrigation control irrix irrix is a custom made software for research on sensor based irrigation scheduling it can operate autonomously during the whole irrigation season with a daily routine that includes uploading sensor data from the field analysing those data updating the water balance deciding the next irrigation doses at each plot and transmitting them to the automata in the field the scheduling approach used by irrix consists of estimating the crop water requirements by the method of water balance allen et al 1998 and use the feedback from sensors for adjusting empirically the irrigation doses of each sector casadesús et al 2012 basically the daily irrigation doses did in mm were determined on a daily basis as 1 did et o k x where eto was the reference evapotranspiration estimated by the hargreaves equation using as input the air temperature recorded by the datalogger kx was initialized as a crop coefficient and later on independently for each sector it was iteratively adjusted on a daily basis from feedback by the sensors in order to provide a seasonal vision of irrigation and to enable in other studies the application of certain types of irrigation strategies irrix requires the definition of a seasonal plan the seasonal plans of irrix specify for every day of the irrigation season the acceptable ranges for a the accumulated irrigation b the weekly water unbalance and c the range of crop s water comfort in terms of the monitored normalized soil water content nswc in the seasonal plan for this trial the range of accumulated irrigation and the weekly balance were set sufficiently wide to avoid limiting the response to sensors fig 1 sectors auto l and auto s were configured exactly with the same seasonal plan which was also the same for 2017 and 2018 interpretation of the soil moisture sensors by irrix focused at the trend between consecutive days of the driest measurement of each day swcd in order to manage the variability between sensors irrix normalized those values between the measurable range of each individual sensor as defined by its actual reading at field capacity and the presumed wilting point for that soil textural class hence the nswc dimensionless was calculated as 2 nswc swc d swc wp swc fc swc wp where swcd was the driest soil water content measured by the sensor at given day m3 m 3 swcfc was the highest daily minimum of the soil water content swcd recorded by a sensor in a period of reference at the start of the season under conditions near field capacity in this context the purpose of swcfc is just to provide an empirical reference for that sensor near its high end of scale fig 2 shows an example of the empirical setting of swcfc for one sensor since normal growing conditions were far from wilting point swcwp was not empirically based but set at the typical swc at wilting point for that soil textural class table 2 shows the references set to the different sensors involved in this study in order to enforce its tolerance to sensor failures the daily analysis of sensor data by irrix included rating the reliability of each sensor these automated ratings started assigning to each sensor a reliability of 1 0 and when irrix detected values out of range noise or abnormal patterns the reliability of the sensor was penalized which could decrease its value down to 0 0 the advantage of this method is that if a sensor is broken or disconnected for any reason irrix can automatically detect this situation assign it a reliability of 0 0 and keep the aggregated value safe from its influence to obtain a single value to summarize the state of an irrigation sector irrix aggregated the nswc obtained by the six sensors installed on a sector through a weighted average in this trial the weight of each sensor was its current rating of reliability updated with the same set of data being summarized in order to provide feedback to the scheduling algorithm irrix evaluates every day the state of an irrigation sector as either to dry to wet or fitted from the current value of aggregated nswc and its trend in the last 3 days it calculates the projected value after 3 days nswc 3d if nswc 3d is below the comfort zone specified in the seasonal plan then the state of that sector is evaluated as too dry and the response of irrix consists of increasing kx by the estimated amount to fill in three days the soil wet bulbs up to the water content corresponding to the midst of the comfort zone if nswc 3d is above the comfort zone it is evaluated as too wet and the response aims at reaching the midst of the comfort zone at the wet bulbs in 7 days in either case the change in kx is conditioned to fulfil the conditions of accumulated irrigation and water unbalance specified in the seasonal plan 2 4 measurement of etc by weighing lysimeter the same orchard where this trial was conducted is equipped with two weighing lysimeters that provide a continuous measurement of crop evapotranspiration girona et al 2004 these lysimeters contain four apple trees each grown in equivalent conditions than the rest of the plantation the eto used in the lysimeter was the penman monteith evapotranspiration determined by an automated meteorological station located next to the orchard operated by the catalan meteorological service due to maintenance operations in the period from march to july 2017 the lysimeters were not operative and the daily et values for that period were estimated from the kc values determined in 2018 corrected by the ratio between kc measured in august of both years as 3 et d2017 eto d2017 kc d2018 kc august2017 kc august2018 2 5 physiological and agronomical measurements stem water potential swp was determined once a week using a pressure chamber 3005 series portable plant water status console soil moisture equipment corp model 3005 santa barbara ca usa following the method described by mccutchan and shackel 1992 procedure measurements were made at solar noon on shaded leaves located close to the main trunk previously leaves were covered with plastic sheathes with aluminium foil bags to minimize transpiration and keep in balance with the xylem of the tree the differences in vigour between the large and small trees were quantified in terms of fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopies fipar along the whole day the measurement method was similar to the fisheye photography described by wünsche et al 1995 and consisted on taking hemispheric photos from below the tree following a pattern that covered the entire planting space the photographs were taken with a digital camera nikon d70 and a 10 17 mm at x tokina fish eye lens on a self leveling support that held the camera 10 cm above ground the photographs were processed to calculate the daily solar path on each picture and analyse the fraction between treetop pixels and background i e blue sky at the different sun positions along the day to determine yield and its components the central five apple trees of each plot were individually harvested and the collected fruits counted and weighted to determine total yield kg of fruits per tree yield and after passing the fruits for a grade and removing fruits smaller than 70 mm the remaining ones were used to determine commercial yield kg tree 1 and t ha 1 cy yield index yi kg of total yield ctsa 1 kg cm 2 and commercial yield index cyi kg of commercial yield ctsa 1 kg cm 2 were also determined to compare the effects of treatments in fruit production because of the location and distribution of the different plots within the orchard each individual tree was used as a repetition resulting a strip plot design statistical analyses were carried out with sas sas institute cary nc usa version 9 4 the effects of treatments were analysed by means of the general linear model glm procedure and differences among means were compared with the lsmeans followed by tukey kramer adjustment with the statistical significance established at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrix performance and interpretation of sensor data the trees in sectors auto s and manual s had through the duration of the trial a visually lower vigour than those in the rest of the plot including auto l manual l and the lysimeter the ratio between fiparauto s and fiparauto l was persistently around 0 88 during the whole period of study fig 3 interaction of the research team with the web application irrix concentrated in 2017 before season when the seasonal plan was established and the references for each sensor were set during the irrigation seasons of 2017 and 2018 irrix operated autonomously and the participation of the research team consisted in supervising the normal development of the irrigation plan by connecting once twice per week to irrix and checking for common anomalies that would require a physical repair such as malfunction of the irrigation system or the sensors data recorded by soil moisture sensors used to show clear responses to irrigation rain and water uptake by the crop as illustrated in fig 4 which shows a period that includes rain events and an interruption in water supply as shown in fig 4a at the daily scale the timing of irrigation was programmed to concur with eto however irrigation did not necessarily fluctuate between days with eto because the control algorithm may vary at any time the proportionality between irrigation and eto the soil water content recorded by sensors showed a clear daily pattern with a peak during irrigation followed by a decrease that may be attributed to the redistribution of water in soil plus uptake by roots in days without irrigation sensors showed a clear decrease in water content during transpiration hours and still values at night most rain events could be observed as a rise in soil water content unaligned with irrigation despite the coherent responses of individual sensors to irrigation rain and water uptake by the crop a large variation was observed between sensors which fluctuated with similar patterns but shifted at different positions in the scale of soil water content swc as shown in fig 4b the scatter between sensors in swc was twice as large as the typical fluctuation of a sensor in a daily cycle and also larger than the effect of suppressing irrigation for several days sensor to sensor variability in the soil moisture recorded by capacitance type sensors has frequently been reported intrigliolo and castel 2004 hignett and evett 2008 kizito et al 2008 kargas and soulis 2011 such variation could partially be explained by the small volume of soil perceived by a capacitance sensor around 1 dm3 in sensor 10hs sakaki et al 2008 whereas the soil electrical permittivity at that scale of observation may vary at different spots as affected by macropores soil density or stones hignett and evett 2008 in addition under conditions of localized irrigation wet bulbs develop below the emitters determining a very heterogeneous pattern of soil moisture samadianfard et al 2012 to cope with such variability some authors recommend installing sensors at two or more depths or positions dursun and ozden 2011 casadesús et al 2012 lea cox et al 2013 soulis et al 2015 domínguez niño et al 2019 regarding the interpretation of sensor data an approach for handling the variability between sensors is to look at the dynamics rather than the absolute readings irrix focuses on the trend of swcd fig 4b with the assumption that the driest situation after a cycle of irrigation redistribution and uptake by roots summarizes the aggregate outcome of those processes moreover the trends of swcd in consecutive days may follow the soil water balance and be used for rating the fit between irrigation and the crop water requirements casadesús et al 2012 besides its dynamics another informative trait of swcd is its relative position within the particular span of measurements by that sensor which can be specified by normalizing the value of swcd between the readings of that sensor at wilting point and field capacity fig 4c hence one normalized the dataset including different sensors can offer a more straightforward view of the soil water dynamics than the original readings whose overall pattern may be partly obscured by the variability in the baseline of each sensor additionally as it can be observed in this example variability between sensors was highest when the average soil moisture was lowest and that the variability was reduced at higher soil moisture specially following rain this observation may endorse the interpretation that under localized irrigation short irrigation doses can cause larger variability because while some spots can still be wetted the shrunk wet bulbs leave some spots outside the wetted volume swelled bulbs may re include those spots and the sensors there and hence reduce their variability accordingly aggregation of the different sensors once normalized may offer a sounder basis for decision making compared with the direct readings 3 2 applied irrigation overall the seasonal amount of irrigation applied in auto l was similar to that applied by an expert using water balance in the manual treatment and similar also to the etc measured by the lysimeter while auto s applied 24 less irrigation fig 5 in 2017 auto l applied a total irrigation volume of 666 0 mm similar to manual only differed by a 1 0 while in 2018 auto l irrigated 724 7 mm 4 9 more than manual in both years auto s applied lower doses than auto l 23 7 and 27 2 less in 2017 and 2018 respectively and manual 24 5 and 23 4 less in the year 2017 and 2018 respectively the seasonal amount of irrigation applied in auto l was in agreement with the etc measured by the lysimeter differences of 6 1 and 0 9 in the years 2017 and 2018 respectively while the irrigation in auto s was considerably lower than the etc at the lysimeter 18 7 and 27 9 for the year 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 5 shows how those volumes accumulated along the season 3 3 response of the automated irrigation scheduling with a greater detail the functioning of the automated scheduling is illustrated in fig 6 the span of time shown in the figure corresponds to the part of the season in 2018 where the irrigation requirements were highest in that period the measured eto fluctuated between 3 4 and 6 1 mm and et measured by the lysimeter was slightly higher than eto with an average kc of 1 03 in both auto l and auto s irrix tried to keep the soil moisture here expressed as nswc within the comfort zone specified in the seasonal plan however the observed pattern of soil moisture response to irrigation by these two sectors was different which caused that they required different adjustments to maintain the comfort zone auto l used to remain in the lower part of the comfort zone and several times it decreased below the lower limit of comfort hence irrix often evaluated that the state of the soil or its projection for the next days was too dry and it adjusted the irrigation coefficient of auto l upwards on the other hand auto s used to remain easily in the upper part of the comfort zone and several times its moisture level surpassed the upper limit of comfort consequently in those occasions where irrix evaluated that the state of the soil or its projection in the next days were too wet irrix adjusted the irrigation coefficient downwards as a result within that period the average irrigation coefficient for auto l was 0 97 and 47 2 of the time it was above the presumed kc value meanwhile the irrigation coefficient for auto s was on average 0 75 and most of the time below 1 0 which was the presumed kc at the time of preparing the seasonal plan all those adjustments of the irrigation coefficients produced different irrigation doses in the two automated sectors with average daily doses of 5 6 mm and 4 4 mm in auto l and auto s respectively and 73 6 of the time auto s with a lower irrigation dose than auto l incidentally within the period shown in fig 6 a power cut following a small storm in july 20th produced an interruption of irrigation for two days which triggered different responses in the two automated sectors in auto l the lack of irrigation immediately produced a decrease in soil moisture which stimulated the irrigation coefficient and helped in approaching the comfort zone after the incident in contrast in auto s the soil moisture was maintained probably because the rainfall could compensate the missing irrigation and furthermore the next irrigation after this event raised the soil moisture above the comfort zone causing a decrease in the irrigation coefficient some days later these results show how the control algorithm of irrix without using information of tree vigour applied a differential irrigation because the moisture sensors perceived that soil water was depleted faster in auto l than in auto s previous studies at the same site had looked at the effect of tree canopy on irrigation requirements in particular lysimeter data from a previous apple plantation showed a strong relationship between fipar and kc girona et al 2011 using the relationship described in girona et al 2011 with the fipar measured in this trial we estimate that kc at auto s would be 21 below the kc at auto l this value fits closely with the response of the automated algorithm in the present study where the amount of irrigation applied to auto s was 23 lower than the amount applied to auto l 3 4 physiological and agronomical results measurements of stem water potential were aligned with the values obtained by girona et al 2010 between 0 8 mpa and 1 3 mpa the measured stem water potential showed slightly more negative values in the smaller trees regardless of whether irrigation was scheduled automatically or manually fig 7 more precisely during the year 2017 in manual l and auto l the stem water potential remained between 1 3 mpa and 0 7 mpa and in manual s and auto s they were between 1 5 mpa and 0 7 mpa during the year 2018 in manual l and auto l the stem water potential remained between 1 2 mpa and 0 7 mpa and in manual s and auto s they were between 1 3 mpa and 0 7 mpa in the manual treatment it can be noticed that even though manual s received the same irrigation than manual l their stem water potential used to be lower this may be explained by the diagnosed cause of their smaller size the apple replant disease that disease affects the root system laurent et al 2010 singh et al 2017 and the lower swp may be a consequence of the limited hydraulic conductance of their root system therefore taking into account the measured swp and the effect of this disease the data suggests that trees in auto s were not water limited by irrigation the yield of this apple orchard table 3 showed a large variation between the two years of the study mainly attributed to a poor fruit set in 2017 which was also clearly identified in the whole area however no statistical differences were found between treatments for the main productivity indicators when analysing the harvest data for the whole experimental period table 3 because of the commercial thinning practices no differences were observed on yield between large and small tress and more important no statistical significant differences were found on cyi commercial yield index and yi yield index therefore it can be stated that no negative effects of the automated management were observed on yield either in the larger trees which were irrigated a similar amount to classical water balance or in smaller trees where the automated algorithm saved 23 of irrigation volume 3 5 irrigation scheduling approach overall this study tested the performance of scheduling irrigation through an automated water balance approach tuned by capacitance type soil moisture sensors here we observed how the adaptive response allowed spontaneous adjustment to a component of the water balance in this case the low et associated to low vigour that had not been considered in the original configuration of the water balance this experience may exemplify the capacity of this approach to confront site specific conditions that would be difficult to parameterize in a deterministic model as another example a previous version of the algorithm showed a spontaneous adaptation to the presence of groundwater casadesús et al 2014 which would otherwise be omitted in the management of irrigation regarding the choice for a base scheduling method the water balance approach provides an effective method for fitting irrigation to the encountered weather conditions allen et al 1998 while irrigation controllers based on water balance are commercially available for turfgrass davis and dukes 2014 their application to orchards would be more complicated because of the much larger uncertainty of crop coefficients that uncertainty was solved here through feedback from sensors which provided an empirical site specific adjustment of the ratio of irrigation to eto other alternative sensor based approaches use predefined thresholds either to trigger irrigation when the soil is too dry dukes and scholberg 2005 osroosh et al 2016 vera et al 2019 and or to bypass a timer triggered irrigation when the soil is too wet smajstrla and locascio 1996 cáceres et al 2007 muñoz carpena et al 2008 some advantages of water balance tuned by sensors are that its response is smoother and more predictable than occasional switching on off valves additionally it allows modulating the daily irrigation depth of each sector without disturbing the hydraulic scheme for the whole farm while irrigation triggered directly by sensors can switch valves on at arbitrary times complicating the operation of the farm s hydraulic system 4 conclusions the results of this trial show the feasibility of automated sensor based scheduling of irrigation in orchards the algorithm based on the approach of water balance and tuned locally through feedback from sensors provided precise irrigation doses along the season adapting itself to weather conditions and to the seasonal vegetation cycle of the crop capacitance sensors have successfully been used to provide automated feedback to the scheduling algorithm in spite of the observed sensor to sensor variability comparable with that reported by other authors the approach followed here allows a consistent mechanism for their unmanned interpretation and integration with decision making first the summarization of the daily fluctuation of soil water content on the daily driest measurement focuses the analysis on a simple parameter whose day to day dynamics retains much of the information on the fit between irrigation and the crop water demand second the sensor specific normalization of those daily values reduces the scatter between sensors and brings a more intelligible dataset on which to base automate control this trial shows how the irrigation doses determined by the algorithm are aligned with the et measured on the same orchard by a weighing lysimeter the irrigation doses applied by the automated approach are also comparable with those by a skilled irrigation technician though requiring less labour effort furthermore the tested algorithm adapts itself to heterogeneous tree vigour applying less irrigation to sectors with smaller trees in a proportion that fits previous lysimeter studies on the relationship between kc and fipar therefore this indicates that the algorithm could be suitable for horticultural application where adaptation to site specific vigour are a common concern declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the spanish national institute for agricultural and food

10791,automated software tools are required to undertake the routine tasks and decision making involved in scheduling irrigation a key issue in this topic is how to integrate sensors in the scheduling approach the objectives of this research were to test in the context of drip irrigated orchards a the suitability of fao s water balance method locally adjusted by sensors as the basis for the scheduling algorithm b the suitability of capacitance type soil moisture sensors and an approach for their automated interpretation for providing feedback to the scheduling algorithm and c the performance of these combined approaches in the autonomous scheduling of irrigation in an apple orchard with heterogeneous vigour the trial consisted of applying for two years the proposed approaches using an experimental web application irrix which scheduled irrigation of two irrigation sectors which differed in tree size the automated system was compared with manual scheduling by a classical water balance and with the actual evapotranspiration determined by a weighing lysimeter located in the same orchard results show that the irrigation applied by the automated approach in the sector of larger trees agreed with the et determined by the lysimeter and overall with the scheduling by an experienced irrigator using a classical water balance meanwhile as a result of a different feedback from soil moisture sensors the same system reduced irrigation in the sector of smaller trees by a similar amount to that expected from the differences between the two sectors in the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation this study illustrates that the method of water balance complemented with capacitance type soil moisture sensors provides a sound basis for automated irrigation scheduling in orchards keywords irrigation control drip irrigation 10hs sensor internet of things orchard automation precision agriculture 1 introduction at the plot level an appropriate irrigation scheduling promote benefits such as saving water decreasing environmental impacts and generating sustainable agriculture smith et al 1996 in this context the paradigm of precision irrigation emphasizes the variable rate application of water according with the variability in weather soil crop properties and topography daccache et al 2015 in practice the variety of factors to take into account together with the sequence of routine steps involved in scheduling irrigation requires of farmers too much dedication perseverance and expertise for conducting an optimized irrigation strategy consequently digital tools are required to alleviate those requirements and enable commercial orchards apply precision irrigation with a feasible effort as a basis for determining the irrigation schedules the most common method for calculating irrigation requirements follows the approach of fao s soil water balance where the water inputs in the soil plant system are compared with the outputs doorenbos and pruitt 1977 the major output is the evapotranspiration by the crop etc which under non stress conditions can be predicted from etc eto kc where the evapotranspiration of a reference crop eto is estimated by the penman monteith method and kc is the crop coefficient characteristic of each crop allen et all 1998 however in horticultural crops this approach can be quite uncertain since for a given crop species its kc may vary with factors such as spacing and orientation of the rows intrieri et al 1998 the plant variety higgins et al 1992 crop load wünsche et al 2000 naor et al 2008 and the size and shape of the canopy wünsche et al 1995 ayars et al 2003 girona et al 2011 marsal et al 2014 in particular the dependence of kc on the solar radiation intercepted by the canopy has previously being studied in apple orchards girona et al 2011 auzmendi et al 2011 marsal et al 2013 furthermore automated dosing of irrigation proportional to the daily amount of solar radiation intercepted by the canopy has experimentally been tested in apple casadesús et al 2011 on the other hand given the practical difficulties for a precise parameterization of the water balance sensors can be used for an empirical site specific adjustment a simple approach is to set in the irrigation automata a general irrigation program based on a conservative water balance and then an automated system suppresses irrigation when the soil moisture exceeds a determined threshold muñoz carpena et al 2005 cáceres et al 2008 a more elaborated approach is to determine irrigation doses by water balance but using the feedback from sensors for the empirical adjustment of kc bacci et al 2008 casadesús et al 2012 this combination of water balance and sensors sums up the ability to calculate irrigation volumes by water balance with the site specific adaptive response to sensors the choice of the sensing method for providing feedback must trade off its reliability with the feasibility of its usage in farms one of the most widely used types of sensors for irrigation management are soil water sensors of capacitance type kojima et al 2016 bogena et al 2017 domínguez niño et al 2019 their functioning relies on the determination of the dielectric permittivity of the soil around the sensor which mostly depends on the soil water content capacitance sensors have the advantage of being low cost and require little maintenance campbell 1990 kizito et al 2008 visconti et al 2014 however the response of these sensors varies with soil texture presence of coarse elements macropores roots and soil compaction hignett and evett 2008 furthermore the dielectric permittivity is influenced by the temperature and by the electrical conductivity of the medium kizito et al 2008 kargas and soulis 2019 an additional complication in scenarios of localized irrigation is the heterogeneous distribution of soil water in contrast with flood and sprinkler irrigation where the water infiltrates on the most or all soil surface in localized irrigation infiltration takes place directly in the area around the emitter cote et al 2003 irmak et al 2016 this creates wet bulbs in the soil whose size and shape depend on many factors such as the soil hydraulic characteristics the absorption by the roots the evaporation from the soil surface as well as the irrigation depth relative position of the dripper drip line sources spacing and quantity and frequency of the irrigation lazarovitch et al 2007 nafchi et al 2011 elmaloglou et al 2013 hao et al 2007 all of these factors lead to one of the major difficulties in using capacitance sensors which is the high variability between sensors even if installed at equivalent positions in the soil intrigliolo and castel 2004 nevertheless once a sensor has been installed the effects associated with its exact position including the properties of the soil around it will be nearly constant rolston et al 1991 hence one approach to deal with the variability between sensors is to field calibrate each individual sensor after installation evett et al 2008 2009 mittelbach et al 2012 singh et al 2018 a simplified field calibration approach for practical use in irrigation is to rescale the measurements by each sensor as relative to the measurements recorded by the same sensor under conditions of soil water at field capacity in addition to simplify dealing with the daily pattern of soil water content the interpretation can focus in the driest measurement recorded each day casadesús et al 2012 the trend of this value between consecutive days has been proposed as an indicator of the resulting water balance in that period and has been used for tuning the water balance in an algorithm of automated irrigation scheduling casadesús et al 2012 the overall goal of this research was to demonstrate the feasibility of automated scheduling irrigation in orchards where in practice size and structure of the canopy can be a common source of variation in particular this study focused at testing a the suitability of water balance locally tuned by sensors as the basis for irrigation scheduling in drip irrigated orchards b the unmanned interpretation of soil moisture measured by capacitance sensors as a source of feedback for the scheduling algorithm and c the performance of these combined approaches in the autonomous scheduling of irrigation in an apple orchard with heterogeneous vigour the study was conducted with an experimental web application irrix which implements the proposed algorithms and the methods for unmanned interpretation of capacitance sensors on an apple orchard with heterogeneous vigour sectors with larger and smaller trees were scheduled during two seasons by the automated system using capacitance sensors the trial looked at how the automated system behaved on sectors with different tree vigour and whether with identical configuration it was able to provide differential irrigation according to the differences in tree vigour additionally the automated system was compared with manual scheduling by a classical water balance and with the actual evapotranspiration determined by a weighing lysimeter located in the same orchard 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and irrigation treatments the apple orchard malus domestica borkh cv golden reinders was located at the irta lleida experimental station in mollerussa 41 6 n 0 8 e 260 m above sea level lleida spain with a dry continental mediterranean climate apple trees had been planted in 2011 spaced at 3 63 m x 1 2 m oriented north south irrigation was provided by means of a single pipe with drippers every 0 6 m whose delivery rate was 3 5 dm3 h 1 some properties of the soil are shown in table 1 one fraction of this plantation had been replanted after a previous apple plantation and in this area the trees were homogeneously smaller than in the rest of the orchard because of the apple tree replant disease laurent et al 2010 singh et al 2017 the average trunk cross sectional area tcsa in the unaffected area was 40 55 cm2 while in the affected area it was 27 94 cm2 the trial consisted of the automated scheduling of two independent irrigation sectors one in the area of larger trees auto l and the other in an area with smaller trees auto s these were compared with two sectors scheduled manually following a classical water balance one with larger trees manual l and the other with smaller trees manual s manual irrigation scheduling consisted of the application of the fao s water balance allen et al 1998 on a weekly basis by an experienced irrigator using eto from the previous week recorded by a weather station located in the same farm and crop coefficients kc determined in previous years by the weighing lysimeter included in the same orchard in these sectors irrigation was controlled by solenoid valves operated by a commercial automata agronic 4000 sistemes electrònics progrés palau d anglesola lleida spain which was programmed remotely every monday through the desktop application provided by the manufacturer all irrigation sectors were equipped with the same model of water meter cz3000 contazara zaragoza spain that were recorded at least twice per week apart from the scheduling application the manual scheduling made no distinction between manual l and manual s and applied a homogeneous irrigation program to the whole orchard based on the estimated requirements of the larger trees which mirrors the expected practice in a commercial farm 2 2 deployment and management of the automated scheduling one datalogger model cr800 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was used in the automated sectors for both recording sensors and commanding irrigation valves the datalogger was equipped with a multiplexer am16 32 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa to increase the number of sensor channels which were measured every 15 s and the average of 5 min was stored a 3 g modem mtx 3 g java mtx flexitron group madrid spain allowed remote communication through internet protocol in addition a four channel latching relay lr4 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa enabled the datalogger open and close the irrigation valves of the auto sectors model ¾ aquanet plus netafim the program in the datalogger written in cr basic campbell scientific inc logan ut usa implemented the functionalities of an irrigation automata four times per day the web application polled the datalogger for new sensor data and once per day typically at 02 30 gmt irrix sent to the datalogger the irrigation doses of each sector in mm for the new day communication between the irrix server and the datalogger used the api packbus sdk campbell scientific inc logan ut usa during the day independently for each sector at the appointed time 8 00 am the datalogger started irrigation and ended it when it had measured the scheduled dose each automated sector was equipped with six capacitance type soil moisture sensors 10hs meter group pullman wa usa which were recorded by the datalogger in units of soil water content m3 m 3 using the general calibration for mineral soils proposed by the manufacturer these sensors have one body with two 14 5 cm long prong spaced 3 3 cm which gives an apparent permittivity measurement volume of around 1 dm3 sakaki et al 2008 all soil sensors were installed at 30 cm depth three of them centered 15 cm from the vertical of the dripper perpendicular to the irrigation pipe and the other three at the mid point between two drippers each automated sector was equipped with a water meter with a resolution of one pulse per litter model multijet m15 arad group dalia israel which were used by the datalogger for controlling the delivery of the appointed doses in addition a temperature sensor model vp3 meter group pullman wa usa provided a continuous measurement of air temperature that was used by irrix for the estimation of eto using hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 the settings of auto l and auto s in the automated scheduling application were exactly the same while they were equipped with separate sets of soil moisture sensors which would provide independent feedback to the scheduling algorithm 2 3 web platform for irrigation control irrix irrix is a custom made software for research on sensor based irrigation scheduling it can operate autonomously during the whole irrigation season with a daily routine that includes uploading sensor data from the field analysing those data updating the water balance deciding the next irrigation doses at each plot and transmitting them to the automata in the field the scheduling approach used by irrix consists of estimating the crop water requirements by the method of water balance allen et al 1998 and use the feedback from sensors for adjusting empirically the irrigation doses of each sector casadesús et al 2012 basically the daily irrigation doses did in mm were determined on a daily basis as 1 did et o k x where eto was the reference evapotranspiration estimated by the hargreaves equation using as input the air temperature recorded by the datalogger kx was initialized as a crop coefficient and later on independently for each sector it was iteratively adjusted on a daily basis from feedback by the sensors in order to provide a seasonal vision of irrigation and to enable in other studies the application of certain types of irrigation strategies irrix requires the definition of a seasonal plan the seasonal plans of irrix specify for every day of the irrigation season the acceptable ranges for a the accumulated irrigation b the weekly water unbalance and c the range of crop s water comfort in terms of the monitored normalized soil water content nswc in the seasonal plan for this trial the range of accumulated irrigation and the weekly balance were set sufficiently wide to avoid limiting the response to sensors fig 1 sectors auto l and auto s were configured exactly with the same seasonal plan which was also the same for 2017 and 2018 interpretation of the soil moisture sensors by irrix focused at the trend between consecutive days of the driest measurement of each day swcd in order to manage the variability between sensors irrix normalized those values between the measurable range of each individual sensor as defined by its actual reading at field capacity and the presumed wilting point for that soil textural class hence the nswc dimensionless was calculated as 2 nswc swc d swc wp swc fc swc wp where swcd was the driest soil water content measured by the sensor at given day m3 m 3 swcfc was the highest daily minimum of the soil water content swcd recorded by a sensor in a period of reference at the start of the season under conditions near field capacity in this context the purpose of swcfc is just to provide an empirical reference for that sensor near its high end of scale fig 2 shows an example of the empirical setting of swcfc for one sensor since normal growing conditions were far from wilting point swcwp was not empirically based but set at the typical swc at wilting point for that soil textural class table 2 shows the references set to the different sensors involved in this study in order to enforce its tolerance to sensor failures the daily analysis of sensor data by irrix included rating the reliability of each sensor these automated ratings started assigning to each sensor a reliability of 1 0 and when irrix detected values out of range noise or abnormal patterns the reliability of the sensor was penalized which could decrease its value down to 0 0 the advantage of this method is that if a sensor is broken or disconnected for any reason irrix can automatically detect this situation assign it a reliability of 0 0 and keep the aggregated value safe from its influence to obtain a single value to summarize the state of an irrigation sector irrix aggregated the nswc obtained by the six sensors installed on a sector through a weighted average in this trial the weight of each sensor was its current rating of reliability updated with the same set of data being summarized in order to provide feedback to the scheduling algorithm irrix evaluates every day the state of an irrigation sector as either to dry to wet or fitted from the current value of aggregated nswc and its trend in the last 3 days it calculates the projected value after 3 days nswc 3d if nswc 3d is below the comfort zone specified in the seasonal plan then the state of that sector is evaluated as too dry and the response of irrix consists of increasing kx by the estimated amount to fill in three days the soil wet bulbs up to the water content corresponding to the midst of the comfort zone if nswc 3d is above the comfort zone it is evaluated as too wet and the response aims at reaching the midst of the comfort zone at the wet bulbs in 7 days in either case the change in kx is conditioned to fulfil the conditions of accumulated irrigation and water unbalance specified in the seasonal plan 2 4 measurement of etc by weighing lysimeter the same orchard where this trial was conducted is equipped with two weighing lysimeters that provide a continuous measurement of crop evapotranspiration girona et al 2004 these lysimeters contain four apple trees each grown in equivalent conditions than the rest of the plantation the eto used in the lysimeter was the penman monteith evapotranspiration determined by an automated meteorological station located next to the orchard operated by the catalan meteorological service due to maintenance operations in the period from march to july 2017 the lysimeters were not operative and the daily et values for that period were estimated from the kc values determined in 2018 corrected by the ratio between kc measured in august of both years as 3 et d2017 eto d2017 kc d2018 kc august2017 kc august2018 2 5 physiological and agronomical measurements stem water potential swp was determined once a week using a pressure chamber 3005 series portable plant water status console soil moisture equipment corp model 3005 santa barbara ca usa following the method described by mccutchan and shackel 1992 procedure measurements were made at solar noon on shaded leaves located close to the main trunk previously leaves were covered with plastic sheathes with aluminium foil bags to minimize transpiration and keep in balance with the xylem of the tree the differences in vigour between the large and small trees were quantified in terms of fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopies fipar along the whole day the measurement method was similar to the fisheye photography described by wünsche et al 1995 and consisted on taking hemispheric photos from below the tree following a pattern that covered the entire planting space the photographs were taken with a digital camera nikon d70 and a 10 17 mm at x tokina fish eye lens on a self leveling support that held the camera 10 cm above ground the photographs were processed to calculate the daily solar path on each picture and analyse the fraction between treetop pixels and background i e blue sky at the different sun positions along the day to determine yield and its components the central five apple trees of each plot were individually harvested and the collected fruits counted and weighted to determine total yield kg of fruits per tree yield and after passing the fruits for a grade and removing fruits smaller than 70 mm the remaining ones were used to determine commercial yield kg tree 1 and t ha 1 cy yield index yi kg of total yield ctsa 1 kg cm 2 and commercial yield index cyi kg of commercial yield ctsa 1 kg cm 2 were also determined to compare the effects of treatments in fruit production because of the location and distribution of the different plots within the orchard each individual tree was used as a repetition resulting a strip plot design statistical analyses were carried out with sas sas institute cary nc usa version 9 4 the effects of treatments were analysed by means of the general linear model glm procedure and differences among means were compared with the lsmeans followed by tukey kramer adjustment with the statistical significance established at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrix performance and interpretation of sensor data the trees in sectors auto s and manual s had through the duration of the trial a visually lower vigour than those in the rest of the plot including auto l manual l and the lysimeter the ratio between fiparauto s and fiparauto l was persistently around 0 88 during the whole period of study fig 3 interaction of the research team with the web application irrix concentrated in 2017 before season when the seasonal plan was established and the references for each sensor were set during the irrigation seasons of 2017 and 2018 irrix operated autonomously and the participation of the research team consisted in supervising the normal development of the irrigation plan by connecting once twice per week to irrix and checking for common anomalies that would require a physical repair such as malfunction of the irrigation system or the sensors data recorded by soil moisture sensors used to show clear responses to irrigation rain and water uptake by the crop as illustrated in fig 4 which shows a period that includes rain events and an interruption in water supply as shown in fig 4a at the daily scale the timing of irrigation was programmed to concur with eto however irrigation did not necessarily fluctuate between days with eto because the control algorithm may vary at any time the proportionality between irrigation and eto the soil water content recorded by sensors showed a clear daily pattern with a peak during irrigation followed by a decrease that may be attributed to the redistribution of water in soil plus uptake by roots in days without irrigation sensors showed a clear decrease in water content during transpiration hours and still values at night most rain events could be observed as a rise in soil water content unaligned with irrigation despite the coherent responses of individual sensors to irrigation rain and water uptake by the crop a large variation was observed between sensors which fluctuated with similar patterns but shifted at different positions in the scale of soil water content swc as shown in fig 4b the scatter between sensors in swc was twice as large as the typical fluctuation of a sensor in a daily cycle and also larger than the effect of suppressing irrigation for several days sensor to sensor variability in the soil moisture recorded by capacitance type sensors has frequently been reported intrigliolo and castel 2004 hignett and evett 2008 kizito et al 2008 kargas and soulis 2011 such variation could partially be explained by the small volume of soil perceived by a capacitance sensor around 1 dm3 in sensor 10hs sakaki et al 2008 whereas the soil electrical permittivity at that scale of observation may vary at different spots as affected by macropores soil density or stones hignett and evett 2008 in addition under conditions of localized irrigation wet bulbs develop below the emitters determining a very heterogeneous pattern of soil moisture samadianfard et al 2012 to cope with such variability some authors recommend installing sensors at two or more depths or positions dursun and ozden 2011 casadesús et al 2012 lea cox et al 2013 soulis et al 2015 domínguez niño et al 2019 regarding the interpretation of sensor data an approach for handling the variability between sensors is to look at the dynamics rather than the absolute readings irrix focuses on the trend of swcd fig 4b with the assumption that the driest situation after a cycle of irrigation redistribution and uptake by roots summarizes the aggregate outcome of those processes moreover the trends of swcd in consecutive days may follow the soil water balance and be used for rating the fit between irrigation and the crop water requirements casadesús et al 2012 besides its dynamics another informative trait of swcd is its relative position within the particular span of measurements by that sensor which can be specified by normalizing the value of swcd between the readings of that sensor at wilting point and field capacity fig 4c hence one normalized the dataset including different sensors can offer a more straightforward view of the soil water dynamics than the original readings whose overall pattern may be partly obscured by the variability in the baseline of each sensor additionally as it can be observed in this example variability between sensors was highest when the average soil moisture was lowest and that the variability was reduced at higher soil moisture specially following rain this observation may endorse the interpretation that under localized irrigation short irrigation doses can cause larger variability because while some spots can still be wetted the shrunk wet bulbs leave some spots outside the wetted volume swelled bulbs may re include those spots and the sensors there and hence reduce their variability accordingly aggregation of the different sensors once normalized may offer a sounder basis for decision making compared with the direct readings 3 2 applied irrigation overall the seasonal amount of irrigation applied in auto l was similar to that applied by an expert using water balance in the manual treatment and similar also to the etc measured by the lysimeter while auto s applied 24 less irrigation fig 5 in 2017 auto l applied a total irrigation volume of 666 0 mm similar to manual only differed by a 1 0 while in 2018 auto l irrigated 724 7 mm 4 9 more than manual in both years auto s applied lower doses than auto l 23 7 and 27 2 less in 2017 and 2018 respectively and manual 24 5 and 23 4 less in the year 2017 and 2018 respectively the seasonal amount of irrigation applied in auto l was in agreement with the etc measured by the lysimeter differences of 6 1 and 0 9 in the years 2017 and 2018 respectively while the irrigation in auto s was considerably lower than the etc at the lysimeter 18 7 and 27 9 for the year 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 5 shows how those volumes accumulated along the season 3 3 response of the automated irrigation scheduling with a greater detail the functioning of the automated scheduling is illustrated in fig 6 the span of time shown in the figure corresponds to the part of the season in 2018 where the irrigation requirements were highest in that period the measured eto fluctuated between 3 4 and 6 1 mm and et measured by the lysimeter was slightly higher than eto with an average kc of 1 03 in both auto l and auto s irrix tried to keep the soil moisture here expressed as nswc within the comfort zone specified in the seasonal plan however the observed pattern of soil moisture response to irrigation by these two sectors was different which caused that they required different adjustments to maintain the comfort zone auto l used to remain in the lower part of the comfort zone and several times it decreased below the lower limit of comfort hence irrix often evaluated that the state of the soil or its projection for the next days was too dry and it adjusted the irrigation coefficient of auto l upwards on the other hand auto s used to remain easily in the upper part of the comfort zone and several times its moisture level surpassed the upper limit of comfort consequently in those occasions where irrix evaluated that the state of the soil or its projection in the next days were too wet irrix adjusted the irrigation coefficient downwards as a result within that period the average irrigation coefficient for auto l was 0 97 and 47 2 of the time it was above the presumed kc value meanwhile the irrigation coefficient for auto s was on average 0 75 and most of the time below 1 0 which was the presumed kc at the time of preparing the seasonal plan all those adjustments of the irrigation coefficients produced different irrigation doses in the two automated sectors with average daily doses of 5 6 mm and 4 4 mm in auto l and auto s respectively and 73 6 of the time auto s with a lower irrigation dose than auto l incidentally within the period shown in fig 6 a power cut following a small storm in july 20th produced an interruption of irrigation for two days which triggered different responses in the two automated sectors in auto l the lack of irrigation immediately produced a decrease in soil moisture which stimulated the irrigation coefficient and helped in approaching the comfort zone after the incident in contrast in auto s the soil moisture was maintained probably because the rainfall could compensate the missing irrigation and furthermore the next irrigation after this event raised the soil moisture above the comfort zone causing a decrease in the irrigation coefficient some days later these results show how the control algorithm of irrix without using information of tree vigour applied a differential irrigation because the moisture sensors perceived that soil water was depleted faster in auto l than in auto s previous studies at the same site had looked at the effect of tree canopy on irrigation requirements in particular lysimeter data from a previous apple plantation showed a strong relationship between fipar and kc girona et al 2011 using the relationship described in girona et al 2011 with the fipar measured in this trial we estimate that kc at auto s would be 21 below the kc at auto l this value fits closely with the response of the automated algorithm in the present study where the amount of irrigation applied to auto s was 23 lower than the amount applied to auto l 3 4 physiological and agronomical results measurements of stem water potential were aligned with the values obtained by girona et al 2010 between 0 8 mpa and 1 3 mpa the measured stem water potential showed slightly more negative values in the smaller trees regardless of whether irrigation was scheduled automatically or manually fig 7 more precisely during the year 2017 in manual l and auto l the stem water potential remained between 1 3 mpa and 0 7 mpa and in manual s and auto s they were between 1 5 mpa and 0 7 mpa during the year 2018 in manual l and auto l the stem water potential remained between 1 2 mpa and 0 7 mpa and in manual s and auto s they were between 1 3 mpa and 0 7 mpa in the manual treatment it can be noticed that even though manual s received the same irrigation than manual l their stem water potential used to be lower this may be explained by the diagnosed cause of their smaller size the apple replant disease that disease affects the root system laurent et al 2010 singh et al 2017 and the lower swp may be a consequence of the limited hydraulic conductance of their root system therefore taking into account the measured swp and the effect of this disease the data suggests that trees in auto s were not water limited by irrigation the yield of this apple orchard table 3 showed a large variation between the two years of the study mainly attributed to a poor fruit set in 2017 which was also clearly identified in the whole area however no statistical differences were found between treatments for the main productivity indicators when analysing the harvest data for the whole experimental period table 3 because of the commercial thinning practices no differences were observed on yield between large and small tress and more important no statistical significant differences were found on cyi commercial yield index and yi yield index therefore it can be stated that no negative effects of the automated management were observed on yield either in the larger trees which were irrigated a similar amount to classical water balance or in smaller trees where the automated algorithm saved 23 of irrigation volume 3 5 irrigation scheduling approach overall this study tested the performance of scheduling irrigation through an automated water balance approach tuned by capacitance type soil moisture sensors here we observed how the adaptive response allowed spontaneous adjustment to a component of the water balance in this case the low et associated to low vigour that had not been considered in the original configuration of the water balance this experience may exemplify the capacity of this approach to confront site specific conditions that would be difficult to parameterize in a deterministic model as another example a previous version of the algorithm showed a spontaneous adaptation to the presence of groundwater casadesús et al 2014 which would otherwise be omitted in the management of irrigation regarding the choice for a base scheduling method the water balance approach provides an effective method for fitting irrigation to the encountered weather conditions allen et al 1998 while irrigation controllers based on water balance are commercially available for turfgrass davis and dukes 2014 their application to orchards would be more complicated because of the much larger uncertainty of crop coefficients that uncertainty was solved here through feedback from sensors which provided an empirical site specific adjustment of the ratio of irrigation to eto other alternative sensor based approaches use predefined thresholds either to trigger irrigation when the soil is too dry dukes and scholberg 2005 osroosh et al 2016 vera et al 2019 and or to bypass a timer triggered irrigation when the soil is too wet smajstrla and locascio 1996 cáceres et al 2007 muñoz carpena et al 2008 some advantages of water balance tuned by sensors are that its response is smoother and more predictable than occasional switching on off valves additionally it allows modulating the daily irrigation depth of each sector without disturbing the hydraulic scheme for the whole farm while irrigation triggered directly by sensors can switch valves on at arbitrary times complicating the operation of the farm s hydraulic system 4 conclusions the results of this trial show the feasibility of automated sensor based scheduling of irrigation in orchards the algorithm based on the approach of water balance and tuned locally through feedback from sensors provided precise irrigation doses along the season adapting itself to weather conditions and to the seasonal vegetation cycle of the crop capacitance sensors have successfully been used to provide automated feedback to the scheduling algorithm in spite of the observed sensor to sensor variability comparable with that reported by other authors the approach followed here allows a consistent mechanism for their unmanned interpretation and integration with decision making first the summarization of the daily fluctuation of soil water content on the daily driest measurement focuses the analysis on a simple parameter whose day to day dynamics retains much of the information on the fit between irrigation and the crop water demand second the sensor specific normalization of those daily values reduces the scatter between sensors and brings a more intelligible dataset on which to base automate control this trial shows how the irrigation doses determined by the algorithm are aligned with the et measured on the same orchard by a weighing lysimeter the irrigation doses applied by the automated approach are also comparable with those by a skilled irrigation technician though requiring less labour effort furthermore the tested algorithm adapts itself to heterogeneous tree vigour applying less irrigation to sectors with smaller trees in a proportion that fits previous lysimeter studies on the relationship between kc and fipar therefore this indicates that the algorithm could be suitable for horticultural application where adaptation to site specific vigour are a common concern declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the spanish national institute for agricultural and food

10792,during periods of heavy precipitation farmland drainage ditches are the main routes for farmland nitrogen flowing into surface waters in northern china vegetated ditches can be engineered to mitigate n loss from agricultural runoff we used a simulation study to evaluate the interception of nitrogen in a ditch without vegetation and three vegetated ditches the 15n stable isotope tracer method was used to analyze the fate of ditch intercepting farmland runoff nitrogen the three vegetated ditches were planted with lolium perenne l bromus inermis leyss and elytrigia repens l nevski the results showed that the interception rates of nitrogen in the three vegetated ditches were higher than in the ditch without vegetation the l perenne ditch had the lowest interception rates of nitrogen among the three vegetated ditches the interception of nitrogen by the three vegetated ditches was primarily achieved by the capture of nitrogen runoff in the soil ditch bed which allowed water infiltration nitrogen retained in the ditch bed soil of the ditch without vegetation was enriched in the 0 10 cm soil layer from surface mainly however in the three vegetated ditches it was transported to the 50 cm soil layer all of the nitrogen retained in the vegetated ditches was absorbed by the l perenne and e repens and the interception of nitrogen was affected by plant species and growth stage in the vegetated ditch keywords agricultural non point source pollution vegetated ditches nitrogen northern china surface water 1 introduction ditches are usually designed and constructed as a component of agricultural irrigation systems and are an important part of farm landscapes their functions include irrigation and draining excess water from farmland carluer and marsily 2004 kröger et al 2007a b herzon and helenius 2008 buchanan et al 2012 chen et al 2015 kumwimba et al 2016 in the irrigated areas of northern china drainage ditches are important for maintaining food production and provide a buffer ecosystem between agricultural areas wu et al 2015 ditches are the main pathway for nitrogen and phosphorus moving from farmland to surface water herzon and helenius 2008 kröger et al 2007a b ecological ditches have been transformed from traditional agricultural ditches wu et al 2013 to reduce water flow and intercept and remove sediment organic matter nutrients and chemicals from runoff otto et al 2016 the construction and use of ecological ditches is an economical approach to reduce farmland nutrient runoff losses cooper et al 2004 kröger et al 2008 kumwimba et al 2017b in northern china annual precipitation is unevenly distributed and annual average precipitation ranges 350 500 mm therefore farmland ditches generally have no water flow and are dry for long periods of time however during heavy rainfall soil erosion can occur and a considerable amount of sediment and nutrients will move from ditch into surface water and be a source of non point source pollution shi 1997 current research on vegetated ditches focuses on the reduction of nitrogen phosphorus and pesticides under long term water filling conditions otto et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 kumwimba et al 2017a there are few studies on vegetated ditches containing intermittent water flow in the northern china the 15n labelling method has been widely used for the study of nitrogen absorption utilization and distribution in plant soil systems and this method has been proven to be a powerful tool for nitrogen process marking and fate tracking hauck and bremner 1976 matheson et al 2002 yang et al 2011 cheng et al 2018 in this study simulation experiments composed of three vegetated ditches lolium perenne bromus inermis leyss and elytrigia repens l nevski and one ditch without vegetation were used based on the characteristics of soil erosion and non point source pollution we carried out the simulated experiment and tracked nitrogen in farmland runoff by the 15n stable isotope labeling method we focused on the following two objectives 1 the evaluation of nitrogen interception using different vegetated ditches and using a ditch without vegetation as a control and 2 an analysis of nitrogen fate in a vegetated ditch 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental site was at the national precision agriculture demonstration base in xiaotangshan town changping district beijing 116 26 n 40 10 e this area is on the northern edge of the north china plain at an elevation of 50 m the main landforms are plains hills and shallow mountains it is characterized by a continental semi humid and monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 11 5 c the average frost free period is 190 days the annual accumulated degrees of temperature 0 c is 4400 c the mean annual precipitation is 447 mm precipitation mainly occurs in summer june august and this period accounts for 70 of the annual precipitation the soil in the experimental site is fluvo aquic and the texture is loamy clay 2 2 experimental design and management the experiment was conducted from may 2016 to september 2017 a total of 18 soil flumes width 0 5 m length 3 m height 0 6 m fig 1 were arranged in a complete randomized design with three replicates of these the 15n stable isotope labeling experiment was conducted on 12 soil flumes in july 2017 and the other 6 soil flumes were scoured using simulated runoff in july 2016 the growth stage was two months october 2016 the growth stage was five months and july 2017 the growth stage was fourteen months to study the nitrogen interception effect of plant species at various growth stage the experiment was simulated using two types of ditches vegetated ditches l perenne ditch b inermis ditch and e repens ditch and ditch without vegetation as the control the plants in the vegetated ditches were seeded on may 4 2016 prior to the beginning of the experiment the average vegetation stem diameters of the plants in the three vegetated ditches were 1 33 cm l perenne 1 52 cm e repens and 1 54 cm b inermis the vegetation stem densities of the plants in the three vegetated ditches were 6511 plants m2 l perenne 4666 plants m2 e repens and 4133 plants m2 b inermis because the ditch bed was eroded by rain and runoff for a long time and affected by some pollutants such as pesticides nitrogen was absorbed by the

chemical properties of the soil in the ditch bed and compare the effect of vegetation on the nitrogen interception capacity the soil was collected from farmland to simulate a new ditch bed the soil was broken with a shovel and passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove the plant residue to ensure soil uniformity it was then used to fill a soil flume in layers of 5 cm with a loading capacity of 1 2 g cm3 based on the european standard the sedimat 4 12 soil particle size analysis system was used and the grain composition of the loaded soil was 30 81 sand 39 58 silt and 29 61 clay the organic matter

investigated table 1 the result showed that the total nitrogen and sediment content of the runoff was between 2 63 7 52 mg l and 10 49 22 46 g l respectively according to this result and convenient calculation we put 4 20 kg sediment 4 00 g potassium nitrogen and 3 69 g ammonium dihydrogen phosphate into 210 l water as simulated runoff and the content of nitrogen and sediment of the simulated runoff was 4 42 mg l and 20 g l respectively while the concentration of total nitrogen and sediment in the simulated runoff were within the range of the measured values in dezhou city the sediment was broken and passed through a 0 15 mm sieve and added to water with potassium nitrogen that had a 15n abundance of 10 ammonium dihydrogen phosphate water sediment potassium nitrogen and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate were evenly mixed and the simulated runoff was uniformly introduced into the ditch at a flow rate of 0 27 l s which then flowed to the outlet details of the simulated runoff are shown in table 2 2 3 sampling procedure and analyses 2 3 1 runoff fluid and sediment samples collected during the experiment a flow sample was collected every 60 s collected samples were subjected to

the amount of water input to the vegetation was 100 mm and 838 mm by irrigation and rainfall respectively the soil of the simulated ditch was consolidated and closed to the natural soil through vegetation growth irrigation rainfall so we collected the samples of soil profile to analyze the distribution of 15n in soil after scour the soil samples were collected at different horizontal and vertical locations before and after scouring fig 2 the sampling points were arranged in a horizontal direction from the inlet of 50 cm 150 cm and 250 cm and the sampling points were layered at a distance of 10 cm at each sampling point the soil samples were air dried in a cool place then broken and passed through a 0 15 mm sieve prior to storage the plant samples were cut on september 12 2017 and then dried crushed and stored in a desiccator relative humidity rh 20 the total nitrogen of the soil and plant samples was determined using an elemental analyzer vario el cube elementar germany

runoff fluid of the control was significantly higher than that of the three vegetated ditches p 0 05 the l perenne ditch produced the largest runoff volume among the three vegetated ditches and this was significantly larger than the e repens ditch and b inermis ditch p 0 05 sediment can absorb particulate pollutants in runoff and then enter water bodies and cause pollution the anova of sediment

the total nitrogen interception rate in the control ditch was significantly less than the total nitrogen interception rate in the three vegetated ditches p 0 05 the l perenne ditch had the least total nitrogen interception rate among the three vegetated ditches 3 2 the distribution of 15n after scour by runoff fig 5 shows the distribution of 15n in the soil sediment and runoff fluid from the different ditches after runoff scour in the control ditch 80 of 15n carried in the runoff was lost in runoff fluid 19 was retained in the soil with water infiltration and less than 1 was lost with sediment in the three vegetated ditches 58 81 of 15n carried in the runoff was retained in the soil with water infiltration 19 42 was lost in runoff fluid and less than 0 2 was lost with sediment among the three vegetated ditches the b inermis ditch retained the most 15n in the soil of ditch bed reaching 81 and the l perenne ditch was the lowest with 58 3 3 distribution of 15n in different ditch bed soils after runoff scouring how was the nitrogen retained in the soil distributed table 3 shows the distribution of 15n in the soil of different ditches after runoff scour at 50 cm from the scour inlet the 15n ratios in the 0 10 cm of soil from the surface of the control l perenne e repens and b inermis ditches after scour were significantly higher than that before scour p 0 05 and the 15n ration of soil in the four ditches was increased by 130 212 this indicated that the nitrogen in the runoff had different degrees of underground infiltration with water after scour at the 10 50 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio in the soil of the control ditch was not significantly different from that before scour but the 15n ratio in the soil of the three vegetated ditches was still significantly higher than that before scour and the increase in the 15n ratio was greater than 80 indicating that planting in the ditch promoted further 15n infiltration with water p 0 05 a comparison of the 15n ratio in the soil of the four ditches after scour showed that the 15n ratio of the three vegetated ditches was not significantly different from that of the control ditch and there was no significant difference among the three vegetated ditches in 0 10 cm from the soil surface p 0 05 at the 10 20 cm soil layer from the surface the 15n ratio of the e repens ditch was the highest and 1 5 times that of the control ditch in addition it was significantly higher than that of the control ditch p 0 05 at 20 40 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio in the soil of b inermis ditch was the highest and 1 9 2 4 times that of the control ditch at 40 50 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio in the soil of the three vegetated ditches was higher than that of control ditch but the difference was not significant p 0 05 at a 150 cm distance from the scour inlet the 15n ratios in the 0 10 cm of soil from the surface of the control l perenne e repens and b inermis ditches after scour were significantly higher than that before scour and the 15n ratio of four ditches was increased by 156 213 p 0 05 at 10 50 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio of the control ditch was not significantly different from that prior to scour but the 15n ratios in the soil of the l perenne e repens and b inermis ditch beds were significantly higher than that prior to scour and the increase in the 15n ratios were more than 130 p 0 05 at a 250 cm distance from the scour inlet the 15n ratios at 0 10 cm from the soil surface of the control l perenne e repens and b inermis ditches after scour were significantly higher than those prior to scour and the 15n ratios of four ditches were increased by 95 162 p 0 05 at 10 50 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio of the control ditch was not significantly different from that prior to scour but the 15n ratios of l perenne e repens and b inermis ditches were significantly higher than those prior to scour p 0 05 a comparison of the 15n ratios of the soil in the four ditches after scour showed that the 15n ratios of the three vegetated ditches was 1 6 2 8 times that of the control ditch the distribution of 15n in the soil profile of the control ditch bed showed that the 15n ratio at 0 10 cm from the soil surface was significantly higher than that in the 10 50 cm soil layers after scour p 0 05 3 4 the fate of 15n after scour by runoff the plants in the ditches were sampled after 60 d of growth and the 15n content in the soil was measured additionally the plant biomass and its 15n content were measured to analyze the fate of 15n in the soil of the three vegetated ditches figs 6 and 7 comparing the content of 15n in the soil before and after scour and after harvesting showed that the 15n content in the soil after scour was significantly greater than the content before scour and after harvesting the above ground parts of the three vegetated ditches p 0 05 this indicated that 15n remaining in the soil after runoff scour was absorbed and removed by plants the 15n absorption by the above ground parts of the three vegetated ditches was also compared and the results showed that the 15n absorption by e repens was the highest followed by l perenne and b inermis and the 15n percentage of the three plants absorption from of soil retaining was 47 103 111 respectively so the 15n retained in the soil of the l perenne and e repens ditches can be removed from the soil by cutting and removing the above ground biomass however b inermis has a relatively small above ground biomass and less than 50 of the 15n retained in the soil can be removed with one cut in addition 41 75 of the 15n from the input runoff was absorbed by three plants 4 discussion 4 1 effects of vegetated ditch plant species on nitrogen interception one mechanism for n removal in vegetated ditches is that the vegetation ditch slows down the water velocity effectively which allows for the adsorption of nitrogen in the sediment hu et al 2010 kröger et al 2007a b this study demonstrated that the interception of runoff fluid sediment and nitrogen in ditch can vary with different plants the stem size tillering ability and root growth of the plant species were different and affected the interception ability of runoff fluid and sediment different plants have different stem tiller and root growth at different growth stages plant species and growth time both have an impact on the interception of runoff fluid sediment and nitrogen nutrients daili et al 2017 we analyzed different planting times and plant growth on runoff fluid and sediment interception by l perenne and e repens fig 8 the total nitrogen interception rates in different growth stages by e repens and l perenne showed that the total nitrogen interception rate of the same grass at different growth stages was different and the total nitrogen interception rate of e repens and l perenneat after five months of growth was 1 4 times and 1 6 times higher than that of two months of growth respectively the interception rate of total nitrogen by l perenne was higher than that of e repens in the early growth stage but the interception rate of total nitrogen by e repens was greater than that of l perenne after five months of growth this may be because l perenne grew faster during the early growth stage but the stem density decreased rapidly in the hot and humid summer while the stem density of e repens increased with increased growth time therefore in the process of planting vegetation in the vegetated ditch mixed seeding of e repens and l perenne can be used in the initial stage of planting to achieve the best adsorption and interception effect 4 2 removal mechanism of farmland runoff nitrogen by plants plant interception and removal of pollutants such as nitrogen is achieved through multiple functions plant stems can impede runoff reduce flow rate and achieve slow flow and diversion deng et al 2012 roots can help maintain good soil permeability thereby increasing the infiltration rate of runoff and reducing surface runoff xiao et al 2013 the 15n isotope tracing technique showed that the infiltration of nitrogen in the three vegetated ditches was significantly higher than that in the control ditch pansak et al 2008 demonstrated that vetiver grass and acacia leucocephala planted on moderate slopes 21 28 in the northern mountains of thailand altered the migration pathway of nitrogen which changed from surface runoff loss to seepage by analyzing the 15n isotope ratio in the sediment we found that the vegetated ditch not only intercepts the nitrogen lost from the runoff fluid but also helps keep nitrogen and sediment in the ditch bed from being scoured away by runoff in addition the retention and adsorption of nitrogen in vegetated ditch was also affected by the physical and chemical properties of the ditch bed soil this mechanism of soil properties in vegetated ditches requires further study to understand how it affects the adsorption and transportation of nitrogen from farmland runoff after 60 d of growth e repens and l perenne can remove the nitrogen retained in the soil by cutting therefore when constructing a vegetated ditch timely cutting should be used this reduces the risk of seepage and also prevents litter from entering the soil and causing secondary loss of nitrogen nutrients 4 3 construction and cost benefit analysis of vegetated ditches in the northern china in northern china it is dry in the winter and spring rain and high temperatures are characteristic of summer months in this climate farmland drainage ditches are dry for long periods of time and the natural vegetation community structure in the ditch is fragile wu et al 2015 therefore the selection of plant species is important when planting vegetated ditches plants must withstand the winter and spring drought and also survive the high temperatures and humidity of summer in this study the perennial species e repens l perenne and b inermis were found to be suitable plants for constructing vegetated ditches in northern semiarid areas they are all perennials and do not need replanting so the only costs involve labor and grass seeds in the first year after this time management e g cutting the plants is needed twice per year and maintenance e g fertilization irrigation is no longer necessary we take the demonstration of the agricultural park as an example in dezhou city shandong province of china and its area is 30 67 ha fig 9 the ditch is 100 m length 3 m width and with 2 m width ditch slope l perenne and b inermisis were planted at a density of 40 plants per square meter the price is approximately 8 cny per square meter now thus it costs 5600 cny to buy grasses to build this ditch additionally it took 15 person days to plant the vegetated ditch on average in the study area the labor cost was 150 cny per person day which resulted in a total labor cost of 2250 cny therefore the cost for vegetated ditch building was 7850 cny and it costs 300 cny each year to harvest plants however all three species are high quality forage grass and can be harvested twice a year 0 27 ton dry grass was collected in the vegetated ditch and sold at the price of 2000 cny each ton and thus it earns 540 cny each year through selling the grass the cost of nitrogen treatment in polluted water is used to express the environment benefit of vegetated ditch and it counts 4 10 104 cny per ton kang and liu 2016 the vegetated ditch can intercept 0 16 ton nitrogen each year according to our experiment and its environmental benefits is 6560 cny the vegetated ditch can last for more than 10 years it only costs 1085 cny but benefits 7100 cny each year and thus the cost benefit ratio of this vegetated ditch is 0 15 therefore the construction of vegetated ditches is a farmland runoff interception method that is economical and produces ecological and environmental benefits 5 conclusions this experiment was used to simulate the habitat of vegetated ditches the interception effects of three vegetated ditches composed of l perenne b inermis and e repens and control ditch were studied and produced the following results 1 the interception rates of nitrogen in the l perenne b inermis and e repens vegetated ditches were higher than that of the control ditch and the interception rate of nitrogen in the three vegetated ditches was more than 83 2 the 15n stable isotope tracer method was used to analyze the mechanism by which vegetated ditches intercept farmland runoff nitrogen the interception of nitrogen by the three vegetated ditches was mainly achieved by increasing soil infiltration while keeping the ditch bed soil and its nitrogen from being scoured away by runoff the nitrogen remaining in the l perenne and e repens ditch beds was almost completely absorbed by the plants after 60 d of growth 3 the plant species and growth stage affected the interception effect of vegetated ditches on nitrogen therefore in the construction of vegetated ditches in semiarid areas of northern china a mixture of several plants should be used this type of ditch bed is best adapted to environmental variation and considers temporal changes in plant growth over time and plant nutrient absorption differences funding this work was supported by the china s ministry of agriculture

10792,during periods of heavy precipitation farmland drainage ditches are the main routes for farmland nitrogen flowing into surface waters in northern china vegetated ditches can be engineered to mitigate n loss from agricultural runoff we used a simulation study to evaluate the interception of nitrogen in a ditch without vegetation and three vegetated ditches the 15n stable isotope tracer method was used to analyze the fate of ditch intercepting farmland runoff nitrogen the three vegetated ditches were planted with lolium perenne l bromus inermis leyss and elytrigia repens l nevski the results showed that the interception rates of nitrogen in the three vegetated ditches were higher than in the ditch without vegetation the l perenne ditch had the lowest interception rates of nitrogen among the three vegetated ditches the interception of nitrogen by the three vegetated ditches was primarily achieved by the capture of nitrogen runoff in the soil ditch bed which allowed water infiltration nitrogen retained in the ditch bed soil of the ditch without vegetation was enriched in the 0 10 cm soil layer from surface mainly however in the three vegetated ditches it was transported to the 50 cm soil layer all of the nitrogen retained in the vegetated ditches was absorbed by the l perenne and e repens and the interception of nitrogen was affected by plant species and growth stage in the vegetated ditch keywords agricultural non point source pollution vegetated ditches nitrogen northern china surface water 1 introduction ditches are usually designed and constructed

kumwimba et al 2017b in northern china annual precipitation is unevenly distributed and annual average precipitation ranges 350 500 mm therefore farmland ditches generally have no water flow and are dry for long periods of time however during heavy rainfall soil erosion can occur and a considerable amount of sediment and nutrients will move from ditch into surface water and be a source of non point source pollution shi 1997 current research on vegetated ditches focuses on the reduction of nitrogen phosphorus and pesticides under long term water filling conditions otto et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 kumwimba et al 2017a there are few studies on vegetated ditches containing intermittent water flow in the northern china the 15n labelling method has been widely used for the study of nitrogen absorption utilization and distribution in plant soil systems and this method has been proven to be a powerful tool for nitrogen process marking and fate tracking hauck and bremner 1976 matheson et al 2002 yang et al 2011 cheng et al 2018 in this study simulation experiments composed of three vegetated ditches lolium perenne bromus inermis leyss and elytrigia repens l nevski and one ditch without vegetation were used based on the characteristics of soil erosion and non point source pollution we carried out the simulated experiment and tracked nitrogen in farmland runoff by the 15n stable

fig 1 were arranged in a complete randomized design with three replicates of these the 15n stable isotope labeling experiment was conducted on 12 soil flumes in july 2017 and the other 6 soil flumes were scoured using simulated runoff in july 2016 the growth stage was two months october 2016 the growth stage was five months and july 2017 the growth stage was fourteen months to study the nitrogen interception effect of plant species at various growth stage the experiment was simulated using two types of ditches vegetated ditches l perenne ditch b inermis ditch and e repens ditch and ditch without vegetation as the control the plants in the vegetated ditches were seeded on may 4 2016 prior to the beginning of the experiment the average vegetation stem diameters of the plants in the three vegetated ditches were 1 33 cm l perenne 1 52 cm e repens and 1 54 cm b inermis the vegetation stem densities of the plants in the three vegetated ditches were 6511 plants m2 l perenne 4666 plants m2 e repens and 4133 plants m2 b inermis because the ditch bed was eroded by rain and runoff for a long time and affected by some pollutants such as pesticides nitrogen was absorbed by the ditch bed hence the physical and chemical properties of soil in the bottom of the ditch were varied in practice daly et al 2017 jeanne et al 2018 therefore to ensure the consistency the physical and

from the soil surface the 15n ratio in the soil of the control ditch was not significantly different from that before scour but the 15n ratio in the soil of the three vegetated ditches was still significantly higher than that before scour and the increase in the 15n ratio was greater than 80 indicating that planting in the ditch promoted further 15n infiltration with water p 0 05 a comparison of the 15n ratio in the soil of the four ditches after scour showed that the 15n ratio of the three vegetated ditches was not significantly different from that of the control ditch and there was no significant difference among the three vegetated ditches in 0 10 cm from the soil surface p 0 05 at the 10 20 cm soil layer from the surface the 15n ratio of the e repens ditch was the highest and 1 5 times that of the control ditch in addition it was significantly higher than that of the control ditch p 0 05 at 20 40 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio in the soil of b inermis ditch was the highest and 1 9 2 4 times that of the control ditch at 40 50 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio in the soil of the three vegetated ditches was higher than that of control ditch but the difference was not significant p 0 05 at a 150 cm distance from the scour inlet the 15n ratios in the 0 10 cm of soil from the surface of the control l perenne e repens and b inermis ditches after scour were significantly higher than that before scour and the 15n ratio of four ditches was increased by 156 213 p 0 05 at 10 50 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio of the control ditch was not significantly different from that prior to scour but the 15n ratios in the soil of the l perenne e repens and b inermis ditch beds were significantly higher than that prior to scour and the increase in the 15n ratios were more than 130 p 0 05 at a 250 cm distance from the scour inlet the 15n ratios at 0 10 cm from the soil surface of the control l perenne e repens and b inermis ditches after scour were significantly higher than those prior to scour and the 15n ratios of four ditches were increased by 95 162 p 0 05 at 10 50 cm from the soil surface the 15n ratio of the control ditch was not significantly different from that prior to scour but the 15n ratios of l perenne e repens and b inermis ditches were significantly higher than those prior to scour p 0 05 a comparison of the 15n ratios of the soil in the four ditches after scour showed that the 15n ratios of the three vegetated ditches was 1 6 2 8 times that of the control ditch the distribution of 15n in the soil profile of the control ditch bed showed that the 15n ratio at 0 10 cm from the soil surface was significantly higher than that in the 10 50 cm soil layers after scour p 0 05 3 4 the fate of 15n after scour by runoff the plants in the ditches were sampled after 60 d of growth and the 15n content in the soil was measured additionally the plant biomass and its 15n content were measured to analyze the fate of 15n in the soil of the three vegetated ditches figs 6 and 7 comparing the content of 15n in the soil before and after scour and after harvesting showed that the 15n content in the soil after scour was significantly greater than the content before scour and after harvesting the above ground parts of the three vegetated ditches p 0 05 this indicated that 15n remaining in the soil after runoff scour was absorbed and removed by plants the 15n absorption by the above ground parts of the three vegetated ditches was also compared and the results showed that the 15n absorption by e repens was the highest followed by l perenne and b inermis and the 15n percentage of the three plants absorption from of soil retaining was 47 103 111 respectively so the 15n retained in the soil of the l perenne and e repens ditches can be removed from the soil by cutting and removing the above ground biomass however b inermis has a relatively small above ground biomass and less than 50 of the 15n retained in the soil can be removed with one cut in addition 41 75 of the 15n from the input runoff was absorbed by three plants 4 discussion 4 1 effects of vegetated ditch plant species on nitrogen interception one mechanism for n removal in vegetated ditches is that the vegetation ditch slows down the water velocity effectively which allows for the adsorption of nitrogen in the sediment hu et al 2010 kröger et al 2007a b this study demonstrated that the interception of runoff fluid sediment and nitrogen in ditch can vary with different plants the stem size tillering ability and root growth of the plant species were different and affected the interception ability of runoff fluid and sediment different plants have different stem tiller and root growth at different growth stages plant species and growth time both have an impact on the interception of runoff fluid sediment and nitrogen nutrients daili et al 2017 we analyzed different planting times and plant growth on runoff fluid and sediment interception by l perenne and e repens fig 8 the total nitrogen interception rates in different growth stages by e repens and l perenne showed that the total nitrogen interception rate of the same grass at different growth stages was different and the total nitrogen interception rate of e repens and l perenneat after five months of growth was 1 4 times and 1 6 times higher than that of two months of growth respectively the interception rate of total nitrogen by l perenne was higher than that of e repens in the early growth stage but the interception rate of total nitrogen by e repens was greater than that of l perenne after five months of growth this may be because l perenne grew faster during the early growth stage but the stem density decreased rapidly in the hot and humid summer while the stem density of e repens increased with increased growth time therefore in the process of planting vegetation in the vegetated ditch mixed seeding of e repens and l perenne can be used in the initial stage of planting to achieve the best adsorption and interception effect 4 2 removal mechanism of farmland runoff nitrogen by plants plant interception and removal of pollutants such as nitrogen is achieved through multiple functions plant stems can impede runoff reduce flow rate and achieve slow flow and diversion deng et al 2012 roots can help maintain good soil permeability thereby increasing the infiltration rate of runoff and reducing surface runoff xiao et al 2013 the 15n isotope tracing technique showed that the infiltration of nitrogen in the three vegetated ditches was significantly higher than that in the control ditch pansak et al 2008 demonstrated that vetiver grass and acacia leucocephala planted on moderate slopes 21 28 in the northern mountains of thailand altered the migration pathway of nitrogen which changed from surface runoff loss to seepage by analyzing the 15n isotope ratio in the sediment we found that the vegetated ditch not only intercepts the nitrogen lost from the runoff fluid but also helps keep nitrogen and sediment in the ditch bed from being scoured away by runoff in addition the retention and adsorption of nitrogen in vegetated ditch was also affected by the physical and chemical properties of the ditch bed soil this mechanism of soil properties in vegetated ditches requires further study to understand how it affects the adsorption and transportation of nitrogen from farmland runoff after 60 d of growth e repens and l perenne can remove the nitrogen retained in the soil by cutting therefore when constructing a vegetated ditch timely cutting should be used this reduces the risk of seepage and also prevents litter from entering the soil and causing secondary loss of nitrogen nutrients 4 3 construction and cost benefit analysis of vegetated ditches in the northern china in northern china it is dry in the winter and spring rain and high temperatures are characteristic of summer months in this climate farmland drainage ditches are dry for long periods of time and the natural vegetation community structure in the ditch is fragile wu et al 2015 therefore the selection of plant species is important when planting vegetated ditches plants must withstand the winter and spring drought and also survive the high temperatures and humidity of summer in this study the perennial species e repens l perenne and b inermis were found to be suitable plants for constructing vegetated ditches in northern semiarid areas they are all perennials and do not need replanting so the only costs involve labor and grass seeds in the first year after this time management e g cutting the plants is needed twice per year and maintenance e g fertilization irrigation is no longer necessary we take the demonstration of the agricultural park as an example in dezhou city shandong province of china and its area is 30 67 ha fig 9 the ditch is 100 m length 3 m width and with 2 m width ditch slope l perenne and b inermisis were planted at a density of 40 plants per square meter the price is approximately 8 cny per square meter now thus it costs 5600 cny to buy grasses to build this ditch additionally it took 15 person days to plant the vegetated ditch on average in the study area the labor cost was 150 cny per person day which resulted in a total labor cost of 2250 cny therefore the cost for vegetated ditch building was 7850 cny and it costs 300 cny each year to harvest plants however all three species are high quality forage grass and can be harvested twice a year 0 27 ton dry grass was collected in the vegetated ditch and sold at the price of 2000 cny each ton and thus it earns 540 cny each year through selling the grass the cost of nitrogen treatment in polluted water is used to express the environment benefit of vegetated ditch and it counts 4 10 104 cny per ton kang and liu 2016 the vegetated ditch can intercept 0 16 ton nitrogen each year according to our experiment and its environmental benefits is 6560 cny the vegetated ditch can last for more than 10 years it only costs 1085 cny but benefits 7100 cny each year and thus the cost benefit ratio of this vegetated ditch is 0 15 therefore the construction of vegetated ditches is a farmland runoff interception method that is economical and produces ecological and environmental benefits 5 conclusions this experiment was used to simulate the habitat of vegetated ditches the interception effects of three vegetated ditches composed of l perenne b inermis and e repens and control ditch were studied and produced the following results 1 the interception rates of nitrogen in the l perenne b inermis and e repens vegetated ditches were higher than that of the control ditch and the interception rate of nitrogen in the three vegetated ditches was more than 83 2 the 15n stable isotope tracer method was used to analyze the mechanism by which vegetated ditches intercept farmland runoff nitrogen the interception of nitrogen by the three vegetated ditches was mainly achieved by increasing soil infiltration while keeping the ditch bed soil and its nitrogen from being scoured away by runoff the nitrogen remaining in the l perenne and e repens ditch beds was almost completely absorbed by the plants after 60 d of growth 3 the plant species and growth stage affected the interception effect of vegetated ditches on nitrogen therefore in the construction of vegetated ditches in semiarid areas of northern china a mixture of several plants should be used this type of ditch bed is best adapted to environmental variation and considers temporal changes in plant growth over time and plant nutrient absorption differences funding this work was supported by the china s ministry of agriculture

10793,prolonged drought in arid west texas has resulted in freshwater scarcities in the rio grande basin forcing growers to abandon agricultural lands augmenting freshwater scarcities with marginal quality treated urban wastewater could be an alternative strategy however higher salinity in wastewater could be detrimental to crops and soil quality therefore developing information on crops that are salt tolerant and less water intensive is important to sustain agriculture in this region sorghum is both drought and salt tolerant and could potentially provide revenue due to increasing demand for its lignocellulosic biomass in biofuel industry this two year field study evaluated i the performance of bioenergy sorghum under wastewater irrigation in terms of its biomass yield potential and biomass quality relative to freshwater irrigation and ii wastewater irrigation effects on rootzone soil quality including soil salinity and sodicity a split plot experimental design was used with water type fresh and wastewater as the main plot and soil amendments non amended and gypsum sulfur as the subplot factors results show that sorghum biomass yields were not significantly different between fresh and wastewaters in any of the years differences in biomass quality were observed overtime but as an indirect consequence of increased soil salinity and or sodicity after wastewater irrigation soil quality changes were apparent with salinity and sodicity increasing over time with irrigation but this effect was pronounced under wastewater irrigation application of gypsum and sulfur was able to significantly reduce soil sodicity especially in wastewater irrigated plots the results from this study highlight that treated wastewater can be successfully used to grow bioenergy sorghum in arid regions however appropriate soil management practices should be in place to counter the effects of high sodium in wastewater these results have important implications in diversifying cropping pattern in this region while also help extend freshwater supplies through increased reuse of treated urban wastewater keywords drought irrigation water quality and reuse bioenergy sorghum soil salinity and sodicity soil management diversified cropping systems 1 introduction population growth and rapid urbanization along with high demand from agriculture sector to meet food needs of growing population has put enormous pressure on finite freshwater resources across all parts of the world corwin and bradford 2008 flörke et al 2018 in addition to this climate change leading to erratic rainfall patterns and increasing drought conditions especially in arid and semi arid regions and degradation of quality of available water through point and non point source pollution have resulted in acute fresh water scarcities gosling and arnell 2016 o connor et al 2008 it has been estimated that about 4 billion people across the world live in water scarcity at least once a year and approx five hundred million people live in areas of severe water scarcity throughout the year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 therefore water is unarguably the world s most critical resource issue in the present time in addition to water conservation developing alternative solutions to meet both urban and agricultural demands is an international priority in this regard water reuse is increasingly seen as a sustainable alternative to supplement freshwater this could potentially address current and future water shortages o connor et al 2008 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2012 gude 2017 especially in agricultural sector which is the largest user of freshwater both globally and in the united states united nations food and agriculture organization fao 2016 dieter et al 2018 given the current challenges to meet agricultural water demands united states department of agriculture usda considers diversifying water resources is of utmost priority use of alternative non traditional water resources is one water reuse management strategy to extend availability of fresh water supplies and sustain agricultural production suri et al 2019 importantly reusing these waters will reduce excess withdrawal from the environment and prevents environmental degradation by reducing their disposal to fresh water ways toze 2006 non traditional water resources include treated wastewater recycled water produced water agricultural return flow captured runoff brackish groundwater and the concentrate from desalinization plants dery et al 2019 díaz et al 2018 generally these waters are not suitable for potable use due to their degenerated water quality and so are commonly referred to as marginal or degraded waters o connor et al 2008 rock et al 2019 treated wastewater or reclaimed water texas water development board twdb 2019 from municipal water treatment plants is safe for non potable needs e g for agricultural irrigation and has been shown to be cost effective and reliable alternative solution for augmenting fresh water supplies chen et al 2013 savchenko et al 2019 especially in arid and semi arid regions such as southwest united states future projections indicate erratic precipitation trends frequent and higher temperatures contributing to prolonged droughts that limits freshwater availability and reduces agricultural productivity in the southwest u s suri et al 2019 as population grows in this region the availability of reclaimed treated wastewater will increase and therefore has a greater potential to be diverted for agricultural irrigation dery et al 2019 especially in states such as california arizona and texas during the years 2010 2014 texas has experienced the second worst drought on record texas water development board twdb 2017 which has resulted in drastic reductions in fresh water allocations for agricultural irrigation ganjegunte and clark 2017 however approximately 540 000 acre feet of different nontraditional waters such as brackish ground water produced water from oil industry reject water from cooling towers and treated wastewater is available for water reuse in texas texas water development board twdb 2017 ganjegunte et al 2018a the study region el paso is the largest city in the far west texas region with a population close to 800 000 this region has an arid climate with an annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of 15 and 198 cm respectively ganjegunte and clark 2017 agriculture in this region relies greatly on irrigation supplies from the rio grande river the cropping pattern in this region is dominated by water intensive crops such as cotton gossypium hirsutum l pecan carya illinoinensis l and alfalfa medicago sativa l of which pecan and alfalfa are salt sensitive suthar et al 2019 reduced fresh water allocation in recent years due to drought has forced growers in this region to abandon lands that were under annual crops such as cotton to salvage perennial high value cash crop pecan the annual treated wastewater production by el paso utilities is about 85 billion liters of which only 13 is reused for industrial and commercial landscape irrigation el paso water 2019 this is close to the level of reuse at the state level 15 of total available reuse water mancha 2017 thus there is a great potential for supplementing freshwater for agricultural irrigation in this region and extend the availability of fresh water supplies for other purposes also treated wastewater is known to contain considerable amounts of dissolved organic carbon and other nutrient sources such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p muhmood et al 2019 toze 2006 which could improve soil nutrient status transiently however higher salinity and sodicity in treated wastewaters would pose a serious environmental concern of soil salinization and reduce agricultural productivity toze 2006 corwin and bradford 2008 o connor et al 2008 wu et al 2009 therefore it is important to develop information on alternative crops that are both salt tolerant and less water intensive bioenergy crops such as switchgrass panicum virgatum and sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and biodiesel crops such as canola brassica spp and castor riccinus communis l can be potential alternatives due to their tolerance to environmental stresses and increased demand in biofuel production this would help provide some farm revenue from idle lands while also diversifying cropping patterns to sustain agriculture in this region ray et al 2018 sun et al 2013 environmental pollution and increased environmental compliance for greenhouse gases and future energy security has sparked interest in developing non conventional fuels such as bioethanol from biomass feedstocks achinas and euverink 2016a traditionally in u s corn based bioethanol is the leading first generation biofuel production technology mohanty and swain 2019 however second generation lignocellulosic based bioethanol production has gained recent importance due to the ease of availability of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks anwar et al 2014 saini et al 2015 united states department of energy usdoe recognizes c4 grasses switchgrass panicum virgatum miscanthus miscanthus gigantues sugar cane saccharum officinarum and biomass sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench as potential sources of lignocellulosic feedstock for biofuels production due to their high photosynthetic and water use efficiencies rooney et al 2007 usdoe 2011 sorghum is a hardy crop that can adapt to wide environments due to its tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought and salinity rooney 2014 rooney et al 2007 tari et al 2013 bioenergy sorghum is a dedicated class of sorghum that has been developed to produce lignocellulosic biomass feedstock for bioenergy production usdoe 2011 rooney 2014 rao et al 2016a this type of sorghum is highly photoperiod sensitive which extends its vegetative growth by limiting reproductive development and thus facilitates higher accumulation of lignocellulosic biomass in a single growing season than traditional grain and forage sorghum types mullet et al 2014 olson et al 2012 packer and rooney 2014 however studies on performance of bioenergy sorghum in terms of biomass yield potential and quality under treated wastewater irrigation especially in arid soils are limited it is important to understand the effects of treated wastewater irrigation on both plant performance and soil salinization under biomass sorghum production therefore the objectives of this field study were to evaluate i bioenergy sorghum biomass yield potential and quality under treated wastewater irrigation and ii quantifying changes in rootzone soil quality including salinity and sodicity after irrigating with treated wastewater our null hypothesis is that irrigating with wastewater will negatively affect soil quality which in turn reduces yield and biomass quality of bioenergy sorghum overtime 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and experimental setup a two year field study was initiated in april of 2017 at the texas a m agrilife research and extension center el paso tx usa 31 39 27 31 n 106 16 8 32 w fig 1 climatic conditions of the study site are characterized as arid with an annual average precipitation of 16 9 cm and a potential evapotranspiration rate of 194 cm annual temperature ranges from 3 6 c in winter to 35 8 c during summer the dominant soil map unit at the study site was saneli silty clay loam clayey over sandy or sandy skeletal montmorillonitic calcareous thermic vertic torrifluvents detailed monthly weather data for the el paso region is presented in ganjegunte et al 2018a a split plot randomized complete block experimental design was used in this study water type was used as the main plot factor and amendment application as the subplot actor water types consisted of two levels fresh fw and treated urban wastewater ww amendment application consisted of two levels no amendment na and gypsum elemental sulfur gs application all treatment combinations were replicated three times there were a total 12 individual experimental plots and each plot measured 5 6 m long and 2 6 m wide 2 2 irrigation water irrigation water consisted of regular tap water for fw which is filtered and chlorine disinfected rio grande river water and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant roberto bustamante for ww the wastewater treatment process consisted of screening de gritting pre aeration primary settling aeration secondary settling and chlorine disinfection irrigation water samples were randomly collected 2 3 times during each growing season using 500 ml polyethylene bottles and stored at 4 c until chemical analysis is completed samples of fw and ww were initially filtered through a

used in this study are presented in table 1 2 3 soil amendments gypsum caso4 2h2o and elemental sulfur s were added to respective amended plots at the rates equivalent to 10 and 1 mg ha 1 and were applied before planting and incorporated into the soil gypsum requirement was calculated based on pre study soil sodicity and that could potentially be added from irrigation waters during the course of the experiment it is a common practice for growers to add elemental s to solubilize native caco3 up to 10 by weight in the upper 75 cm to aid in in situ gypsum formation which can reduce future gypsum applications keeping this in view gypsum and elemental s application was made only once at the beginning of the experiment in the first year 2 4 plot management soil preparation in each plot included tilling using a disking harrow and a field cultivator to prepare the seedbed for sowing each individual plot is separated by raised 20 cm in height earthen berms and a buffer strip of 60 cm width in between to avoid any edge effects of treatments and percolation of irrigation water into adjacent plots an inter row spacing of 90 cm and intra row spacing of 5 cm was followed as per the literature review and keeping in mind the field equipment farmer would be using in this predominantly cotton growing region there were three rows of sorghum in each plot and 2 3 seeds of energy sorghum hybrid cultivar es5200 ceres inc thousand oaks ca usa were placed manually at a depth of 2 cm in the soil in late may of 2017 and 2018 before direct seeding starter fertilizer was applied to all plots at a rate of 120 120 and 120 kg ha 1 of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k respectively weeds in the plots were controlled by a combination of herbicide glyphosate or roundup application and manual weeding sorghum plants were thinned 4 weeks after planting at five leaf stage to have only one vigorous plant at each hole which resulted in a final plant density of 237 500 plants ha 1 all plots were irrigated by flood irrigation method as it is the most common practice in this region a total of 68 cm of irrigation water was applied to each plot with each irrigation timed at 3 4 week intervals for a total of 7 8 irrigations per cropping season energy sorghum hybrids are photo period sensitive and remain in vegetative growth stage throughout most of the growing season therefore all scheduled irrigations fell within the vegetative growth phase of sorghum when aphid infestation was observed whirlwind pesticide 44 9 chlorpyrifos at the rate of 8 ml l 1 was sprayed on plants to control aphids 2 5 soil sampling and analyses bulk soil samples were collected from the study site to quantify the general soil properties bulk soil was collected from 0 to 15 and

composited as a single sample composite soil samples were air dried mixed and were ground to pass through a 2 mm sieve to achieve uniformity baseline and end of the year soil samples from all plots were analyzed for soil quality indices including ece ph and sar 2 6 biomass yield and quality sorghum plants were harvested from all three rows in each test plot using hand implements around first week of november before the first killing frost which was approximately 145 150 days after planting plants were cut at the base closer to the soil surface and were weighed for fresh weight plants were dried in a forced air oven at 75 ⁰c and the total dry weight of above ground biomass was recorded for each individual test plot dried biomass samples were ground to pass through a 1 mm sieve using a commercial grinder and sub samples were sent to dairy one forage laboratory ithaca ny usa for determining select biomass quality parameters by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy xu et al 2015 and

all data were subjected to analysis of variance using the general linear model glm repeated measures analysis in spss v 25 to determine the significance at 5 level of main water type and sub plot amendment factors and their respective interactions water type and amendment effects were considered as fixed effects and year was considered as a repeated measure with respect to soil quality measurements depth of the soil was also included in the model as a fixed factor when statistically significant mean comparisons between treatments were conducted using the tukey s hsd test at p 0 05 unless otherwise stated graphics were generated using ggplot2 package in r wickham 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 sorghum biomass yield biomass production for energy sorghum ranged from a low of 15 4 mg ha 1 to a high of 20 8 mg ha 1 across all treatments and two years table 3 year water type and soil amendment did not have any significant effect on biomass yield of sorghum respective interactions between year water type and amendment were also not statistically significant however there was a general trend of increased biomass production in 2018 compared to 2017 across all treatments except ww na treatment where a decrease in biomass productivity was observed average biomass yields under fw and ww irrigations across both the years were 17 6 and 19 3 mg ha 1 respectively application of amendment to soil irrigated with different water qualities did not produce any significant yield advantage mean sorghum biomass yields were 18 3 mg ha 1 and 18 7 mg ha 1 for na and gs treatments respectively in a greenhouse study ganjegunte et al 2018a reported that sorghum biomass yields increased significantly as time progressed furthermore sorghum grown with wastewater yielded significantly less biomass compared to that grown under freshwater irrigation mean biomass yields were 23 and 26 mg ha 1 for ww and fw irrigation treatments respectively in the ganjegunte et al 2018a study our results follow a similar trend but the observed differences were not statistically significant also in the same study application of amendment gs did not produce any significant yield difference a result similar to that observed in our study lack of yield response to amendment application was attributed to the calcareous nature of soils in this region which can naturally form gypsum when s is added to the soil ganjegunte et al 2018a the same was likely true for our soils and thus no additional benefit with gs application on sorghum biomass yield furthermore our results are supported by campi et al 2014 who reported that irrigation with municipal reclaimed waters increased sorghum biomass production in the second year of a two year study in italy however this increase was attributed to increased nutrient supply through reclaimed waters especially nitrogen n that enhanced the yield response campi et al 2014 zema et al 2012 such a response to wastewater irrigation was not observed in the current study in any of the two years even though ww had higher n compared to fw table 1 the exact reason for this result is unclear but is likely a site specific yield response contrarily some studies have reported reduced bioenergy sorghum biomass yields on marginal and saline soils chen et al 2017 c tang et al 2018a b for example in two different studies conducted by tang et al 2018a b in china biomass yields of bioenergy sorghum were less than 15 mg ha 1 most times on marginal and saline soils in contrast to biomass yields 38 mg ha 1 under non saline soil conditions however the range of yields observed in this field study for es5200 high biomass cultivar under increased saline conditions following ww and amendment applications are comparable to those reported under non saline conditions in other parts of texas and elsewhere almeida et al 2019 chavez et al 2019 da silva et al 2018 diallo et al 2019 enciso et al 2015 hoffmann and rooney 2014 maw et al 2017 mckinley et al 2018 this shows the potential of bioenergy sorghum to tolerate elevated soil salinity and likely is a viable crop for bioenergy biomass production in degraded saline lands and improve their productivity 3 2 sorghum biomass quality 3 2 1 water soluble carbohydrates water soluble carbohydrate concentrations ranged from 6 8 to 9 2 g 100g 1 across the two growth years water types and amendment treatments fig 2 a growth year water type and amendment application did not result in any significant differences in wsc contents in sorghum biomass table 4 previously almodares et al 2008 in iran and ganjegunte et al 2018a in texas reported decreased wsc concentrations as time progressed this decrease in wsc carbohydrate concentrations was attributed to increasing soil salinity with time which could negatively affect processes such as tissue rehydration and reduced k uptake crucial for sugar transport and metabolism similarly in china tang et al 2018a also reported reduced soluble sugar concentrations in sorghum above ground biomass in salt affected soils compared to normal crop lands however such a trend was not observed in the present study even though soil salinity levels increased in 2018 compared to 2017 in fact an 8 increase in soluble carbohydrate concentration was observed from 2017 to 2018 growth year it is likely that the increase in soil salinity observed after irrigating with ww and applying gypsum and sulfur is still well below the salinity tolerance threshold of sorghum and so might not have negatively affected sorghum quality here nevertheless stefaniak et al 2012 and mckinley et al 2018 reported similar levels of soluble carbohydrate sucrose fructose and glucose contents in biomass sorghum while sekhon et al 2016 and godin et al 2016 reported much higher soluble sugar contents than what were observed in the current study 3 2 2 holocellulose cellulose hemicellulose holocellulose concentrations ranged between 46 60 6 g 100g 1 fig 2b and significant growth year differences were observed table 4 holocellulose concentrations were significantly lower in 2018 compared to that in 2017 fig 1b irrigating with ww also significantly reduced holocellulose content of the biomass fig 1b when compared to fw irrigation amending soil with gypsum and s did not have any significant effect on holocellulose contents of the biomass relative to non amended soils holocellulose is the desirable portion of the cellulosic biomass during the biochemical conversion process in lignocellulosic bioethanol production achinas and euverink 2016 anwar et al 2014 holocellulose concentrations specifically cellulose contents data not shown significantly decreased over time in our study which is likely due to increased salt stress with the addition of ww and gypsum treatments however in very similar experiments campi et al 2016 and ganjegunte et al 2018a reported an increase in overall holocellulose concentrations over a 2 and 3 yr time period abiotic stresses such as salt stress could potentially alter the cellulose synthesis pathways that result in changes in cellulose compositions of plant cell walls kesten et al 2017 regardless the levels of holocellulose in sorghum biomass are still higher compared to the ganjegunte et al 2018a and closer to that reported in campi et al 2016 studies also campi et al 2016 reported no significant effect of fw and ww on holocellulose contents in sorghum biomass however in this study we observed significantly reduced p 0 1 holocellulose contents in plants that were irrigated with ww in general the holocellulose concentrations observed in our study are consistent with the ranges reported in other studies for sorghum rocateli et al 2012 mckinley et al 2018 rao et al 2016 stefaniak et al 2012 c c tang et al 2018 zhao et al 2009 3 2 3 lignin biomass lignin contents ranged between 4 4 7 3 g 100g 1 fig 2c biomass lignin contents significantly decreased with time table 4 irrigating with either fresh or wastewater and amending soils with gypsum and sulfur did not result in any significant changes in biomass lignin contents lignin is a complex polymer that adds stability to plant cell walls and is highly recalcitrant wang et al 2016 lower lignin contents are preferred to increase the efficiency of biochemical conversion processes and increase ethanol yield from lignocellulosic biomass achinas and euverink 2016b the acid insoluble lignin content observed in this study is consistent with those reported by ganjegunte et al 2018a and campi et al 2016 however these values are well below the ranges 10 25 given for most agricultural lignocellulosic biomass in the literature anwar et al 2014 higher lignin contents in sorghum biomass were also reported by other studies zhao et al 2009 kim and day 2011 stefaniak et al 2012 hoffmann and rooney 2014 tang et al 2018a than what were found in this study for example in a study conducted in texas hoffman and rooney 2014 found biomass lignin concentrations between 14 16 in different cultivars of biomass sorghum when 108 different sorghum genotypes were evaluated in another study in texas stefaniak et al 2012 reported a much wider range 8 9 20 6 of lignin concentrations in biomass sorghum also tang et al 2018a reported higher lignin concentrations 15 5 24 7 in sorghum biomass grown on saline and waste lands in china conditions which are similar to this study the lower lignin contents observed in this study can be attributed to the differences in cultivar performance under different site specific soil conditions 3 2 4 ash overall biomass ash contents ranged from 8 3 to 11 g 100g 1 across all treatments fig 2d as expected ash content significantly increased with time irrigating with either fresh or wastewater and amending soils with gypsum and sulfur did not result in any significant changes ash contents of sorghum biomass however increased ash contents might be a consequence of increased soil salinity following wastewater application biomass ash contents in sorghum under elevated soil salinity observed in this study are in conjunction with those reported by ganjegunte et al 2018a these authors reported ash contents ranging between 6 2 12 6 in sorghum biomass under elevated soil salinity conditions tang et al 2018a also found increased ash contents in biomass sorghum grown on saline and degraded lands compared to those grown on non saline crop lands other studies have also reported lower ash contents in sorghum biomass grown under non saline conditions rocatelli et al 2012 rao et al 2016 mckinley et al 2018 lower biomass ash contents are generally preferred for efficient combustion conversion of cellulosic feedstock cassida et al 2005 however we believe that the biomass ash contents observed in this study are not high enough that could negatively impact the combustion efficiency of lignocellulosic feedstock 3 3 soil quality 3 3 1 ph soil ph changes observed during this study are presented in fig 3 among all the factors only year and soil amendment application significantly affected soil solution ph table 5 no significant interactions between various treatment combinations were observed in general soil ph decreased over time from 7 97 to 7 13 at the 0 15 cm depth and 8 to 7 10 at the 15 30 cm depth decrease in ph regardless of irrigation water type and soil amendment is most likely due to the natural rhizosphere acidification processes facilitated by plant roots through various mechanisms fageria and stone 2006 houmani et al 2015 it is also possible that increased carbon c availability from organic matter addition through roots increased microbial activity in soil rootzone higher microbial activity likely increased the partial pressure of co2 pco2 and resulted in the formation of organic and inorganic acids chaganti and crohn 2015 wong et al 2009 which caused reductions in soil ph over time application of s along with gypsum also significantly reduced soil ph overtime this could be mostly attributed to sulfur as gypsum is a neutral salt and will not cause soil acidification also reduction in soil ph was much more pronounced in the upper layers of the soil profile than deeper depths in gs plots regardless of depth reductions in soil ph in gs treatments averaged 0 9 units compared to 0 6 unit reduction in na plots over a two year period application of elemental s is known to cause soil acidity by its microbial oxidation to sulfate so4 2 and subsequent formation of sulfuric acid germida and janzen 1993 goulding 2016 moreover dissolution of native caco3 and in situ gypsum formation in calcareous soils after s additions likely increased divalent cation availability in soil solution dominance of divalent cations at the diffuse double layer is shown to reduce soil solution ph due to the formation neutral ionic pairs essington 2015 nevertheless decrease in soil ph has important implications in nutrient availability for plants especially for calcareous soils like those seen in this study 3 3 2 soil salinity ece changes in soil salinity overtime after application of different qualities of water and soil amendments are presented in fig 4 effects of growth year water types and soil amendment treatments on soil salinity were all significant table 5 also the interactive effects of year x water type and year x amendment were statistically significant table 5 irrigating with either fw or ww significantly reduced soil salinity over time in the na plots that did not receive gypsum and s soil salinities observed in the surface layer at the end of the experiment were lower than baseline soils and almost equilibrated with the salinity of the irrigation water on the other hand soil salinity changes in the 15 30 cm depth followed a mixed trend over time these results indicate that both fw and ww can be used to leach salts from the soil profile without any amendment application whereas in the gypsum and s amended plots soil salinity significantly increased in 2017 and then decreased in 2018 with salinity dropping closer to baseline levels at both the depths in fw irrigated plots the same trend was observed in the ww irrigated plots but the changes in soil salinity levels were much higher than the fw plots this specific trend of initial spike in soil salinity in the first year followed by salinity reduction in the second year observed in gs plots can be attributed to solubilization of gypsum salt and subsequent redistribution or leaching into lower depths as time progressed irrespective of amendment application irrigating with ww generally increased soil salinity compared to fw irrigation this is a common result reported in literature and is attributed to higher dissolved salt concentrations in ww bedbabis et al 2014 elgallal et al 2016 erel et al 2019 ganjegunte et al 2018a gharaibeh et al 2016 muyen et al 2011 which is also the case in this study table 1 results also indicate that in most treatment combinations subsurface soil salinity was higher than surface soil salinity though the differences were not statistically significant this is due to leaching of salts from upper layers into deeper layers after irrigation most importantly increase in soil salinities with either ww irrigation or gypsum s application did not cause any significant yield reductions in sorghum biomass this can be attributed to higher salinity tolerance of sorghum 6 8 ds m 1 francois et al 1984 and the highest salinities observed in this study were still below the general threshold therefore these results indicate that bioenergy sorghum can be successfully grown in arid soils with ww under elevated soil salinity 3 3 3 soil sodicity sar sodicity changes in soil over time are presented in fig 5 effects of year water amendment and depth were all significant table 5 also the interactive effects of year x amendment and year x amendment x depth were statistically significant table 5 results indicate that soil sodicity significantly increased after two years of irrigation either with fw or ww in unamended na plots across both the depths this can be attributed to increased na concentration in soil solution because of na addition through irrigation waters also when the soil solution is diluted by added water there is an increased adsorption of divalent cations onto soil exchange complex at the expense of monovalent cations valence dilution reeve and doering 1966 this increases the concentration of monovalent cations in soil solution especially na the same likely happened in our case when soils were irrigated with fw and ww and thus high sar values in na plots soil sar increased by 18 and 57 at 0 15 cm and by 61 and 31 at 15 30 cm depth in fw na and ww na treatments respectively relative to their baseline soil sar s conversely sar decreased in soils that were amended with gypsum s after two years of irrigation with either fw or ww reductions in soil sar in gs plots can be attributed to chemical enrichment of ca2 in soil solution relative to na due to solubilization of gypsum in soil water also higher ca2 concentrations in soil solution solubilized na from exchange sites and enabled its loss through leaching thus causing reductions in sar our results concur with previous studies who reported similar reductions in soil sar upon addition of gypsum or s to soil amezketa et al 2005 chaganti et al 2015 g k ganjegunte et al 2018b rasouli et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 nevertheless soil sar was reduced by 54 and 14 in fw gs and ww gs treatments respectively compared to their respective baseline soil sar s at the surface layer however sar reduction with time as seen at the surface layer was observed only in the fw gs treatment at the 15 30 cm depth sar in fact increased overtime in the ww gs treatment at the same subsurface depth also subsurface soils 15 30 cm were generally found to have significantly higher sar values compared to surface soils 0 15 cm fig 4 this can be attributed to increased solution concentration of na due to its accumulation in the lower layers as a result of leaching from surface layer also soil sodicity was always significantly higher in ww irrigated plots compared to fw plots in both na and gs plots in 2017 and 2018 this is an expected result as ww has higher na concentration compared to fresh water table 1 assouline et al 2016 bedbabis et al 2014 tahtouh et al 2019 overall these results indicate that irrigation with either fw and ww can cause soil sodification in the absence of amendments with ww irrigation having a greater potential to increase sodicity hazard therefore it is ideal to include gypsum application in the management practice especially when irrigating with ww on marginal lands 4 conclusions significant sorghum biomass yield differences were not observed between ww and fw irrigation over two years of this study biomass yields obtained with ww irrigation in our study were comparable to yields obtained through freshwater irrigation reported in the literature however biomass quality showed a mixed trend overtime when irrigated with different quality waters holocellulose and lignin concentrations decreased and ash content increased in biomass over time this result can be attributed to the indirect effects of changes in soil quality by wastewater irrigation decreased holocellulose and increased ash concentrations in sorghum biomass are not likely beneficial in terms of efficiency of biochemical conversion processes in bioenergy production however more long term studies are needed to understand these changes in sorghum biomass quality as a function of soil quality dynamics following wastewater irrigation soil quality changes were more apparent due to irrigation with different quality waters and application of gypsum and sulfur soil ph decreased overtime regardless of irrigation water quality and is attributable to natural soil acidification processes and application of s soil salinity decreased overtime and equilibrated with water ec in unamended plots but salinity increased in gypsum and s treated plots it is important here to highlight that sorghum biomass yield reductions were not observed under increased soil salinity conditions this is likely due to the fact that highest salinity values observed during the study were lower than the salinity tolerance threshold of sorghum results show that irrigation with wastewater increased soil sar but application of gypsum significantly reduced that effect this indicates that wastewater irrigation can increase soil sodification hazard and negatively impact soil quality in the absence of an amendment to counteract the effects of sodium in wastewater overall the results from this two year field study highlight that treated wastewaters can be successfully used to irrigate bioenergy crops such as sorghum in arid regions of west texas without significant yield compromises however necessary soil management practices should be in place to negate the detrimental effects of wastewater on soil quality when used continuously on long term basis these results have important implications in diversifying cropping systems in arid lands and sustaining their agricultural productivity this also shows the potential for expanding acreage of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock production for bioenergy into arid lands of southwestern u s most importantly increased wastewater reuse for agricultural irrigation in these regions

10793,prolonged drought in arid west texas has resulted in freshwater scarcities in the rio grande basin forcing growers to abandon agricultural lands augmenting freshwater scarcities with marginal quality treated urban wastewater could be an alternative strategy however higher salinity in wastewater could be detrimental to crops and soil quality therefore developing information on crops that are salt tolerant and less water intensive is important to sustain agriculture in this region sorghum is both drought and salt tolerant and could potentially provide revenue due to increasing demand for its lignocellulosic biomass in biofuel industry this two year field study evaluated i the performance of bioenergy sorghum under wastewater irrigation in terms of its biomass yield potential and biomass quality relative to freshwater irrigation and ii wastewater irrigation effects on rootzone soil quality including soil salinity and sodicity a split plot experimental design was used with water type fresh and wastewater as the main plot and soil amendments non amended and gypsum sulfur as the subplot factors results show that sorghum biomass yields were not significantly different between fresh and wastewaters in any of the years differences in biomass quality were observed overtime but as an indirect consequence of increased soil salinity and or sodicity after wastewater irrigation soil quality changes were apparent with salinity and sodicity increasing over time with irrigation but this effect was pronounced under wastewater irrigation application of gypsum and sulfur was able to significantly reduce soil sodicity especially in wastewater irrigated plots the results from this study highlight that treated wastewater can be successfully used to grow bioenergy sorghum in arid regions however appropriate soil management practices should be in place to counter the effects of high sodium in wastewater these results have important implications in diversifying cropping pattern in this region while also help extend freshwater supplies through increased reuse of treated urban wastewater keywords drought irrigation water quality and reuse bioenergy sorghum soil salinity and sodicity soil management diversified cropping systems 1 introduction population growth and rapid urbanization along with high demand from agriculture sector to meet food needs of growing population has put enormous pressure on finite freshwater resources across all parts of the world corwin and bradford 2008 flörke et al 2018 in addition to this climate change leading to erratic rainfall patterns and increasing drought conditions especially in arid and semi arid regions and degradation of quality of available water through point and non point source pollution have resulted in acute fresh water scarcities gosling and arnell 2016 o connor et al 2008 it has been estimated that about 4 billion people across the world live in water scarcity at least once a year and approx five hundred million people live in areas of severe water scarcity throughout the year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 therefore water is unarguably the world s most critical resource issue in the present time in addition to water conservation developing alternative solutions to meet both urban and agricultural demands is an international priority in this regard water reuse is increasingly seen as a sustainable alternative to supplement freshwater this could potentially address current and future water shortages o connor et al 2008 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2012 gude 2017 especially in agricultural sector which is the largest user of freshwater both globally and in the united states united nations food and agriculture organization fao 2016 dieter et al 2018 given the current challenges to meet agricultural water demands united states department of agriculture usda considers diversifying water resources is of utmost priority use of alternative non traditional water resources is one water reuse management strategy to extend availability of fresh water supplies and sustain agricultural production suri et al 2019 importantly reusing these waters will reduce excess withdrawal from the environment and prevents environmental degradation by reducing their disposal to fresh water ways toze 2006 non traditional water resources include treated wastewater recycled water produced water agricultural return flow captured runoff brackish groundwater and the concentrate from desalinization plants dery et al 2019 díaz et al 2018 generally these waters are not suitable for potable use due to their degenerated water quality and so are commonly referred to as marginal or degraded waters o connor et al 2008 rock et al 2019 treated wastewater or reclaimed water texas water development board twdb 2019 from municipal water treatment plants is safe for non potable needs e g for agricultural irrigation and has been shown to be cost effective and reliable alternative solution for augmenting fresh water supplies chen et al 2013 savchenko et al 2019 especially in arid and semi arid regions such as southwest united states future projections indicate erratic precipitation trends frequent and higher temperatures contributing to prolonged droughts that limits freshwater availability and reduces agricultural productivity in the southwest u s suri et al 2019 as population grows in this region the availability of reclaimed treated wastewater will increase and therefore has a greater potential to be diverted for agricultural irrigation dery et al 2019 especially in states such as california arizona and texas during the years 2010 2014 texas has experienced the second worst drought on record texas water development board twdb 2017 which has resulted in drastic reductions in fresh water allocations for agricultural irrigation ganjegunte and clark 2017 however approximately 540 000 acre feet of different nontraditional waters such as brackish ground water produced water from oil industry reject water from cooling towers and treated wastewater is available for water reuse in texas texas water development board twdb 2017 ganjegunte et al 2018a the study region el paso is the largest city in the far west texas region with a population close to 800 000 this region has an arid climate with an annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of 15 and 198 cm respectively ganjegunte and clark 2017 agriculture in this region relies greatly on irrigation supplies from the rio grande river the cropping pattern in this region is dominated by water intensive crops such as cotton gossypium hirsutum l pecan carya illinoinensis l and alfalfa medicago sativa l of which pecan and alfalfa are salt sensitive suthar et al 2019 reduced fresh water allocation in recent years due to drought has forced growers in this region to abandon lands that were under annual crops such as cotton to salvage perennial high value cash crop pecan the annual treated wastewater production by el paso utilities is about 85 billion liters of which only 13 is reused for industrial and commercial landscape irrigation el paso water 2019 this is close to the level of reuse at the state level 15 of total available reuse water mancha 2017 thus there is a great potential for supplementing freshwater for agricultural irrigation in this region and extend the availability of fresh water supplies for other purposes also treated wastewater is known to contain considerable amounts of dissolved organic carbon and other nutrient sources such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p muhmood et al 2019 toze 2006 which could improve soil nutrient status transiently however higher salinity and sodicity in treated wastewaters would pose a serious environmental concern of soil salinization and reduce agricultural productivity toze 2006 corwin and bradford 2008 o connor et al 2008 wu et al 2009 therefore it is important to develop information on alternative crops that are both salt tolerant and less water intensive bioenergy crops such as switchgrass panicum virgatum and sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and biodiesel crops such as canola brassica spp and castor riccinus communis l can be potential alternatives due to their tolerance to environmental stresses and increased demand in biofuel production this would help provide some farm revenue from idle lands while also diversifying cropping patterns to sustain agriculture in this region ray et al 2018 sun et al 2013 environmental pollution and increased environmental compliance for greenhouse gases and future energy security has sparked interest in developing non conventional fuels such as bioethanol from biomass feedstocks achinas and euverink 2016a traditionally in u s corn based bioethanol is the leading first generation biofuel production technology mohanty and swain 2019 however second generation lignocellulosic based bioethanol production has gained recent importance due to the ease of availability of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks anwar et al 2014 saini et al 2015 united states department of energy usdoe recognizes c4 grasses switchgrass panicum virgatum miscanthus miscanthus gigantues sugar cane saccharum officinarum and biomass sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench as potential sources of lignocellulosic feedstock for biofuels production due to their high photosynthetic and water use efficiencies rooney et al 2007 usdoe 2011 sorghum is a hardy crop that can adapt to wide environments due to its tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought and salinity rooney 2014 rooney et al 2007 tari et al 2013 bioenergy sorghum is a dedicated class of sorghum that has been developed to produce lignocellulosic biomass feedstock for bioenergy production usdoe 2011 rooney 2014 rao et al 2016a this type of sorghum is highly photoperiod sensitive which extends its vegetative growth by limiting reproductive development and thus facilitates higher accumulation of lignocellulosic biomass in a single growing season than traditional grain and forage sorghum types mullet et al 2014 olson et al 2012 packer and rooney 2014 however studies on performance of bioenergy sorghum in terms of biomass yield potential and quality under treated wastewater irrigation especially in arid soils are limited it is important to understand the effects of treated wastewater irrigation on both plant performance and soil salinization under biomass sorghum production therefore the objectives of this field study were to evaluate i bioenergy sorghum biomass yield potential and quality under treated wastewater irrigation and ii quantifying changes in rootzone soil quality including salinity and sodicity after irrigating with treated wastewater our null hypothesis is that irrigating with wastewater will negatively affect soil quality which in turn reduces yield and biomass quality of bioenergy sorghum overtime 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and experimental setup a two year field study was initiated in april of 2017 at the texas a m agrilife research and extension center el paso tx usa 31 39 27 31 n 106 16 8 32 w fig 1 climatic conditions of the study site are characterized as arid with an annual average precipitation of 16 9 cm and a potential evapotranspiration rate of 194 cm annual temperature ranges from 3 6 c in winter to 35 8 c during summer the dominant soil map unit at the study site was saneli silty clay loam clayey over sandy or sandy skeletal montmorillonitic calcareous thermic vertic torrifluvents detailed monthly weather data for the el paso region is presented in ganjegunte et al 2018a a split plot randomized complete block experimental design was used in this study water type was used as the main plot factor and amendment application as the subplot actor water types consisted of two levels fresh fw and treated urban wastewater ww amendment application consisted of two levels no amendment na and gypsum elemental sulfur gs application all treatment combinations were replicated three times there were a total 12 individual experimental plots and each plot measured 5 6 m long and 2 6 m wide 2 2 irrigation water irrigation water consisted of regular tap water for fw which is filtered and chlorine disinfected rio grande river water and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant roberto bustamante for ww the wastewater treatment process consisted of screening de gritting pre aeration primary settling aeration secondary settling and chlorine disinfection irrigation water samples were randomly collected 2 3 times during each growing season using 500 ml polyethylene bottles and stored at 4 c until chemical analysis is completed samples of fw and ww were initially filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter and analyzed for chemical properties such as ph electrical conductivity ec cations ca2 mg2 na k nh4 and anions cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 using methods outlined in the standard methods

fisher scientific com nh the cations and anions were determined using ion exchange chromatography dionex ics 1100 dionex corporation sunnyvale ca important chemical properties of fresh and wastewater used in this study are presented in table 1 2 3 soil amendments gypsum caso4 2h2o and elemental sulfur s were added to respective amended plots at the rates equivalent to 10 and 1 mg ha 1 and were applied before planting and incorporated into the soil gypsum requirement was calculated based on pre study soil sodicity and that could potentially be added from irrigation waters during the course of the experiment it is a common practice for growers to add elemental s to solubilize native caco3 up to 10 by weight in the upper 75 cm to aid in in situ gypsum formation which can reduce future gypsum applications keeping this in view gypsum and elemental s application was made only once at the beginning of the experiment in the first year 2 4 plot management soil preparation in each plot included tilling using a disking harrow and a field cultivator to prepare the seedbed for sowing each individual plot is separated by raised 20 cm in height earthen berms and a buffer strip of 60 cm width in between to avoid any edge effects of treatments and percolation of irrigation water into adjacent plots an inter row spacing of 90 cm and intra row spacing of 5 cm was followed as per the literature review and keeping in mind the field equipment farmer would be using in this predominantly cotton growing region there were three rows of sorghum in each plot and 2 3 seeds of energy sorghum hybrid cultivar es5200 ceres inc thousand oaks ca usa were placed manually at a depth of 2 cm in the soil in late may of 2017 and 2018 before direct seeding starter fertilizer was applied to all plots at a rate of 120 120 and 120 kg ha 1 of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k respectively weeds in the plots were controlled by a combination of herbicide glyphosate or roundup application and manual weeding sorghum plants were thinned 4 weeks after planting at five leaf stage to have only one vigorous plant at each hole which resulted in a final plant density of 237 500 plants ha 1 all plots were irrigated by flood irrigation method as it is the most common practice in this region a total of 68 cm of irrigation water was applied to each plot with each irrigation timed at 3 4 week intervals for a total of 7 8 irrigations per cropping season energy sorghum hybrids are photo period sensitive and remain in vegetative growth stage throughout most of the growing season therefore all scheduled irrigations fell within the vegetative growth phase of sorghum when aphid infestation was observed whirlwind pesticide 44 9 chlorpyrifos at the rate of 8 ml l 1 was sprayed on plants to control aphids 2 5 soil sampling and analyses bulk soil samples were collected from the study site to quantify the general soil properties bulk soil was collected from 0 to 15 and

all data were subjected to analysis of variance using the general linear model glm repeated measures analysis in spss v 25 to determine the significance at 5 level of main water type and sub plot amendment factors and their respective interactions water type and amendment effects were considered as fixed effects and year was considered as a repeated measure with respect to soil quality measurements depth of the soil was also included in the model as a fixed factor when statistically significant mean comparisons between treatments were conducted using the tukey s hsd test at p 0 05 unless otherwise stated graphics were generated using ggplot2 package in r wickham 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 sorghum biomass yield biomass production for energy sorghum ranged from a low of 15 4 mg ha 1 to a high of 20 8 mg ha 1 across all treatments and two years table 3 year water type and soil amendment did not have any significant effect on biomass yield of sorghum respective interactions between year water type and amendment were also not statistically significant however there was a general trend of increased biomass production in 2018 compared to 2017 across all treatments except ww na treatment where a decrease in biomass productivity was observed average biomass yields under fw and ww irrigations across both the years were 17 6 and 19 3 mg ha 1 respectively application of amendment to soil irrigated with different water qualities did not produce any significant yield advantage mean sorghum biomass yields were 18 3 mg ha 1 and 18 7 mg ha 1 for na and gs treatments respectively in a greenhouse study ganjegunte et al 2018a reported that sorghum biomass yields increased significantly as time progressed furthermore sorghum grown with wastewater yielded significantly less biomass compared to that grown under freshwater irrigation mean biomass yields were 23 and 26 mg ha 1 for ww and fw irrigation treatments respectively in the ganjegunte et al 2018a study our results follow a similar trend but the observed differences were not statistically significant also in the same study application of amendment gs did not produce any significant yield difference a result similar to that observed in our study lack of yield response to amendment application was attributed to the calcareous nature of soils in this region which can naturally form gypsum when s is added to the soil ganjegunte et al 2018a the same was likely true for our soils and thus no additional benefit with gs application on sorghum biomass yield furthermore our results are supported by campi et al 2014 who reported that irrigation with municipal reclaimed waters increased sorghum biomass production in the second year of a two year study in italy however this increase was attributed to increased nutrient supply through reclaimed waters especially nitrogen n that enhanced the yield response campi et al 2014 zema et al 2012 such a response to wastewater irrigation was not observed in the current study in any of the two years even though ww had higher n compared to fw table 1 the exact reason for this result is unclear but is likely a site specific yield response contrarily some studies have reported reduced bioenergy sorghum biomass yields on marginal and saline soils chen et al 2017 c tang et al 2018a b for example in two different studies conducted by tang et al 2018a b in china biomass yields of bioenergy sorghum were less than 15 mg ha 1 most times on marginal and saline soils in contrast to biomass yields 38 mg ha 1 under non saline soil conditions however the range of yields observed in this field study for es5200 high biomass cultivar under increased saline conditions following ww and amendment applications are comparable to those reported under non saline conditions in other parts of texas and elsewhere almeida et al 2019 chavez et al 2019 da silva et al 2018 diallo et al 2019 enciso et al 2015 hoffmann and rooney 2014 maw et al 2017 mckinley et al 2018 this shows the potential of bioenergy sorghum to tolerate elevated soil salinity and likely is a viable crop for bioenergy biomass production in degraded saline lands and improve their productivity 3 2 sorghum biomass quality 3 2 1 water soluble carbohydrates water soluble carbohydrate concentrations ranged from 6 8 to 9 2 g 100g 1 across the two growth years water types and amendment treatments fig 2 a growth year water type and amendment application did not result in any significant differences in wsc contents in sorghum biomass table 4 previously almodares et al 2008 in iran and ganjegunte et al 2018a in texas reported decreased wsc concentrations as time progressed this decrease in wsc carbohydrate concentrations was attributed to increasing soil salinity with time which could negatively affect processes such as tissue rehydration and reduced k uptake crucial for sugar transport and metabolism similarly in china tang et al 2018a also reported reduced soluble sugar concentrations in sorghum above ground biomass in salt affected soils compared to normal crop lands however such a trend was not observed in the present study even though soil salinity levels increased in 2018 compared to 2017 in fact an 8 increase in soluble carbohydrate concentration was observed from 2017 to 2018 growth year it is likely that the increase in soil salinity observed after irrigating with ww and applying gypsum and sulfur is still well below the salinity tolerance threshold of sorghum and so might not have negatively affected sorghum quality here nevertheless stefaniak et al 2012 and mckinley et al 2018 reported similar levels of soluble carbohydrate sucrose fructose and glucose contents in biomass sorghum while sekhon et al 2016 and godin et al 2016 reported much higher soluble sugar contents than what were observed in the current study 3 2 2 holocellulose cellulose hemicellulose holocellulose concentrations ranged between 46 60 6 g 100g 1 fig 2b and significant growth year differences were observed table 4 holocellulose concentrations were significantly lower in 2018 compared to that in 2017 fig 1b irrigating with ww also significantly reduced holocellulose content of the biomass fig 1b when compared to fw irrigation amending soil with gypsum and s did not have any significant effect on holocellulose contents of the biomass relative to non amended soils holocellulose is the desirable portion of the cellulosic biomass during the biochemical conversion process in lignocellulosic bioethanol production achinas and euverink 2016 anwar et al 2014 holocellulose concentrations specifically cellulose contents data not shown significantly decreased over time in our study which is likely due to increased salt stress with the addition of ww and gypsum treatments however in very similar experiments campi et al 2016 and ganjegunte et al 2018a reported an increase in overall holocellulose concentrations over a 2 and 3 yr time period abiotic stresses such as salt stress could potentially alter the cellulose synthesis pathways that result in changes in cellulose compositions of plant cell walls kesten et al 2017 regardless the levels of holocellulose in sorghum biomass are still higher compared to the ganjegunte et al 2018a and closer to that reported in campi et al 2016 studies also campi et al 2016 reported no significant effect of fw and ww on holocellulose contents in sorghum biomass however in this study we observed significantly reduced p 0 1 holocellulose contents in plants that were irrigated with ww in general the holocellulose concentrations observed in our study are consistent with the ranges reported in other studies for sorghum rocateli et al 2012 mckinley et al 2018 rao et al 2016 stefaniak et al 2012 c c tang et al 2018 zhao et al 2009 3 2 3 lignin biomass lignin contents ranged between 4 4 7 3 g 100g 1 fig 2c biomass lignin contents significantly decreased with time table 4 irrigating with either fresh or wastewater and amending soils with gypsum and sulfur did not result in any significant changes in biomass lignin contents lignin is a complex polymer that adds stability to plant cell walls and is highly recalcitrant wang et al 2016 lower lignin contents are preferred to increase the efficiency of biochemical conversion processes and increase ethanol yield from lignocellulosic biomass achinas and euverink 2016b the acid insoluble lignin content observed in this study is consistent with those reported by ganjegunte et al 2018a and campi et al 2016 however these values are well below the ranges 10 25 given for most agricultural lignocellulosic biomass in the literature anwar et al 2014 higher lignin contents in sorghum biomass were also reported by other studies zhao et al 2009 kim and day 2011 stefaniak et al 2012 hoffmann and rooney 2014 tang et al 2018a than what were found in this study for example in a study conducted in texas hoffman and rooney 2014 found biomass lignin concentrations between 14 16 in different cultivars of biomass sorghum when 108 different sorghum genotypes were evaluated in another study in texas stefaniak et al 2012 reported a much wider range 8 9 20 6 of lignin concentrations in biomass sorghum also tang et al 2018a reported higher lignin concentrations 15 5 24 7 in sorghum biomass grown on saline and waste lands in china conditions which are similar to this study the lower lignin contents observed in this study can be attributed to the differences in cultivar performance under different site specific soil conditions 3 2 4 ash overall biomass ash contents ranged from 8 3 to 11 g 100g 1 across all treatments fig 2d as expected ash content significantly increased with time irrigating with either fresh or wastewater and amending soils with gypsum and sulfur did not result in any significant changes ash contents of sorghum biomass however increased ash contents might be a consequence of increased soil salinity following wastewater application biomass ash contents in sorghum under elevated soil salinity observed in this study are in conjunction with those reported by ganjegunte et al 2018a these authors reported ash contents ranging between 6 2 12 6 in sorghum biomass under elevated soil salinity conditions tang et al 2018a also found increased ash contents in biomass sorghum grown on saline and degraded lands compared to those grown on non saline crop lands other studies have also reported lower ash contents in sorghum biomass grown under non saline conditions rocatelli et al 2012 rao et al 2016 mckinley et al 2018 lower biomass ash contents are generally preferred for efficient combustion conversion of cellulosic feedstock cassida et al 2005 however we believe that the biomass ash contents observed in this study are not high enough that could negatively impact the combustion efficiency of lignocellulosic feedstock 3 3 soil quality 3 3 1 ph soil ph changes observed during this study are presented in fig 3 among all the factors only year and soil amendment application significantly affected soil solution ph table 5 no significant interactions between various treatment combinations were observed in general soil ph decreased over time from 7 97 to 7 13 at the 0 15 cm depth and 8 to 7 10 at the 15 30 cm depth decrease in ph regardless of irrigation water type and soil amendment is most likely due to the natural rhizosphere acidification processes facilitated by plant roots through various mechanisms fageria and stone 2006 houmani et al 2015 it is also possible that increased carbon c availability from organic matter addition through roots increased microbial activity in soil rootzone higher microbial activity likely increased the partial pressure of co2 pco2 and resulted in the formation of organic and inorganic acids chaganti and crohn 2015 wong et al 2009 which caused reductions in soil ph over time application of s along with gypsum also significantly reduced soil ph overtime this could be mostly attributed to sulfur as gypsum is a neutral salt and will not cause soil acidification also reduction in soil ph was much more pronounced in the upper layers of the soil profile than deeper depths in gs plots regardless of depth reductions in soil ph in gs treatments averaged 0 9 units compared to 0 6 unit reduction in na plots over a two year period application of elemental s is known to cause soil acidity by its microbial oxidation to sulfate so4 2 and subsequent formation of sulfuric acid germida and janzen 1993 goulding 2016 moreover dissolution of native caco3 and in situ gypsum formation in calcareous soils after s additions likely increased divalent cation availability in soil solution dominance of divalent cations at the diffuse double layer is shown to reduce soil solution ph due to the formation neutral ionic pairs essington 2015 nevertheless decrease in soil ph has important implications in nutrient availability for plants especially for calcareous soils like those seen in this study 3 3 2 soil salinity ece changes in soil salinity overtime after application of different qualities of water and soil amendments are presented in fig 4 effects of growth year water types and soil amendment treatments on soil salinity were all significant table 5 also the interactive effects of year x water type and year x amendment were statistically significant table 5 irrigating with either fw or ww significantly reduced soil salinity over time in the na plots that did not receive gypsum and s soil salinities observed in the surface layer at the end of the experiment were lower than baseline soils and almost equilibrated with the salinity of the irrigation water on the other hand soil salinity changes in the 15 30 cm depth followed a mixed trend over time these results indicate that both fw and ww can be used to leach salts from the soil profile without any amendment application whereas in the gypsum and s amended plots soil salinity significantly increased in 2017 and then decreased in 2018 with salinity dropping closer to baseline levels at both the depths in fw irrigated plots the same trend was observed in the ww irrigated plots but the changes in soil salinity levels were much higher than the fw plots this specific trend of initial spike in soil salinity in the first year followed by salinity reduction in the second year observed in gs plots can be attributed to solubilization of gypsum salt and subsequent redistribution or leaching into lower depths as time progressed irrespective of amendment application irrigating with ww generally increased soil salinity compared to fw irrigation this is a common result reported in literature and is attributed to higher dissolved salt concentrations in ww bedbabis et al 2014 elgallal et al 2016 erel et al 2019 ganjegunte et al 2018a gharaibeh et al 2016 muyen et al 2011 which is also the case in this study table 1 results also indicate that in most treatment combinations subsurface soil salinity was higher than surface soil salinity though the differences were not statistically significant this is due to leaching of salts from upper layers into deeper layers after irrigation most importantly increase in soil salinities with either ww irrigation or gypsum s application did not cause any significant yield reductions in sorghum biomass this can be attributed to higher salinity tolerance of sorghum 6 8 ds m 1 francois et al 1984 and the highest salinities observed in this study were still below the general threshold therefore these results indicate that bioenergy sorghum can be successfully grown in arid soils with ww under elevated soil salinity 3 3 3 soil sodicity sar sodicity changes in soil over time are presented in fig 5 effects of year water amendment and depth were all significant table 5 also the interactive effects of year x amendment and year x amendment x depth were statistically significant table 5 results indicate that soil sodicity significantly increased after two years of irrigation either with fw or ww in unamended na plots across both the depths this can be attributed to increased na concentration in soil solution because of na addition through irrigation waters also when the soil solution is diluted by added water there is an increased adsorption of divalent cations onto soil exchange complex at the expense of monovalent cations valence dilution reeve and doering 1966 this increases the concentration of monovalent cations in soil solution especially na the same likely happened in our case when soils were irrigated with fw and ww and thus high sar values in na plots soil sar increased by 18 and 57 at 0 15 cm and by 61 and 31 at 15 30 cm depth in fw na and ww na treatments respectively relative to their baseline soil sar s conversely sar decreased in soils that were amended with gypsum s after two years of irrigation with either fw or ww reductions in soil sar in gs plots can be attributed to chemical enrichment of ca2 in soil solution relative to na due to solubilization of gypsum in soil water also higher ca2 concentrations in soil solution solubilized na from exchange sites and enabled its loss through leaching thus causing reductions in sar our results concur with previous studies who reported similar reductions in soil sar upon addition of gypsum or s to soil amezketa et al 2005 chaganti et al 2015 g k ganjegunte et al 2018b rasouli et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 nevertheless soil sar was reduced by 54 and 14 in fw gs and ww gs treatments respectively compared to their respective baseline soil sar s at the surface layer however sar reduction with time as seen at the surface layer was observed only in the fw gs treatment at the 15 30 cm depth sar in fact increased overtime in the ww gs treatment at the same subsurface depth also subsurface soils 15 30 cm were generally found to have significantly higher sar values compared to surface soils 0 15 cm fig 4 this can be attributed to increased solution concentration of na due to its accumulation in the lower layers as a result of leaching from surface layer also soil sodicity was always significantly higher in ww irrigated plots compared to fw plots in both na and gs plots in 2017 and 2018 this is an expected result as ww has higher na concentration compared to fresh water table 1 assouline et al 2016 bedbabis et al 2014 tahtouh et al 2019 overall these results indicate that irrigation with either fw and ww can cause soil sodification in the absence of amendments with ww irrigation having a greater potential to increase sodicity hazard therefore it is ideal to include gypsum application in the management practice especially when irrigating with ww on marginal lands 4 conclusions significant sorghum biomass yield differences were not observed between ww and fw irrigation over two years of this study biomass yields obtained with ww irrigation in our study were comparable to yields obtained through freshwater irrigation reported in the literature however biomass quality showed a mixed trend overtime when irrigated with different quality waters holocellulose and lignin concentrations decreased and ash content increased in biomass over time this result can be attributed to the indirect effects of changes in soil quality by wastewater irrigation decreased holocellulose and increased ash concentrations in sorghum biomass are not likely beneficial in terms of efficiency of biochemical conversion processes in bioenergy production however more long term studies are needed to understand these changes in sorghum biomass quality as a function of soil quality dynamics following wastewater irrigation soil quality changes were more apparent due to irrigation with different quality waters and application of gypsum and sulfur soil ph decreased overtime regardless of irrigation water quality and is attributable to natural soil acidification processes and application of s soil salinity decreased overtime and equilibrated with water ec in unamended plots but salinity increased in gypsum and s treated plots it is important here to highlight that sorghum biomass yield reductions were not observed under increased soil salinity conditions this is likely due to the fact that highest salinity values observed during the study were lower than the salinity tolerance threshold of sorghum results show that irrigation with wastewater increased soil sar but application of gypsum significantly reduced that effect this indicates that wastewater irrigation can increase soil sodification hazard and negatively impact soil quality in the absence of an amendment to counteract the effects of sodium in wastewater overall the results from this two year field study highlight that treated wastewaters can be successfully used to irrigate bioenergy crops such as sorghum in arid regions of west texas without significant yield compromises however necessary soil management practices should be in place to negate the detrimental effects of wastewater on soil quality when used continuously on long term basis these results have important implications in diversifying cropping systems in arid lands and sustaining their agricultural productivity this also shows the potential for expanding acreage of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock production for bioenergy into arid lands of southwestern u s most importantly increased wastewater reuse for agricultural irrigation in these regions

10794,uncertainties in the estimation of evapotranspiration et1 using the crop coefficient kc reference et method arise for deeply rooted crops and severe water stress we expanded upon the crop coefficient based model by modifying plant available water via a nonuniform root distribution that limited deep water extraction using daily estimated soil profile water contents the model was calibrated to predict maize zea mays l et over a wide range in crop water deficits in addition maize grain yield was calibrated with model predicted et using a multiplicative water production function the calibrated model with optimized crop and stress response coefficients predicted actual maize et for a wide range in water deficits with a daily and growing season prediction root mean square error rmse of 1 16 mm d 1 and 25 6 mm respectively a nonuniform root distribution functioned similarly to stress response coefficients reducing soil water extraction deeper in the profile with a resultant 18 reduction in the prediction rmse compared with the optimized stress response conventionally used with the kc approach the largest uncertainties in predicted crop et resulted from an underestimation of runoff and an overestimation of crop water use during stress induced early senescence measured and predicted soil water contents averaged over the entire rooting depth agreed closely however root water extraction was overestimated deeper in the profile calibration of the water production function using data exhibiting a wide range in measured grain yield resulted in a rmse of 2 1 mg ha 1 including an additive high temperature stress response expression improved the calibration because of the limited input requirements and robustness over a wide range in crop water stress levels the

high plains aquifer this region associated with the southern half of the aquifer has experienced the greatest declines in saturated thickness that has resulted in a concomitant reduction in well pumping capacities for irrigation mcguire et al 2003 mcguire 2014 as a consequence of reduced availability of freshwater and increasing competition among users irrigators are being forced to reassess how much water is allocated to crops so as to optimize productivity maize zea mays l is one of the major irrigated crops in the southern u s great plains and has the greatest seasonal irrigation requirements and sensitivity to water deficits howell et al 1996 colaizzi et al 2009 xue et al 2017 considerable reductions in maize grain yield are often realized as a result of marginal well capacities and corresponding irrigation allocations that fail to meet crop water requirements during critical growth stages moreover pre plant water allocation decisions are made in the face of the uncertainty in estimating seasonal and peak crop water requirements that vary considerably from year to year and regionally undoubtedly the optimization of productivity under these conditions requires an accurate assessment of crop yield under a wide range in water stress levels accurate models of crop development and yield in response to water are instrumental in evaluating irrigation strategies to optimize water productivity of equal importance is the ability to accurately estimate root zone soil water contents to correctly infer plant available water calibrate effects of water deficits on crop water use and to make appropriate real time water management decisions bell et al 2019 since its publication the fao 56 crop coefficient reference et approach allen et al 1998 based largely on the fao 24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 method has gained widespread use in estimating crop water requirements owing to its intuitiveness and simplicity and because of its demonstrated robustness and transferability to range of environments pereira et al 2014 early on it was demonstrated that at the onset of water stress in plants transpiration rate should be approximately proportional to the available soil water content gardner and ehlig 1963 this concept was incorporated into crop et estimation for non standard conditions in fao 56 such that below a threshold soil water content transpiration declines linearly with root zone water depletion as a result of stomatal closure the threshold value was crop specific and also dependent on potential evapotranspiration this approach has been shown to function satisfactorily and produce reasonable estimates of actual crop et as used in the mopeco model domínguez et al 2011 for several crops and as assessed by lyra et al 2016 with maize especially when stress coefficients were adapted to local conditions because stress thresholds and response functions are directly based on soil water depletion it is particularly important that root elongation be considered during the growing season e g smith 2008 domínguez et al 2011 to avoid an overestimation of plant available soil water during the vegetative stage however in soils with horizon dependent retention properties and deeply rooted 1 m crops using a rooting zone averaged permanent wilting point and field capacity to evaluate available water can lead to errors in estimating crop et in addition root proliferation deeper in the soil profile is considerably less than near the surface moroke et al 2005 which renders much of the deep water inaccessible and consequently plant available water is overestimated under these circumstances bell et al 2019 calibration of the crop coefficients kc for fao 56 to determine the et of a non stressed crop e g piccinni et al 2009 trout and dejonge 2018 is relatively straightforward because irrigation only need to be scheduled to ensure that plant available soil water is non limiting the calibration of the stress response coefficients is challenging because the resultant function must apply to a wide range in levels of plant available water and atmospheric demands which vary throughout the season and from year to year failure to include both stressed and non stressed conditions will result in optimized parameters that lack robustness and exhibit difficulties with identifiability the importance of hydrological model calibrations using multiple field data sets has long been recognized mcmillan et al 2011 yet in practice most calibrations of crop water use models are carried out on a single field and typically only for a single growing season calibrations that encompass multiple fields or locations over a wide range in crop water stress levels for more than a single growing season maximize the information content and hence robustness of the optimization our objectives were to i expand upon the fao 56 method crop et estimation that accounts for nonuniform root distribution with depth ii calibrate and test the model using multiple fields years under a wide range of water deficits and management conditions for maize production and iii use the calibrated crop et model to calibrate and evaluate maize water production functions suitable for use in the texas high plains our overall model development goal was to use a minimum parameter set to simulate soil water contents throughout the profile as modified by water extraction by roots yet calculate et in a manner that is consistent with the conventional fao 56 method moreover introduction of soil water contents in the simulation provides a way to integrate the model with real time monitoring of soil water contents and thereby facilitate the integration or fusion of these measurements with reference et for improved irrigation scheduling

hoffman and van genuchten 1983 is used to simulate reduced available soil water at deeper depths β1 z and modify the distribution of soil water extraction throughout the profile β2 z the parameter f

h 3 and h 4 are assumed equal to soil water potentials at field capacity 0 033 mpa and permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa respectively the sink term being used herein is employed to distribute the water uptake equivalent to etc eq 1 throughout the profile rather than directly calculate the magnitude of the water uptake for a particular layer nonetheless it influences crop water stress vis à vis feedback associated with the summation of plant available water likewise influenced by the rooting fraction and depth herein the generalized sink term of feddes and raats 2004 has been simplified and does not consider the dependence of h 3 on the magnitude of transpiration in addition potential declines in water uptake very near saturation as a result of limited oxygen diffusion to roots is not considered soil water potential h for the evaluation of the sink term is calculated with the van genucthen 1980 relationship 13 θ h θ s θ r 1 α v g h n v g 1 1 n v g with the shape parameter nvg as an input variable and the residual water content θr and shape parameter αvg uniquely evaluated given a knowledge of the water contents at 0 033 mpa and 1 5 mpa likewise an exponential function 14 θ h c exp h γ can be used to approximate the sink function again with the parameters c and γ uniquely determined given a knowledge of the water contents at 0 033 mpa and 1 5 mpa the two sink term functions based on eqs 13 and 14 can vary considerably with respect to soil water content fig 1 2 4 irrigation precipitation and runoff net irrigation describing the potential average change in the depth of stored soil water from an overhead irrigation event in is estimated as 15 i n i g a e i i g d 0 i g a e i d 0 a e i d 0 i g d 0 where ig is gross irrigation application depth aei is the fractional value of the irrigation application efficiency that accounts for losses resulting from evaporation of water droplets wind drift canopy interception and evaporation from depression storage and d 0 is a minimum threshold gross application depth for achieving aei the threshold depth permits an accounting for the low application efficiencies observed with shallow application depths using overhead sprinklers wiersma 1963 because aei does not consider losses from deep drainage and runoff these processes are handled separately and based on daily soil water contents net irrigation depth is added as soil water to fillable pore space θs θ to achieve saturation in successively deeper soil layers up to a maximum depth of zf any remaining balance of in is added to the runoff component runoff depth r from daily precipitation depth p was calculated using the original curve number approach rallison 1980 16 r p i a 2 p i a s i p i a 0 p i a where ia is the depth of initial abstraction mm to account for depression storage and si is the potential retention due to soil water storage or infiltration whichever is the least herein we assume no relationship between ia and si and for conditions of limiting soil water storage si is defined as 17 s i 0 z f θ s θ d z describing si without the use of the scs curve numbers permits an adaptive assessment of runoff governed by the level of soil water saturation and hence sensitive to levels of irrigation e g schneider and howell 2000 as with irrigation precipitation less calculated runoff is added as soil water to fillable pore space θs θ to achieve saturation in successively deeper soil layers up to a maximum depth of zf 2 5 redistribution and drainage redistribution of soil water in the profile is described by an exponential drainage function adapted from raes 2004 18 δ θ j δ t τ θ j θ f c j exp θ j θ f c j 1 exp θ s j θ f c j 1 θ j θ f c 0 θ j θ f c where τ is a dimensionless rate constant 0 τ 1 and δθ j is the change in water content per unit time t d in layer j characterized by an initial water content field capacity and saturated water content specific to that layer flux q mm d 1 out of each layer is calculated as 19 q j δ θ j δ t δ z j where δz j is layer thickness mm and q j is the flux mm d 1 out of the layer j subject to the constraint that daily flux cannot exceed the sum of fillable pore space and flux out of the underlying layer only downward flux is considered the boundary at the soil surface is a zero flux condition and daily flow out of the lowermost layer is considered as drainage d eq 18 has been modified to better represent the nonlinearity of hydraulic conductivity as water content declines this was achieved by replacing the expression prior to the exponential function from θ fc θ s to θ θ s in this case the solution for the calculation of the change in soil water content associated with a given flux was not closed form and was approximated using a root finding algorithm further details of the method are described by raes 2004 2 6 calculation procedure the algorithm used to evaluate daily crop evapotranspiration was implemented in matlab mathworks natick ma 1 1 the use of trade firm

agriculture or the agricultural research service of any product or service to the exclusion of others that may be suitable beginning each day net irrigation less runoff was used to update soil water contents in the profile and then followed by similar procedure for precipitation after updating soil water contents in the surface through additions from irrigation and precipitation redistribution of soil water was calculated and thereafter plant available soil water content was evaluated to estimate etc at the conclusion of each day soil water extraction by roots was used to update the soil water content profile the calculations of the above hydrological components ensured that the following mass balance equation is preserved for the domain with soil depth z z 20 0 z θ t i 1 z θ t i z d z p i n e t c r d z throughout the simulation period 2 7 crop water production function the empirical crop water production function based on the work of stewart et al 1977 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 that considers water deficits at different crop growth stages in a multiplicative relationship rao et al 1988 domínguez et al 2012a was used to calculate predicted yields yp 21 y p y m j 1 n y 1 k y j ϕ e t c e t m j where ym is maximum attainable crop yield ky is the crop yield response factor by growing stage j and ny is the number of growth stages herein we consider that maximum dry matter production may be achieved at etc etm φ that is less than unity such that eq 21 is subject to the restriction 22 e t c e t m j min e t c e t m j ϕ this expression accounts for environments and practices that cause the development of surface conditions at high levels of irrigation or precipitation that are subject to enhanced soil water evaporation losses that do not contribute to yield and consequently results in more realistic values of ym when based on extrapolation of measured yields in the field using production functions 3 materials and methods 3 1 description of field experiments the water use and yield model was calibrated and evaluated using four experimental studies of maize response to water deficits table 1 at the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory

evaporative demand class a pan averages 2600 mm with 67 and 58 occurring respectively from may to september the experimental fields for the three studies are located adjacent to each other on pullman clay loam fine mixed superactive thermic torrertic paleustoll with 1 slope the ap horizon of the pullman soil 0 0 0 15 m is noncalcareous with a clay content of 380 g kg 1 and is underlain by a deep

texture and up to 50 calcium carbonates unger and pringle 1981 in each of the experimental fields irrigation was applied with three span lateral move sprinkler systems model 6000 valmont irrigation valley ne drop hoses spaced 1 52 m apart were equipped with low drift nozzles extractable nutrients determined in soil samples collected in the spring prior to planting were used to determine n and p fertilizer application rates most of the nitrogen was applied by fertigation through the lateral move sprinkler neutron moisture gages model 503dr instrotek inc raleigh nc were used to determine soil water contents from 0 1 to 2 3 m depth in 0 2 m increments at 6 to 14 day intervals throughout the growing season all studies used a depth control stand to ensure that the source was centered at the intended measurement depth evett et al 2003 each of the neutron probes used in these studies were previously calibrated in 2002 using methods described by evett and steiner 1995 with separate equations for the a bt and btk horizons because of the need to obtain accurate estimates of changes in soil water content treatments other than irrigation rates were pooled for a given year when there were small or insignificant differences in crop water use and grain yield solar irradiance wind speed air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and barometric pressure were measured at an adjacent weather station located on an irrigated cool season grass surface and described by howell et al 1995 precipitation was measured with tipping bucket rain gages also over the grass surface and adjacent to one of the study locations a summary of the climatic conditions for each study is provided in table 2 reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated from monitored variables using the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for a short reference crop at a 24 h time step allen et al 2005 although eto calculations using hourly time steps are preferred irmak et al 2005 a 24 h time step was used because of its wide availability for real time applications and because it was considered sufficiently accurate for purposes of irrigation scheduling comparison of hourly and 24 h calculations during the 2016 growing season yielded a calibration rmse of 0 77 mm 3 d 1 3 day periods ratios of mean 24 h eto to daily sums of hourly eto of 1 03 and a slope of 1 007 in the four year study by baumhardt et al 2013 irrigation and tillage effects on maize soil water use and grain yield were examined within a wheat corn fallow crop rotation within a strip split plot design with three replications per treatment combination tillage treatments consisted of disk tillage stubble mulch tillage and no tillage that were implemented primarily during fallow periods following wheat and after maize harvest irrigation applications of 25 or 50 mm depth were applied in 10 day intervals to represent the limited pumping capacities of the regions maize pioneer 33b54 du pont pioneer hi bred int johnston ia with a relative hybrid maturity crm of 113 was planted during mid may in 0 76 m rows to achieve a target population of 9 plants m 2 for the purposes of this study we evaluated water use and yield pooled among the tillage treatments for the 2007 2008 and 2009 growing seasons noting that mean differences in seasonal water use between no tillage and disk tillage varied by 21 mm the 2006 study year was omitted from this evaluation because infrequent soil water content measurements curtailed an accurate assessment of crop water use additional details of the field operations crop development and harvest yield components for this study are provided by baumhardt et al 2013 the study carried out by colaizzi et al 2011 in 2009 and 2010 evaluated water use and maize grain yields obtained using mid elevation mesa and low elevation lesa spray application methods within a strip split plot design each application method was evaluated at 25 50 75 and 100 of full crop water requirements in addition water use and yield were evaluated under dryland conditions with supplemental irrigation to permit crop establishment for the purpose of this study the mesa and lesa treatments were pooled because within irrigation level crop water use and yield did not significantly differ in each of the study years irrigation was applied in 25 4 mm depth increments to the 100 level and at proportionately smaller depths to the remaining treatments by increasing the speed of the lateral move maize pioneer 33b54 du pont pioneer hi bred int johnston ia was planted on the last day of april 2009 and mid may 2010 in 0 76 m rows that achieved measured populations of 8 4 plants m 2 additional details of this study can be found in colaizzi et al 2011 in 2014 maize water use and grain yield were evaluated in response to managed allowed plant available soil water depletion levels of 20 and 40 within a strip plot design and six replicates per treatment schwartz unpublished

and standard crop coefficients to update soil water levels on a daily basis approximately 20 days after emergence v3 to v4 furrow dikes were installed to control runoff of irrigation and precipitation excess irrigation was applied in 25 4 mm depth increments except on three occasions when only 12 7 mm was applied to avoid over filling the basins which had reduced capacity during the latter part of the growing season as a result of dike erosion maize pioneer 1151am du pont pioneer hi bred int johnston ia with a crm of 111 was planted on 20 may 2014 in 0 76 m rows that achieved measured populations at harvest of 9 6 plants m 2 maize grain yields were based on three 1 5 m2 hand samples two 1 52 m rows 1 m harvested from each of the six replicates growing season precipitation was above average for the 2014 season and totaled 524 mm with daily totals exceeding 40 mm on four occasions because of significant runoff problems observed in plots associated with the 20 depletion level treatment we have restricted our evaluation herein to the 40 depletion level treatment a study was initiated in 2016 to examine irrigation and plant population levels on grain yield of three maize cultivars two of which were labeled as drought tolerant schwartz and bell unpublished results experimental plots were arranged within a strip split plot design with two irrigation levels on main plots and three cultivars two populations randomized within subplots and three replications per treatment combination imposed irrigation treatments were based on pumping capacities restricted to 84 7 m3 ha 1 d 1 25 4 mm 3 d 1 or 42 3 m3 ha 1 d 1 25 4 mm 6 d 1 irrigation was applied with low elevation 0 46 m spray application using low drift nozzle ldn spray heads senninger irrigation inc orlando fl regulated at 69 kpa for a discharge rate of 0 32 l s 1 furrow dikes were constructed at the v3 stage to reduce runon and runoff within the field the prescribed application rates of 25 4 mm every third or sixth day was maintained unless stored soil water in the 0 1 4 m profile exceeded 85 plant available water at field capacity under these circumstances irrigation was withheld until water contents dropped below this threshold three maize hybrids dekalb dkc 62 27 dgvt2pro and dkc62 98 vt2pro monsanto inc st louis mo and pioneer p1151hr with crm s of 112 112 and 111 respectively were planted on 7 may 2016 under conventional tillage planting was on 0 76 m rows that achieved measured populations at harvest of 7 9 and 9 9 plants m 2 for the two plant population treatments grain was sampled by hand on four 1 m 1 52 m 2 rows subplots per replication growing season precipitation during 2016 was near normal 253 mm although a 20 day period extending from 4 to 23 jul that included the pollination stage had a mean eto that exceeded 9 1 mm d 1 in conjunction with negligible 0 4 mm precipitation that imposed considerable water stress on the crop under both irrigation regimes from mid august to early september four precipitation events totaling 125 mm combined with low eto mean 4 1 mm d 1 were adequate for crop water requirements for much of the remainder of the growing season seasonal crop water use was significantly influenced only by irrigation rate p 0 05 maize grain yields averaged 16 48 mg ha 1 at the 25 4 mm 3 d 1 irrigation rate among the three cultivars two planting populations with no significant treatment differences at the 25 4 mm 6 d 1 irrigation rate grain yields were significantly influenced by population but not hybrid with mean pooled yields of 7 48 and 5 27 mg ha 1 for the 7 9 and 9 9 plants m 2 populations respectively for the aims of this research and because of the lack of significant water use and yield responses among cultivars we evaluated mean water use and mean yields of all cultivars populations at the 25 4 mm 3 d 1 irrigation level and all cultivars 7 9 plants m 2 population at the 25 4 mm 6 d 1 irrigation level 3 2 estimation of actual crop et actual evapotranspiration of crops eta to be distinguished from calculated values using crop coefficients etc was estimated based on soil water balance evaluations using neutron probe measurements and pertinent precipitation irrigation and runoff fluxes cumulative eta for a period of n days and bracketed by neutron probe measurements from t i and extending to t i n can be written as 23 i t i t i n e t a t 0 z r i n θ n p t i z θ w p z d z 0 z r i n θ n p t i n z θ w p z d z i t i t i n p t i t i t i n i n t i t i t i n r t where θ np is the water content measurement at time t and depth z and zr i n is the rooting depth on day t i n here drainage or upward flow at zr i n is assumed negligible for the time period between measurements which was evident by the insignificant increase in soil water contents below 1 5 m for the experimental studies used to calibrate and evaluate modeled etc runoff is estimated using the algorithm during the optimization procedure and inserted in the above eq 23 to refine estimates of eta daily eta mm d 1 was estimated as 24 e t a k c e t o where k c is the mean measured crop coefficient over the period fig 2 25 k c i t i t i n e t a t i t i t i n e t o t to permit the implementation of the optimization procedure and subsequently subdivision of crop et into growth stages associated with kc and ky that do not coincide with the neutron probe measurement intervals initial water contents at planting were calculated by assuming that k c 0 3 prior to the first neutron probe readings which generally were completed two to three weeks after planting 3 3 model parameterization daily eto precipitation and irrigation depth mm and initial soil water contents are the necessary inputs to initialize the model identification of the periods of the growing season associated with crop coefficients for water use and yield determination and root elongation were identified by growing degree days gdd required to reach several crop developmental stages fig 3 the specific periods associated with the yield response factors were based on those identified by domínguez et al 2012b growing degree days were evaluated using a 10 c base temperature and an upper temperature threshold of 30 c using method 2 of mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 the gdd after planting to attain the specific crop growth stages infrequently varied by more than two days with respect to visual observations noting that maize hybrids had a narrow range in crm 111 113 appearance of silk r1 occurred either simultaneously or within a day of tasseling vt for these hybrids we chose to end model simulations at a gdd accumulation of 1675 c that corresponds to harvest maturity when grain moisture content was at most 25 nielsen 2012 for these hybrids this avoids difficulties in crop water use estimation extending long after physiological maturity to indeterminate harvest dates that can vary considerably because of slow or delayed losses in grain moisture we assumed root growth began at emergence at a depth of z 0 and maximum rooting depth zrm was attained at vt water retention at permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa and field capacity 0 033 mpa for each depth increment of neutron probe measurements table 3 were based on previous studies musick and sletten 1966 moroke 2002 schwartz et al 2003 bell 2014 tolk and evett 2012 the maximum rooting depth zrm was set equivalent to 1 4 m because there was little or no evidence of water extraction at greater depths in measured profiles of soil water content during the growing season based on these retention measurements plant available water soil water at field capacity for the entire profile to 1 4 m is 174 mm and agrees closely with the 167 mm in the 1 47 m profile measured by unger and pringle 1981 for the pullman clay loam because some horizons within the pullman clay loam can remain above field capacity for extended periods because of slow drainage rates unger and pringle 1981 inclusion of half of the water between field capacity and saturation fp 0 5 as per eq 6 implies a potential depth of 233 mm as plant available a tabulation of model parameters is provided in table 4 the water stress coefficients etb and pb were set equivalent to 4 mm d 1 and 0 4 respectively except for model runs using the default fao 56 values of 5 mm d 1 and 0 55 for maize allen et al 1998 soil water extraction was described using the sink function described by van genuchten 1980 retention with a shape parameter nvg of 1 25 schwartz and evett 2002 maximum root uptake rates smax were set equivalent to 0 015 m3 m 3 d 1 at soil depths greater than 0 2 m and to 0 030 m3 m 3 d 1 at shallower soil depths hoogland et al 1981 irrigation application efficiency aei was assumed to be 0 9 howell 2003 with a minimum application depth d 0 of 25 4 mm and efficiencies declining for lower depths as per eq 15 intitial abstraction ia for runoff calculations was set equivalent to 15 mm and the soil depth zf was fixed at 0 2 m to estimate the potential storage si after initial abstraction redistribution of soil water via eq 18 was estimated using a spatial discretization δz of 0 2 m and τ 0 34 which was found to approximate soil water profiles predicted using ver 4 08 of hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 with an initially saturated profile to 0 2 m and water contents at field capacity at lower depths raes 2004 provides an approximation to estimate τ from saturated hydraulic conductivities however we note that the solution eq 18 for a given τ is scale dependent and consequently redistribution rates vary with δz 3 4 optimization our paradigm to obtain a consistent parameterization of crop water stress response warrants a simultaneous optimization of crop water use over treatments site years representing a wide range in water deficit levels this avoids fitting crop coefficients and stress factors for a given crop year or water deficit level that usually results in non robust solutions in this vein we selected the data of baumhardt et al 2013 in 2007 and the 2014 schwartz unpublished results and 2016 schwartz and bell unpublished results field data consisting of five site years to calibrate the model table 1 these specific data sets were selected because soil water balance meteorological and crop development information were computed and compiled prior to the other data sets the remaining data in baumhardt et al 2013 and colaizzi et al 2011 consisting of 14 additional treatment site years was used to test the calibrations the entire data set consists of estimated eta ranging from 307 to 773 mm seasonal water use fractions eta etm from 0 41 to 0 93 and grain yields from 0 to 19 mg ha 1 table 1 crop coefficients and stress parameters were first optimized to predict etc and subsequently these optimized parameters were used to optimize the production function with measured yields five parameters were considered for optimizing crop et table 4 through the minimization of the objective function 26 φ β χ 1 n m n p i 1 n p w i j 1 m e t a χ i j e t c β χ i j 2 σ i j 2 where β is the vector of np optimized parameters χ represents the vectors of independent variables e g eto in p etc σ2 is the variance associated with measurement errors n is the number of site treatment years evaluated and m is the number of days associated with eta records from planting until the final neutron probe measurements a homoscedastic variance was assumed because of the difficulty in assessing error originating from multiple sources e g runoff and soil water balance here w is a weight which was used to i ensure that each site treatment year was weighted equally independent of the number of days m and ii weight the two deficit irrigation treatments baumhardt et al 2013 1 5 times greater than the three other site years so as to normalize variance among irrigation treatment levels and avoid biasing optimizations towards high levels of irrigation due to the manner in which the values of daily kc are calculated throughout the growing season all three cannot be simultaneously optimized because of the inherent interdependencies of coefficients we chose not to optimize the crop coefficient for the mid season growth stage kc mid and set it to the default fao 56 value of 1 20 this permits the optimization of kc ini and kc end which are independent of one another the remaining parameters for the crop water use optimization could be fitted without such constraints an iterative procedure was used to estimate runoff because it could not be evaluated directly in the estimation of eta daily runoff estimated using optimized crop water use parameters was subtracted from daily precipitation and eta was recalculated the model was re optimized using the updated values of eta to obtain updated parameter estimates after two iterations runoff and hence eta and etc values remained stable 0 2 mm and the resultant daily eta values were used for all further optimization runs we examined four optimization scenarios to assess if additional parameters conceptualizing processes not considered by fao 56 would improve crop water use predictions these scenarios included i the original fao 56 with fitted crop coefficients kc ini and kc end and the stress response coefficient δ ii same as scenario i but with a baseline stress response fraction pb 0 4 rather than 0 55 typically recommended for maize iii same as scenario ii but with a fitted ε to account for nonlinearity of the water stress function and iv same as scenario iii but with a fitted f that applies a nonuniform root distribution a matlab function implementing the levenberg marquardt algorithm press et al 1992 was used to minimize the objective function eq 26 with a convergence criterion of 1 10 4 for parameter estimates and 1 10 2 for the objective function optimizations were repeated several times using a range of starting parameters to ensure that a global minimum was attained within realistic parameter values parameters of the crop production function eq 21 were optimized by means of minimization of the objective function 27 φ y β χ i 1 n y y p β χ i 2 σ i 2 where y is measured yield β is the vector of optimized parameters χ represents the independent variable i e etc etm for each of the growth periods associated with the yield response factors and σ2 is the variance associated with measurement errors which is assumed homoscedastic only parameters ym and ky 2 were optimized for the calibration data because of the insensitivity of the predicted yield to yield response factors of the other growth periods in this case ky 1 ky 3 and ky 4 were set equivalent to the nominal values provided in table 4 for optimizations using both the calibration and test data the objective function was more sensitive to ky 1 and ky 3 and in this case we only optimized ym ky 1 and ky 2 with the conditions that ky 3 ky 1 and ky 4 ½ ky 1 based on yield component coefficients for maize reported by domínguez et al 2012b and because for the evaluation herein ky 1 tended to converge to slightly greater values of ky 3 the crop production function was optimized based on crop water use predictions obtained with the four optimization scenarios described previously procedure nlin sas institute 2016 was used to minimize the objective function for yield prediction and bootstrapping was used to evaluate the distributional properties of the parameter estimates 4 results and discussion 4 1 crop water use calibration fitted crop coefficients varied little among the four parameter optimization scenarios for the crop water use calibration data table 5 kc ini averaged 0 317 0 019 whereas kc end averaged 0 524 0 008 when kc mid was set equivalent to the default fao 56 value of 1 20 asymptotic confidence intervals for the crop coefficients ranged between 1 to 4 of the fitted parameter value indicating that parameter identifiability was good even when stress coefficients were fitted simultaneously asymptotic confidence intervals were also narrow 3 to 6 4 of the fitted parameter value for the crop stress coefficients the frequent assumption of negligible runoff used in soil water balance approaches to estimate eta in semiarid environments e g klocke et al 2011 araya et al 2017 trout and dejonge 2018 generated large errors in the estimation of crop coefficients for the studies evaluated herein under fully or nearly fully irrigated treatments in years with significant precipitation events without the inclusion of estimated runoff in the mass balance calculations crop coefficients inferred from measurements attained unrealistic values of 1 73 2014 s 1 71 2010 c 100 and 1 54 2010 c 75 in contrast inclusion of estimated runoff from irrigation and precipitation resulted in estimated crop coefficients that did not exceed 1 30 a value obtained at the early r3 milk growth stage in 2010 under full irrigation 2010 c 100 likewise crop coefficients inferred from measurements did not greatly exceed values of optimized kc values throughout the growing season with the exception of the treatment in the 2016 sb at 25 4 mm 3 d 1 study where kc inferred from eq 25 overestimated the optimized kc by 29 on doy 246 this likely resulted from an underestimation of runoff that occurred during a 53 mm precipitation event received on doy 242 244 in 2016 although the furrow dikes can reduce or eliminate runoff from the field with continued irrigation and rainfall throughout the season the storage capacity of the dikes is reduced schneider and howell 2000 use of the default fao 56 parameters to describe water stress in maize etb 5 mm d 1 pb 0 55 resulted in a larger calibration rmse than the values etb 4 mm d 1and pb 0 4 used for the remaining optimizations in table 5 however optimized values of δ that ranged from 0 035 0 057 d mm 1 bracketed the fao 56 value of 0 04 d mm 1 proposed by allen et al 1998 lyra et al 2016 also found that a δ value of 0 04 d mm 1 with lower values for pb 0 15 and etb 3 mm d 1 were more suitable to estimate maize water use in northeastern brazil the optimized stress coefficient values in this study implies that at an etc of approximately 12 to 14 mm d 1 the stress response function p is approximately zero and consequently a maize crop would experience water stress even when the soil water content is at field capacity a nonlinear stress response optimization iii resulted in a slight improvement in the calibration rmse compared to the linear stress response table 5 lyra et al 2016 observed a lower calibration rmse for crop water use with respect to eta using a linear stress response for maize however they compared this to a logarithmic function of stress response rather than a quadratic function evaluated herein an optimized value of ε of less than unity table 5 optimizations iii and iv implies that the stress response is concave and that the decline in ks becomes increasingly steeper as soil water depletion increases the value of the optimized parameter f describing a nonuniform root distribution table 5 optimization iv implies that only half of the plant available soil water below 0 77 m is accessible by roots inclusion of parameters ε and f in the optimization problem resulted in a calibration rmse of 0 91 mm d 1 for the calibration data 4 2 crop water use prediction using each of the four crop water use calibrations i iv table 5 to predict the 14 treatment site years resulted in prediction rmse s ranging from 1 16 to 1 42 mm d 1 and again the lowest prediction rmse was associated with optimization iv that employed a nonuniform root distribution with depth table 5 overall the prediction rmse s herein are significantly less than rmse s of 1 5 2 0 reported by heng et al 2009 using fao aquacrop steduto et al 2009 to predict maize crop use within a relatively narrow range 760 900 mm at the bushland tx location lower errors in estimated crop water use likely results from the use of a local calibration because of consistently smaller prediction rmse obtained for the calibration using a nonuniform root distribution table 4 optimization iv the remainder of the discussion and results presented pertain to this particular optimization cumulative eta and etc for the calibration and test data figs 4 and 5 show good agreement throughout the growing season with the exception of the 2016 sb data and for dryland treatments 2009 c and 2010 c under extreme water stress as discussed earlier an underestimation of runoff during the latter part of the 2016 season likely resulted in an overestimation of eta that is discernible in fig 4 for both irrigation treatments however because the predicted runoff for etc is essentially the same as eta the observed differences later in the season are a result of the lower predicted crop water use etc reflected as greater stored soil water at the end of the growing season noting that for all the simulations estimated drainage flux out of the root zone was negligible we suspect that the optimization underestimated etc to compensate for underestimated runoff however we note that crop water use etc in a year without large intense precipitation events agreed closely with eta fig 5 2009 c 100 signifying that the parameter values associated with the stress response function p and the non uniform root distribution f were suitable for the conditions at this location and study years another difficulty with optimized etc is the overestimation of water use during the latter part of the growing season exhibited principally by the dryland treatments fig 5 2009 c and 2010 c however this is also reflected in the greater slope of cumulative etc compared with eta in many of the simulations figs 4 and 5 this is undoubtedly a result of the failure of crop coefficients to predict crop senescence at the end of the growing season heng et al 2009 also found that aquacrop steduto et al 2009 a crop et model that includes parameterization for canopy senescence also had difficulty in simulating water use during stress induced early senescence deviations in predicted etc from water balance calculated eta accumulated throughout the growing season extending from planting to harvest maturity was small prediction rmse 25 4 mm with the greatest departure from the 1 1 line fig 6 associated with underestimation of runoff 2016 sb at 25 4 mm 3 d 1 and stress induced early senescence 2009 c dryland 2010 c dryland 2008 b 2 5 mm d 1 using calibrated aquacrop steduto et al 2009 simulations to predict maize water use 470 730 mm in southwest kansas araya et al 2017 obtained a prediction rmse of 82 6 mm for seasonal crop water use araya et al 2017 attributed the somewhat poor agreement between measured and simulated seasonal crop et to an inadequate characterization of canopy development 4 3 stored profile water during the growing season measured and simulated volumetric soil water contents exhibited close agreement over the entire soil profile 0 1 4 m except after significant precipitation events fig 7 2016 sb at 25 4 mm 6 d 1 and later in the growing season during water stress induced canopy senescence fig 7 2010 c 50 the model simulated 35 mm runoff for the 60 mm precipitation event that occurred on doy 188 in 2010 fig 7 that permitted the close approximation of measured profile soil water content following the storm however we note that the ability of the model to correctly predict runoff after large precipitations events varied widely among storms considerable uncertainty in runoff predictions is to be expected when they are based on daily precipitation totals that do not reflect short time scale dynamics of infiltration in response to near surface soil water and rainfall intensity simulated water contents deviated considerably from measured water contents averaged throughout the 0 0 7 m and 0 7 1 4 m depth increments fig 8 at 0 0 7 m a portion of this divergence is generated by the algorithm that adds infiltrated water into each layer of the profile until saturated and also by the empirical function eq 18 used to redistribute water in the profile overestimation of the soil water contents in the 0 0 7 m depth increment did not occur until after the maize established full canopy cover fig 8 suggesting that the use of et rather than t in the sink term eq 10 had little influence on the profile water distribution likely because of uncertainties in the redistribution function soil water content distributions simulated by eq 18 were characterized by steeper gradients compared with neutron probe measured water contents not shown because of these departures from measured water contents comparison of soil water contents at finer depth increments is not meaningful soil water depletion resulting from root uptake at the 0 7 1 4 m depth increment could be discerned in both measured and simulated treatments that were exposed to moderate water stress fig 8 in all the cases where this was discernible the rate of simulated water extraction exceeded that measured using the neutron probe simulations that employed a uniform root distribution f 1 rather than the optimized value of f 0 55 resulted in greater deviations between simulated and measured apparent root water uptake whereas setting f 0 14 the lower limit for z 0 0 2 improved predictions fig 8 a further improvement in the agreement between predicted and measured water extraction at the 0 7 1 4 m depth increment could be obtained using the exponential soil water retention function eq 14 to evaluate h θ within the sink term fig 8 these results suggest that the model overestimated the sink term at deeper depths at the expense of reduced root water uptake nearer to the surface although these changes in the root sink term reduced deviations between predicted and measured soil water contents at this lower depth increment they increased prediction errors associated with estimation of the total profile soil water content further evaluation of the disparity between measured and simulated soil water contents at the 0 7 1 4 m depth increment indicated that it was not related to the specification of a 1 4 m maximum rooting depth which was corroborated by neutron probe measurements in all but the most severely water stressed treatments 2009 c 25 and dryland 2010 c dryland in addition increasing the water content associated with the permanent wilting point in the bt horizon resulted in simulations that reduced the deviation between predicted and measured final water contents in the 0 7 1 4 m depth increment but had the undesirable effect of generating larger errors in estimated profile water content due to reduced eta lastly increasing simulated redistribution rates by increasing the value of τ to 0 76 did not alter the pattern of root extraction nor did it greatly increase the soil water content at this depth increment it is important to recognize that the sink term inherently assumes that soil water potential equilibrium is achieved within an entire discretization layer each day following water extraction by roots and hence localized regions at large negative water potentials near the root hair are not preserved e g gardner 1960 as such fitted parameter values are misleading in a physical sense as a consequence of the approximations used to describe macroscopic root water uptake skaggs et al 2006 nonetheless using a nonuniform root distribution with macroscopic root water uptake was more successful in imposing water stress compared with conventional fao 56 water stress parameterization 4 4 crop water production functions optimizations of the water production function to estimate grain yield using the four crop water use calibrations table 5 resulted in low calibration rmse s 0 24 0 59 mg ha 1 and asymptotic confidence intervals for ky 2 and ym of approximately 4 and 2 of the fitted parameter value respectively however in contrast to the crop water use calibration use of the calibrated production function to predict grain yields for the test data overestimated all yields by an average of 3 4 mg ha 1 and consequently did not result in reliable yield estimates prediction rmse 3 9 mg ha 1 this outcome signifies that optimizations using a larger observational data set are required to obtain a robust parameterization of the water production function to predict realistic grain yields in this environment recognizing these limitations observational data consisting of all treatment site years were used to develop grain yield calibrations for the production function using crop water use parameterizations iii and iv table 5 ym ky 1 and ky 2 with the conditions that ky 3 ky 1 and ky 4 ½ ky 1 were optimized using all treatment site years with the exception of 2010 c at the 100 irrigation rate grain yields at this level of irrigation 15 1 mg ha 1 were not significantly greater than the 75 irrigation level possibly because of limiting nitrogen availability anaerobic conditions that reduced oxygen transport to roots or because the genetic yield potential of the hybrid pioneer 33b54 was less than the hybrids used in 2014 and 2016 noting that maximum irrigated yields reported in the region were approximately 16 mg ha 1 kansas state university 2005 at lower irrigation rates this hybrid performed similarly to those hybrids planted in 2014 and 2016 optimizations using the remaining 18 treatment site years resulted in calibration rmse s of 2 1 mg ha 1 and model efficiencies of 0 87 0 88 for both crop water use parameterizations iii and iv table 6 fig 9 bootstrap evaluations of fitted parameters showed that for all optimizations ky 1 and ym were approximately normally distributed whereas ky 2 was negatively skewed based on the bootstrap constructed 95 confidence intervals only ky 2 and ym differed significantly from zero whereas yield predictions were relatively insensitive to ky1 indicating that there was insufficient information to estimate ky 1 along with ky 3 and ky 4 domínguez et al 2012a had similar problems optimizing ky 1 and attributed this yield insensitivity to the lack of water stress conditions during the vegetative growth stage optimized values of maximum yield of 19 4 19 9 mg ha 1 table 6 are comparable to the potential yield of 20 mg ha 1 adjusted for 15 5 moisture content estimated for the southern tolk et al 2016 and central grassini et al 2009 u s great plains the fitted parameter values of the yield response coefficients during the early reproductive stage ky 2 were 1 55 and 1 57 for optimization scenarios iii and iv table 6 this is similar to the value of 1 5 proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for this growth stage likewise the fitted values for the other yield response coefficients that were optimized conjointly table 6 were similar to the values of 0 4 0 5 and 0 2 reported by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for the vegetative yield formation and ripening growing stages respectively however the yield response factors tabulated by doorenbos and kassam 1979 are for an additive water production function rather than multiplicative function used herein measured yield response to the growth stage weighted etc et m 1 fraction the right hand side of eq 21 was highly linear p 0 0001 and did not exhibit quadratic behavior p 0 74 however variability about the predicted yield as defined by 20 and 80 quantiles fig 10 was large especially for the range of seasonal water use 0 6 etc et m 1 0 8 a considerable proportion of the model error in the yield response 50 results from the particularly low measured grain yield in 2009 for the 50 and 75 irrigation rates fig 10 as discussed by colaizzi et al 2011 this yield depression was attributed to crop stress during pollination that coincided with a period with abnormally high temperatures and vapor pressure deficits table 2 it is plausible that daily high temperatures exceeding 35 c would have reduced fertilization rate of ovules that led to the observed low kernel numbers a yield factor expression ktp max tp 35 0 was added to the right and side of eq 21 to evaluate if the inclusion of daily mean maximum ambient air temperature during the pollination period tp would improve yield estimation here ktp is the coefficient describing yield loss during pollination mg ha 1 c 1 attributed to high temperature stress pollination was assumed to begin with the vt r1 crop growth stage identified using growing degree days fig 3 and continue for seven days thereafter optimized values of the yield factor coefficients associated with optimizations that only included water stress were marginally less than ky 2 or greater than ky 1 ky 3 ky 4 optimizations without accounting for high temperature stress but with calibration rmse s that were 20 smaller these preliminary results imply a grain yield reduction of approximately 1 6 mg m 3 for every c that mean daily maximum temperature exceeds 35 c during pollination in addition to temperature stress other factors contributed to yield variability as exhibited by the magnitude of error bars shown in fig 10 the measured grain yield in 2016 under the 25 4 mm 6 d 1 irrigation level at the higher plant density 9 9 plants ha 1 were 69 of yields at the lower plant density 7 9 plants ha 1 grain yields at the lower irrigation rate for the 2016 growing season were also observed to exhibit a greater corn earworm helicoverpa zea boddie damage especially at greater plant densities exemplifying the commonly overlooked interaction between water and biotic stresses brewer et al 2014 grain yields under no tillage baumhardt et al 2013 averaged 1 55 mg ha 1 greater than observed under disk tillage principally because of 31 mm greater crop water use during the growing season lamm et al 2009 observed yield effects resulting from differences in plant densities and tillage practices although the magnitude of these effects varied with respect to the cropping year lastly grain yields under low elevation sprinklers averaged 0 6 mg ha 1 greater than mid elevation sprinklers colaizzi et al 2011 factors such as surface residue or irrigation application method that influence yields by modifying the partitioning between e and t can be significant in some years however they are difficult to parameterize and reliably predict in a modeling sense yang et al 2004 2017 5 conclusions the multi location treatment year calibration of a crop water use model facilitated the optimization of fao 56 crop and stress response coefficients that permitted accurate predictions prediction rmse 1 16 mm of maize et across a wide range in seasonal crop water use implementation of a nonuniform root distribution within the algorithm functioned as an additional crop water stress factor that reduced soil water extraction by roots deeper within the profile and resulted in an 18 reduction in the prediction rmse compared with the optimized fao 56 stress response function the largest uncertainties in predicted crop et were related to an underestimation of runoff for crops receiving high levels of irrigation in years with significant high intensity rainfall events and an overestimation of crop water use during stress induced early senescence therefore even in level fields under semiarid conditions runoff may need to be included in water balance calculations to avoid unrealistic kc values optimized production functions using 18 location treatment years resulted in grain yield calibrations with an rmse of 2 1 mg ha 1 with half of the yield variability attributed to elevated maximum daytime temperatures 35 c during pollination a water production function that included an additive temperature stress response expression improved grain yield calibrations rmse 1 69 mg ha 1 tillage practices plant density and nozzle elevation also generated additional yield variability our results suggest that refinement of crop water use estimates would achieve only incremental improvements in maize grain yield predictions because of differing cultural practices and the large influence of other abiotic and biotic stressors unrelated to or interacting with water stress owing to the large uncertainties in maize yield predictions in the southern us great plains especially under moderate water stress we feel it is crucial to specify the probabilities of expected yield in conjunction with the predicted yield which is essential for guiding crop production decisions and risk avoidance acknowledgements the authors

10794,uncertainties in the estimation of evapotranspiration et1 using the crop coefficient kc reference et method arise for deeply rooted crops and severe water stress we expanded upon the crop coefficient based model by modifying plant available water via a nonuniform root distribution that limited deep water extraction using daily estimated soil profile water contents the model was calibrated to predict maize zea mays l et over a wide range in crop water deficits in addition maize grain yield was calibrated with model predicted et using a multiplicative water production function the calibrated model with optimized crop and stress response coefficients predicted actual maize et for a wide range in water deficits with a daily and growing season prediction root mean square error rmse of 1 16 mm d 1 and 25 6 mm respectively a nonuniform root distribution functioned similarly to stress response coefficients reducing soil water extraction deeper in the profile with a resultant 18 reduction in the prediction rmse compared with the optimized stress response conventionally used with the kc approach the largest uncertainties in predicted crop et resulted from an underestimation of runoff and an overestimation of crop water use during stress induced early senescence measured and predicted soil water contents averaged over the entire rooting depth agreed closely however root water extraction was overestimated deeper in the profile calibration of the water production function using data exhibiting a wide range in measured grain yield resulted in a rmse of 2 1 mg ha 1 including an additive high temperature stress response expression improved the calibration because of the limited input requirements and robustness over a wide range in crop water stress levels the

coefficient evapotranspiration maize simulation model 1 introduction approximately six million acres within the southern u s great plains are irrigated for crop production through withdrawals from the high plains aquifer this region associated with the southern half of the aquifer has experienced the greatest declines in saturated thickness that has resulted in a concomitant reduction in well pumping capacities for irrigation mcguire et al 2003 mcguire 2014 as a consequence of reduced availability of freshwater and increasing competition among users irrigators are being forced to reassess how much water is allocated to crops so as to optimize productivity maize zea mays l is one of the major irrigated crops in the southern u s great plains and has the greatest seasonal irrigation requirements and sensitivity to water deficits howell et al 1996 colaizzi et al 2009 xue et al 2017 considerable reductions in maize grain yield are often realized as a result of marginal well capacities and corresponding irrigation allocations that fail to meet crop water requirements during critical growth stages moreover pre plant water allocation decisions are made in the face of the uncertainty in estimating seasonal and peak crop water requirements that vary considerably from year to year and regionally undoubtedly the optimization of productivity under these conditions requires an accurate assessment of crop yield under a wide range in water stress levels accurate models of crop development and yield in response to water are instrumental in evaluating irrigation strategies to optimize water productivity of equal importance is the ability to accurately estimate root zone soil water contents to correctly infer plant available water calibrate effects of water deficits on crop water use and to make appropriate real time water management decisions bell et al 2019 since its publication the fao 56 crop coefficient reference et approach allen et al 1998 based largely on the fao 24 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 method has gained widespread use in estimating crop water requirements owing to its intuitiveness and simplicity and because of its demonstrated robustness and transferability to range of environments pereira et al 2014 early on it was demonstrated that at the onset of water stress in plants transpiration rate should be approximately proportional to the available soil water content gardner and ehlig 1963 this concept was incorporated into crop et estimation for non standard conditions in fao 56 such that below a threshold soil water content transpiration declines linearly with root zone water depletion as a result of stomatal closure the threshold value was crop specific and also dependent on potential evapotranspiration this approach has been shown to function satisfactorily and produce reasonable estimates of actual crop et as used in the mopeco model domínguez et al 2011 for several crops and as assessed by lyra et al 2016 with maize especially when stress coefficients were adapted to local conditions because stress thresholds and response functions are directly based on soil water depletion it is particularly important that root elongation be considered during the growing season e g smith 2008 domínguez et al 2011 to avoid an overestimation of plant available soil water during the vegetative stage however in soils with horizon dependent retention properties and deeply rooted 1 m crops using a rooting zone averaged permanent wilting point and field capacity to evaluate available water can lead to errors in estimating crop et in addition root proliferation deeper in the soil profile is considerably less than near the surface moroke et al 2005 which renders much of the deep water inaccessible and consequently plant available water is overestimated under these circumstances bell et al 2019 calibration of the crop coefficients kc for fao 56 to determine the et of a non stressed crop e g piccinni et al 2009 trout and dejonge 2018 is relatively straightforward because irrigation only need to be scheduled to ensure that plant available soil water is non limiting the calibration of the stress response coefficients is challenging because the resultant function must apply to a wide range in levels of plant available water and atmospheric demands which vary throughout the season and from year to year failure to include both stressed and non stressed conditions will result in optimized parameters that lack robustness and exhibit difficulties with identifiability the importance of hydrological model calibrations using multiple field data sets has long been recognized mcmillan et al 2011 yet in practice most calibrations of crop water use models are carried out on a single field and typically only for a single growing season calibrations that encompass multiple fields or locations over a wide range in crop water stress levels for more than a single growing season maximize the information content and hence robustness of the optimization our objectives were to i expand upon the fao 56 method crop et estimation that accounts for nonuniform root distribution with depth ii calibrate and test the model using multiple fields years under a wide range of water deficits and management conditions for maize production and iii use the calibrated crop et model to calibrate and evaluate maize water production functions suitable for use in the texas high plains our overall model development goal was to use a minimum parameter set to simulate soil water contents throughout the profile as modified by water extraction by roots yet calculate et in a manner that is consistent with the conventional fao 56 method moreover introduction of soil water contents in the simulation provides a way to integrate the model with real time monitoring of soil water contents and thereby facilitate the integration or fusion of these measurements with reference et for improved irrigation scheduling

fraction of water between field capacity and saturation that is considered as plant available this has the effect of moderating the effect of the uncertainty in estimated soil water contents near saturation within portions of the root zone that operationally reduces overall plant available water 2 2 nonuniform root distribution a generalized trapezoidal root distribution function gardner 1983 hoffman and van genuchten 1983 is used to simulate reduced available soil water at deeper depths β1 z and modify the distribution of soil water extraction throughout the profile β2 z the parameter f describes the fraction of the rooting depth below which plant accessible water becomes less than unity fig 1 the transition point zt where the fraction of accessible water falls below unity is described as 7 z t t z r 0 f z r t z r 0 f z r t f z r t z r 0 where zr 0 is the initial rooting depth at planting here f is defined within the bounds of zr 0 zrm f 1 where zrm is the maximum depth of

macroscopic extraction of soil water by roots within a soil layer is described by a sink term feddes et al 1976 10 s z j e t c α h z j β 2 z j 0 z r α h z β 2 z d z where s zj is water extraction mm d 1 at depth increment j α h is the dimensionless sink term dependent on soil water potential h etc is daily calculated crop evapotranspiration and β2 is the normalized root distribution function 11 β 2 z j β 1 z j 0 z r β 1 z d z because eq 10 utilizes et rather than t to describe the sink term the volume of soil water evaporation that would normally reduce near surface soil water contents is subtracted from soil water contents throughout the rooting depth the use of et rather than t feddes et al 1976 would cause an overestimation of water contents in the top layer principally during the vegetative stage when canopy cover is sparse daily extraction rate within a soil layer s zj is limited to less than or equal to smax δz where δz is the thickness of the soil layer mm and smax m3 m 3 d 1 is the maximal extraction rate hoogland et al 1981 as per feddes and raats 2004 the linear dimensionless sink term can be approximated as 12 α z 0 h z h 4 h 4 h z h 4 h 3 h 4 h z h 3 1 h z h 3 where h 3 and h 4 are assumed equal to soil water potentials at field capacity 0 033 mpa and permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa respectively the sink term being used herein is employed to distribute the water uptake equivalent to etc eq 1 throughout the profile rather than directly calculate the magnitude of the water uptake for a particular layer nonetheless it influences crop water stress vis à vis feedback associated with the summation of plant available water likewise influenced by the rooting fraction and depth herein the generalized sink term of feddes and raats 2004 has been simplified and does not consider the dependence of h 3 on the magnitude of transpiration in addition potential declines in water uptake very near saturation as a result of limited oxygen diffusion to roots is not considered soil water potential h for the evaluation of the sink term is calculated with the van genucthen 1980 relationship 13 θ h θ s θ r 1 α v g h n v g 1 1 n v g with the shape parameter nvg as an input variable and the residual water content θr and shape parameter αvg uniquely evaluated given a knowledge of the water contents at 0 033 mpa and 1 5 mpa likewise an exponential function 14 θ h c exp h γ can be used to approximate the sink function again with the parameters c and γ uniquely determined given a knowledge of the water contents at 0 033 mpa and 1 5 mpa the two sink term functions based on eqs 13 and 14 can vary considerably with respect to soil water content fig 1 2 4 irrigation precipitation and runoff net irrigation describing the potential average change in the depth of stored soil water from an overhead irrigation event in is estimated as 15 i n i g a e i i g d 0 i g a e i d 0 a e i d 0 i g d 0 where ig is gross irrigation application depth aei is the fractional value of the irrigation application efficiency that accounts for losses resulting from evaporation of water droplets wind drift canopy interception and evaporation from depression storage and d 0 is a minimum threshold gross application depth for achieving aei the threshold depth permits an accounting for the low application efficiencies observed with shallow application depths using overhead sprinklers wiersma 1963 because aei does not consider losses from deep drainage and runoff these processes are handled separately and based on daily soil water contents net irrigation depth is added as soil water to fillable pore space θs θ to achieve saturation in successively deeper soil layers up to a maximum depth of zf any remaining balance of in is added to the runoff component runoff depth

limiting soil water storage si is defined as 17 s i 0 z f θ s θ d z describing si without the use of the scs curve numbers permits an adaptive assessment of runoff governed by the level of soil water saturation and hence sensitive to levels of irrigation e g schneider and howell 2000 as with irrigation precipitation less calculated runoff is added as soil water to fillable pore space θs θ to

δ θ j δ t δ z j where δz j is layer thickness mm and q j is the flux mm d 1 out of the layer j subject to the constraint that daily flux cannot exceed the sum of fillable pore space and flux out of the underlying layer only downward flux is considered the boundary at the soil surface is a zero flux condition and daily flow out of the lowermost layer is considered as drainage d eq 18 has been modified to better represent the nonlinearity of hydraulic conductivity as water content declines this was achieved by replacing the expression prior to the exponential function from θ fc θ s to θ θ s in this case the solution for the calculation of the change in soil water content associated with a given flux was not closed form and was approximated using a root finding algorithm further details of the method are described by raes 2004 2 6 calculation procedure the algorithm used to evaluate daily crop evapotranspiration was implemented in matlab mathworks natick ma 1 1 the use of trade firm

contents in the profile and then followed by similar procedure for precipitation after updating soil water contents in the surface through additions from irrigation and precipitation redistribution of soil water was calculated and thereafter plant available soil water content was evaluated to estimate etc at the conclusion of each day soil water extraction by roots was used to update the soil water

that considers water deficits at different crop growth stages in a multiplicative relationship rao et al 1988 domínguez et al 2012a was used to calculate predicted yields yp 21 y p y m j 1 n y 1 k y j ϕ e t c e t m j where ym is maximum attainable crop yield ky is the crop yield response factor by growing stage j and ny is the number of growth stages herein we consider that maximum dry matter production may be achieved at etc etm φ that is less than unity such that eq 21 is subject to the restriction 22 e t c e t m j min e t c e t m j ϕ this expression accounts for environments and practices that cause the development of surface conditions at high levels of irrigation or precipitation that are subject to enhanced soil water evaporation losses that do not contribute to yield and consequently results in more realistic values of ym when based on extrapolation of measured yields in the field using production functions 3 materials and methods 3 1 description of field experiments the water use and yield model was calibrated and evaluated using four experimental studies of maize response to water deficits table 1 at the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory

valley ne drop hoses spaced 1 52 m apart were equipped with low drift nozzles extractable nutrients determined in soil samples collected in the spring prior to planting were used to determine n and p fertilizer application rates most of the nitrogen was applied by fertigation through the lateral move sprinkler neutron moisture gages model 503dr instrotek inc raleigh nc were used to determine soil water contents from 0 1 to 2 3 m depth in 0 2 m increments at 6 to 14 day intervals throughout the growing season all studies used a depth control stand to ensure that the source was centered at the intended measurement depth evett et al 2003 each of the neutron probes used in these studies were previously calibrated in 2002 using methods described by evett and steiner 1995 with separate equations for the a bt and btk horizons because of the need to obtain accurate estimates of changes in soil water content treatments other than irrigation rates were pooled for a given year when there were small or insignificant differences in crop water use and grain yield solar irradiance wind speed air temperature dew point temperature relative humidity and barometric pressure were measured at an adjacent weather station located on an irrigated cool season grass surface and described by howell et al 1995 precipitation was measured with tipping bucket rain gages also over the grass surface

asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for a short reference crop at a 24 h time step allen et al 2005 although eto calculations using hourly time steps are preferred irmak et al 2005 a 24 h time step was used because of its wide availability for real time applications and because it was considered sufficiently accurate for purposes of irrigation scheduling comparison of hourly and 24 h calculations during the 2016 growing season yielded a calibration rmse of 0 77 mm 3 d 1 3 day periods ratios of mean 24 h eto to daily sums of hourly eto of 1 03 and a slope of 1 007 in the four year study by baumhardt et al 2013 irrigation and tillage effects on maize soil water use and grain yield were examined within a wheat corn fallow crop rotation within a strip split plot design with three replications per treatment combination tillage treatments consisted of disk tillage stubble mulch tillage and no tillage that were implemented primarily during fallow periods following wheat and after maize harvest irrigation applications of 25 or 50 mm depth were applied in 10 day intervals to represent the limited pumping capacities of the regions maize pioneer 33b54 du pont pioneer hi bred int johnston ia with a relative hybrid maturity crm of 113 was planted during mid may in 0 76 m rows to achieve a target population of 9 plants m 2 for the purposes of this study we evaluated water use and yield pooled among the tillage treatments for the 2007 2008 and 2009 growing seasons noting that mean differences in seasonal water use between no tillage and disk tillage varied by 21 mm the 2006 study year was omitted from this evaluation because infrequent soil water content measurements curtailed an accurate assessment of crop water use additional details of the field operations crop development and harvest yield components for this study are provided by baumhardt et al 2013 the study carried out by colaizzi et al 2011 in 2009 and 2010 evaluated water use and maize grain yields obtained using mid elevation mesa and low elevation lesa spray application methods within a strip split plot design each application method was evaluated at 25 50 75 and 100 of full crop water requirements in addition water use and yield were evaluated under dryland conditions with supplemental irrigation to permit crop establishment for the purpose of this study the mesa and lesa treatments were pooled because within irrigation level crop water use and yield did not significantly differ in each of the study years irrigation was applied in 25 4 mm depth increments to the 100

day of april 2009 and mid may 2010 in 0 76 m rows that achieved measured populations of 8 4 plants m 2 additional details of this study can be found in colaizzi et al 2011 in 2014 maize water use and grain yield were evaluated in response to managed allowed plant available soil water depletion levels of 20 and 40 within a strip plot design and six replicates per treatment schwartz unpublished

excess irrigation was applied in 25 4 mm depth increments except on three occasions when only 12 7 mm was applied to avoid over filling the basins which had reduced capacity during the latter part of the growing season as a result of dike erosion maize pioneer 1151am du pont pioneer hi bred int johnston ia with a crm of 111 was planted on 20 may 2014 in 0 76 m rows that achieved measured populations at harvest of 9 6 plants m 2 maize grain yields were based on three 1 5 m2 hand samples two 1 52 m rows 1 m harvested from each of the six replicates growing season precipitation was above average for the 2014 season and totaled 524 mm with daily totals exceeding 40 mm on four occasions because of significant runoff problems observed in plots associated with the 20 depletion level treatment we have restricted our evaluation herein to the 40 depletion level treatment a study was initiated in 2016 to examine irrigation and plant population levels on grain yield of three maize cultivars two of which were labeled as drought tolerant schwartz and bell unpublished results experimental plots were arranged within a strip split plot design with two irrigation levels on main plots and three cultivars two populations randomized within subplots and three replications per treatment combination imposed irrigation treatments were based on pumping capacities restricted to 84 7 m3 ha 1 d 1 25 4 mm 3 d 1 or 42 3 m3 ha 1 d 1 25 4 mm 6 d 1 irrigation was applied with low elevation 0 46 m spray application using low drift nozzle ldn spray heads senninger irrigation inc orlando fl regulated at 69 kpa for a discharge rate of 0 32 l s 1 furrow dikes were constructed at the v3 stage to reduce runon and runoff within the field the prescribed application rates of 25 4 mm every third or sixth day was maintained unless stored soil water in the 0 1 4 m profile exceeded 85 plant available water at field capacity under these circumstances irrigation was withheld until water contents dropped below this threshold three maize hybrids dekalb dkc 62 27 dgvt2pro and dkc62 98 vt2pro monsanto inc st louis mo and pioneer p1151hr with crm s of 112 112 and 111 respectively were planted on 7 may 2016 under conventional tillage planting was on 0 76 m rows that achieved measured populations at harvest of 7 9 and 9 9 plants m 2 for the two plant population treatments grain was sampled by hand on four 1 m 1 52 m 2 rows subplots per replication growing season precipitation during 2016 was near normal 253 mm although a 20 day period extending from 4 to 23 jul that included the pollination stage had a mean eto that exceeded 9 1 mm d 1 in conjunction with negligible 0 4 mm precipitation that imposed considerable water stress on the crop under both irrigation regimes from mid august to early september four precipitation events totaling 125 mm combined with low eto mean 4 1 mm d 1 were adequate for crop water requirements for much of the remainder of the growing season seasonal crop water use was significantly influenced only by irrigation rate p 0 05 maize grain yields averaged 16 48 mg ha 1 at the 25 4 mm 3 d 1 irrigation rate among the three cultivars two planting populations with no significant treatment differences at the 25 4 mm 6 d 1 irrigation rate grain yields were significantly influenced by population but not hybrid with mean pooled yields of 7 48 and 5 27 mg ha 1 for the 7 9 and 9 9 plants m 2 populations respectively for the aims of this research and because of the lack of significant water use and yield responses among cultivars we evaluated mean water use and mean yields of all cultivars populations at the 25 4 mm 3 d 1 irrigation level and all cultivars 7 9 plants m 2 population at the 25 4 mm 6 d 1 irrigation level 3 2 estimation of actual crop et actual evapotranspiration of crops eta to be distinguished from calculated values using crop coefficients etc was estimated based on soil water balance evaluations using neutron probe measurements and pertinent precipitation irrigation and runoff fluxes cumulative eta for a period of n days and bracketed by neutron probe measurements from t i and extending to t i n can be written as 23 i t i t i n e t a t 0 z r i n θ n p t i z θ w p z d z 0 z r i n θ n p t i n z θ w p z d z i t i t i n p t i t i t i n i n t i t i t i n r t where θ np is the water content measurement at time t and depth z and zr i n is the rooting depth on day t i n here drainage or upward flow at zr i n is assumed negligible for the time period between measurements which was evident by the insignificant increase in soil water contents below 1 5 m for the experimental studies used to calibrate and evaluate modeled etc runoff is estimated using the algorithm during the optimization procedure and inserted in the above eq 23 to refine estimates of eta daily eta mm d 1 was estimated as 24 e t a k c e t o where k c is the mean measured crop coefficient over the period fig 2 25 k c i t i t i n e t a t i t i t i n e t o t to permit the implementation of the optimization procedure and subsequently subdivision of crop et into growth stages associated with kc and ky that do not coincide with the neutron probe measurement intervals initial water contents at planting were calculated by assuming that k c 0 3 prior to the first neutron probe readings which generally were completed two to three weeks after planting 3 3 model parameterization daily eto precipitation and irrigation depth mm and initial soil water contents are the necessary inputs to initialize the model identification of the periods of the growing season associated with crop coefficients for water use and yield determination and root elongation were identified by growing degree days gdd required to reach several crop developmental stages fig 3 the specific periods associated with the yield response factors were based on those identified by domínguez et al 2012b growing degree days were evaluated using a 10 c base temperature and an upper temperature threshold of 30 c using method 2 of mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 the gdd after planting to attain the specific crop growth stages infrequently varied by more than two days with respect to visual observations noting that maize hybrids had a narrow range in crm 111 113 appearance of silk r1 occurred either simultaneously or within a day of tasseling vt for these hybrids we chose to end model simulations at a gdd accumulation of 1675 c that corresponds to harvest maturity when grain moisture content was at most 25 nielsen 2012 for these hybrids this avoids difficulties in crop water use estimation extending long after physiological maturity to indeterminate harvest dates that can vary considerably because of slow or delayed losses in grain moisture we assumed root growth began at emergence at a depth of z 0 and maximum rooting depth zrm was attained at vt water retention at permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa and field capacity 0 033 mpa for each depth increment of neutron probe measurements table 3 were based on previous studies musick and sletten 1966 moroke 2002 schwartz et al 2003 bell 2014 tolk and evett 2012 the maximum rooting depth zrm was set equivalent to 1 4 m because there was little or no evidence of water extraction at greater depths in measured profiles of soil water content during the growing season based on these retention measurements plant available water soil water at field capacity for the entire profile to 1 4 m is 174 mm and agrees closely with the 167 mm in the 1 47 m profile measured by unger and pringle 1981 for the pullman clay loam because some horizons within the pullman clay loam can remain above field capacity for extended periods because of slow drainage rates unger and pringle 1981 inclusion of half of the water between field capacity and saturation fp 0 5 as per eq 6 implies a potential depth of 233 mm as plant available a tabulation of model parameters is provided in table 4 the water stress coefficients etb and pb were set equivalent to 4 mm d 1 and 0 4 respectively except for model runs using the default fao 56 values of 5 mm d 1 and 0 55 for maize allen et al 1998 soil water extraction was described using the sink function described by van genuchten 1980 retention with a shape parameter nvg of 1 25 schwartz and evett 2002 maximum root uptake rates smax were set equivalent to 0 015 m3 m 3 d 1 at soil depths greater than 0 2 m and to 0 030 m3 m 3 d 1 at shallower soil depths hoogland et al 1981 irrigation application efficiency aei was assumed to be 0 9 howell 2003 with a minimum application depth d 0 of 25 4 mm and efficiencies declining for lower depths as per eq 15 intitial abstraction ia for runoff calculations was set equivalent to 15 mm and the soil depth zf was fixed at 0 2 m to estimate the potential storage si after initial abstraction redistribution of soil water via eq 18 was estimated using a spatial discretization δz of 0 2 m and τ 0 34 which was found to approximate soil water profiles predicted using ver 4 08 of hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 with an initially saturated profile to 0 2 m and water contents at field capacity at lower depths raes 2004 provides an approximation to estimate τ from saturated hydraulic conductivities however we note that the solution eq 18 for a given τ is scale dependent and consequently redistribution rates vary with δz 3 4 optimization our paradigm to obtain a consistent parameterization of crop water stress response warrants a simultaneous optimization of crop water use over treatments site years representing a wide range in water deficit levels this avoids fitting crop coefficients and stress factors for a given crop year or water deficit level that usually results in non robust solutions in this vein we selected the data of baumhardt et al 2013 in 2007 and the 2014 schwartz unpublished results and 2016 schwartz and bell unpublished results field data consisting of five site years to calibrate the model table 1 these specific data sets were selected because soil water balance meteorological and crop development information were computed and compiled prior to the other data sets the remaining data in baumhardt et al 2013 and colaizzi et al 2011 consisting of 14 additional treatment site years was used to test the calibrations the entire data set consists of estimated eta ranging from 307 to 773 mm seasonal water use fractions eta etm from 0 41 to 0 93 and grain yields from 0 to 19 mg ha 1 table 1 crop coefficients and stress parameters were first optimized to predict etc and subsequently these optimized parameters were used to optimize the production function with measured yields five parameters were considered for optimizing crop et table 4 through the minimization of the objective function 26 φ β χ 1 n m n p i 1 n p w i j 1 m e t a χ i j e t c β χ i j 2 σ i j 2 where β is the vector of np optimized parameters χ represents the vectors of independent variables e g eto in p etc σ2 is the variance associated with measurement errors n is the number of site treatment years evaluated and m is the number of days associated with eta records from planting until the final neutron probe measurements a homoscedastic variance was assumed because of the difficulty in assessing error originating from multiple sources e g runoff and soil water balance here w is a weight which was used to i ensure that each site treatment year was weighted equally independent of the number of days m and ii weight the two deficit irrigation treatments baumhardt et al 2013 1 5 times greater than the three other site years so as to normalize variance among irrigation treatment levels and avoid biasing optimizations towards high levels of irrigation due to the manner in which the values of daily kc are calculated throughout the growing season all three cannot be simultaneously optimized because of the inherent interdependencies of coefficients we chose not to optimize the crop coefficient for the mid season growth stage kc mid and set it to the default fao 56 value of 1 20 this permits the optimization of kc ini and kc end which are independent of one another the remaining parameters for the crop water use optimization could be fitted without such constraints an iterative procedure was used to estimate runoff because it could not be evaluated directly in the estimation of eta daily runoff estimated using optimized crop water use parameters was subtracted from daily precipitation and eta was recalculated the model was re optimized using the updated values of eta to obtain updated parameter estimates after two iterations runoff and hence eta and etc values remained stable 0 2 mm and the resultant daily eta values were used for all further optimization runs we examined four optimization scenarios to assess if additional parameters conceptualizing processes not considered by fao 56 would improve crop water use predictions these scenarios included i the original fao 56 with fitted crop coefficients kc ini and kc end and the stress response coefficient δ ii same as scenario i but with a baseline stress response fraction pb 0 4 rather than 0 55 typically recommended for maize iii same as scenario ii but with a fitted ε to account for nonlinearity of the water stress function and iv same as scenario iii but with a fitted f that applies a nonuniform root distribution a matlab function implementing the levenberg marquardt algorithm press et al 1992 was used to minimize the objective function eq 26 with a convergence criterion of 1 10 4 for parameter estimates and 1 10 2 for the objective function optimizations were repeated several times using a range of starting parameters to ensure that a global minimum was attained within realistic parameter values parameters of the crop production function eq 21 were optimized by means of minimization of the objective function 27 φ y β χ i 1 n y y p β χ i 2 σ i 2 where y is measured yield β is the vector of optimized parameters χ represents the independent variable i e etc etm for each of the growth periods associated with the yield response factors and σ2 is the variance associated with measurement errors which is assumed homoscedastic only parameters ym and ky 2 were optimized for the calibration data because of the insensitivity of the predicted yield to yield response factors of the other growth periods in this case ky 1 ky 3 and ky 4 were set equivalent to the nominal values provided in table 4 for optimizations using both the calibration and test data the objective function was more sensitive to ky 1 and ky 3 and in this case we only optimized ym ky 1 and ky 2 with the conditions that ky 3 ky 1 and ky 4 ½ ky 1 based on yield component coefficients for maize reported by domínguez et al 2012b and because for the evaluation herein ky 1 tended to converge to slightly greater values of ky 3 the crop production function was optimized based on crop water use predictions obtained with the four optimization scenarios described previously procedure nlin sas institute 2016 was used to minimize the objective function for yield prediction and bootstrapping was used to evaluate the distributional properties of the parameter estimates 4 results and discussion 4 1 crop water use calibration fitted crop coefficients varied little among the four parameter optimization scenarios for the crop water use calibration data table 5 kc ini averaged 0 317 0 019 whereas kc end averaged 0 524 0 008 when kc mid was set equivalent to the default fao 56 value of 1 20 asymptotic confidence intervals for the crop coefficients ranged between 1 to 4 of the fitted parameter value indicating that parameter identifiability was good even when stress coefficients were fitted simultaneously asymptotic confidence intervals were also narrow 3 to 6 4 of the fitted parameter value for the crop stress coefficients the frequent assumption of negligible runoff used in soil water balance approaches to estimate eta in semiarid environments e g klocke et al 2011 araya et al 2017 trout and dejonge 2018 generated large errors in the estimation of crop coefficients for the studies evaluated herein under fully or nearly fully irrigated treatments in years with significant precipitation events without the inclusion of estimated runoff in the mass balance calculations crop coefficients inferred from measurements attained unrealistic values of 1 73 2014 s 1 71 2010 c 100 and 1 54 2010 c 75 in contrast inclusion of estimated runoff from irrigation and precipitation resulted in estimated crop coefficients that did not exceed 1 30 a value obtained at the early r3 milk growth stage in 2010 under full irrigation 2010 c 100 likewise crop coefficients inferred from measurements did not greatly exceed values of optimized kc values throughout the growing season with the exception of the treatment in the 2016 sb at 25 4 mm 3 d 1 study where kc inferred from eq 25 overestimated the optimized kc by 29 on doy 246 this likely resulted from an underestimation of runoff that occurred during a 53 mm precipitation event received on doy 242 244 in 2016 although the furrow dikes can reduce or eliminate runoff from the field with continued irrigation and rainfall throughout the season the storage capacity of the dikes is reduced schneider and howell 2000 use of the default fao 56 parameters to describe water stress in maize etb 5 mm d 1 pb 0 55 resulted in a larger calibration rmse than the values etb 4 mm d 1and pb 0 4 used for the remaining optimizations in table 5 however optimized values of δ that ranged from 0 035 0 057 d mm 1 bracketed the fao 56 value of 0 04 d mm 1 proposed by allen et al 1998 lyra et al 2016 also found that a δ value of 0 04 d mm 1 with lower values for pb 0 15 and etb 3 mm d 1 were more suitable to estimate maize water use in northeastern brazil the optimized stress coefficient values in this study implies that at an etc of approximately 12 to 14 mm d 1 the stress response function p is approximately zero and consequently a maize crop would experience water stress even when the soil water content is at field capacity a nonlinear stress response optimization iii resulted in a slight improvement in the calibration rmse compared to the linear stress response table 5 lyra et al 2016 observed a lower calibration rmse for crop water use with respect to eta using a linear stress response for maize however they compared this to a logarithmic function of stress response rather than a quadratic function evaluated herein an optimized value of ε of less than unity table 5 optimizations iii and iv implies that the stress response is concave and that the decline in ks becomes increasingly steeper as soil water depletion increases the value of the optimized parameter f describing a nonuniform root distribution table 5 optimization iv implies that only half of the plant available soil water below 0 77 m is accessible by roots inclusion of parameters ε and f in the optimization problem resulted in a calibration rmse of 0 91 mm d 1 for the calibration data 4 2 crop water use prediction using each of the four crop water use calibrations i iv table 5 to predict the 14 treatment site years resulted in prediction rmse s ranging from 1 16 to 1 42 mm d 1 and again the lowest prediction rmse was associated with optimization iv that employed a nonuniform root distribution with depth table 5 overall the prediction rmse s herein are significantly less than rmse s of 1 5 2 0 reported by heng et al 2009 using fao aquacrop steduto et al 2009 to predict maize crop use within a relatively narrow range 760 900 mm at the bushland tx location lower errors in estimated crop water use likely results from the use of a local calibration because of consistently smaller prediction rmse obtained for the calibration using a nonuniform root distribution table 4 optimization iv the remainder of the discussion and results presented pertain to this particular optimization cumulative eta and etc for the calibration and test data figs 4 and 5 show good agreement throughout the growing season with the exception of the 2016 sb data and for dryland treatments 2009 c and 2010 c under extreme water stress as discussed earlier an underestimation of runoff during the latter part of the 2016 season likely resulted in an overestimation of eta that is discernible in fig 4 for both irrigation treatments however because the predicted runoff for etc is essentially the same as eta the observed differences later in the season are a result of the lower predicted crop water use etc reflected as greater stored soil water at the end of the growing season noting that for all the simulations estimated drainage flux out of the root zone was negligible we suspect that the optimization underestimated etc to compensate for underestimated runoff however we note that crop water use etc in a year without large intense precipitation events agreed closely with eta fig 5 2009 c 100 signifying that the parameter values associated with the stress response function p and the non uniform root distribution f were suitable for the conditions at this location and study years another difficulty with optimized etc is the overestimation of water use during the latter part of the growing season exhibited principally by the dryland treatments fig 5 2009 c and 2010 c however this is also reflected in the greater slope of cumulative etc compared with eta in many of the simulations figs 4 and 5 this is undoubtedly a result of the failure of crop coefficients to predict crop senescence at the end of the growing season heng et al 2009 also found that aquacrop steduto et al 2009 a crop et model that includes parameterization for canopy senescence also had difficulty in simulating water use during stress induced early senescence deviations in predicted etc from water balance calculated eta accumulated throughout the growing season extending from planting to harvest maturity was small prediction rmse 25 4 mm with the greatest departure from the 1 1 line fig 6 associated with underestimation of runoff 2016 sb at 25 4 mm 3 d 1 and stress induced early senescence 2009 c dryland 2010 c dryland 2008 b 2 5 mm d 1 using calibrated aquacrop steduto et al 2009 simulations to predict maize water use 470 730 mm in southwest kansas araya et al 2017 obtained a prediction rmse of 82 6 mm for seasonal crop water use araya et al 2017 attributed the somewhat poor agreement between measured and simulated seasonal crop et to an inadequate characterization of canopy development 4 3 stored profile water during the growing season measured and simulated volumetric soil water contents exhibited close agreement over the entire soil profile 0 1 4 m except after significant precipitation events fig 7 2016 sb at 25 4 mm 6 d 1 and later in the growing season during water stress induced canopy senescence fig 7 2010 c 50 the model simulated 35 mm runoff for the 60 mm precipitation event that occurred on doy 188 in 2010 fig 7 that permitted the close approximation of measured profile soil water content following the storm however we note that the ability of the model to correctly predict runoff after large precipitations events varied widely among storms considerable uncertainty in runoff predictions is to be expected when they are based on daily precipitation totals that do not reflect short time scale dynamics of infiltration in response to near surface soil water and rainfall intensity simulated water contents deviated considerably from measured water contents averaged throughout the 0 0 7 m and 0 7 1 4 m depth increments fig 8 at 0 0 7 m a portion of this divergence is generated by the algorithm that adds infiltrated water into each layer of the profile until saturated and also by the empirical function eq 18 used to redistribute water in the profile overestimation of the soil water contents in the 0 0 7 m depth increment did not occur until after the maize established full canopy cover fig 8 suggesting that the use of et rather than t in the sink term eq 10 had little influence on the profile water distribution likely because of uncertainties in the redistribution function soil water content distributions simulated by eq 18 were characterized by steeper gradients compared with neutron probe measured water contents not shown because of these departures from measured water contents comparison of soil water contents at finer depth increments is not meaningful soil water depletion resulting from root uptake at the 0 7 1 4 m depth increment could be discerned in both measured and simulated treatments that were exposed to moderate water stress fig 8 in all the cases where this was discernible the rate of simulated water extraction exceeded that measured using the neutron probe simulations that employed a uniform root distribution f 1 rather than the optimized value of f 0 55 resulted in greater deviations between simulated and measured apparent root water uptake whereas setting f 0 14 the lower limit for z 0 0 2 improved predictions fig 8 a further improvement in the agreement between predicted and measured water extraction at the 0 7 1 4 m depth increment could be obtained using the exponential soil water retention function eq 14 to evaluate h θ within the sink term fig 8 these results suggest that the model overestimated the sink term at deeper depths at the expense of reduced root water uptake nearer to the surface although these changes in the root sink term reduced deviations between predicted and measured soil water contents at this lower depth increment they increased prediction errors associated with estimation of the total profile soil water content further evaluation of the disparity between measured and simulated soil water contents at the 0 7 1 4 m depth increment indicated that it was not related to the specification of a 1 4 m maximum rooting depth which was corroborated by neutron probe measurements in all but the most severely water stressed treatments 2009 c 25 and dryland 2010 c dryland in addition increasing the water content associated with the permanent wilting point in the bt horizon resulted in simulations that reduced the deviation between predicted and measured final water contents in the 0 7 1 4 m depth increment but had the undesirable effect of generating larger errors in estimated profile water content due to reduced eta lastly increasing simulated redistribution rates by increasing the value of τ to 0 76 did not alter the pattern of root extraction nor did it greatly increase the soil water content at this depth increment it is important to recognize that the sink term inherently assumes that soil water potential equilibrium is achieved within an entire discretization layer each day following water extraction by roots and hence localized regions at large negative water potentials near the root hair are not preserved e g gardner 1960 as such fitted parameter values are misleading in a physical sense as a consequence of the approximations used to describe macroscopic root water uptake skaggs et al 2006 nonetheless using a nonuniform root distribution with macroscopic root water uptake was more successful in imposing water stress compared with conventional fao 56 water stress parameterization 4 4 crop water production functions optimizations of the water production function to estimate grain yield using the four crop water use calibrations table 5 resulted in low calibration rmse s 0 24 0 59 mg ha 1 and asymptotic confidence intervals for ky 2 and ym of approximately 4 and 2 of the fitted parameter value respectively however in contrast to the crop water use calibration use of the calibrated production function to predict grain yields for the test data overestimated all yields by an average of 3 4 mg ha 1 and consequently did not result in reliable yield estimates prediction rmse 3 9 mg ha 1 this outcome signifies that optimizations using a larger observational data set are required to obtain a robust parameterization of the water production function to predict realistic grain yields in this environment recognizing these limitations observational data consisting of all treatment site years were used to develop grain yield calibrations for the production function using crop water use parameterizations iii and iv table 5 ym ky 1 and ky 2 with the conditions that ky 3 ky 1 and ky 4 ½ ky 1 were optimized using all treatment site years with the exception of 2010 c at the 100 irrigation rate grain yields at this level of irrigation 15 1 mg ha 1 were not significantly greater than the 75 irrigation level possibly because of limiting nitrogen availability anaerobic conditions that reduced oxygen transport to roots or because the genetic yield potential of the hybrid pioneer 33b54 was less than the hybrids used in 2014 and 2016 noting that maximum irrigated yields reported in the region were approximately 16 mg ha 1 kansas state university 2005 at lower irrigation rates this hybrid performed similarly to those hybrids planted in 2014 and 2016 optimizations using the remaining 18 treatment site years resulted in calibration rmse s of 2 1 mg ha 1 and model efficiencies of 0 87 0 88 for both crop water use parameterizations iii and iv table 6 fig 9 bootstrap evaluations of fitted parameters showed that for all optimizations ky 1 and ym were approximately normally distributed whereas ky 2 was negatively skewed based on the bootstrap constructed 95 confidence intervals only ky 2 and ym differed significantly from zero whereas yield predictions were relatively insensitive to ky1 indicating that there was insufficient information to estimate ky 1 along with ky 3 and ky 4 domínguez et al 2012a had similar problems optimizing ky 1 and attributed this yield insensitivity to the lack of water stress conditions during the vegetative growth stage optimized values of maximum yield of 19 4 19 9 mg ha 1 table 6 are comparable to the potential yield of 20 mg ha 1 adjusted for 15 5 moisture content estimated for the southern tolk et al 2016 and central grassini et al 2009 u s great plains the fitted parameter values of the yield response coefficients during the early reproductive stage ky 2 were 1 55 and 1 57 for optimization scenarios iii and iv table 6 this is similar to the value of 1 5 proposed by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for this growth stage likewise the fitted values for the other yield response coefficients that were optimized conjointly table 6 were similar to the values of 0 4 0 5 and 0 2 reported by doorenbos and kassam 1979 for the vegetative yield formation and ripening growing stages respectively however the yield response factors tabulated by doorenbos and kassam 1979 are for an additive water production function rather than multiplicative function used herein measured yield response to the growth stage weighted etc et m 1 fraction the right hand side of eq 21 was highly linear p 0 0001 and did not exhibit quadratic behavior p 0 74 however variability about the predicted yield as defined by 20 and 80 quantiles fig 10 was large especially for the range of seasonal water use 0 6 etc et m 1 0 8 a considerable proportion of the model error in the yield response 50 results from the particularly low measured grain yield in 2009 for the 50 and 75 irrigation rates fig 10 as discussed by colaizzi et al 2011 this yield depression was attributed to crop stress during pollination that coincided with a period with abnormally high temperatures and vapor pressure deficits table 2 it is plausible that daily high temperatures exceeding 35 c would have reduced fertilization rate of ovules that led to the observed low kernel numbers a yield factor expression ktp max tp 35 0 was added to the right and side of eq 21 to evaluate if the inclusion of daily mean maximum ambient air temperature during the pollination period tp would improve yield estimation here ktp is the coefficient describing yield loss during pollination mg ha 1 c 1 attributed to high temperature stress pollination was assumed to begin with the vt r1 crop growth stage identified using growing degree days fig 3 and continue for seven days thereafter optimized values of the yield factor coefficients associated with optimizations that only included water stress were marginally less than ky 2 or greater than ky 1 ky 3 ky 4 optimizations without accounting for high temperature stress but with calibration rmse s that were 20 smaller these preliminary results imply a grain yield reduction of approximately 1 6 mg m 3 for every c that mean daily maximum temperature exceeds 35 c during pollination in addition to temperature stress other factors contributed to yield variability as exhibited by the magnitude of error bars shown in fig 10 the measured grain yield in 2016 under the 25 4 mm 6 d 1 irrigation level at the higher plant density 9 9 plants ha 1 were 69 of yields at the lower plant density 7 9 plants ha 1 grain yields at the lower irrigation rate for the 2016 growing season were also observed to exhibit a greater corn earworm helicoverpa zea boddie damage especially at greater plant densities exemplifying the commonly overlooked interaction between water and biotic stresses brewer et al 2014 grain yields under no tillage baumhardt et al 2013 averaged 1 55 mg ha 1 greater than observed under disk tillage principally because of 31 mm greater crop water use during the growing season lamm et al 2009 observed yield effects resulting from differences in plant densities and tillage practices although the magnitude of these effects varied with respect to the cropping year lastly grain yields under low elevation sprinklers averaged 0 6 mg ha 1 greater than mid elevation sprinklers colaizzi et al 2011 factors such as surface residue or irrigation application method that influence yields by modifying the partitioning between e and t can be significant in some years however they are difficult to parameterize and reliably predict in a modeling sense yang et al 2004 2017 5 conclusions the multi location treatment year calibration of a crop water use model facilitated the optimization of fao 56 crop and stress response coefficients that permitted accurate predictions prediction rmse 1 16 mm of maize et across a wide range in seasonal crop water use implementation of a nonuniform root distribution within the algorithm functioned as an additional crop water stress factor that reduced soil water extraction by roots deeper within the profile and resulted in an 18 reduction in the prediction rmse compared with the optimized fao 56 stress response function the largest uncertainties in predicted crop et were related to an underestimation of runoff for crops receiving high levels of irrigation in years with significant high intensity rainfall events and an overestimation of crop water use during stress induced early senescence therefore even in level fields under semiarid conditions runoff may need to be included in water balance calculations to avoid unrealistic kc values optimized production functions using 18 location treatment years resulted in grain yield calibrations with an rmse of 2 1 mg ha 1 with half of the yield variability attributed to elevated maximum daytime temperatures 35 c during pollination a water production function that included an additive temperature stress response expression improved grain yield calibrations rmse 1 69 mg ha 1 tillage practices plant density and nozzle elevation also generated additional yield variability our results suggest that refinement of crop water use estimates would achieve only incremental improvements in maize grain yield predictions because of differing cultural practices and the large influence of other abiotic and biotic stressors unrelated to or interacting with water stress owing to the large uncertainties in maize yield predictions in the southern us great plains especially under moderate water stress we feel it is crucial to specify the probabilities of expected yield in conjunction with the predicted yield which is essential for guiding crop production decisions and risk avoidance acknowledgements the authors
