565,extremes are rare and unexpected this limits observations and constrains our knowledge on their predictability and behavior graphical tools are among the many methods developed to study extremes a major weakness is that they rely on visual inspection inferences which are subjective and make applications to large datasets time consuming and impractical here we advance a graphical method the so called mean excess function mef into an algorithmic procedure mef investigates the mean value of a variable over threshold and thus focuses on extremes we formulate precise and easy to apply statistical tests based on the mef to assess if observed data can be described by exponential or heavier tails as a real world example we apply our method in 21 348 daily precipitation records from all over the globe results show that the exponential tail hypothesis is rejected in 75 8 of the records indicating that heavy tail distributions alternative hypothesis can better describe rainfall extremes the spatial variation of the tail heaviness reveals that heavy tails prevail in regions of australia and eurasia with a hot spot found in central russia and kazakhstan we deem this study offers a new diagnostic tool in assessing the behavior of extremes easy to apply in large databases and for any variable of interest our results on precipitation extremes reinforce past findings and further highlight that exponential tails should be used with caution keywords rainfall extremes heavy tails mean excess function global assessment 1 introduction hydrological extremes have a crucial role in water infrastructure design hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2017 adverse impacts of extreme rainfall are detected in flash floods building and infrastructure damage loss of crops and livestock landslides and disruption of transport and communications nissen and ulbrich 2017 evidence shows that over half a million deaths occurred between 1980 and 2009 due to floods doocy et al 2013 the world climate research program has identified understanding modeling and predicting weather and climate extremes as a major area where further progress is required sillmann et al 2017 long term rainfall prediction cannot be deterministic leading to probabilistic approaches where rainfall is treated as a random variable governed by a distribution law identifying the correct distribution to describe precipitation enables the estimation of return periods corresponding to any precipitation amount i e the average time interval for an event of given magnitude to be exceeded the most important part of a probability distribution is its upper part also known as the right tail as it controls the magnitude and frequency of extreme events generally probability distributions depending on their tail behavior can be classified into two main categories heavy tailed and light tailed distributions loosely speaking the light tailed are those with thinner or similar tails than the exponential distribution fitting methods may be biased against the tail especially when all sample values are used in parameter estimation as markedly less data belong to the tail also precipitation records may underestimate the actual extreme values due to temporal discretization papalexiou et al 2016 van montfort 1990 these factors contribute to poor assessment of extremes behavior and may lead in adopting inadequate models the importance of extremes initiated broad and dedicated research on the upper tail of distributions since the 1940 s when gumbel and other pioneers formalized the extreme value theory yet defining and studying rainfall extremes is still a challenging task in hydrology with recent studies shifting towards the use of heavier than the exponential distribution for example studies on daily precipitation using data from all over the globe provide theoretical and empirical evidence that daily extremes are more frequent and larger in magnitude than those predicted by light tail or exponential distributions such as the commonly used gamma or gumbel distributions papalexiou et al 2013 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 2013 2012 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 additionally stochastic generators only recently have begun to focus on capturing extreme rainfall events baxevani and lennartsson 2015 evin et al 2018 so et al 2015 li et al 2012 hundecha et al 2009 furrer and katz 2008 serinaldi 2009 or reproduce any marginal distribution including heavy tailed distributions and correlation structure papalexiou 2018 papalexiou et al 2018a 2018b however the use of light tail distributions is still common for example many weather generators employ distributions such as the exponential or the gamma chen et al 2012 chowdhury et al 2017 de vera and terra 2018 li et al 2017 li and shi 2019 urdiales et al 2018 verdin et al 2019 2 literature review there are several classifications of distribution tails a popular one ouarda et al 1994 proposed to classify typically used distributions in hydrology according to the asymptotic behavior of their probability density function pdf the normal distribution is the most light tailed followed by the exponential the gamma the lognormal and finally the pareto distribution werner and upper 2004 provided an equivalent classification of distributions commonly used for analysis of extremes and described extensively in el adlouni et al 2008 they discuss of five nested classes classes e to a from light tailed to heavy tailed according to werner and upper 2004 e is broadest class and includes all distributions with e ex that is distributions with infinite exponential moments for example the normal distribution is not included in this class the class d suggested by teugels 1975 encompasses the sub exponential distributions defined by 1 lim x pr x 1 x n x pr max x 1 x n x 1 this limit indicates that the sum of n independent and identically distributed iid sub exponential distributions are likely to exceed x if and only if its maximum value is larger than x an equivalent definition is given by embrechts et al 1997 2 lim x f x exp ε x ε 0 where f x 1 f x x is the exceedance probability also known as complementary distribution function or survival function f is the cumulative distribution function cdf and exp εx expresses the exponential tail therefore distribution tails in class d decrease slower than the exponential tail the class c comprises distributions for which 3 lim t f t x f t x γ or else the tail decreases asymptotically according to a power function c class distributions are all regularly varying with a tail index parameter γ the class b refers to distributions with exact pareto tails and not asymptotically equivalent finally class a contains distributions with pareto tails having γ 2 the so called stable distributions several studies deal with precipitation tails on regional or global scale wilson and toumi 2005 used statistical theory to deduct that the precipitation tail has a stretched exponential form with a shape parameter of 2 3 heavy tail they verified these results using a global daily precipitation data set on an attempt to specify which one of the three limiting types gumbel fréchet and reversed weibull better describes the annual maxima of daily rainfall papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 analyzed the annual maximum daily rainfall of 15 137 records from all over the world after correcting the effect of record length they showed that the fréchet law which has a power type tail is the most appropriate papalexiou et al 2013 used the same dataset and tested four common theoretical tails pareto lognormal weibull and gamma according to their results the heavier tailed distributions better agree with the observed rainfall extremes serinaldi and kilsby 2014 provided an extensive review regarding the behavior of peak over threshold pot daily rainfall extremes and their distribution cavanaugh et al 2015 examined 22 000 rainfall stations around the world in order to determine whether the extreme events are best described by the exponential or pareto distribution by using a test based on the log likelihood ratio they stated that the pdfs of the rainfall tails are power law pareto distributed rather than exponential nguyen and nguyen 2016 developed a decision support tool for statistical modeling of extreme rainfall processes which tests ten commonly used probability models they suggested that the generalized extreme value generalized normal and pearson type iii models were the best models for describing the distribution of annual maximum precipitations from a network of 21 stations in ontario canada papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 proposed the generalized gamma as a universal model for daily precipitation and suggested that exponential tail distributions like the exponential mixed exponentials or the gamma may underestimate the magnitude of extreme events gu et al 2017 examined 728 rainfall stations from all over china by applying the gev distribution and concluded that most tails tend to be heavy and unbounded papalexiou et al 2018 proposed a novel bayesian adjustment approach to distinguish the most appropriate tail between power type and stretched exponential tails the method was applied in more than 4000 hourly rainfall records and favored stretched exponential tails as a better model marani and ignaccolo 2015 compared the generalized extreme value distribution with the metastatistical extreme value mev and showed an agreement between mev estimates and the observed frequency of occurrence of extreme events zorzetto et al 2016 subsequently applied mev to a large dataset finding that the exponent in the stretched exponential used to construct the mev is typically 1 indeed suggesting a tail heavier than an exponential one although this study focuses on the analysis of precipitation extremes we note that harmel et al 2002 evaluated the adequacy of the normal distribution to simulate maximum and minimum daily air temperature and found that the measured variables are not normally distributed in each month but are often slightly skewed ruff and neelin 2012 examined observations of the national climatic data center and examined tail characteristics for daily average maximum and minimum surface temperature probability distributions while the core conforms to gaussian for most distributions roughly half the cases exhibit non gaussian tails in both winter and summer seasons loikith and neelin 2015 identified that north american regions exhibit shorter than gaussian warm tails 3 graphical methods statistical graphical methods constitute useful tools for exploratory analysis and tail discrimination el adlouni et al 2008 embrechts et al 1997 the log log plot is a popular choice especially in economics and finance beirlant et al 2004 the method exploits that power law or regularly varying tails appear as straight lines beirlant et al 2004 embrechts et al 1997 the max sum ratio plot is another method used to distinguish the distributions belonging to class c but not to d along with the generalized hill ratio plot beirlant et al 2004 these two methods are more robust than the widely used log log plot there is also a method using the jackson statistic beirlant et al 2004 which allows to test the sample s consistency with pareto distributions class b the mean excess function mef is another graphical method for tail identification embrechts et al 1997 discriminating distributions which belong to the class d sub exponential and the class e light tailed or exponential it was initially introduced by benktander and segerdahl 1960 the mef has been used in recent studies concerning rainfall extremes as a graphical method for selecting the threshold in peaks over threshold analyses beguería and vicente serrano 2006 chukwudum et al 2019 lana et al 2019 roth et al 2016 or for the selection of the best fitting distribution awadallah 2015 mef was further enhanced by das and ghosh das and ghosh 2016 who constructed confidence intervals for mef plots to ascertain the domain of attraction fréchet gumbel or reversed weibull of data they applied their methodology on simulated and observed datasets such as regional ozone concentrations and flow rates here we 1 update the mean excess function so it can be applied algorithmically and 2 apply the method globally using a big dataset more than 21 000 stations to assess the tail of daily precipitation extremes graphical tools are very useful in discriminating distribution tails yet their major weakness is the need for visual inspection which can also be subjective we overcome this limitation by translating an important graphical method into an algorithmic procedure this paper provides an easy to use tool to distinguish between exponential and sub exponential tails while it is tailored for analysis of big data sets we deem that in the big data era such extensions offer additional diagnostic tools in assessing the behavior of extremes 4 mean excess function the probability of exceedance f x 1 f x or else survival function for large values of x describes the upper tail of the distribution as aforementioned commonly used tails categorized in ouarda et al 1994 and werner and upper 2004 are those of the pareto class b lognormal between classes c and d weibull depending on the tail parameter value gamma class d and exponential class e distributions more advanced distributions like the generalized gamma the generalized beta of the second kind the burr type iii and xii and many more have asymptotic behavior matching one of those simple tails papalexiou 2018 some typically used tail functions along with a description of their tail type are presented in table 1 for a random variable x with distribution function fx the mean excess function is 4 e x p e x x p x x p 1 f x x p x p x x p f x x d x x p 0 where x p f x 1 p is the lower threshold value for probability p and f x 1 p is the quantile function the function e xp is constant for distributions with exponential tails due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution thus if the empirical value of e xp vs xp is linear and the slope is equal to zero it indicates an exponential tail if the plot shows greater than zero slopes it might be an indication of sub exponential tails as the mean excess function tends to infinity for such tails cooke and nieboer 2011 additionally regularly varying tails with a tail index γ 1 have e x p x p γ 1 as x p cooke and nieboer 2011 mef slopes lower than zero indicate tails lighter than the exponential also called hyper exponential vela and rodríguez 2014 some examples are the normal distribution the gamma distribution for shape parameter γ 1 and the weibull distribution for shape parameter γ 1 fig 1 eq 4 can be easily applied to the distributions in table 1 with the corresponding mef expressions given in table 2 graphical illustrations are shown in fig 1 5 advancing the mean excess function method typically the mef method is to plot the empirical mef and visually inspect its slope in order to assess the tail of the observed sample this might be efficient for a limited number of samples yet it is subjective since it depends on visual inspection and is time consuming and impractical for large databases to overcome this weakness we extend this methodology by translating it into an algorithmic procedure for this we used extensive monte carlo simulations to assess the distribution and confidence intervals of the empirical mef slopes in samples drawn from exponential distributions particularly we 1 simulate 5000 random samples from the exponential distribution and for sample size n 2 for each sample we plot the empirical mef for xp x 0 9 x 0 99 fit a linear regression line and estimate its slope κ where x 0 9 and x 0 99 are the empirical 90 and 99 percentile sample values 3 we calculate the mean value μ n and standard deviation σ n of these 5000 slopes in order to fit a gaussian distribution i e k n μ n σ n which allows the estimation of the exceedance probability of the observed slope k that is pr k κ 1 φ κ μ n σ n where φ is the cdf of the gaussian distribution 4 the confidence interval ci for the slope and for level u is then estimated by 5 φ 1 u 2 μ n σ n φ 1 1 u 2 μ n σ n where φ 1 is the quantile function of the fitted gaussian distribution n 1 we repeat the process for different samples sizes that is for n 2000 3000 4000 5000 7000 10 000 20 000 50 000 we note that the selected sample sizes n cover the observed range of the sample sizes in the precipitation dataset we used we selected records having at least 3000 non zero values clearly any other sample size can be used also we have applied the anderson darling goodness of fit test to verify that the estimated slopes follow the normal distribution used in step 3 to simplify the applicability of the method for any sample size we need to construct a simple function to express the mean and standard deviation see step 3 vs the sample size n the estimated empirical points fig 2 a b reveal that the mean value could be described by a concave function asymptotically tending to zero the expected value of the mef slope while the standard deviation by a convex one tending also to zero a simple function with these properties is the 6 g n a 1 n b c particularly the fitted functions for the mean value and standard deviation vs the sample size respectively are 7 μ n 0 12 1 n 403 41 1 07 8 σ n 2 87 1 n 1 47 0 49 which offer an excellent fit fig 2a b noteworthy the mef slope is equal to zero for large samples as expected yet for smaller sample sizes it is biased the standard deviation as anticipated decreases with increasing sample size given the mean and the standard deviation of the mef slopes eq 7 and eq 8 we can easily form the probability density function pdf for any sample size examples for three sample sizes are given in fig 3 a obviously the pdf becomes less dispersed as the sample size increases additionally the slope s confidence interval given in eq 5 for any significance level u and any sample size can also be easily estimated by using eq 7 and eq 8 for example the 90 confidence interval significance level u 10 for the exponential mef slopes and for sample size ranging from 2000 to 50 000 is presented in fig 3b as expected the range of the ci decreases with increasing samples size 6 real world data we apply our method in daily precipitation records provided by the global historical climatology network www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets which includes data from thousands of stations from all over the world we selected stations having 1 at least 3000 nonzero daily values 2 record length greater than 30 years 3 missing values less than 20 and 4 values assigned with quality flags less than 0 1 in just a few records we removed unrealistically large values flagged in the database for more information of the quality flags used please visit the above mentioned website ultimately 21 348 stations met the above mentioned criteria and were used in the analysis fig 4 depicts the spatial distribution of the examined stations the empirical mef was estimated for each station and for threshold values xp corresponding to empirical non exceedance probabilities ranging from 90 to 99 thus the empirical mef for x 0 99 is estimated by at least 30 values in the worst case when the minimum sample size is 3000 values as an example we show characteristic graphics of the mef for two precipitation records having different tail behavior fig 5 the first mef plot fig 5a database station code asn00009035 indicates that the hypothesis of exponential tail cannot be rejected as the estimated slope k is 0 008 and the slope s 90 ci for the record s sample size n 3066 is 0 12 0 10 in contrast the second graphic fig 5b station code aj000037850 indicates a heavy tail the exponential tail hypothesis can be easily rejected as the estimated slope k is 0 31 and the slope s 90 ci for the record s sample size n 7682 is 0 08 0 07 see also fig 3b 7 statistical tests and results based on the previous section we can form two statistical tests first we test whether we can reject or not the hypothesis that the empirical tails of observed daily precipitation are exponential particularly the null hypothesis is that the tail is exponential and the alternative is that it is not for each one of the 21 348 records we 1 estimate the empirical mef and its slope k 2 estimate the confidence interval ci for the exponential case see eq 5 corresponding to the record s sample size n for specific significance level u and 3 we assess if the estimated slope k lies within the ci if it lies within the ci the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for the selected significance level u in contrast if the estimated slope lies outside the ci the null hypothesis is rejected which indicates that non exponential tails are more appropriate this test is illustrated in fig 6 where the empirical mef slopes of the 21 348 daily precipitation records are depicted together with the mef 90 ci for the exponential tails vs the sample size n analysis reveals that for significance level 10 two sided test 70 4 of the observed sample slopes lie outside the ci area this indicates that the exponential tail hypothesis is rejected for most stations the previous test reveals whether the exponential tail hypothesis can be rejected but it does not indicate if heavier or thinner tails than the exponential are more likely if the exponential hypothesis is rejected then the observed slope is either above the ci s upper limit which indicates sub exponential tails or below the ci s lower limit indicating hyper exponential tails based on this rationale we can form a statistical one sided test where the null hypothesis is exponential tail and the alternative is sub exponential or hyper exponential we can form the test by estimating 1 the sample mef slope κ 2 the slope s distribution for the record s sample size n that is gaussian with mean μ n and standard deviation σ n given respectively by eq 7 and eq 8 3 the exceedance probability of the observed slope κ that is p κ 1 φ κ μ n σ n now if p κ u then the exponential tail hypothesis is rejected at significance level u with alternative hypothesis sub exponential tails if p κ 1 u the exponential tail hypothesis is rejected at u with alternative hypothesis hyper exponential tails for example for u 5 and observed slope with p κ 2 which means that 98 of slopes is expected to have smaller values the null hypothesis is rejected with alternative sub exponential tails the spatial distribution of the absolute values of the 21 348 observed mef slopes of daily precipitation fig 7 a provides a general picture of where large or small slope values are observed for example we see the smaller values in eastern south america and the larger ones in central russia to put these values into context we tested the exponential tail hypothesis with the alternative being sub exponential tail we used three significance levels one sided test that is 1 5 and 10 with results showing that the null hypothesis is rejected respectively for 56 9 69 6 and 75 8 of the records the results suggest that even for a strict significance level 1 more than half of the daily precipitation tails cannot be characterized as exponential for the typically used 5 level most of the observed tails about 70 are heavier than the exponential the spatial distribution of the exceedance probabilities of observed slopes fig 7b indicates sub exponential tails at the 10 level in most parts of the globe with exception the eastern south america specifically lighter tails are observed in eastern south america eastern brazil uruguay paraguay and specific regions in central africa and central china heavier tails are observed in eastern u s central canada parts of india and south africa the heaviest are found in australia and eurasia with a hot spot located in central russia and kazakhstan 8 discussion the spatial distribution of the tail s heaviness shows lighter tails in eastern south america central china and india heavier tails are spotted in parts of north america while the heaviest tails are observed in australia and eurasia with a hot spot found in central russia and kazakhstan these results agree with previous studies investigating heavy and exponential tails in hundreds of daily station records in north america panorska et al 2007 most stations indicated power type tails rather than exponential gu et al 2017 also concluded that most of rainfall tails in china tend to be heavy stretched exponential tails were also found to describe daily precipitation with heavier tails noted in australia and eurasia and the lightest ones in the eastern south america wilson and toumi 2005 cavanaugh et al 2015 examined 22 000 rainfall stations around the world and also concluded that most of the tails are non exponential at the 95 confidence level 64 9 in the northern hemisphere and 60 2 in the southern this study suggested that heavier tails are observed in locations with significant topographical weather interaction and areas which are influenced by tropical cyclone landfalls such areas are the mexican gulf coast sections of coastal brazil the southeast coastal australia and japan the gulf and east coasts of the u s and east asian coasts and the taiga in contrast it was suggested that exponential tails occur when precipitation is generated by similar weather systems for example in central mexican high plateau the brazilian highlands and the east african highlands and california their results are in agreement with the findings of this study here we aim to provide a new diagnostic tool easily applicable to large databases for any variable of interest noteworthy several papers deal with tail discrimination in precipitation yet most of them show regional results and still only a few global studies exist although evidence shows that in most parts of the world precipitation tails are heavier than the exponential in hydrological practice exponential tail distributions are still popular actually many times are the standard choice for example the gamma and gumbel distributions are among practitioners typically the first choice this study reinforces past findings and further highlights that exponential tails should be used with caution the spatial variation of the tail s heaviness provided here could be used as a priori information for regional studies for example this could drive the choice of probability distributions at specific locations in regions where empirical heavy tails are observed candidate distributions for daily precipitation should at least be able to model such tails additionally the knowledge obtained for the daily scale can be used in the selection construction of intensity duration frequency idf curves idf curves are essentially probability distributions valid in a range of scales note that some idf estimation methods demand that the tail remains the same at all time scales however this may not be universally true in any case in regions with heavy daily tails we should use with extreme caution or even exclude idf expressions that assume exponential tails 9 conclusions here we form a new diagnostic tool for discriminating between exponential and heavier distribution tails the method is based on an existing graphical method the mean excess function mef the core idea is that the mean value of the exponential distribution above a threshold xp vs the xp is a zero slope line heavier tails have positive slopes for example power type pareto tails appear as positive slope lines the original graphical method although useful requires visual inspection which is be subjective and cannot be applied massively into large databases we overcome these limitations by reformulating the mean excess function into an algorithmic procedure we offer two variations of statistical tests that assess the exponential tail hypothesis for samples of any size and at any significance level this provides an easy to apply tool that eliminates the subjective character of the graphical method and makes it suitable for analysis of big datasets in the big data era we deem such tools offer additional diagnostics is assessing the behavior of extremes we apply the algorithmic mef using a big dataset of daily precipitation records particularly we studied more than 21 000 records focusing on the largest 10 of nonzero values analysis indicated that for a significance level of 1 5 10 one sided test the hypothesis of the exponential tail is rejected for 56 9 69 6 75 8 of the records respectively this implies that rainfall extremes on a global scale are better described by heavier than the exponential tails our results are robust and supported by other global studies using different methods cavanaugh et al 2015 papalexiou et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 wilson and toumi 2005 the spatial variation of the tail s heaviness reveals strong spatial patterns for instance evidence suggests exponential tails in eastern south america eastern brazil uruguay paraguay heavier tails based on the exceedance probability of the observed mef slopes are observed in western u s southwestern canada india and central china for these regions however the exponential tail hypothesis cannot be rejected at 10 significance the heaviest tails are found in australia and eurasia with a hot spot located in central russia and kazakhstan we deem that the algorithmic mef offers another weapon in the arsenal of diagnostic tools to assess the behavior of extremes its application in assessing precipitation extremes provides additional facts and evidence on the heavy tail character of precipitation knowledge of the tail behavior can support informed decision making and model selection for example typically used distributions and idf curves that assume exponential tails should be used with caution as they may severely underestimate return levels many precipitation weather generators should be also used with caution they are based on point processes or preserve the first few moments and thus they fail to reproduce heavy tails in such cases recent weather generators that reproduce any desired marginal distribution and correlation structure should be preferred papalexiou 2018 potential new applications of this method could focus on identifying in more detail tail types based on their mef plot curvature however this requires careful investigation in order to construct robust diagnostics as the empirical mef shows large variability and it is not easy to calculate empirical curvatures declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgement we honestly thank the reviewers for providing meticulous reviews which helped us to significantly improve this paper the data used in this study are freely available at www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets

maximum precipitations from a network of 21 stations in ontario canada papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 proposed the generalized gamma as a universal model for daily precipitation and suggested that exponential tail distributions like the exponential mixed exponentials or the gamma may underestimate the magnitude of extreme events gu et al 2017 examined 728 rainfall stations from all over china by applying the gev distribution and concluded that most tails tend to be heavy and unbounded papalexiou et al 2018 proposed a novel bayesian adjustment approach to distinguish the most appropriate tail between power type and stretched exponential tails the method was applied in more than 4000 hourly rainfall records and favored stretched exponential tails as a better model marani and ignaccolo 2015 compared the generalized extreme value distribution with the metastatistical extreme value mev and showed an agreement between mev estimates and the observed frequency of occurrence of extreme events zorzetto et al 2016 subsequently applied mev to a large dataset finding that the exponent in the stretched exponential used to construct the mev is typically 1 indeed suggesting a tail heavier than an exponential one although this study focuses on the analysis of precipitation extremes we note that harmel et al 2002 evaluated the adequacy of the normal distribution to simulate maximum and minimum daily air temperature and found that the measured variables are not normally distributed in each month but are often slightly skewed ruff and neelin 2012 examined observations of the national climatic data center and examined tail characteristics for daily average maximum and minimum surface temperature probability distributions while the core conforms to gaussian for most distributions roughly half the cases exhibit non gaussian tails in both winter and summer seasons loikith and neelin 2015 identified that north american regions exhibit shorter than gaussian warm tails 3 graphical methods statistical graphical methods constitute useful tools for exploratory analysis and tail discrimination el adlouni et al 2008 embrechts et al 1997 the log log plot is a popular choice especially in economics and finance beirlant et al 2004 the method exploits that power law or regularly varying tails appear as straight lines beirlant et al 2004 embrechts et al 1997 the max sum ratio plot is another method used to distinguish the distributions belonging to class c but not to d along with the generalized hill ratio plot beirlant et al 2004 these two methods are more robust than the widely used log log plot there is also a method using the jackson statistic beirlant et al 2004 which allows to test the sample s consistency with pareto distributions class b the mean excess function mef is another graphical method for tail identification embrechts et al 1997 discriminating distributions which belong to the class d sub exponential and the class e light tailed or exponential it was initially introduced by benktander and segerdahl 1960 the mef has been used in recent studies concerning rainfall extremes as a graphical method for selecting the threshold in peaks over threshold analyses beguería and vicente serrano 2006 chukwudum et al 2019 lana et al 2019 roth et al 2016 or for the selection of the best fitting distribution awadallah 2015 mef was further enhanced by das and ghosh das and ghosh 2016 who constructed confidence intervals for mef plots to ascertain the domain of attraction fréchet gumbel or reversed weibull of data they applied their methodology on simulated and observed datasets such as regional ozone concentrations and flow rates here we 1 update the mean excess function so it can be applied algorithmically and 2 apply the method globally using a big dataset more than 21 000 stations to assess the tail of daily precipitation extremes graphical tools are very useful in discriminating distribution tails yet their major weakness is the need for visual inspection which can also be subjective we overcome this limitation by translating an important graphical method into an algorithmic procedure this paper provides an easy to use tool to distinguish between exponential and sub exponential tails while it is tailored for analysis of big data sets we deem that in the big data era such extensions offer additional diagnostic tools in assessing the behavior of extremes 4 mean excess function the probability of exceedance f x 1 f x or else survival function for large values of x describes the upper tail of the distribution as aforementioned commonly used tails categorized in ouarda et al 1994 and werner and upper 2004 are those of the pareto class b lognormal between classes c and d weibull depending on the tail parameter value gamma class d and exponential class e distributions more advanced distributions like the generalized gamma the generalized beta of the second kind the burr type iii and xii and many more have asymptotic behavior matching one of those simple tails papalexiou 2018 some typically used tail functions along with a description of their tail type are presented in table 1 for a random variable x with distribution function fx the mean excess function is 4 e x p e x x p x x p 1 f x x p x p x x p f x x d x x p 0 where x p f x 1 p is the lower threshold value for probability p and f x 1 p is the quantile function the function e xp is constant for distributions with exponential tails due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution thus if the empirical value of e xp vs xp is linear and the slope is equal to zero it indicates an exponential tail if the plot shows greater than zero slopes it might be an indication of sub exponential tails as the mean excess function tends to infinity for such tails cooke and nieboer 2011 additionally regularly varying tails with a tail index γ 1 have e x p x p γ 1 as x p cooke and nieboer 2011 mef slopes lower than zero indicate tails lighter than the exponential also called hyper exponential vela and rodríguez 2014 some examples are the normal distribution the gamma distribution for shape parameter γ 1 and the weibull distribution for shape parameter γ 1 fig 1 eq 4 can be easily applied to the distributions in table 1 with the corresponding mef expressions given in table 2 graphical illustrations are shown in fig 1 5 advancing the mean excess function method typically the mef method is to plot the empirical mef and visually inspect its slope in order to assess the tail of the observed sample this might be efficient for a limited number of samples yet it is subjective since it depends on visual inspection and is time consuming and impractical for large databases to overcome this weakness we extend this methodology by translating it into an algorithmic procedure for this we used extensive monte carlo simulations to assess the distribution and confidence intervals of the empirical mef slopes in samples drawn from exponential distributions particularly we 1 simulate 5000 random samples from the exponential distribution and for sample size n 2 for each sample we plot the empirical mef for xp x 0 9 x 0 99 fit a linear regression line and estimate its slope κ where x 0 9 and x 0 99 are the empirical 90 and 99 percentile sample values 3 we calculate the mean value μ n and standard deviation σ n of these 5000 slopes in order to fit a gaussian distribution i e k n μ n σ n which allows the estimation of the exceedance probability of the observed slope k that is pr k κ 1 φ κ μ n σ n where φ is the cdf of the gaussian distribution 4 the confidence interval ci for the slope and for level u is then estimated by 5 φ 1 u 2 μ n σ n φ 1 1 u 2 μ n σ n where φ 1 is the quantile function of the fitted gaussian distribution n 1 we repeat the process for different samples sizes that is for n 2000 3000 4000 5000 7000 10 000 20 000 50 000 we note that the selected sample sizes n cover the observed range of the sample sizes in the precipitation dataset we used we selected records having at least 3000 non zero values clearly any other sample size can be used also we have applied the anderson darling goodness of fit test to verify that the estimated slopes follow the normal distribution used in step 3 to simplify the applicability of the method for any sample size we need to construct a simple function to express the mean and standard deviation see step 3 vs the sample size n the estimated empirical points fig 2 a b reveal that the mean value could be described by a concave function asymptotically tending to zero the expected value of the mef slope while the standard deviation by a convex one tending also to zero a simple function with these properties is the 6 g n a 1 n b c particularly the fitted functions for the mean value and standard deviation vs the sample size respectively are 7 μ n 0 12 1 n 403 41 1 07 8 σ n 2 87 1 n 1 47 0 49 which offer an excellent fit fig 2a b noteworthy the mef slope is equal to zero for large samples as expected yet for smaller sample sizes it is biased the standard deviation as anticipated decreases with increasing sample size given the mean and the standard deviation of the mef slopes eq 7 and eq 8 we can easily form the probability density function pdf for any sample size examples for three sample sizes are given in fig 3 a obviously the pdf becomes less dispersed as the sample size increases additionally the slope s confidence interval given in eq 5 for any significance level u and any sample size can also be easily estimated by using eq 7 and eq 8 for example the 90 confidence interval significance level u 10 for the exponential mef slopes and for sample size ranging from 2000 to 50 000 is presented in fig 3b as expected the range of the ci decreases with increasing samples size 6 real world data we apply our method in daily precipitation records provided by the global historical climatology network www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets which includes data from thousands of stations from all over the world we selected stations having 1 at least 3000 nonzero daily values 2 record length greater than 30 years 3 missing values less than 20 and 4 values assigned with quality flags less than 0 1 in just a few records we removed unrealistically large values flagged in the database for more information of the quality flags used please visit the above mentioned website ultimately 21 348 stations met the above mentioned criteria and were used in the analysis fig 4 depicts the spatial distribution of the examined stations the empirical mef was estimated for each station and for threshold values xp corresponding to empirical non exceedance probabilities ranging from 90 to 99 thus the empirical mef for x 0 99 is estimated by at least 30 values in the worst case when the minimum sample size is 3000 values as an example we show characteristic graphics of the mef for two precipitation records having different tail behavior fig 5 the first mef plot fig 5a database station code asn00009035 indicates that the hypothesis of exponential tail cannot be rejected as the estimated slope k is 0 008 and the slope s 90 ci for the record s sample size n 3066 is 0 12 0 10 in contrast the second graphic fig 5b station code aj000037850 indicates a heavy tail the exponential tail hypothesis can be easily rejected as the estimated slope k is 0 31 and the slope s 90 ci for the record s sample size n 7682 is 0 08 0 07 see also fig 3b 7 statistical tests and results based on the previous section we can form two statistical tests first we test whether we can reject or not the hypothesis that the empirical tails of observed daily precipitation are exponential particularly the null hypothesis is that the tail is exponential and the alternative is that it is not for each one of the 21 348 records we 1 estimate the empirical mef and its slope k 2 estimate the confidence interval ci for the exponential case see eq 5 corresponding to the record s sample size n for specific significance level u and 3 we assess if the estimated slope k lies within the ci if it lies within the ci the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for the selected significance level u in contrast if the estimated slope lies outside the ci the null hypothesis is rejected which indicates that non exponential tails are more appropriate this test is illustrated in fig 6 where the empirical mef slopes of the 21 348 daily precipitation records are depicted together with the mef 90 ci for the exponential tails vs the sample size n analysis reveals that for significance level 10 two sided test 70 4 of the observed sample slopes lie outside the ci area this indicates that the exponential tail hypothesis is rejected for most stations the previous test reveals whether the exponential tail hypothesis can be rejected but it does not indicate if heavier or thinner tails than the exponential are more likely if the exponential hypothesis is rejected then the observed slope is either above the ci s upper limit which indicates sub exponential tails or below the ci s lower limit indicating hyper exponential tails based on this rationale we can form a statistical one sided test where the null hypothesis is exponential tail and the alternative is sub exponential or hyper exponential we can form the test by estimating 1 the sample mef slope κ 2 the slope s distribution for the record s sample size n that is gaussian with mean μ n and standard deviation σ n given respectively by eq 7 and eq 8 3 the exceedance probability of the observed slope κ that is p κ 1 φ κ μ n σ n now if p κ u then the exponential tail hypothesis is rejected at significance level u with alternative hypothesis sub exponential tails if p κ 1 u the exponential tail hypothesis is rejected at u with alternative hypothesis hyper exponential tails for example for u 5 and observed slope with p κ 2 which means that 98 of slopes is expected to have smaller values the null hypothesis is rejected with alternative sub exponential tails the spatial distribution of the absolute values of the 21 348 observed mef slopes of daily precipitation fig 7 a provides a general picture of where large or small slope values are observed for example we see the smaller values in eastern south america and the larger ones in central russia to put these values into context we tested the exponential tail hypothesis with the alternative being sub exponential tail we used three significance levels one sided test that is 1 5 and 10 with results showing that the null hypothesis is rejected respectively for 56 9 69 6 and 75 8 of the records the results suggest that even for a strict significance level 1 more than half of the daily precipitation tails cannot be characterized as exponential for the typically used 5 level most of the observed tails about 70 are heavier than the exponential the spatial distribution of the exceedance probabilities of observed slopes fig 7b indicates sub exponential tails at the 10 level in most parts of the globe with exception the eastern south america specifically lighter tails are observed in eastern south america eastern brazil uruguay paraguay and specific regions in central africa and central china heavier tails are observed in eastern u s central canada parts of india and south africa the heaviest are found in australia and eurasia with a hot spot located in central russia and kazakhstan 8 discussion the spatial distribution of the tail s heaviness shows lighter tails in eastern south america central china and india heavier tails are spotted in parts of north america while the heaviest tails are observed in australia and eurasia with a hot spot found in central russia and kazakhstan these results agree with previous studies investigating heavy and exponential tails in hundreds of daily station records in north america panorska et al 2007 most stations indicated power type tails rather than exponential gu et al 2017 also concluded that most of rainfall tails in china tend to be heavy stretched exponential tails were also found to describe daily precipitation with heavier tails noted in australia and eurasia and the lightest ones in the eastern south america wilson and toumi 2005 cavanaugh et al 2015 examined 22 000 rainfall stations around the world and also concluded that most of the tails are non exponential at the 95 confidence level 64 9 in the northern hemisphere and 60 2 in the southern this study suggested that heavier tails are observed in locations with significant topographical weather interaction and areas which are influenced by tropical cyclone landfalls such areas are the mexican gulf coast sections of coastal brazil the southeast coastal australia and japan the gulf and east coasts of the u s and east asian coasts and the taiga in contrast it was suggested that exponential tails occur when precipitation is generated by similar weather systems for example in central mexican high plateau the brazilian highlands and the east african highlands and california their results are in agreement with the findings of this study here we aim to provide a new diagnostic tool easily applicable to large databases for any variable of interest noteworthy several papers deal with tail discrimination in precipitation yet most of them show regional results and still only a few global studies exist although evidence shows that in most parts of the world precipitation tails are heavier than the exponential in hydrological practice exponential tail distributions are still popular actually many times are the standard choice for example the gamma and gumbel distributions are among practitioners typically the first choice this study reinforces past findings and further highlights that exponential tails should be used with caution the spatial variation of the tail s heaviness provided here could be used as a priori information for regional studies for example this could drive the choice of probability distributions at specific locations in regions where empirical heavy tails are observed candidate distributions for daily precipitation should at least be able to model such tails additionally the knowledge obtained for the daily scale can be used in the selection construction of intensity duration frequency idf curves idf curves are essentially probability distributions valid in a range of scales note that some idf estimation methods demand that the tail remains the same at all time scales however this may not be universally true in any case in regions with heavy daily tails we should use with extreme caution or even exclude idf expressions that assume exponential tails 9 conclusions here we form a new diagnostic tool for discriminating between exponential and heavier distribution tails the method is based on an existing graphical method the mean excess function mef the core idea is that the mean value of the exponential distribution above a threshold xp vs the xp is a zero slope line heavier tails have positive slopes for example power type pareto tails appear as positive slope lines the original graphical method although useful requires visual inspection which is be subjective and cannot be applied massively into large databases we overcome these limitations by reformulating the mean excess function into an algorithmic procedure we offer two variations of statistical tests that assess the exponential tail hypothesis for samples of any size and at any significance level this provides an easy to apply tool that eliminates the subjective character of the graphical method and makes it suitable for analysis of big datasets in the big data era we deem such tools offer additional diagnostics is assessing the behavior of extremes we apply the algorithmic mef using a big dataset of daily precipitation records particularly we studied more than 21 000 records focusing on the largest 10 of nonzero values analysis indicated that for a significance level of 1 5 10 one sided test the hypothesis of the exponential tail is rejected for 56 9 69 6 75 8 of the records respectively this implies that rainfall extremes on a global scale are better described by heavier than the exponential tails our results are robust and supported by other global studies using different methods cavanaugh et al 2015 papalexiou et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 wilson and toumi 2005 the spatial variation of the tail s heaviness reveals strong spatial patterns for instance evidence suggests exponential tails in eastern south america eastern brazil uruguay paraguay heavier tails based on the exceedance probability of the observed mef slopes are observed in western u s southwestern canada india and central china for these regions however the exponential tail hypothesis cannot be rejected at 10 significance the heaviest tails are found in australia and eurasia with a hot spot located in central russia and kazakhstan we deem that the algorithmic mef offers another weapon in the arsenal of diagnostic tools to assess the behavior of extremes its application in assessing precipitation extremes provides additional facts and evidence on the heavy tail character of precipitation knowledge of the tail behavior can support informed decision making and model selection for example typically used distributions and idf curves that assume exponential tails should be used with caution as they may severely underestimate return levels many precipitation weather generators should be also used with caution they are based on point processes or preserve the first few moments and thus they fail to reproduce heavy tails in such cases recent weather generators that reproduce any desired marginal distribution and correlation structure should be preferred papalexiou 2018 potential new applications of this method could focus on identifying in more detail tail types based on their mef plot curvature however this requires careful investigation in order to construct robust diagnostics as the empirical mef shows large variability and it is not easy to calculate empirical curvatures declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgement we honestly thank the reviewers for providing meticulous reviews which helped us to significantly improve this paper the data used in this study are freely available at www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets 
566,a series of laboratory experiments and large eddy simulation les carried out to study the interactions of a solitary wave with arrays of blocks representing idealized beachfront buildings positioned at different arrangements show that formation of jet type channelized flow significantly alters the flow hydrodynamics delays wave breaking and influences the total loading on the blocks in the back row the staggered layout yields a 30 60 increase in the maximum force on the block in the back row compared to those of the single row and straight layouts while the latter creates the highest shielding effect the total number of primary vortices forming around the blocks is proportional to the number of sharp edges of the blocks the dimensions of the vortex tubes are controlled by the width of the block although vorticities were not directly measured the critical phenomena are accurately represented by the simulated flow field which was thoroughly validated using observations and measurements keywords turbulence wave pressure vorticity les overland wave propagation 1 introduction with rising sea levels and a changing climate shorelines are advancing landward placing coastal communities in flood zones in addition the population in coastal areas is expected to continue to grow noaa 2013 nicholls and small 2011 consequently the most pressing challenge for coastal communities is to enhance their resiliency against future extreme flooding events hence quantifying hydrodynamics of flood flows in a developed coastal area and identifying loading patterns on buildings are critical for resilient planning and design several studies have tried to improve estimations of wave induced forces on structures such as buildings seawalls jetties bridges columns and piers yeh 2006 used analytical and numerical models developed based on a fully nonlinear shallow water wave theory to study the wave force on objects in the swash zone for planar slopes maximum momentum flux envelopes were developed assuming that the momentum flux was proportional to the drag force for a stationary object the maximum momentum and hydrodynamic loading on the structures were found to occur near the still water shoreline yeh s results were consistent with the findings of carrier et al 2003 pedro et al 2007 studied the interactions of long waves with a square column using les and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans models validated by experimental data the authors stated that les resulted in more accurate predictions of wave structure interactions compared to urans riggs et al 2008 applied solitary and cnoidal waves for tsunami bores to measure the loads on a multistory building they conducted experiments to understand the bore impact on square and rectangular columns with different configurations in order to simulate the interaction of solitary wave with a beachfront structure a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model which predicted the wave run up wave load and overturning moments on the buildings was used by xiao and huang 2008 cuomo et al 2008 studied the effects of long waves on straight building units and units oriented with respect to the incident wave direction they showed that impulsive wave loading was more critical in assessing the vulnerability of buildings in flood prone areas cox et al 2008 conducted a combined experimental and numerical work for tsunami inundation of the town of seaside oregon their study showed that the water depth and momentum flux were drastically reduced landward goseberg and schlurmann 2011 2012 investigated the tsunami induced run up and inundation for four different configurations of blocks both experimentally and numerically they showed a strong correlation between runup and number of rows of blocks effective cross sectional area of flow and the layout of the blocks tomita et al 2006 studied tsunami wave impact on submerged breakwater by analyzing temporal variations of wave induced pressure on a vertical wall using experimental and 3 d numerical modeling work tomiczek et al 2017 conducted a series of laboratory experiments where tsunami like waves were generated by superimposing a solitary wave and a low frequency water level rise they showed that breaking waves resulted in impulsive wave pressures on the structure and the maximum wave pressure happened during this event the measured pressures were reported to be in good agreement with those predicted according to the japanese design code for non breaking waves however they concluded that the method prescribed by the design code resulted in underpredicted pressures under breaking waves this however could be related to the scale effect such as that described by bredmose et al 2015 a 40 70 pressure reduction was observed for the shielded structures compared to those exposed to direct breaking wave actions a set of analytical formulas validated using small scale experimental data on tsunami induced forces on rectangular buildings were presented by foster et al 2017 they observed that the inundation pressure on the structures was hydrostatic in the absence of impulsive wave breaking xie and chu 2019 carried out numerical simulations using both shallow water hydraulic equations and navier stokes equations to determine the tsunami impact force on a structure they concluded that at the time of impact the wave force on the structure situated in the wet zone rose to a peak and then settled down to a relatively constant value on the other hand the force on the structure located on dry zone was relatively insignificant xiong et al 2019 proposed a deterministic approach to evaluate the large scale building damages due to a tsunami wave impact by quantifying the lateral forces on the buildings they adopted a finite volume shock capturing numerical model solving the 2d nonlinear shallow water equations to predict the tsunami wave forces on a structure they simulated a hypothetical 1000 year tsunami event flooding the city of seaside oregon united states they found that the building damages were not very sensitive to the building dimension and manning coefficient corresponding to the macro roughness environment jayaratne et al 2018 experimentally and numerically investigated the hydrodynamic conditions and scour depths around structures subjected to tsunami waves fukui et al 2018 proposed a subgrid scale model for urban roughness parameterization drag force model dfm validated by an experimental study for tsunami inundation modeling they found that dfm performed better in the estimation of inundation distance and depth compared to structure resolving model srm conducting laboratory experiments is the most common approach used to resolve wave structure interaction

offshore wind turbine using openfoam they compared cfd results with the forces calculated using the morrison equation and reported that peak forces were underestimated by the analytical equations

highlighted the importance of a structure position in a layout on the resultant flow forces on the structure e g lynett 2011 the objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of building arrangement on the flow field and total forcing for inundated beachfront buildings by a solitary wave towards that objective a series of laboratory experiments on the interactions of a solitary wave and impervious blocks of different layouts are conducted the experimental layouts included two layouts a straight and a staggered array fig 1 a and b layouts a and b the flow field was measured and used to validate a three dimensional 3d les large eddy simulation numerical model openfoam the les model was then used to simulate an additional case single row layout where the solitary wave interacted with three blocks placed on a single row fig 1 c layout c a comparative analysis was performed for the three layouts to further quantify the effects of the layout on the local hydrodynamics including the evolution of turbulent flows and loading on the blocks in the following the experimental setup instrumentation and test conditions followed by a description of the numerical model computational domain model parameters and boundary conditions are described finally the results of the numerical simulations are presented and the findings are discussed 1 1 experimental setup experiments were conducted at stony brook university s coastal and hydraulic engineering research laboratory cherl the tests were executed in an integrated wave and current flume of 25 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m deep a solitary wave signal was generated using the flume s piston type wavemaker fig 1 f the still water depth was 0 38 m fig 1 a and b shows the plan and side views of the wave flume and the coordinate system adopted where x 0 m at the paddle and x increases towards the direction of wave propagation looking downwave the y axis is located at the right sidewall of the flume and is positive towards the opposite sidewall the z axis is located at the free surface and positive upward in these experiments the solitary wave propagated over a 10 25 m long flat bottom before arriving at the toe of a 4 2 m long beach with an approach slope of 1 15 followed by a 4 85 m long horizontal berm elevated 0 28 m above the flume bottom given the still water depth of 0 38 m in the flume the still water depth on the berm h was 0 1 m the beach berm platform was made out of smooth high density polyethylene plastic panels sharped edged wooden blocks with a cross section of 0 25 m 0 25 m and a height of 0 75 m were used to represent buildings the experimental setup was designed based on a 1 40 length scale the building dimensions and flow conditions followed the froude similitude two different blockage ratios 33 3 and 50 were tested in the present study by placing two rows of blocks with different configurations the blocks were placed on the berm and positioned as 3 3 number of blocks on the seaside row number of blocks on the leeside row layout a and 2 3 layout b as noted earlier a third layout layout c set as 0 3 was numerically generated to provide further reflections on the effects of the layout on flow and loading patterns layout c is the basic layout where three buildings in a row are exposed to flooding layout b reflects a scenario where the buildings in the front row do not appear to provide a direct shielding effect for the buildings on the back row layout a is selected because it represents a layout where the buildings in the front row appear to provide direct shielding for the buildings in the back row the blocks were evenly spaced and the side to side distance between adjacent blocks was 0 25 m which was equal to the block width l the distance between the side blocks close to the flume walls was set to half of the spacing between the adjacent blocks 0 125 m this resulted in a reduced wall effect by taking advantage of symmetrical layouts and flow patterns 1 2 wave generation the free surface time series of the target solitary wave was provided as input to the wave paddle software the time series was generated according to the analytical solution of a solitary wave given by munk 1949 fig 1 f represents the temporal variation of the water surface elevation immediately in front of the paddle this time series was used as the inlet boundary for the numerical model 1 3 flow field measurements edinburgh designs wg8usb resistive wave gauges wg with a sampling capacity of 128 hz were used to record the free surface elevations at various locations in the flume and among the blocks as fig 1 a b d and e illustrates wave gauges wg1 wg4 positioned at the centerline of the flume recording wave transformations along the flume and over the slope before the wave interacts with the blocks gauges wg5 wg11 were positioned on the berm to record water surface fluctuations among the blocks during the interactions the velocity field among the blocks was measured using three nortek vectrino acoustic doppler velocimeters adv at a sampling capacity of 25 hz the advs were elevated sich that they recorded the velocity at one third of the still water depth from the bottom the positions of the advs are shown in fig 1 d and e the coordinates of all the instruments used in experiments are summarized in table 1 1 4 repeatability of experiments the authors performed each experimental trial twice to compare the free surface elevations and velocities and ensure the repeatability of the tests the normalized root mean square errors nrmses for the measured water levels at wgs on the flat bottom beach and berm showed that the variations showed a difference of around 1 between the two trials the nrmse comparisons of the measured velocity data by the advs showed that the mean difference between the two trials was less than 7 5 among all three velocity components the streamwise u spanwise v and vertical w the measured quantities of the two trials were averaged and used for the model validation 1 5 numerical model the following section introduces ihfoam module a two phase flow solver designed to simulate

model the 3d numerical wave flume is modeled for layouts a b and c according to the experimental setup to reduce the computation cost the dimensions of the numerical flume were reduced to 17 6 m in length and 1 0 m in height the width of the numerical flumes for all layouts was 1 5 m the same as that of the experimental setup fig 1 a c the instruments whose coordinates are summarized in table 1 were defined as numerical probes in the model to record computed free surface elevations and velocity components the grid sensitivity analysis of the numerical model results was carried out by comparing the measured and simulated free surface elevations at wg1 wg5 wg9 and wg11 as well as the velocity components at the three advs the coarsest grid size 2 cm in all directions did not lead to satisfactory comparisons with the measure data the refinement of the grid to 1 cm lead to 5 to 6 improvement in the model results further refinement of the grid size from 1 cm to 0 5 cm applied to the domain in the region between x 10 m and x 16 m resulted in a slight improvement of the results approximately 1 5 2 due to the limitations in the computational capacity no additional refinement was possible the total number of the grid nodes was approximately 9 107 the no slip boundary condition is enforced for rigid boundaries including block faces flume side walls and bottom including the beach and berm the time series of water level for the solitary wave measured in front of the wave paddle fig 1 f was defined at the inlet boundary of the numerical flume a wave absorption boundary condition is applied at the outlet of the numerical domain to enhance the numerical stability the variable adjustable time step was enforced because of the limited memory of the cluster the numerical model output sampling rate was set to be equal to the sampling rate of the adv 25 hz the simulations used a dynamic time step setting with a maximum courant number of 1 0 to ensure the numerical model stability and convergence in all cases the numerical simulations were conducted for a physical time of 20 s the clock time of the computation for each case was approximately 35 h using 160 processors 2 1 model validation in the following the measured and simulated results for layouts a and b as well as the numerical model results for layout c are presented the numerical model skills in predicting the free surface elevation η and the streamwise spanwise and vertical velocity components are quantified using the normalized root mean square error and index of agreement ia introduced by willmott et al 1985 fig 2 presents the temporal variations of the normalized measured and computed free surface elevations at wg1 wg11 for layouts a and b the free surface elevation is normalized by the offshore incident wave height h the time t is normalized by the characteristic time defined as the ratio of the still water depth on the berm h and shallow water wave celerity c g h where g is the gravitational acceleration t t g h the nrmse e1 and ia e2 values for the water levels measured at offshore wave gauges located on the flat bottom of the flume are around 6 5 and 0 94 indicating the numerical model s capability in predicting the water level variations the error values increase by approximately 2 for the gauges on the beach the nrmse and ia values for the wave gauges on the berm range from 9 15 and 0 65 0 89 respectively the wave gauges measuring wave runup on the blocks wg5 wg7 and wg9 and the gauge measuring the transmitted wave height wg11 show relatively a greater disagreement with measured water levels compared to other gauges for wg5 wg7 and wg9 this could be because unlike the numerical runup gauges which were attached to the blocks walls in the experiments the gauges were not fully attached to the block s as a result a thin layer of flow rushing up on the surface of blocks could not be captured accurately during the test the values of ia for wg5 wg7 and wg9 indicate that even though the model performed well in replicating the runup heights there is a slight time lag between the measured and predicted quantities on the other hand for wg11 the water surface fluctuations are small and perhaps within the numerical model error margin as the wave propagates on the sloping beach its height increases due to the shoaling which is apparent in fig 2 at wg2 wg4 the wave impingement on the blocks in the front row results in a significant wave runup as shown in fig 2 at wg5 for both layouts a and b the measured and simulated free surface elevations at wg6 located between the blocks in the front row is almost twice the incident wave height for layout b wg7 on the side block b3 in the back row demonstrates a runup height comparable with that of b2 in the front row fig 2 b however the wave runup on the middle block in the back row b4 recorded by wg9 is significantly lower owing to the shielding effects by the front row despite being shielded by b1 wg8 in layout b which is approximately at the mid point between the front and back rows recorded a larger wave height than that of layout a on the other hand b4 in layout b which appears to be more directly exposed to the incident wave experiences a runup recorded by wg9 that is significantly lower than that on b5 for layout a for both layouts the transmitted wave height at wg11 is approximately half the incident wave height the measured velocity data were contaminated by noise originated from air entertainments and bubble formation during wave impingement and breaking similar to that described by tomasicchio 2006 a band pass filter functioning based on the signal correlation and signal to noise ratio snr was used to eliminate the noise from the velocity time series the average values of snr and correlation for each signal were determined and the quantities below the average values were identified as noise and thus eliminated in the present study for all adv data the average snr and correlation ranged from 10 to 12 and 80 to 85 respectively fig 3 shows the comparisons of the temporal variations of the measured and computed velocity for layouts a and b the velocity components u v and w are normalized by the shallow water wave celerity c the calculated nrmse and ia for the two layouts range from 10 to 45 and 0 23 to 0 96 respectively the computed streamwise and vertical velocity components show the most and the least agreements with thr mesured values respectively the residual noise is perhaps responsible for some of the discrepancies between the simulated and measured velocities in addition the model might not have been able to fully resolve the turbulence of all ranges due to mesh resolution overall the model demonstrates acceptable skills in predicting the velocity field for layout a the streamwise velocity becomes approximately as strong as the shallow water wave celerity c at adv1 and adv2 where the flow is channelized at the same time adv3 records a maximum offshore directed flow of nearly 0 5c which can be attributed to the formation of eddies on the leeside of b2 the spanwise and vertical velocities are weak compared to the streamwise velocity at the three advs for layout b adv1 and adv3 are somewhat shielded from the direct wave impact by b1 and b2 respectively however adv3 which is closer to the corner of the block and thus more exposed to the direct flow recorded a stronger streamwise current velocity the spanwise velocity which is as strong as the streamwise velocity of 0 75c at adv3 highlights the formation of eddies around the corner of the block adv2 on the other hand is located between b3 and b4 in the back row where the streamwise velocity is strong due to flow channelization the power spectral densities psd of the measured and simulated streamwise velocity are given in fig 4 the psd can quantify the range of scales of motions captured and their associated energies as fig 4 depicts the turbulent kinetic energy of the measured and simulated streamwise velocities are in good agreement across the frequency range for which the psds are plotted in fig 4 the production range and inertial subrange are shown as the regions with slope 1 f 1 and 5 3 f 5 3 respectively fernando 2012 the production range indicates the turbulent kinetic energy production due to low frequency coherent structures high energy eddies the inertial subrange marks the transfer of energy from lower to higher frequency coherent structures the dissipation range of the spectrum is associated with the small scale eddies minimum of which is known as kolmogorov scale where viscosity forces act to dissipate the turbulent energy of the system in a typical power spectral density the spectrum drops off at frequencies greater than that of kolmogorov scale since the maximum frequency shown in fig 4 is 12 hz 25 hz cut off frequency of adv s the dissipation range of the measured data is absent in the spectra the dissipation occurs at frequencies higher than the sampling rate of 25 hz on the other hand the slopes of the les computed spectra follow the slopes of the production range and the inertial subrange 2 2 results and discussions in the following flow field vorticity pressure distribution and maximum force are discussed 2 3 flow field fig 5 shows the 3d visualization of the simulated free surface elevation at five time instants during the interactions of the wave and the blocks for the three layouts the wave arrives at the blocks of the front row at t 114 for layouts a and b and at t 117 for layout c fig 6 shows the snapshots of the surface horizontal velocity normalized by the shallow water wave celerity u u 2 v 2 c for the three layouts the wave induced current is channelized through the blocks in the front row also seen in fig 5 a at t 116 1 the jet type channelized flow is shallower and stronger in the middle the maximum normalized velocity of this flow becomes as high as about u 3 0 fig 6 a at t 116 1 the wave impingement on the blocks of the front row results in a runup height of almost three to four times the incident wave height figs 5 and 6 a at t 116 1 during the impingement a thin layer of flow tlf runs up on the block front face as the tlf reaches its peak height droplets are formed before the tlf starts descending as a water column fig 7 the findings related to the formation of tlf are consistent with observations by mchugh and watt 1998 furthermore offshore directed bow like waves blws are observed similar to those reported by goseberg and schlurmann 2014 these waves are the product of the descending runup that inserts momentum into the flow these blws are apparent in all three cases e g figs 5 and 6 a at t 117 7 the incdent wave continues to propagate landward through the gaps between the blocks for layout a the diffracted wave merges from the two sides of the blocks in the front row and impinges on the blocks on the back row leading to a large wave runup on these blocks for layout a the momentum added to the flow by the descending runup on the blocks in the back row generates an offshore directed wave similar to the blw this wave however is trapped between the two rows bouncing back and forth until its energy dissipates figs 5 and 6 a at t 120 8 for layout b the runup on the blocks in the back row is a result of the direct wave impact this results in a runup height of approximately four times the incident wave height on b3 and b5 on the other hand the wave runup on b4 is slightly lower due to a smaller transmitted wave through the smaller opening between b1 and b2 compared to that between b1 and b2 and the flume walls fig 5 b at t 117 7 when the wave advances towards the blocks in the back row the diffracted wave merges from both sides of the blocks forming the jet type channelized flows for layout c the blocks are directly impacted by the incident wave this results in a runup height of more than three times the incident wave height fig 5 c at t 119 3 the blws propagate offshore following the fall of the runup flow figs 5 and 6 c at t 120 8 2 4 vorticity highly energetic turbulent flows marked by the intensified velocity are apparent for the three layouts fig 8 a c presents a visualization of the instantaneous near surface out of plane vorticity normalized by characteristic frequency c h for the three layouts the vorticity pattern displays a mirror symmetry consistent with the symmetry of the layout furthermore the vortices forming at the sharp edges of each individual block are symmetric these symmetric vortices spin in opposite directions soon after the wave impinges on the blocks a primary vortex forms at the sharp corners of each block the total number of the primary vortices in layouts a b and c are 24 20 and 12 number of blocks in a layout number of sharp edges of each block respectively this is consistent with the past laboratory observations and numerical modeling by the co authors arabi et al 2019 however the primary vortices on the leeside corners are greater in size and intensity compared to those of seasides of the blocks fig 8 a c the intensity of the normalized vorticity for the three layouts ranges between 5 and 5 but with quite different evolution patterns it is worth noting that for layout c the incident wave which begins to break right in front of the blocks resulted in the formation of out of plane vortices that are evident in fig 8 c at t 116 1 the breaking wave plunges into the water through the gaps between the adjacent blocks figs 5 and 6 this leads to a significant energy dissipation through the formation of vortices of various scales further landward fig 8 indicates that apart from the vortices formed around the edges of the blocks relatively strong vortices are formed where the plunging breaker occurs the intensity of the landward vortices are not as high as the ones formed during the wave breaking another interesting phenomenon is that bisecting vortices give birth to pairs of counter rotating doublet vortices fig 8 a at t 117 7 at leeside corners of the blocks in the back row and further onshore at t 119 3 in the following the evolutions of the primary vortices forming around the blocks b2 and b5 of layout a b2 and b4 of layout b and b2 of layout c are further discussed the positions of the cores of primary vortices are tracked in the animation created using the numerical model results during the period of t 114 5 124 then the trajectories of these primary vortices are plotted using the positions of the cores fig 9 for layout a the two primary vortices ω z1 and ω z2 originated at the trailing edge of b2 fig 9 a initially converge towards the block centerline over a distance of approximately 0 2 l before they diverge and enter the channelized high velocity currents between the blocks in the back row where the vortices break down to smaller eddies and eventually dissipate further landward a similar phenomenon is observed for the two primary vortices ω z1 and ω z2 for layout c except for the trajectory length which is slightly different from that of layout a fig 9 c on the other hand the trajectories of the primary vortices ω z3 and ω z4 forming at the trailing edge of b5 converge along the centerline at 0 8 l these primary vortices break down to smaller eddies and eventually dissipates further landward as well the trajectories of the primary vortices in layout b fig 9 b are markedly different from those of the other two layouts vortex ω z1 migrates towards the centerline of b2 over a path of 0 25 l long which is slightly longer than those of layouts a and c the arrangement of the blocks in the back row hinders the smooth flow of the channelized current established between b1 and b2 this leads to a reduction of the favorable pressure gradient and even formation of a returned flow which makes the trajectory of ω z1 bend towards the centerline of b2 before it is dissipated in addition vortex ωz2 bends towards the centerline of b2 before diverging from b2 and being carried away upwave by the return flow the other two primary vortices ω z3 and ω z4 also initially converge along the centerline of b4 and then diverge and are carried downwave to further analyze the characteristics of the vortices the q criterion hunt et al 1988 is used to visualize the vortices this technique identifies the vortices as flow regions with the positive second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor v i e q 0 the q criterion can be written as 9 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where ω and s are the antisymmetric and symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively the location direction and shape of a vortex can be identified by plotting iso surfaces with q 0 indicating the areas where the strength of the local rotation rate is larger than the strain rate here the magnitude of the q criterion is set to 100 large enough to allow for the detection and visualization of the primary vortex tubes while fading out small secondary vortices fig 8 d f shows that although the trajectories and spinning rates of the vortices are different the diameter of the two primary vortex tubes for layout a ω z1 and ω z2 and one primary vortex tube of layout b ω z2 are similar in size the size of the primary vortex ω z1 is approximately 3 4 of that of ω z2 in layout b on the other hand the size of the primary vortex tubes ω z1 and ω z2 in layout c is smaller 0 28 l m than those of layouts a and b furthermore the heights of the primary vortex tubes in layouts a and b are approximately 10 and 20 larger than those of vortex tubes for layout c the difference in the heights of the vortex tubes for layout b is dictated by the stronger jet type current forming between the b1 and b2 compared to that forming between b2 and the flume wall where the latter is 50 wider 2 5 pressure distribution and maximum force on blocks to provide further reflection on the interactions of the solitary wave with the blocks the total loading on a block positioned at the same location but situated within the different layouts is analyzed the analysis is presented for b5 of layout a b4 of layout b and b2 of layout c respectively twelve numerical pressure gauges pg1 pg12 were deployed on each of the aforementioned blocks extended throughout the block height fig 10 a c the total pressure is extracted from the numerical model results and normalized by the hydrostatic pressure based on the still water depth on the berm fig 11 shows the time stacks of the normalized total pressure p at the numerical pressure gauges for the three layouts although shielded by b2 the block b5 in the back row of layout a shows the largest wave runup among the three layouts i e b4 and b2 of layouts b and c respectively the second highest runup occurs on b2 of layout c where the wave breaks right in front of the block the ranges of the runup on the sidewalls of this block are almost on the same order of magnitude as those on the leeside walls however for layout a the gages on the sidewalls near the leading edge of the block pg4 and pg7 fig 11 a demonstrate a higher runup and a negative pressure above z h 0 50 during t 117 120 the negative normalized pressures at pg4 and pg7 are due to flow separation and formation of wakes at the sharp edges of the block this is further illustrated in fig 10 d as noted earlier for layout a the wave transmitted through the blocks in the front row is partially trapped bouncing back and forth between the two rows of blocks before its energy is dissipated this phenomenon is captured by the numerical model as shown in fig 11 a pg2 for layout b the wave impinges on b4 while plunging the entrained air during the breaking process results in a localized reduction of the total pressure due to the cushioning effect the maximum pressure however is the largest at t 116 1 fig 11 b pg2 for layout c as the wave propagates on the berm it begins to break immediately in front of the blocks resulting in a relatively high pressure area on b2 fig 11 c pg2 these distinct processes for these two layouts are highlighted in fig 10 e and f the effects of layout on the normalized force are presented in fig 12 a where the temporal variations of the normalized force for the three layouts are plotted together the normalized force is calculated by integrating the instantaneous pressure over the water column at each pressure gauge as fig 12 a suggests for each block the force is almost identical at pairs of gauges that are symmetric with respect to the incident wave direction although the wave runup is the largest for layout a the greatest impulse occurs at the centerline of the block for layout b followed by layout c fig 12 b shows the spatial variations of the maximum force across the width for b5 in layout a b4 in layout b and b2 in layout c it is also noted that the force is the largest at the centerline of the block s upwave face the maximum force on the upwave face is significantly larger for layout b followed by layouts c and a this large force for layout b can be attributed to the focused flow due to the channelization effect as described earlier on the other hand for layout a the sheltering provided by b1 leads to a drastic reduction of the force on b4 about half of that of layout b for layout c where b2 is directly exposed to the incident wave the maximum force is about 65 and 133 of those of layout b and layout a respectively the maximum forc on the side faces although significantly lower shows a different trend than that of the front face this force is the largest in layout c followed by layouts b and a the force on the back side is very small and similar among the three layouts the comparisons of the temporal variations of the normalized wave runup and force on pg2 fig 13 located at the front face of b5 b4 and b2 for layouts a b and c respectively indicate that there is a time lag between the maximum wave runup height and the maximum force on the block this lag corresponds to the difference between the time needed for a water layer to runup on the block surface to reach its peak and the moment when the wave collides with the block immediately imposing a force on it although the maximum runup heights for layout a and c are almost equal there is a noticeable difference between the corresponding maximum forces this can be attributed to the direct wave impact on the block in layout c which unlike that in layout a lacks the shielding effect on the other hand while the maximum wave runup height in layout b is significantly lower than that in the other layouts the maximum force is the highest for layout b due to the impulsive wave impact and formation of jet type flow these findings indicate that the maximum wave runup and maximum force on the blocks are not necessarily correlated 3 conclusions the present study shows that the block configuration is a key factor not only in the development of the maximum wave force but also evolutions and propagations of the vortices forming during solitary wave blocks interactions the key findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the wave height increases by approximately 50 while propagating over the sloped beach and on the berm in addition the run up height on the front faces of the blocks in the front row can reach up to four times the incident wave height 2 the flow field is significantly affected by the configuration of the blocks for all layouts the surface horizontal velocities are approximately doubled due to the flow channelization through gaps between adjacent blocks the psd comparisons of the measured and simulated streamwise velocities show that the turbulent kinetic energy of the model is consistent with the measurement in addition the jet type currents due to flow channelization appeared to shift the wave breaking landward this resulted in the modification of the wave impact on the blocks in the back row 3 the vorticity pattern is observed to be symmetric in the spanwise direction consistent with the symmetry of the layouts the symmetric vortices spin in opposite directions soon after the wave impinges on the blocks primary vortices form at the edges of the blocks in all layouts it is also observed that the total number of the primary vortices forming around the blocks depends on the number of sharp edges of the blocks a total number of 24 20 and 12 primary vortices are formed for layouts a b and c with 6 5 and 3 blocks respectively the trajectories of the primary vortices at the trailing edges of blocks are also found to depend on the layouts for layout a and b the primary vortices converge towards the block centerline before diverging and dissipating in the strong channelized curents on the other hand in layout b the arrangement of the blocks in the back row results in a stronger return flow that shifts the trajectory of the primary vortex towards the centerline of the channelized flow before it is dissipated although these vorticities were not directly measured the critical phenomena are believed to be accurately represented by the model predicted flow field which was thoroughly validated using observations and measured flow velocity and water surface at multiple locations and during extended period of time 4 the straight layout layout a was found to create the highest shielding effects resulting in the reduction of the maximum force on the blocks in the back row by approximately 30 compared to that of the single row layout layout c on the other hand the staggered layout layout b yielded an increase of the loading by 30 60 compared to the single row and straight layouts the findings of the present study are limited to the solitary wave and the array of blocks studied without considering the scale effect a more comprehensive study with different wave characteristics water levels and building array configurations is necessary for conclusive results regarding the flow field and loading patterns among near coast structures during extreme coastal flooding events declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment this study was funded by the new york state energy research and development authority nyserda under agreement no 105162 the authors would like to thank the funding agency for the support appendix the authors carried out additional numerical modeling by increasing the width of the numerical wave flume bf from 1 5 m to 4 0 m for the case with the highest blockage ratio layout a this channel width expansion increased the ratio of the total flume width bf to blocked width bo from its original value of rb 2 rb 5 33 then comparisons were made between the water surface elevations and velocity components as well as the force on block b5 the q q plots of the maxima of the normalized water surface elevations velocity and force indicate that the effects of sidewalls and blockage ratio on the flow hydrodynamics as well as the force on b5 were negligible fig a 1 
566,a series of laboratory experiments and large eddy simulation les carried out to study the interactions of a solitary wave with arrays of blocks representing idealized beachfront buildings positioned at different arrangements show that formation of jet type channelized flow significantly alters the flow hydrodynamics delays wave breaking and influences the total loading on the blocks in the back row the staggered layout yields a 30 60 increase in the maximum force on the block in the back row compared to those of the single row and straight layouts while the latter creates the highest shielding effect the total number of primary vortices forming around the blocks is proportional to the number of sharp edges of the blocks the dimensions of the vortex tubes are controlled by the width of the block although vorticities were not directly measured the critical phenomena are accurately represented by the simulated flow field which was thoroughly validated using observations and measurements keywords turbulence wave pressure vorticity les overland wave propagation 1 introduction with rising sea levels and a changing climate shorelines are advancing landward placing coastal communities in flood zones in addition the population in coastal areas is expected to continue to grow noaa 2013 nicholls and small 2011 consequently the most pressing challenge for coastal communities is to enhance their resiliency against future extreme flooding events hence quantifying hydrodynamics of flood flows in a developed coastal area and identifying loading patterns on buildings are critical for resilient planning and design several studies have tried to improve estimations of wave induced forces on structures such as buildings seawalls jetties bridges columns and piers yeh 2006 used analytical and numerical models developed based on a fully nonlinear shallow water wave theory to study the wave force on objects in the swash zone for planar slopes maximum momentum flux envelopes were developed assuming that the momentum flux was proportional to the drag force for a stationary object the maximum momentum and hydrodynamic loading on the structures were found to occur near the still water shoreline yeh s results were consistent with the findings of carrier et al 2003 pedro et al 2007 studied the interactions of long waves with a square column using les and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans models validated by experimental data the authors stated that les resulted in more accurate predictions of wave structure interactions compared to urans riggs et al 2008 applied solitary and cnoidal waves for tsunami bores to measure the loads on a multistory building they conducted experiments to understand the bore impact on square and rectangular columns with different configurations in order to simulate the interaction of solitary wave with a beachfront structure a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model which predicted the wave run up wave load and overturning moments on the buildings was used by xiao and huang 2008 cuomo et al 2008 studied the effects of long waves on straight building units and units oriented with respect to the incident wave direction they showed that impulsive wave loading was more critical in assessing the vulnerability of buildings in flood prone areas cox et al 2008 conducted a combined experimental and numerical work for tsunami inundation of the town of seaside oregon their study showed that the water depth and momentum flux were drastically reduced landward goseberg and schlurmann 2011 2012 investigated the tsunami induced run up and inundation for four different configurations of blocks both experimentally and numerically they showed a strong correlation between runup and number of rows of blocks effective cross sectional area of flow and the layout of the blocks tomita et al 2006 studied tsunami wave impact on submerged breakwater by analyzing temporal variations of wave induced pressure on a vertical wall using experimental and 3 d numerical modeling work tomiczek et al 2017 conducted a series of laboratory experiments where tsunami like waves were generated by superimposing a solitary wave and a low frequency water level rise they showed that breaking waves resulted in impulsive wave pressures on the structure and the maximum wave pressure happened during this event the measured pressures were reported to be in good agreement with those predicted according to the japanese design code for non breaking waves however they concluded that the method prescribed by the design code resulted in underpredicted pressures under breaking waves this however could be related to the scale effect such as that described by bredmose et al 2015 a 40 70 pressure reduction was observed for the shielded structures compared to those exposed to direct breaking wave actions a set of analytical formulas validated using small scale experimental data on tsunami induced forces on rectangular buildings were presented by foster et al 2017 they observed that the inundation pressure on the structures was hydrostatic in the absence of impulsive wave breaking xie and chu 2019 carried out numerical simulations using both shallow water hydraulic equations and navier stokes equations to determine the tsunami impact force on a structure they concluded that at the time of impact the wave force on the structure situated in the wet zone rose to a peak and then settled down to a relatively constant value on the other hand the force on the structure located on dry zone was relatively insignificant xiong et al 2019 proposed a deterministic approach to evaluate the large scale building damages due to a tsunami wave impact by quantifying the lateral forces on the buildings they adopted a finite volume shock capturing numerical model solving the 2d nonlinear shallow water equations to predict the tsunami wave forces on a structure they simulated a hypothetical 1000 year tsunami event flooding the city of seaside oregon united states they found that the building damages were not very sensitive to the building dimension and manning coefficient corresponding to the macro roughness environment jayaratne et al 2018 experimentally and numerically investigated the hydrodynamic conditions and scour depths around structures subjected to tsunami waves fukui et al 2018 proposed a subgrid scale model for urban roughness parameterization drag force model dfm validated by an experimental study for tsunami inundation modeling they found that dfm performed better in the estimation of inundation distance and depth compared to structure resolving model srm conducting laboratory experiments is the most common approach used to resolve wave structure interaction

highlighted the importance of a structure position in a layout on the resultant flow forces on the structure e g lynett 2011 the objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of building arrangement on the flow field and total forcing for inundated beachfront buildings by a solitary wave towards that objective a series of laboratory experiments on the interactions of a

flume and is positive towards the opposite sidewall the z axis is located at the free surface and positive upward in these experiments the solitary wave propagated over a 10 25 m long flat bottom before arriving at the toe of a 4 2 m long beach with an approach slope of 1 15 followed by a 4 85 m long horizontal berm elevated 0 28 m above the flume bottom given the still water depth of 0 38 m in the flume the still water depth on the berm h was 0 1 m the beach berm platform was made out of smooth high density polyethylene plastic panels sharped edged wooden blocks with a cross section of 0 25 m 0 25 m and a height of 0 75 m were used to represent buildings the experimental setup was designed based on a 1 40 length scale the building dimensions and flow conditions followed the froude similitude two different blockage ratios 33 3 and 50 were tested in the present study by placing two rows of blocks with different configurations the blocks were placed on the berm and positioned as 3 3 number of blocks on the seaside row number of blocks on the leeside row layout a and 2 3 layout b as noted earlier a third layout layout c set as 0 3 was numerically generated to provide further reflections on the effects of the layout on flow and loading patterns layout c is the basic layout where three buildings in a row are exposed to flooding layout b reflects a scenario where the buildings in the front row do not appear to provide a direct shielding effect for the buildings on the back row layout a is selected because it represents a layout where the buildings in the front row appear to provide direct shielding for the buildings in the back row the blocks were evenly spaced and the side to side distance between adjacent blocks was 0 25 m which was equal to the block width l the distance between the side blocks close to the flume walls was set to half of the spacing between the adjacent blocks 0 125 m this resulted in a reduced wall effect by taking advantage of symmetrical layouts and flow patterns 1 2 wave generation the free surface time series of the target solitary wave was provided as input to the wave paddle software the time series was generated according to the analytical solution of a solitary wave given by munk 1949 fig 1 f represents the temporal variation of the water surface elevation immediately in front of the paddle this time series was used as the inlet boundary for the numerical model 1 3 flow field measurements edinburgh designs wg8usb resistive wave gauges wg with a sampling capacity of 128 hz were used to record the free surface elevations at various locations in the flume and among the blocks as fig 1 a b d and e illustrates wave gauges wg1 wg4 positioned at the centerline of the flume recording wave transformations along the flume and over the slope before the wave interacts with the blocks gauges wg5 wg11 were positioned on the berm to record water surface fluctuations among the blocks during the interactions the velocity field among the blocks was measured using three nortek vectrino acoustic doppler velocimeters adv at a sampling capacity of 25 hz the advs were elevated sich that they recorded the velocity at one third of the still water depth from the bottom the positions of the advs are shown in fig 1 d and e the coordinates of all the instruments used in experiments are summarized in table 1 1 4 repeatability of experiments the authors performed each experimental trial twice to compare the free surface elevations and velocities and ensure the repeatability of the tests the normalized root mean square errors nrmses for the measured water levels at wgs on the flat bottom beach and berm showed that the variations showed a difference of around 1 between the two trials the nrmse comparisons of the measured velocity data by the advs showed that the mean difference between the two trials was less than 7 5 among all three velocity components the streamwise u spanwise v and vertical w the measured quantities of the two trials were averaged and used for the model validation 1 5 numerical model the following section introduces ihfoam module a two phase flow solver designed to simulate

model the 3d numerical wave flume is modeled for layouts a b and c according to the experimental setup to reduce the computation cost the dimensions of the numerical flume were reduced to 17 6 m in length and 1 0 m in height the width of the numerical flumes for all layouts was 1 5 m the same as that of the experimental setup fig 1 a c the instruments whose coordinates are summarized in table 1 were defined as numerical probes in the model to record computed free surface elevations and velocity components the grid sensitivity analysis of the numerical model results was carried out by comparing the measured and simulated free surface elevations at wg1 wg5 wg9 and wg11 as well as the velocity components at the three advs the coarsest grid size 2 cm in all directions did not lead to satisfactory comparisons with the measure data the refinement of the grid to 1 cm lead to 5 to 6 improvement in the model results further refinement of the grid size from 1 cm to 0 5 cm applied to the domain in the region between x 10 m and x 16 m resulted in a slight improvement of the results approximately 1 5 2 due to the limitations in the computational capacity no additional refinement was possible the total number of the grid nodes was approximately 9 107 the no slip boundary condition is enforced for rigid boundaries including block faces flume side walls and bottom including the beach and berm the time series of water level for the solitary wave measured in front of the wave paddle fig 1 f was defined at the inlet boundary of the numerical flume a wave absorption boundary condition is applied at the outlet of the numerical domain to enhance the numerical stability the variable adjustable time step was enforced because of the limited memory of the cluster the numerical model output sampling rate was set to be equal to the sampling rate of the adv 25 hz the simulations used a dynamic time step setting with a maximum courant number of 1 0 to ensure the numerical model stability and convergence in all cases the numerical simulations were conducted for a physical time of 20 s the clock time of the computation for each case was approximately 35 h using 160 processors 2 1 model validation in the following the measured and simulated results for layouts a and b as well as the numerical model results for layout c are presented the numerical model skills in predicting the free surface elevation η and the streamwise spanwise and vertical velocity components are quantified using the normalized root mean square error and index of agreement ia introduced by willmott et al 1985 fig 2 presents the temporal variations of the normalized measured and computed free surface elevations at wg1 wg11 for layouts a and b the free surface elevation is normalized by the offshore incident wave height h the time t is normalized by the characteristic time defined as the ratio of the still water depth on the berm h and shallow water wave celerity c g h where g is the gravitational acceleration t t g h the nrmse e1 and ia e2 values for the water levels measured at offshore wave gauges located on the flat bottom of the flume are around 6 5 and 0 94 indicating the numerical model s capability in predicting the water level variations the error values increase by approximately 2 for the gauges on the beach the nrmse and ia values for the wave gauges on the berm range from 9 15 and 0 65 0 89 respectively the wave gauges measuring wave runup on the blocks wg5 wg7 and wg9 and the gauge measuring the transmitted wave height wg11 show relatively a greater disagreement with measured water levels compared to other gauges for wg5 wg7 and wg9 this could be because unlike the numerical runup gauges which were attached to the blocks walls in the experiments the gauges were not fully attached to the block s as a result a thin layer of flow rushing up on the surface of blocks could not be captured accurately during the test the values of ia for wg5 wg7 and wg9 indicate that even though the model performed well in replicating the runup heights there is a slight time lag between the measured and predicted quantities on the other hand for wg11 the water surface fluctuations are small and perhaps within the numerical model error margin as the wave propagates on the sloping beach its height increases due to the shoaling which is apparent in fig 2 at wg2 wg4 the wave impingement on the blocks in the front row results in a significant wave runup as shown in fig 2 at wg5 for both layouts a and b the measured and simulated free surface elevations at wg6 located between the blocks in the front row is almost twice the incident wave height for layout b wg7 on the side block b3 in the back row demonstrates a runup height comparable with that of b2 in the front row fig 2 b however the wave runup on the middle block in the back row b4 recorded by wg9 is significantly lower owing to the shielding effects by the front row despite being shielded by b1 wg8 in layout b which is approximately at the mid point between the front and back rows recorded a larger wave height than that of layout a on the other hand b4 in layout b which appears to be more directly exposed to the incident wave experiences a runup recorded by wg9 that is significantly lower than that on b5 for layout a for both layouts the transmitted wave height at wg11 is approximately half the incident wave height the measured velocity data were contaminated by noise originated from air entertainments and bubble formation during wave impingement and breaking similar to that described by tomasicchio 2006 a band pass filter functioning based on the signal correlation and signal to noise ratio snr was used to eliminate the noise from the velocity time series the average values of snr and correlation for each signal were determined and the quantities below the average values were identified as noise and thus eliminated in the present study for all adv data the average snr and correlation ranged from 10 to 12 and 80 to 85 respectively fig 3 shows the comparisons of the temporal variations of the measured and computed velocity for layouts a and b the velocity components u v and w are normalized by the shallow water wave celerity c the calculated nrmse and ia for the two layouts range from 10 to 45 and 0 23 to 0 96 respectively the computed streamwise and vertical velocity components show the most and the least agreements with thr mesured values respectively the residual noise is perhaps responsible for some of the discrepancies between the simulated and measured velocities in addition the model might not have been able to fully resolve the turbulence of all ranges due to mesh resolution overall the model demonstrates acceptable skills in predicting the velocity field for layout a the streamwise velocity becomes approximately as strong as the shallow water wave celerity c at adv1 and adv2 where the flow is channelized at the same time adv3 records a maximum offshore directed flow of nearly 0 5c which can be attributed to the formation of eddies on the leeside of b2 the spanwise and vertical velocities are weak compared to the streamwise velocity at the three advs for layout b adv1 and adv3 are somewhat shielded from the direct wave impact by b1 and b2 respectively however adv3 which is closer to the corner of the block and thus more exposed to the direct flow recorded a stronger streamwise current velocity the spanwise velocity which is as strong as the streamwise velocity of 0 75c at adv3 highlights the formation of eddies around the corner of the block adv2 on the other hand is located between b3 and b4 in the back row where the streamwise velocity is strong due to flow channelization the power spectral densities psd of the measured and simulated streamwise velocity are given in fig 4 the psd can quantify the range of scales of motions captured and their associated energies as fig 4 depicts the turbulent kinetic energy of the measured and simulated streamwise velocities are in good agreement across the frequency range for which the psds are plotted in fig 4 the production range and inertial subrange are shown as the regions with slope 1 f 1 and 5 3 f 5 3 respectively fernando 2012 the production range indicates the turbulent kinetic energy production due to low frequency coherent structures high energy eddies the inertial subrange marks the transfer of energy from lower to higher frequency coherent structures the dissipation range of the spectrum is associated with the small scale eddies minimum of which is known as kolmogorov scale where viscosity forces act to dissipate the turbulent energy of the system in a typical power spectral density the spectrum drops off at frequencies greater than that of kolmogorov scale since the maximum frequency shown in fig 4 is 12 hz 25 hz cut off frequency of adv s the dissipation range of the measured data is absent in the spectra the dissipation occurs at frequencies higher than the sampling rate of 25 hz on the other hand the slopes of the les computed spectra follow the slopes of the production range and the inertial subrange 2 2 results and discussions in the following flow field vorticity pressure distribution and maximum force are discussed 2 3 flow field fig 5 shows the 3d visualization of the simulated free surface elevation at five time instants during the interactions of the wave and the blocks for the three layouts the wave arrives at the blocks of the front row at t 114 for layouts a and b and at t 117 for layout c fig 6 shows the snapshots of the surface horizontal velocity normalized by the shallow water wave celerity u u 2 v 2 c for the three layouts the wave induced current is channelized through the blocks in the front row also seen in fig 5 a at t 116 1 the jet type channelized flow is shallower and stronger in the middle the maximum normalized velocity of this flow becomes as high as about u 3 0 fig 6 a at t 116 1 the wave impingement on the blocks of the front row results in a runup height of almost three to four times the incident wave height figs 5 and 6 a at t 116 1 during the impingement a thin layer of flow tlf runs up on the block front face as the tlf reaches its peak height droplets are formed before the tlf starts descending as a water column fig 7 the findings related to the formation of tlf are consistent with observations by mchugh and watt 1998 furthermore offshore directed bow like waves blws are observed similar to those reported by goseberg and schlurmann 2014 these waves are the product of the descending runup that inserts momentum into the flow these blws are apparent in all three cases e g figs 5 and 6 a at t 117 7 the incdent wave continues to propagate landward through the gaps between the blocks for layout a the diffracted wave merges from the two sides of the blocks in the front row and impinges on the blocks on the back row leading to a large wave runup on these blocks for layout a the momentum added to the flow by the descending runup on the blocks in the back row generates an offshore directed wave similar to the blw this wave however is trapped between the two rows bouncing back and forth until its energy dissipates figs 5 and 6 a at t 120 8 for layout b the runup on the blocks in the back row is a result of the direct wave impact this results in a runup height of approximately four times the incident wave height on b3 and b5 on the other hand the wave runup on b4 is slightly lower due to a smaller transmitted wave through the smaller opening between b1 and b2 compared to that between b1 and b2 and the flume walls fig 5 b at t 117 7 when the wave advances towards the blocks in the back row the diffracted wave merges from both sides of the blocks forming the jet type channelized flows for layout c the blocks are directly impacted by the incident wave this results in a runup height of more than three times the incident wave height fig 5 c at t 119 3 the blws propagate offshore following the fall of the runup flow figs 5 and 6 c at t 120 8 2 4 vorticity highly energetic turbulent flows marked by the intensified velocity are apparent for the three layouts fig 8 a c presents a visualization of the instantaneous near surface out of plane vorticity normalized by characteristic frequency c h for the three layouts the vorticity pattern displays a mirror symmetry consistent with the symmetry of the layout furthermore the vortices forming at the sharp edges of each individual block are symmetric these symmetric vortices spin in opposite directions soon after the wave impinges on the blocks a primary vortex forms at the sharp corners of each block the total number of the primary vortices in layouts a b and c are 24 20 and 12 number of blocks in a layout number of sharp edges of each block respectively this is consistent with the past laboratory observations and numerical modeling by the co authors arabi et al 2019 however the primary vortices on the leeside corners are greater in size and intensity compared to those of seasides of the blocks fig 8 a c the intensity of the normalized vorticity for the three layouts ranges between 5 and 5 but with quite different evolution patterns it is worth noting that for layout c the incident wave which begins to break right in front of the blocks resulted in the formation of out of plane vortices that are evident in fig 8 c at t 116 1 the breaking wave plunges into the water through the gaps between the adjacent blocks figs 5 and 6 this leads to a significant energy dissipation through the formation of vortices of various scales further landward fig 8 indicates that apart from the vortices formed around the edges of the blocks relatively strong vortices are formed where the plunging breaker occurs the intensity of the landward vortices are not as high as the ones formed during the wave breaking another interesting phenomenon is that bisecting vortices give birth to pairs of counter rotating doublet vortices fig 8 a at t 117 7 at leeside corners of the blocks in the back row and further onshore at t 119 3 in the following the evolutions of the primary vortices forming around the blocks b2 and b5 of layout a b2 and b4 of layout b and b2 of layout c are further discussed the positions of the cores of primary vortices are tracked in the animation created using the numerical model results during the period of t 114 5 124 then the trajectories of these primary vortices are plotted using the positions of the cores fig 9 for layout a the two primary vortices ω z1 and ω z2 originated at the trailing edge of b2 fig 9 a initially converge towards the block centerline over a distance of approximately 0 2 l before they diverge and enter the channelized high velocity currents between the blocks in the back row where the vortices break down to smaller eddies and eventually dissipate further landward a similar phenomenon is observed for the two primary vortices ω z1 and ω z2 for layout c except for the trajectory length which is slightly different from that of layout a fig 9 c on the other hand the trajectories of the primary vortices ω z3 and ω z4 forming at the trailing edge of b5 converge along the centerline at 0 8 l these primary vortices break down to smaller eddies and eventually dissipates further landward as well the trajectories of the primary vortices in layout b fig 9 b are markedly different from those of the other two layouts vortex ω z1 migrates towards the centerline of b2 over a path of 0 25 l long which is slightly longer than those of layouts a and c the arrangement of the blocks in the back row hinders the smooth flow of the channelized current established between b1 and b2 this leads to a reduction of the favorable pressure gradient and even formation of a returned flow which makes the trajectory of ω z1 bend towards the centerline of b2 before it is dissipated in addition vortex ωz2 bends towards the centerline of b2 before diverging from b2 and being carried away upwave by the return flow the other two primary vortices ω z3 and ω z4 also initially converge along the centerline of b4 and then diverge and are carried downwave to further analyze the characteristics of the vortices the q criterion hunt et al 1988 is used to visualize the vortices this technique identifies the vortices as flow regions with the positive second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor v i e q 0 the q criterion can be written as 9 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 where ω and s are the antisymmetric and symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively the location direction and shape of a vortex can be identified by plotting iso surfaces with q 0 indicating the areas where the strength of the local rotation rate is larger than the strain rate here the magnitude of the q criterion is set to 100 large enough to allow for the detection and visualization of the primary vortex tubes while fading out small secondary vortices fig 8 d f shows that although the trajectories and spinning rates of the vortices are different the diameter of the two primary vortex tubes for layout a ω z1 and ω z2 and one primary vortex tube of layout b ω z2 are similar in size the size of the primary vortex ω z1 is approximately 3 4 of that of ω z2 in layout b on the other hand the size of the primary vortex tubes ω z1 and ω z2 in layout c is smaller 0 28 l m than those of layouts a and b furthermore the heights of the primary vortex tubes in layouts a and b are approximately 10 and 20 larger than those of vortex tubes for layout c the difference in the heights of the vortex tubes for layout b is dictated by the stronger jet type current forming between the b1 and b2 compared to that forming between b2 and the flume wall where the latter is 50 wider 2 5 pressure distribution and maximum force on blocks to provide further reflection on the interactions of the solitary wave with the blocks the total loading on a block positioned at the same location but situated within the different layouts is analyzed the analysis is presented for b5 of layout a b4 of layout b and b2 of layout c respectively twelve numerical pressure gauges pg1 pg12 were deployed on each of the aforementioned blocks extended throughout the block height fig 10 a c the total pressure is extracted from the numerical model results and normalized by the hydrostatic pressure based on the still water depth on the berm fig 11 shows the time stacks of the normalized total pressure p at the numerical pressure gauges for the three layouts although shielded by b2 the block b5 in the back row of layout a shows the largest wave runup among the three layouts i e b4 and b2 of layouts b and c respectively the second highest runup occurs on b2 of layout c where the wave breaks right in front of the block the ranges of the runup on the sidewalls of this block are almost on the same order of magnitude as those on the leeside walls however for layout a the gages on the sidewalls near the leading edge of the block pg4 and pg7 fig 11 a demonstrate a higher runup and a negative pressure above z h 0 50 during t 117 120 the negative normalized pressures at pg4 and pg7 are due to flow separation and formation of wakes at the sharp edges of the block this is further illustrated in fig 10 d as noted earlier for layout a the wave transmitted through the blocks in the front row is partially trapped bouncing back and forth between the two rows of blocks before its energy is dissipated this phenomenon is captured by the numerical model as shown in fig 11 a pg2 for layout b the wave impinges on b4 while plunging the entrained air during the breaking process results in a localized reduction of the total pressure due to the cushioning effect the maximum pressure however is the largest at t 116 1 fig 11 b pg2 for layout c as the wave propagates on the berm it begins to break immediately in front of the blocks resulting in a relatively high pressure area on b2 fig 11 c pg2 these distinct processes for these two layouts are highlighted in fig 10 e and f the effects of layout on the normalized force are presented in fig 12 a where the temporal variations of the normalized force for the three layouts are plotted together the normalized force is calculated by integrating the instantaneous pressure over the water column at each pressure gauge as fig 12 a suggests for each block the force is almost identical at pairs of gauges that are symmetric with respect to the incident wave direction although the wave runup is the largest for layout a the greatest impulse occurs at the centerline of the block for layout b followed by layout c fig 12 b shows the spatial variations of the maximum force across the width for b5 in layout a b4 in layout b and b2 in layout c it is also noted that the force is the largest at the centerline of the block s upwave face the maximum force on the upwave face is significantly larger for layout b followed by layouts c and a this large force for layout b can be attributed to the focused flow due to the channelization effect as described earlier on the other hand for layout a the sheltering provided by b1 leads to a drastic reduction of the force on b4 about half of that of layout b for layout c where b2 is directly exposed to the incident wave the maximum force is about 65 and 133 of those of layout b and layout a respectively the maximum forc on the side faces although significantly lower shows a different trend than that of the front face this force is the largest in layout c followed by layouts b and a the force on the back side is very small and similar among the three layouts the comparisons of the temporal variations of the normalized wave runup and force on pg2 fig 13 located at the front face of b5 b4 and b2 for layouts a b and c respectively indicate that there is a time lag between the maximum wave runup height and the maximum force on the block this lag corresponds to the difference between the time needed for a water layer to runup on the block surface to reach its peak and the moment when the wave collides with the block immediately imposing a force on it although the maximum runup heights for layout a and c are almost equal there is a noticeable difference between the corresponding maximum forces this can be attributed to the direct wave impact on the block in layout c which unlike that in layout a lacks the shielding effect on the other hand while the maximum wave runup height in layout b is significantly lower than that in the other layouts the maximum force is the highest for layout b due to the impulsive wave impact and formation of jet type flow these findings indicate that the maximum wave runup and maximum force on the blocks are not necessarily correlated 3 conclusions the present study shows that the block configuration is a key factor not only in the development of the maximum wave force but also evolutions and propagations of the vortices forming during solitary wave blocks interactions the key findings of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the wave height increases by approximately 50 while propagating over the sloped beach and on the berm in addition the run up height on the front faces of the blocks in the front row can reach up to four times the incident wave height 2 the flow field is significantly affected by the configuration of the blocks for all layouts the surface horizontal velocities are approximately doubled due to the flow channelization through gaps between adjacent blocks the psd comparisons of the measured and simulated streamwise velocities show that the turbulent kinetic energy of the model is consistent with the measurement in addition the jet type currents due to flow channelization appeared to shift the wave breaking landward this resulted in the modification of the wave impact on the blocks in the back row 3 the vorticity pattern is observed to be symmetric in the spanwise direction consistent with the symmetry of the layouts the symmetric vortices spin in opposite directions soon after the wave impinges on the blocks primary vortices form at the edges of the blocks in all layouts it is also observed that the total number of the primary vortices forming around the blocks depends on the number of sharp edges of the blocks a total number of 24 20 and 12 primary vortices are formed for layouts a b and c with 6 5 and 3 blocks respectively the trajectories of the primary vortices at the trailing edges of blocks are also found to depend on the layouts for layout a and b the primary vortices converge towards the block centerline before diverging and dissipating in the strong channelized curents on the other hand in layout b the arrangement of the blocks in the back row results in a stronger return flow that shifts the trajectory of the primary vortex towards the centerline of the channelized flow before it is dissipated although these vorticities were not directly measured the critical phenomena are believed to be accurately represented by the model predicted flow field which was thoroughly validated using observations and measured flow velocity and water surface at multiple locations and during extended period of time 4 the straight layout layout a was found to create the highest shielding effects resulting in the reduction of the maximum force on the blocks in the back row by approximately 30 compared to that of the single row layout layout c on the other hand the staggered layout layout b yielded an increase of the loading by 30 60 compared to the single row and straight layouts the findings of the present study are limited to the solitary wave and the array of blocks studied without considering the scale effect a more comprehensive study with different wave characteristics water levels and building array configurations is necessary for conclusive results regarding the flow field and loading patterns among near coast structures during extreme coastal flooding events declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment this study was funded by the new york state energy research and development authority nyserda under agreement no 105162 the authors would like to thank the funding agency for the support appendix the authors carried out additional numerical modeling by increasing the width of the numerical wave flume bf from 1 5 m to 4 0 m for the case with the highest blockage ratio layout a this channel width expansion increased the ratio of the total flume width bf to blocked width bo from its original value of rb 2 rb 5 33 then comparisons were made between the water surface elevations and velocity components as well as the force on block b5 the q q plots of the maxima of the normalized water surface elevations velocity and force indicate that the effects of sidewalls and blockage ratio on the flow hydrodynamics as well as the force on b5 were negligible fig a 1 
567,induced polarization is a geophysical method that has gained ground in the last decade in hydrogeophysics yet the acquisition of high quality induced polarization data may be challenging using the current technologies mostly because of capacitive coupling effects especially for short durations in the injected current in addition making a true 3d induced polarization survey is very tedious and time consuming in field conditions we discuss the advantages of a new generation of induced polarization equipment composed of individual stations able to measure the two components of the electric field along the ground surface we show how this approach allows for integrating the whole data avoiding negative apparent resistivity chargeability data the use of decentralized recording stations solves the issue of capacitive coupling effects we present a completely novel induced polarization data inversion methodology based on the measurement of the electric field components in addition a robust geostatistical inversion approach is discussed for recovering the conductivity and chargeability fields using the electric field components measured on the ground surface we also treat the case of time lapse monitoring by using a low rank kalman filter approximation which is computationally very appealing in terms of computational time and storage savings the effectiveness of the new methodology is demonstrated on several realistic synthetic case studies these numerical tests show that this electric field based approach is robust and very promising for applications in

duvillard et al 2018 the success of an induced polarization survey basically relies on two aspects i the use of an equipment able of recording high quality data ii the robustness of the numerical model used to invert these data including for time lapse survey currently available acquisition systems use cables to connect the different injecting and measuring electrodes and offer the possibility of reaching a depth of few hundreds of meters generally 500 m e g revil et al 2018b this classical approach has several drawbacks i performing true 3d surveys with cables can be a complicated task ii very long cables are needed for deep surveys iii data quality may be an issue because of capacitive and inductive coupling effects associated with the long wires recently a new generation of induced polarization instrumentation has been developed based on remote recording stations an example of such instrumentation corresponds for instance to the fullwaver e g truffert et al 2017 it gives the possibility of measuring the components of the electric field tangential to the ground surface there are no components normal to the ground surface this system uses a set of autonomous stations synchronized by the global positioning system gps as no wires are used between the transmitter and the recording stations this overcomes the issue mentioned above associated with electromagnetic coupling effects this configuration is also suitable for sites characterized by severe topography in the past the interpretation of electrical resistivity and induced polarization data through data inversion has been the subject of intensive research oldenburg and li 1994 presented three methods for time domain induced polarization data they show that the chargeability can be modeled as a perturbation of the conductivity of the medium loke and barker 1996 introduced a fast inversion technique of 2d resistivity data based on the quasi newton approach kim et al 2009 presented a 4d resistivity inversion approach that considers that the resistivity of the medium can change in time in a continuous way nenna et al 2011 used an extended kalman filter to invert time lapse electrical resistivity data to monitor temporal changes of electrical resistivity of a recharge pond although the kalman filter is very efficient for predicting the evolution of parameters in time for instance in geoelectrical monitoring it has never been used for induced polarization data the kalman filter approach is also difficult to apply for large scale investigations as they require assembling and storing large dense matrices to alleviate the computational burden involved in the implementation of the kalman filter one can compress the large kalman filter covariance matrix using low rank approximation techniques e g kitanidis 2015 li et al 2015 extended this technique to the nonlinear state estimation and applied it to synthetic co2 monitoring examples in addition matrix free approaches e g kitanidis and lee 2014 can be used to avoid the assembly of the jacobian matrix at each iteration of the kalman filter we refer to this large scale adapted kalman filter as the compressed state kalman filter cskf in this paper we propose a new method able to tackle three major points 1 we avoid the use of apparent resistivity data and we based our approach on directly using the two components of the electric field this gives the possibility of avoiding the presence of negative data which are often considered as biased data by practitioners and systematically excluded from the inversion process at the cost of potentially reducing the resolution of the inverted conductivity and chargeability tomograms 2 solving the induced polarization inverse problem by using a large scale geostatistical inversion approach as mentioned above 3 we develop a time lapse inversion approach for induced polarization by using a novel approach based on a low rank approximation of the kalman filter namely the csfk mentioned above in order to show the advantages of our approach we performed four numerical case studies in the first case we show the robustness of the geostatistical inversion approach in imaging the electrical conductivity and chargeability fields based on the two components of the electric field the second case presents the time lapse inversion of conductivity and chargeability data in the third case we discuss a time lapse electrical conductivity tomography monitoring of a saline intrusion in an aquifer the last case study involved the monitoring of water infiltration in a large portion of an unconfined aquifer considerable attention is paid to making the study cases physically meaningful especially in terms of the petrophysical relationships used to relate all the physical parameters with each other in a consistent way 2 measuring the components of the electric field when the current is injected into the ground the response of the medium can be recorded in terms of the electric field the development of such instruments makes it possible to record the electric field without the need for connecting the receivers through cables in practice this system is composed of two kind of units 1 a current recording unit that is connected to a transmitter it records the time stamped samples of the injected current during the survey 2 a set of receivers measuring the two components of the electric field these receivers are gps synchronized the current is injected between two electrodes a and b connected by a long cable the a electrode can be placed far from the area of interest then the second electrode b is placed at different positions that cover the region of interest this current injection line dipole can be set in any direction to increase the sensitivity with respect to the target this approach is also suitable for 3d surveys each recording station has two channels and is connected to three potential electrodes p 1 p 2 and p 3 these electrodes are placed so that the two orthogonal components of the electric field are recorded for each station fig 1 these two components can be seen as the horizontal components of the electric field e note that in the presence of topographic effects it will be more appropriate to designate them as the tangential components of the electric field the normal component of the electric field with respect to the ground surface is null since air is insulating using the relationship between the electric field and the electric potential the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are 1 e 1 δ φ 1 p 1 p 2 2 e 2 δ φ 2 p 3 p 2 where δϕ1 denotes the potential difference along the horizontal direction channel 1 δϕ2 denotes the potential difference along the perpendicular direction channel 2 p 1 p 2 and p 3 p 2 are the distances between p 1 and p 2 and p 2 and p 3 respectively one can use a fictitious electrode pf that can be placed anywhere along the direction of the electric field e so that this electric field can be written 3 e δ φ f p f p 2 i where δϕ f is the potential difference between pf and p 2 i denotes the unit vector defined in the e direction fig 1 pf p 2 denotes the distance between the fictitious electrode pf and p 2 using the intensity of the electric field e 4 δ φ f p f p 2 e 5 δ φ f p f p 2 e 1 2 e 2 2 6 δ φ f p f p 2 δ φ 1 p 1 p 2 2 δ φ 2 p 3 p 2 2 the apparent resistivity on the station can then be obtained by 7 ρ a k δ φ f i where k denotes the geometrical factor and i is the intensity of the injected current a similar reasoning applies for the apparent chargeability derivation in fact the apparent chargeabilities in the two perpendicular horizontal directions can be written as 8 η 1 δ φ 1 s δ φ 1 9 η 2 δ φ 2 s δ φ 2 respectively and where δ φ 1 s and δ φ 2 s denote the secondary potentials computed on channels 1 and 2 respectively similarly to eq 6 the secondary voltage obtained along the direction of e is 10 δ φ f s p f p 2 δ φ 1 s p 1 p 2 2 δ φ 2 s p 3 p 2 2 given that η a δ φ f s δ φ f we obtain after some algebraic manipulations see appendix a 11 η a η 1 δ φ 1 2 η 2 δ φ 2 2 δ φ 1 2 δ φ 2 2 alternatively one can decide to express all the data in terms of the electric field which is numerically more convenient in other words we solve the electrical potential equation to obtain the electric potential ϕ 12 σ φ i δ x x s δ y y s δ z z s where δ denotes the delta dirac function xs ys and zs are the spatial coordinates of the current injecting electrode once eq 12 is solved we compute the electric field as 13 e φ the intensity of the electric field is given by 14 e e 1 2 e 2 2 it is measured on each station and can be used as input data for inverting for the electrical conductivity as stated by siegel 1959 the effect of the chargeability η can be considered as a perturbation of the electrical conductivity field of the medium as σ 1 η eq 12 can be formulated in terms of the electric field the apparent chargeability η a at each station is given in the local system coordinate by see appendix a 15 η a 1 e t e 2 e η e η t e η where e η σ 1 η ϕ e ηt and et denotes the transposes of e η and e respectively in other words we need to solve the electrical potential equation twice one to compute the electrical potential associated to σ and one with the electrical potential associated to σ 1 η then the electric fields e and e η are used to calculate the apparent chargeability following eq 15 note that eq 15 can be rewritten as 16 η a e η e e η where denotes the euclidean norm i e x x t x eq 16 imlies that η a is a real quantity using eqs 6 and 11 or eqs 14 and 16 ensure that we are working with data sets that are made positive and therefore their logarithms can be used as input data for the inversion which generally reduces the artefacts in the tomograms 3 inverse scheme in this section we present an algorithm to solve the inverse problem it consists in retrieving the distributions of the intrinsic electrical conductivity and chargeability fields computed from the two components of the electric field measured on the ground surface including some error or noise in the measurements we propose to use a geostatistical inversion approach when working on time lapse data the parameters of interest i e the electrical conductivity and the intrinsic chargeability can also evolve in time therefore the inverse problem needs to be solved at each time step to update the fields and to compute the new changes in these distributions we propose to use a kalman filter approach for this purpose 3 1 geostatistical inversion the inverse problem for conductivity and chargeability is undetermined and is ill posed on way to address these issues is by imposing constraints on the desired solution usually in geophysics these constraints are imposed using horizontal or vertical smoothing of the model parameter distributions that said this strategy may lead to oversmooth tomograms alternative approaches exist for instance by using a covariance matrix based on a variogram to guide the inversion to converge towards the best solution whose spatial distributions are adequately being described by a given kernel such as gaussian or exponential one for instance one major limitation to this approach is the computation and storage of the covariance matrix in large scales applications where the number of unknowns can be very large a principal component analysis shows that actually the information contained in the covariance matrix can be accurately captured by its leading values which means that this covariance matrix can be compressed resulting in significant storage and computational savings e g kitanidis and lee 2014 this means that major features of the field can be captured by a low rank truncated covariance matrix in this regard kitanidis and lee 2014 adapted the geostatistical inversion to large scale problems by introducing the so called principal component geostatistical approach pcga using this approach the covariance matrix is never computed or stored products of the jacobian matrix with given vectors or matrices are evaluated without explicit storing of it in memory which allows for significant computational savings in the pcga framework we consider that the optimal parameter set is obtained by minimizing the following objective function 17 m i n s 1 2 d φ s t r 1 d φ s 1 2 s x β t q 1 s x β where s denotes the m 1 parameter vector to be estimated d is the n 1 data vector φ is the forward operator r is the n n data covariance matrix x is a m 1 vector of ones β denotes the scalar constant denoting the mean of the parameter field and q denotes the m m prior spatial covariance matrix the matrix q can be compressed for instance by factorizing it in a product of low rank matrices by using its eigen decomposition 18 q q k p k λ k p k t i 1 k v i v i t 19 v i λ i p i where k is the truncation order qk is the m mtruncated covariance matrix λ k is the k kdiagonal matrix of the first k largest eigenvalues of q pk is the m k matrix of the corresponding eigenvectors vi where λ i is the ith eigenvalue of q and pi is the ith column of p the choice of k is important it should not be too small to not loose information and too large to not loose computational efficiency a compromise can be obtained by making sure that k makes the truncation error small enough i e q qk q 1 which means that the ratio between the k 1 eigenvalue of q and the largest one is much smaller than 1 e g kitanidis and lee 2014 the norm is a given norm operator given that generally m n k m is the number of unknowns n is the number of measurements and k is the truncation order the low rank approximation of q yields significant computational savings the solution of the minimization problem 17 is now given by 20 s k 1 ξ d φ s k h k s k where k is the current iteration number of the inversion process hk is the n m jacobian matrix of the measurements with respect to the parameter model sk the vector ξ is found by solving the following linear system 21 h k q h k t r h k x h k x t 0 ξ β h k q x the jacobian products that appear in 21 can be computed as 22 h k x 1 δ φ s δ x φ s where δ is a finite difference step 23 h k q h k q k i 1 k ζ i v i t where 24 ζ i h k v i 1 δ φ s δ v i φ s and 25 h k q h k t h k q k h k t i 1 k ζ i ζ i t computing all the jacobian products i e h k x h k q h k q h k t only require k 3 forward computations which can lead to drastic computational savings for more details on the computational performance of the pcga method over traditional inversion methods the reader can refer to kitanidis and lee 2014 and soueid ahmed et al 2018 3 2 compressed state kalman filter retrieving the conductivity and chargeability fields is an estimation problem if we are considering time lapse monitoring these fields are expected to evolve with time and therefore we seek to monitor the evolution of their states in other words in addition to a spatial regularization a temporal one will be needed as well kalman 1960 introduced an iterative filter that used a series of data measured in time to predict the unknown parameters conductivity and chargeability in our case an advantage of the kalman filter is that it incorporates all the knowledge taken from the previous time data to estimate the current parameter field the kalman filter was extended to the nonlinear case by anderson and moore 1979 the so called extented kalman filter ekf in essence the ekf follows the same spirit as the kalman filter we consider a nonlinear system where the state variables are described as 26 s k 1 ψ s k ω k where sk denotes the estimation of the state variable at time k and ψ is the state transition model the quantity ω k represents any model errors such as poor knowledge of initial and boundary conditions or some other parameters related to the forward modeling the quantity sk and ω k are m 1 vectors and m denotes the number of unknowns similarly the observations can be related to the state variables as 27 d k 1 φ s k v k where φ is the discretized forward operator in our case it is given by the electrical potential equation v k is the measurements error vector d k 1 and v k are n 1 vectors with n the number of observations the ekf involves two steps a forecast step and an analysis one the forecast step consists in predicting the state variable at time k 1 while the analysis step can be seen as an update which seeks to improve the state variable using the observations at time k 1 in fact updating the state variables in the analysis step can be seen as a minimization problem in which the update state minimizes the objection function 28 l d k 1 φ s k t r 1 d k 1 φ s k s k 1 ψ s k k t c k 1 k 1 s k 1 ψ s k k r is n n the measurement covariance matrix s k k is the parameter estimate at time k based on the measurements up to time k likewise c k 1 k is the k k compressed covariance matrix at time k 1 based on the observation up to time k a major limitation of the conventional ekf appears in eq 28 indeed we need to compute store and invert the covariance matrix c k 1 k this is difficult for large scale applications a solution resides in reducing the dimensionality of the problem by approximating the covariance matrix by low rank matrices e g kitanidis 2015 following the same idea as the one presented in the previous section for the geostatictal inversion the covariance matrix c is approximated by a low rank approximation in the form 29 c c a v c a t where a is a m k matrix and vc is a k k symmetric positive definite matrix the idea is to fix a during all the kf iterations and to only update the compressed covariance matrix vc this algorithm will be referred to as the compressed extended kalm filter csfk in this work a is chosen to compose the k leading eigenvalues of a given covariance matrix that can be assembled using a variogram the initial small covariance matrix c 0 is given by a kernel matrix for instance a gaussian one the forecast step allows for computing the optimal state variable and its associated compressed covariance matrix 30 s k 1 k ψ s k k 31 c k 1 k a t a ψ c k k a t a ψ t v q where vq k k comes from the factorization of the covariance matrix q avqat a ψ h ψ a m k with h ψ ψ s s k k denotes the product of the jacobian matrix associated to ψ and the matrix a the analysis step updates the state and compressed covariance at step at time k 1 the state is updated using observations at the same time step 32 s k 1 k 1 s k 1 k k d k 1 φ s k 1 k the matrix k m n is known as the kalman gain it can be obtained from the solution of the following linear system 33 a φ c k 1 k a φ t r σ a φ c k 1 k where a φ n k is the jacobian product associated to forward operator f a φ h φ a with h φ φ s s k k then the kalman gain is given by 34 k a σ t the kalman gain plays a major role in the filtering process it acts as a weight for adjusting the state variables to better fit the observations inaccurate values of the kalman gain will lead to unrealistic estimates values and artifacts in the tomograms and may lead to divergence of the filtering process once the kalman gain is computed it can be used to update the compressed covariance matrix at time k 1 as 35 c k 1 k 1 i σ t a φ c k 1 k where i denotes the identity matrix at the light of the presented algorithm the computational advantages of the cskf can be highlighted 1 the full covariance matrix is never computed explicitly we only with deal with the small compressed covariance matrix which is updated at each time step 2 the jacobian matrices i e ψ s s k k and φ s s k k are never computed explicitly only their products are calculated such computation can be done efficiently using the finite differences scheme previously presented below cksf algorithm initialization step decompose covariance matrices as following c avcat

this new method of acquiring induced polarization data and the algorithms presented in the previous sections to interpret these data four synthetic case studies are presented for all the cases the data are acquired using the electric field components based approach 4 1 case study 1 the goal of this test is to benchmark the geostatistical inversion of the electric field components the domain of simulation is a volume of 1km 1km 100m see fig 2 we use the sgems software e g deutch and journel 1992 to generate hypothetical true electrical conductivity and intrinsic chargeability fields see figs 3 a and 4 a the electrical conductivity values vary between 10 3 6 s m 1 2 5 10 4 s m 1 and 10 1 8 s m 1 1 6 10 2 s m 1 these true fields are assumed to be unknown and the inverse scheme is used to estimate their spatial distributions they were generated using gaussian variograms γ h 0 5 1 exp h 100 2 for the conductivity and γ h 1 exp h 135 2 for the chargeability h is the distance expressed in m the variogram depicts the spatial autocorrelation of the measured sample points a variogram is characterized by a sill and a range the physical meaning of the sill is the total variance contribution the range is that pairs of parameter values at locations that are this distance or greater apart are not spatially correlated a total of 144 receivers are placed on the ground surface two current injection electrodes a and b are used the position of the electrode a is fixed and does not change during the acquisition process while the position of the electrode b is switched for each current injection at a set of predetermined locations this makes sure that we stimulate different regions of the domain to obtain complete information in the electric response in fact when the current is injected it propagates through the domain even in the deeper areas of the subsurface nevertheless it remains stronger at the vicinity of the injecting electrodes this suggests that the current injections should be performed in several locations across the simulation domain to avoid recording redundant data that do not improve the resolution of the final tomogram a total of 17 current injections are performed for each injection the electric field norm is computed on each of the 144 stations this means that the total number of measurements is 2248 as shown in section 2 the apparent resistivities and chargeabilities data acquired using this methodology are always expected to be positive an advantage of having positive data entries is that we can use their logarithms to invert the fields which is generally more stable this is especially true for datasets where there may be variations over several order of magnitude we first estimate the electrical conductivity field which is then used to estimate the chargeability field both inversions are launched with homogenous starting models that correspond to the geometric mean of the apparent electrical conductivity and apparent chargeability values to be representative of the field conditions the data have been corrupted with a 5 gaussian noise although true σ and η distributions have been generated with known variograms this is generally not the case on the field and the properties of the variograms need to be evaluated to construct the elements of the covariance matrix several approaches exist for estimating the variogram parameters e g soueid ahmed et al 2018 one can estimate them together with inverse problem unknowns or they can be deduced from our prior knowledge of the field for instance based on geological cross sections another approach consists in using experimental variograms to fit theoretical varigorams e g deutsch and journel 1992 kitanidis 1997 minsasny and mcbratney 2005 the idea is to use a theoretical variogram for instance exponential or gaussian and to solve a least square minimization problem to fit the experimental data the unknowns are the sill and the correlation length fig 5 shows the experimental σ and η variograms and the theoretical ones one last issue needs to be addressed before being able to start the inversion process that is the truncation of the covariance matrix as stated in the previous section for computational efficiency the covariance matrix is factorized into a product of low rank matrices this approximation accuracy is the related to choice of the truncation order k in other words k needs to be chosen in a way that will guarantee that the approximated covariance matrix still captures the major information about the field as explained in section 3 the relative error between the covariance matrix and its squeezed form should be 1 we chose k 125 which leads to an error of 0 001 the eigenvalues decay of the covariance matrix is shown in fig 6 for the σ and η covariance matrices this fast decay indeed suggest that the most relevant information for the fields can be described by the leading eigenvalues the domain of interest is discretized into regular rectangular cells the pcga method is used to invert the data the convergence is considered to be reached if after two consecutive iterations of the inverse problem the objective value function decrease is smaller than 0 001 after 5 iterations the convergence criteria were met for the inversion of the electrical conductivity fig 3b shows the inverted conductivity σ the major features are well reconstructed and the scatterplot of the true field against the estimated one shows a linear trend with a high coefficient of correlation r 2 0 80 this estimated electrical conductivity field is used in the estimation of the chargeability field after 7 iterations the algorithm has converged giving the chargeability estimate that is shown on fig 4b the inversion results are satisfactory and show high resemblance between the true and estimated chargeability fields see fig 4a and b the chargeability coefficient of correlation r 2 0 78 the magnitudes of both the chargeability and electrical conductivity agree with the magnitudes of the true fields as illustrated by the residuals fields and scatter plots shown in figs 7 and 8 4 2 case study 2 this case study is an extension of the previous case study but introducing now some time dependence the same geometry as well as the electrodes configuration of the previous case are used the numbers of measurements and unknowns remain unchanged that said in this case the electrical conductivity and the chargeability fields are not stationary to account for this we computed several realizations of the conductivity field and chargeability fields using the sgems software these true fields are represented on figs 9 and 11 they are generated with gaussian variograms each snapshot illustrates the spatial distributions of the fields at a given time the purpose of this case study is to see to what extent the cskf will be able to monitor the temporal evolution of the parameter fields all the input data are contaminated with a 5 gaussian noise the measurement covariance matrix is set to be diagonal with its entries given by e g lehikoinenen et al 2009 36 d i a g r k ω i a b s d o b s k m a x d o b s k where r k is the measurements covariance matrix at time step k ω 5 in our case i is the identity matrix and d o b s k is the observed data vector at time step k abs denotes the absolute value operator the initial covariance matrices for both the conductivity and chargeability are constructed using the properties of the variogram of the first time step these properties are assumed to be unknown and are estimated using the approach discussed in the previous synthetic case similarly to the previous case the truncation order was set to be k 125 as the true fields do not significantly change from an iteration to another one it is reasonable to choose the random walk model to update the state variables which means that in eq 30 ψ i the conductivities are first estimated fig 9 shows the predicted conductivities they are in general well estimated and the heterogeneities of the field are well recovered the magnitudes of the estimates are in the same range as those of the true parameters as shown by the residuals plots see fig 10 the conductivity at each step is used in the estimation of the chargeability at the corresponding time step using the cskf fig 11 shows the chargeability tomograms the anomalies of the medium are well reconstructed even if some smoothness is observed due to the effect of compressing the covariance matrices the uncertainties observed both in the conductivity and chargeability tomograms around the top right corner of the simulation domain are due to a lack of observation stations in this area indeed fig 2 shows that there is no station coverage in this region of the simulation domain the estimation seems to be less reliable at the beginning of the process i e the first two time steps in fact the csfk updates the current field based on the previous measurements which means that the more we iterate the more the information we accumulate for predicting the next state the residual fields fig 12 show that the uncertainties are larger at the first two time steps and they become smaller one last issue that deserves to be discussed is the kalman gain matrix as stated before the kalman gain allows for adequately adjusting the update of the state variables and the compressed covariance matrix each column of the kalman gain is related to a given observation in other words each column of the kalman gain matrix gives the sensitivity of the field to an observation fig 13 shows the two columns of the kalman gain matrix for the conductivity and the chargeability at the last time step as expected the kalman gain reaches its maximum values in the vicinity of the receiver at which the measurements are performed i e the corresponding column this means that the sensitivity to the corresponding measurements the 60th and the 1800th measurements is at its maximum around the location of these measurements this case study validates the csfk approach and the electric field components acquisition approaches for monitoring transient processes in the next case study we move to the induced polarization monitoring of a more complicated dynamic process 4 3 case study 3 this case deals with the modeling of a saline intrusion in a heterogeneous aquifer electrical conductivity imagining will be performed to delineate in space and time the evolution of the contamination as this phenomenon is governed by several aspects of physics we first would like to present these governing equations that is the groundwater flow and transport equations as well as the petrophysical relationships that connect the concentration of the salt to the electrical conductivity of the medium under steady state conditions and in a homogenous isotropic medium the groundwater flow equation reads 37 k h q we need to add some boundary conditions 38 h h d on γ d 39 n k h q n on γ n where h denotes the hydraulic head in m k denotes the hydraulic conductivity field in m s 1 q in m3 s 1 is a flow source term hd denotes the hydraulic head value imposed at the dirichlet s boundary while qn is the hydraulic flux in m3 s 1 imposed on γ n the unit vector n is the unit outward vector normal to the neumann s boundary γ n the transport equations are obtained by coupling two constitutive equations namely darcy s law and fick s law 40 u k h 41 j d ρ f ϕ d c ρ f c u where u in m s 1 denotes the darcy velocity hydraulic volumetric flux density jd is the salt flux in kg m 2 s 1 d in m3 s 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor ρ f in kg m 3 is the solute bulk density φ dimensionless is the porosity c dimensionless is the solute mass fraction the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor d is expressed as 42 d d m α α t v i α l α t v v v where dm in m2 s 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the salt at 25 c and at high salinities dm 1 44 10 9m2s 1 α denotes the tortuosity of the pore space product of the formation factor by the porosity α l is the longitudinal dispersitivity α t is the transverse dispersitivity and vis the average velocity and denotes the tensorial product the continuity equation conservation equation for the mass of solute states that 43 ρ f ϕ c t j d 0 inserting eq 41 into eq 43 yields the advection dispersion equation 44 ϕ c t ϕ d c u c 0 eq 44 can be completed by the following boundary conditions 45 c x t c 0 on γ u 46 n d c 0 on γ d where γ u corresponds to the upstream boundary where the salt injection takes place and γ d denotes the downstream boundary at the initial time t 0 we assume that c x t 0 where x denotes any spatial location of the 3d domain solving eq 44 allows for having the salt salinity for each time at any region of the aquifer on the other hand according to waxman and smits 1968 the electrical conductivity of the medium can be seen as the combination of a bulk conductivity related to the pore water conductivity σ f in s m 1 and a surface conductivity σ s in s m 1 related to conduction in the double layer coating the surface of the grains 47 σ σ f f σ s where f dimensionless is the formation factor f φ m and where m dimensionless is the cementation or porosity exponent m 1 in this case study we assume that σ s s m 1 is constant in the aquifer which means that the electrical conductivity changes in the aquifer are induced by the changes in pore water conductivity which are related to the solute concentration in fact the pore water conductivity is related to solute concentration though 48 σ f α c β β e where α is a constant used to account for the conversion of the unit of concentration from kg m 3 to molecules per m3 β and β are the mobility of the cations and anions in the pore water at 25 c β 5 10 8 m 2 s 1 v 1 and β 7 10 8 m 2 s 1 v 1 and e denotes the elementary charge of the electron e 1 6 10 19c combining eqs 47 and 48 allows for explicitly writing the dependence of the electrical conductivity on the solute concentration as 49 σ α c e ϕ m β β σ s now that the governing equations have been presented we describe the time lapse monitoring survey in this numerical case study we simulate the contamination of an aquifer by a saline intrusion the solute is supposed to be non reactive nacl salt the synthetic aquifer covers a volume of 1km 1km 100m a hydraulic gradient is created through the aquifer by imposing a 10 m hydraulic head at one vertical boundary and a 5 m hydraulic head at the opposite boundary the porosity of the aquifer is constant φ 0 30 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is heterogeneous and varies between 10 7m s 1 and 10 3 m s 1 this hydraulic conductivity field was generated using an exponential variogram the migration of the contaminant occurs due to the natural hydraulic gradient through the diffusion and advection processes the contamination is assumed to take place at the left vertical boundary at a rate of 2 kg m 3 the transport equation is solved for a period of 10 days using a time step of 1h this allows for mapping the nacl plume evolution throughout the aquifer for different times the contamination starts from the left region of the aquifer where the time dependent boundary condition is applied and progressively moves across preferential pathways to reach the right boundary after approximately 10 days while augmenting the solute concentration in the aquifer since the electrical conductivity of the medium is related to the solute concentration electrical conductivity imaging is expected to reveals some information about the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the solute plume we assume that the surface conductivity is constant in the aquifer and equals to 10 2 s m 1 an electrical resistivity tomography survey using decentralized stations is performed using a grid of 144 stations placed as in case study 1 the injecting electrode a is placed at the point of coordinate 10 m 10 m 0 m and the second injecting electrode is moving between the stations 17 current injections are performed resulting in a 2448 electric field intensity measurements the injected current has an intensity of 1 a the domain of simulation is discretized into 8 000 regular cells the initial covariance matrix is constructed based on an exponential kernel whose parameters are estimated using the least mean square approach presented in the first study case the truncation order is k 125 this is a reasonable choice given the fast decay of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix the electric field data were intentionally contaminated with a 5 gaussian noise the random walk model is used to update the state variable this means that we do not expect the conductivity to abruptly or quickly change within two consecutive time steps eq 49 is used to derive the electrical conductivity from the solute concentration these conductivity fields are considered to be the true conductivity fields and are used to generate to the electric field data the cskf is then used to predict the evolution of the electrical conductivity for 6 observation times 1 day 2 days 3 days 4 days 5 days 6 days fig 14 shows snapshots of the simulated and estimated electrical conductivities we can notice that the main features of the electric conductivity front resulting from the pollutant transport are well captured and they follow as well the structures of the solute concentration the estimated parameters have a high resolution even for the first time steps where the diffusion process just start to emerge table 1 lists the rms and r 2 values of the true and estimated parameters the low rms and large r 2 values indeed suggest that at least the major features are well resolved the residuals field are plotted on fig 15 one can see that the uncertainties are relatively low even in the vicinity of the bottom of the domain this shows that the contaminant can be tracked even in the deeper areas of the aquifer without the need of installing electrodes in boreholes which is both expensive because of the high cost of drilling and tedious finally we would like to stress that although saline intrusions generally take more time to occur over a kilometric distance we believe that is case study remains interesting for proving the ability of the new system that we present to capture the evolution of large scale physical processes that are of interest for the hydrogeology community such as saline intrusion 4 4 case study 4 in this case study we simulate a recharge experiment in a 1km 1km 200m region this domain is considered to be variably saturated geophysical methods such as the induced polarization method can be used to map the infiltration of water in the vadoze zone and monitor the recharge of the saturated zone of the aquifer from a numerical point of view this requires modelling the groundwater flow and the electric mechanisms associated with it to simulate the groundwater flow in a variably saturated medium the richard s equation needs to solved this will give the saturation of the water in the medium which in turns can be used to compute the electrical conductivity and the chargeability we first briefly recall the constitutive equations and petrophysical relations used to describe the saturation processes richard s equation e g richards 1931 is

plus the effect of sorbed water on the surface of the grains woodruff and revil 2011 revil and lu 2013 the electrical conductivity of the medium can then be expressed in terms of the saturation as e g

study are reported in table 2 we set atmospheric pressure on the bottom boundary and no flow boundaries on the lateral boundaries at the ground surface a no flow boundary condition is assigned expect at the central part of the ground surface where the following hydraulic head boundary was assigned 56 h t 3 e x p t 2 this boundary condition simulates the progressive infiltration of the water through the central area of the ground surface the remaining region of the ground surface of the domain is modeled to be impermeable once the water saturation has been obtained it can be used to compute the electrical conductivity of the medium using eq 55 the recharge experiment is simulated for 150 hours with measurements recorded at every hour an electrical resistivity survey is performed on the site using the same stations configuration as the one described in study case 1 and resulting in 2448 electric field intensity measurements the cskf is used to predict the electrical conductivity and chargeability changes during the injection the saturated permeability is 6 10 8 m2 the domain is discretized into 8 000 unknowns and the truncation order k 125 fig 16 shows the snapshots of the computed and estimated electrical conductivity distributions resepctively the snapshots capture the evolution of the groundwater intrusion in the domain the computed and estimated electrical conductivities follow the same patterns and have the same magnitudes the residuals fig 17 show that the csfk accurately predicts the electrical conductivity evolution all these results show that geoelectrical methods are an excellent tool for monitoring diffusion processes of contaminants in porous media the use of recently developed systems such as the fullwaver system allows for more easily imaging the evolution of these processes in 3d 5 conclusion we presented and discussed a new methodology for acquiring treating and inverting time domain induced polarization and resistivity data with the new generation of induced polarization instrumentation such as the fullwaver system one can directly work on the components of the electrical field and by using some mathematical derivations as shown in the paper ensures that the apparent resistivities and chargeabilties are positive this will ensure that all the measurements can be taken into account and thus no potentially relevant information is omitted from the inverted tomograms in practice the receivers are small decentralized stations that are not linked via cables this advantage solves the issue of capacitive couplings and therefore avoids dealing with unphysical data from a numerical point of view two approaches were used 1 a geostatistical inversion approach that takes the electric field component as data input and performs the estimation of the parameters of interest that is the electrical conductivity and chargeability 2 for time lapse monitoring a compressed kalman filter approach for predicting conductivity and chargeability changes both approaches are large scale oriented as they reduce the dimensionality of the inverse problem and therefore do not require the assembly of large dense jacobian matrices or the computation and storage of covariance matrices these numerical approaches were validated on four synthetic case studies that mimic realistic scenarios including contaminants tracking and the monitoring of water infiltration in an unconfined aquifer many perspectives can be given to the present work for instance in aquifer characterization this equipment could be also used to passively measure the streaming potential responses associated with a series of harmonic pumping tests performed on the aquifer and to perform a joint inversion of the self potential and hydraulic head data to characterize the aquifer for co2 storage in deep geological formation the system can be used to monitor the spreading of the injected co2 plume the numerical tools presented in this paper permit a significant reduction of the computational burden associated with large scale inversion and time lapse monitoring and makes the use of the fullwaver system practicable for the

567,induced polarization is a geophysical method that has gained ground in the last decade in hydrogeophysics yet the acquisition of high quality induced polarization data may be challenging using the current technologies mostly because of capacitive coupling effects especially for short durations in the injected current in addition making a true 3d induced polarization survey is very tedious and time consuming in field conditions we discuss the advantages of a new generation of induced polarization equipment composed of individual stations able to measure the two components of the electric field along the ground surface we show how this approach allows for integrating the whole data avoiding negative apparent resistivity chargeability data the use of decentralized recording stations solves the issue of capacitive coupling effects we present a completely novel induced polarization data inversion methodology based on the measurement of the electric field components in addition a robust geostatistical inversion approach is discussed for recovering the conductivity and chargeability fields using the electric field components measured on the ground surface we also treat the case of time lapse monitoring by using a low rank kalman filter approximation which is computationally very appealing in terms of computational time and storage savings the effectiveness of the new methodology is demonstrated on several realistic synthetic case studies these numerical tests show that this electric field based approach is robust and very promising for applications in hydrogeophysics keywords hydrogeophysics electrical resistivity tomography inverse theory numerical modelling tomography electrical properties 1 introduction geoelectrical methods such as the electrical resistivity tomography and induced polarization methods are widely used to image the structures and dynamic processes of the subsurface in practice performing an electrical resistivity tomography or induced polarization survey is relatively easy it mainly consists in laying out a series of electrodes and switching on the equipment to perform the measurements the same equipment can be used for acquiring both resistivity and induced polarization data electrical resistivity tomography has been adopted for various applications in the field of hydrogeology e g daily et al 1992

to study and locate leaks in dams and enbamkments e g chambers et al 2006 lucas et al 2017 and for agriculture e g samouëlian et al 2005 while electrical resistivity tomography is restricted to mapping the electrical resistivity of the medium the induced polarization method goes beyond this scope by offering the possibility of characterizing an additional physical property of the subsurface namely the chargeability schlumberger 1920 chargeability describes the ability of subsurface porous materials to reversibly store electrical charges under the application of an external electrical field historically induced polarization was first developed for ore body exploration e g bleil 1953 van voorhis et al 1973 zonge and wynn 1975 pelton 1978 telford et al 1990 oldenburg et al 1997 and

duvillard et al 2018 the success of an induced polarization survey basically relies on two aspects i the use of an equipment able of recording high quality data ii the robustness of the numerical model used to invert these data including for time lapse survey currently available acquisition systems use cables to connect the different injecting and measuring electrodes and offer the possibility of reaching a depth of few hundreds of meters generally 500 m e g revil et al 2018b this classical approach has several drawbacks i performing true 3d surveys with cables can be a complicated task ii very long cables are needed for deep surveys iii data quality may be an issue because of capacitive and inductive coupling effects associated with the long wires recently a new generation of induced polarization instrumentation has been developed based on remote recording stations an example of such instrumentation corresponds for instance to the fullwaver e g truffert et al 2017 it gives the possibility of measuring the components of the electric field tangential to the ground surface there are no components normal to the ground surface this system uses a set of autonomous stations synchronized by the global positioning system gps as no wires are used between the transmitter and the recording stations this overcomes the issue mentioned above associated with electromagnetic coupling effects this configuration is also suitable for sites characterized by severe topography in the past the interpretation of electrical resistivity and induced polarization data through data inversion has been the subject of intensive research oldenburg and li 1994 presented three methods for time domain induced polarization data they show that the chargeability can be modeled as a perturbation of the conductivity of the medium loke and barker 1996 introduced a fast inversion technique of 2d resistivity data based on the quasi newton approach kim et al 2009 presented a 4d resistivity inversion approach that considers that the resistivity of the medium can change in time in a continuous way nenna et al 2011 used an extended kalman filter to invert time lapse electrical resistivity data to monitor temporal changes of electrical resistivity of a recharge pond although the kalman filter is very efficient for predicting the evolution of parameters in time for instance in geoelectrical monitoring it has never been used for induced polarization data the kalman filter approach is also difficult to apply for large scale investigations as they require assembling and storing large dense matrices to alleviate the computational burden involved in the implementation of the kalman filter one can compress the large kalman filter covariance matrix using low rank approximation techniques e g kitanidis 2015 li et al 2015 extended this technique to the nonlinear state estimation and applied it to synthetic co2 monitoring examples in addition matrix free approaches e g kitanidis and lee 2014 can be used to avoid the assembly of the jacobian matrix at each iteration of the kalman filter we refer to this large scale adapted kalman filter as the compressed state kalman filter cskf in this paper we propose a new method able to tackle three major points 1 we avoid the use of apparent resistivity data and we based our approach on directly using the two components of the electric field this gives the possibility of avoiding the presence of negative data which are often considered as biased data by practitioners and systematically excluded from the inversion process at the cost of potentially reducing the resolution of the inverted conductivity and chargeability tomograms 2 solving the induced polarization inverse problem by using a large scale geostatistical inversion approach as mentioned above 3 we develop a time lapse inversion approach for induced polarization by using a novel approach based on a low rank approximation of the kalman filter namely the csfk mentioned above in order to show the advantages of our approach we performed four numerical case studies in the first case we show the robustness of the geostatistical inversion approach in imaging the electrical conductivity and chargeability fields based on the two components of the electric field the second case presents the time lapse inversion of conductivity and chargeability data in the third case we discuss a time lapse electrical conductivity tomography monitoring of a saline intrusion in an aquifer the last case study involved the monitoring of water infiltration in a large portion of an unconfined aquifer considerable attention is paid to making the study cases physically meaningful especially in terms of the petrophysical relationships used to relate all the physical parameters with each other in a consistent way 2 measuring the components of the electric field when the current is injected into the ground the response of the medium can be recorded in terms of the electric field the development of such instruments makes it possible to record the electric field without the need for connecting the receivers through cables in practice this system is composed of two kind of units 1 a current recording unit that is connected to a transmitter it records the time stamped samples of the injected current during the survey 2 a set of receivers measuring the two components of the electric field these receivers are gps synchronized the current is injected between two electrodes a and b connected by a long cable the a electrode can be placed far from the area of interest then the second electrode b is placed at different positions that cover the region of interest this current injection line dipole can be set in any direction to increase the sensitivity with respect to the target this approach is also suitable for 3d surveys each recording station has two channels and is connected to three potential electrodes p 1 p 2 and p 3 these electrodes are placed so that the two orthogonal components of the electric field are recorded for each station fig 1 these two components can be seen as the horizontal components of the electric field e note that in the presence of topographic effects it will be more appropriate to designate them as the tangential components of the electric field the normal component of the electric field with respect to the ground surface is null since air is insulating using the relationship between the electric field and the electric potential the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are 1 e 1 δ φ 1 p 1 p 2 2 e 2 δ φ 2 p 3 p 2 where δϕ1 denotes the potential difference along the horizontal direction channel 1 δϕ2 denotes the potential difference along the perpendicular direction channel 2 p 1 p 2 and p 3 p 2 are the distances between p 1 and p 2 and p 2 and p 3 respectively one can use a fictitious electrode pf that can be placed anywhere along the direction of the electric field e so that this electric field can be written 3 e δ φ f p f p 2 i where δϕ f is the potential difference between pf and p 2 i denotes the unit vector defined in the e direction fig 1 pf p 2 denotes the distance between the fictitious electrode pf and p 2 using the intensity of the electric field e 4 δ φ f p f p 2 e 5 δ φ f p f p 2 e 1 2 e 2 2 6 δ φ f p f p 2 δ φ 1 p 1 p 2 2 δ φ 2 p 3 p 2 2 the apparent resistivity on the station can then be obtained by 7 ρ a k δ φ f i where k denotes the geometrical factor and i is the intensity of the injected current a similar reasoning applies for the apparent chargeability derivation in fact the apparent chargeabilities in the two perpendicular horizontal directions can be written as 8 η 1 δ φ 1 s δ φ 1 9 η 2 δ φ 2 s δ φ 2 respectively and where δ φ 1 s and δ φ 2 s denote the secondary potentials computed on channels 1 and 2 respectively similarly to eq 6 the secondary voltage obtained along the direction of e is 10 δ φ f s p f p 2 δ φ 1 s p 1 p 2 2 δ φ 2 s p 3 p 2 2 given that η a δ φ f s δ φ f we obtain after some algebraic manipulations see appendix a 11 η a η 1 δ φ 1 2 η 2 δ φ 2 2 δ φ 1 2 δ φ 2 2 alternatively one can decide to express all the data in terms of the electric field which is numerically more convenient in other words we solve the electrical potential equation to obtain the electric potential ϕ 12 σ φ i δ x x s δ y y s δ z z s where δ denotes the delta dirac function xs ys and zs are the spatial coordinates of the current injecting electrode once eq 12 is solved we compute the electric field as 13 e φ the intensity of the electric field is given by 14 e e 1 2 e 2 2 it is measured on each station and can be used as input data for inverting for the electrical conductivity as stated by siegel 1959 the effect of the chargeability η can be considered as a perturbation of the electrical conductivity field of the medium as σ 1 η eq 12 can be formulated in terms of the electric field the apparent chargeability η a at each station is given in the local system coordinate by see appendix a 15 η a 1 e t e 2 e η e η t e η where e η σ 1 η ϕ e ηt and et denotes the transposes of e η and e respectively in other words we need to solve the electrical potential equation twice one to compute the electrical potential associated to σ and one with the electrical potential associated to σ 1 η then the electric fields e and e η are used to calculate the apparent chargeability following eq 15 note that eq 15 can be rewritten as 16 η a e η e e η where denotes the euclidean norm i e x x t x eq 16 imlies that η a is a real quantity using eqs 6 and 11 or eqs 14 and 16 ensure that we are working with data sets that are made positive and therefore their logarithms can be used as input data for the inversion which generally reduces the artefacts in the tomograms 3 inverse scheme in this section we present an algorithm to solve the inverse problem it consists in retrieving the distributions of the intrinsic electrical conductivity and chargeability fields computed from the two components of the electric field measured on the ground surface including some error or noise in the measurements we propose to use a geostatistical inversion approach when working on time lapse data the parameters of interest i e the electrical conductivity and the intrinsic chargeability can also evolve in time therefore the inverse problem needs to be solved at each time step to update the fields and to compute the new changes in these distributions we propose to use a kalman filter approach for this purpose 3 1 geostatistical inversion the inverse problem for conductivity and chargeability is undetermined and is ill posed on way to address these issues is by imposing constraints on the desired solution usually in geophysics these constraints are imposed using horizontal or vertical smoothing of the model parameter distributions that said this strategy may lead to oversmooth tomograms alternative approaches exist for instance by using a covariance matrix based on a variogram to guide the inversion to converge towards the best solution whose spatial distributions are adequately being described by a given kernel such as gaussian or exponential one for instance one major limitation to this approach is the computation and storage of the covariance matrix in large scales applications where the number of unknowns can be very large a principal component analysis shows that actually the information contained in the covariance matrix can be accurately captured by its leading values which means that this covariance matrix can be compressed resulting in significant storage and computational savings e g kitanidis and lee 2014 this means that major features of the field can be captured by a low rank truncated covariance matrix in this regard kitanidis and lee 2014 adapted the geostatistical inversion to large scale problems by introducing the so called principal component geostatistical approach pcga using this approach the covariance matrix is never computed or stored products of the jacobian matrix with given vectors or matrices are evaluated without explicit storing of it in memory which allows for significant computational savings in the pcga framework we consider that the optimal parameter set is obtained by minimizing the following objective function 17 m i n s 1 2 d φ s t r 1 d φ s 1 2 s x β t q 1 s x β where s denotes the m 1 parameter vector to be estimated d is the n 1 data vector φ is the forward operator r is the n n data covariance matrix x is a m 1 vector of ones β denotes the scalar constant denoting the mean of the parameter field and q denotes the m m prior spatial covariance matrix the matrix q can be compressed for instance by factorizing it in a product of low rank matrices by using its eigen decomposition 18 q q k p k λ k p k t i 1 k v i v i t 19 v i λ i p i where k is the truncation order qk is the m mtruncated covariance matrix λ k is the k kdiagonal matrix of the first k largest eigenvalues of q pk is the m k matrix of the corresponding eigenvectors vi where λ i is the ith eigenvalue of q and pi is the ith column of p the choice of k is important it should not be too small to not loose information and too large to not loose computational efficiency a compromise can be obtained by making sure that k makes the truncation error small enough i e q qk q 1 which means that the ratio between the k 1 eigenvalue of q and the largest one is much smaller than 1 e g kitanidis and lee 2014 the norm is a given norm operator given that generally m n k m is the number of unknowns n is the number of measurements and k is the truncation order the low rank approximation of q yields significant computational savings the solution of the minimization problem 17 is now given by 20 s k 1 ξ d φ s k h k s k where k is the current iteration number of the inversion process hk is the n m jacobian matrix of the measurements with respect to the parameter model sk the vector ξ is found by solving the following linear system 21 h k q h k t r h k x h k x t 0 ξ β h k q x the jacobian products that appear in 21 can be computed as 22 h k x 1 δ φ s δ x φ s where δ is a finite difference step 23 h k q h k q k i 1 k ζ i v i t where 24 ζ i h k v i 1 δ φ s δ v i φ s and 25 h k q h k t h k q k h k t i 1 k ζ i ζ i t computing all the jacobian products i e h k x h k q h k q h k t only require k 3 forward computations which can lead to drastic computational savings for more details on the computational performance of the pcga method over traditional inversion methods the reader can refer to kitanidis and lee 2014 and soueid ahmed et al 2018 3 2 compressed state kalman filter retrieving the conductivity and chargeability fields is an estimation problem if we are considering time lapse monitoring these fields are expected to evolve with time and therefore we seek to monitor the evolution of their states in other words in addition to a spatial regularization a temporal one will be needed as well kalman 1960 introduced an iterative filter that used a series of data measured in time to predict the unknown parameters conductivity and chargeability in our case an advantage of the kalman filter is that it incorporates all the knowledge taken from the previous time data to estimate the current parameter field the kalman filter was extended to the nonlinear case by anderson and moore 1979 the so called extented kalman filter ekf in essence the ekf follows the same spirit as the kalman filter we consider a nonlinear system where the state variables are described as 26 s k 1 ψ s k ω k where sk denotes the estimation of the state variable at time k and ψ is the state transition model the quantity ω k represents any model errors such as poor knowledge of initial and boundary conditions or some other parameters related to the forward modeling the quantity sk and ω k are m 1 vectors and m denotes the number of unknowns similarly the observations can be related to the state variables as 27 d k 1 φ s k v k where φ is the discretized forward operator in our case it is given by the electrical potential equation v k is the measurements error vector d k 1 and v k are n 1 vectors with n the number of observations the ekf involves two steps a forecast step and an analysis one the forecast step consists in predicting the state variable at time k 1 while the analysis step can be seen as an update which seeks to improve the state variable using the observations at time k 1 in fact updating the state variables in the analysis step can be seen as a minimization problem in which the update state minimizes the objection function 28 l d k 1 φ s k t r 1 d k 1 φ s k s k 1 ψ s k k t c k 1 k 1 s k 1 ψ s k k r is n n the measurement covariance matrix s k k is the parameter estimate at time k based on the measurements up to time k likewise c k 1 k is the k k compressed covariance matrix at time k 1 based on the observation up to time k a major limitation of the conventional ekf appears in eq 28 indeed we need to compute store and invert the covariance matrix c k 1 k this is difficult for large scale applications a solution resides in reducing the dimensionality of the problem by approximating the covariance matrix by low rank matrices e g kitanidis 2015 following the same idea as the one presented in the previous section for the geostatictal inversion the covariance matrix c is approximated by a low rank approximation in the form 29 c c a v c a t where a is a m k matrix and vc is a k k symmetric positive definite matrix the idea is to fix a during all the kf iterations and to only update the compressed covariance matrix vc this algorithm will be referred to as the compressed extended kalm filter csfk in this work a is chosen to compose the k leading eigenvalues of a given covariance matrix that can be assembled using a variogram the initial small covariance matrix c 0 is given by a kernel matrix for instance a gaussian one the forecast step allows for computing the optimal state variable and its associated

this new method of acquiring induced polarization data and the algorithms presented in the previous sections to interpret these data four synthetic case studies are presented for all the cases the data are acquired using the electric field components based approach 4 1 case study 1 the goal of this test is to benchmark the geostatistical inversion of the electric field components the domain of simulation is a volume of 1km 1km 100m see fig 2 we use the sgems software e g deutch and journel 1992 to generate hypothetical true electrical conductivity and intrinsic chargeability fields see figs 3 a and 4 a the electrical conductivity values vary between 10 3 6 s m 1 2 5 10 4 s m 1 and 10 1 8 s m 1 1 6 10 2 s m 1 these true fields are assumed to be unknown and the inverse scheme is used to estimate their spatial distributions they were generated using gaussian variograms γ h 0 5 1 exp h 100 2 for the conductivity and γ h 1 exp h 135 2 for the chargeability h is the distance expressed in m the variogram depicts the spatial autocorrelation of the measured sample points a variogram is characterized by a sill and a range the physical meaning of the sill is the total variance contribution the range is that pairs of parameter values at locations that are this distance or greater apart are not spatially correlated a total of 144 receivers are placed on the ground surface two current injection electrodes a and b are used the position of the electrode a is fixed and does not change during the acquisition process while the position of the electrode b is switched for each current injection at a set of predetermined locations this makes sure that we stimulate different regions of the domain to obtain complete information in the electric response in fact when the current is injected it propagates through the domain even in the deeper areas of the subsurface nevertheless it remains stronger at the vicinity of the injecting electrodes this suggests that the current injections should be performed in several locations across the simulation domain to avoid recording redundant data that do not improve the resolution of the final tomogram a total of 17 current injections are performed for each injection the electric field norm is computed on each of the 144 stations this means that the total number of measurements is 2248 as shown in section 2 the apparent resistivities and chargeabilities data acquired using this methodology are always expected to be positive an advantage of having positive data entries is that we can use their logarithms to invert the fields which is generally more stable this is especially true for datasets where there may be variations over several order of magnitude we first estimate the electrical conductivity field which is then used to estimate the chargeability field both inversions are launched with homogenous starting models that correspond to the geometric mean of the apparent electrical conductivity and apparent chargeability values to be representative of the field conditions the data have been corrupted with a 5 gaussian noise although true σ and η distributions have been generated with known variograms this is generally not the case on the field and the properties of the variograms need to be evaluated to construct the elements of the covariance matrix several approaches exist for estimating the variogram parameters e g soueid ahmed et al 2018 one can estimate them together with inverse problem unknowns or they can be deduced from our prior knowledge of the field for instance based on geological cross sections another approach consists in using experimental variograms to fit theoretical varigorams e g deutsch and journel 1992 kitanidis 1997 minsasny and mcbratney 2005 the idea is to use a theoretical variogram for instance exponential or gaussian and to solve a least square minimization problem to fit the experimental data the unknowns are the sill and the correlation length fig 5 shows the experimental σ and η variograms and the theoretical ones one last issue needs to be addressed before being able to start the inversion process that is the truncation of the covariance matrix as stated in the previous section for computational efficiency the covariance matrix is factorized into a product of low rank matrices this approximation accuracy is the related to choice of the truncation order k in other words k needs to be chosen in a way that will guarantee that the approximated covariance matrix still captures the major information about the field as explained in section 3 the relative error between the covariance matrix and its squeezed form should be 1 we chose k 125 which leads to an error of 0 001 the eigenvalues decay of the covariance matrix is shown in fig 6 for the σ and η covariance matrices this fast decay indeed suggest that the most relevant information for the fields can be described by the leading eigenvalues the domain of interest is discretized into regular rectangular cells the pcga method is used to invert the data the convergence is considered to be reached if after two consecutive iterations of the inverse problem the objective value function decrease is smaller than 0 001 after 5 iterations the convergence criteria were met for the inversion of the electrical conductivity fig 3b shows the inverted conductivity σ the major features are well reconstructed and the scatterplot of the true field against the estimated one shows a linear trend with a high coefficient of correlation r 2 0 80 this estimated electrical conductivity field is used in the estimation of the chargeability field after 7 iterations the algorithm has converged giving the chargeability estimate that is shown on fig 4b the inversion results are satisfactory and show high resemblance between the true and estimated chargeability fields see fig 4a and b the chargeability coefficient of correlation r 2 0 78 the magnitudes of both the chargeability and electrical conductivity agree with the magnitudes of the true fields as illustrated by the residuals fields and scatter plots shown in figs 7 and 8 4 2 case study 2 this case study is an extension of the previous case study but introducing now some time dependence the same geometry as well as the electrodes configuration of the previous case are used the numbers of measurements and unknowns remain unchanged that said in this case the electrical conductivity and the chargeability fields are not stationary to account for this we computed several realizations of the conductivity field and chargeability fields using the sgems software these true fields are represented on figs 9 and 11 they are generated with gaussian variograms each snapshot illustrates the spatial distributions of the fields at a given time the purpose of this case study is to see to what extent the cskf will be able to monitor the temporal evolution of the parameter fields all the input data are contaminated with a 5 gaussian noise the measurement covariance matrix is set to be diagonal with its entries given by e g lehikoinenen et al 2009 36 d i a g r k ω i a b s d o b s k m a x d o b s k where r k is the measurements covariance matrix at time step k ω 5 in our case i is the identity matrix and d o b s k is the observed data vector at time step k abs denotes the absolute value operator the initial covariance matrices for both the conductivity and chargeability are constructed using the properties of the variogram of the first time step these properties are assumed to be unknown and are estimated using the approach discussed in the previous synthetic case similarly to the previous case the truncation order was set to be k 125 as the true fields do not significantly change from an iteration to another one it is reasonable to choose the random walk model to update the state variables which means that in eq 30 ψ i the conductivities are first estimated fig 9 shows the predicted conductivities they are in general well estimated and the heterogeneities of the field are well recovered the magnitudes of the estimates are in the same range as those of the true parameters as shown by the residuals plots see fig 10 the conductivity at each step is used in the estimation of the chargeability at the corresponding time step using the cskf fig 11 shows the chargeability tomograms the anomalies of the medium are well reconstructed even if some smoothness is observed due to the effect of compressing the covariance matrices the uncertainties observed both in the conductivity and chargeability tomograms around the top right corner of the simulation domain are due to a lack of observation stations in this area indeed fig 2 shows that there is no station coverage in this region of the simulation domain the estimation seems to be less reliable at the beginning of the process i e the first two time steps in fact the csfk updates the current field based on the previous measurements which means that the more we iterate the more the information we accumulate for predicting the next state the residual fields fig 12 show that the uncertainties are larger at the first two time steps and they become smaller one last issue that deserves to be discussed is the kalman gain matrix as stated before the kalman gain allows for adequately adjusting the update of the state variables and the compressed covariance matrix each column of the kalman gain is related to a given observation in other words each column of the kalman gain matrix gives the sensitivity of the field to an observation fig 13 shows the two columns of the kalman gain matrix for the conductivity and the chargeability at the last time step as expected the kalman gain reaches its maximum values in the vicinity of the receiver at which the measurements are performed i e the corresponding column this means that the sensitivity to the corresponding measurements the 60th and the 1800th measurements is at its maximum around the location of these measurements this case study validates the csfk approach and the electric field components acquisition approaches for monitoring transient processes in the next case study we move to the induced polarization monitoring of a more complicated dynamic process 4 3 case study 3 this case deals with the modeling of a saline intrusion in a heterogeneous aquifer electrical conductivity imagining will be performed to delineate in space and time the evolution of the contamination as this phenomenon is governed by several aspects of physics we first would like to present these governing equations that is the groundwater flow and transport equations as well as the petrophysical relationships that connect the concentration of the salt to the electrical conductivity of the medium under steady state conditions and in a homogenous isotropic medium the groundwater flow equation reads 37 k h q we need to add some boundary conditions 38 h h d on γ d 39 n k h q n on γ n where h denotes the hydraulic head in m k denotes the hydraulic conductivity field in m s 1 q in m3 s 1 is a flow source term hd denotes the hydraulic head value imposed at the dirichlet s boundary while qn is the hydraulic flux in m3 s 1 imposed on γ n the unit vector n is the unit outward vector normal to the neumann s boundary γ n the transport equations are obtained by coupling two constitutive equations namely darcy s law and fick s law 40 u k h 41 j d ρ f ϕ d c ρ f c u where u in m s 1 denotes the darcy velocity hydraulic volumetric flux density jd is the salt flux in kg m 2 s 1 d in m3 s 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor ρ f in kg m 3 is the solute bulk density φ dimensionless is the porosity c dimensionless is the solute mass fraction the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor d is expressed as 42 d d m α α t v i α l α t v v v where dm in m2 s 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient of the salt at 25 c and at high salinities dm 1 44 10 9m2s 1 α denotes the tortuosity of the pore space product of the formation factor by the porosity α l is the longitudinal dispersitivity α t is the transverse dispersitivity and vis the average velocity and denotes the tensorial product the continuity equation conservation equation for the mass of solute states that 43 ρ f ϕ c t j d 0 inserting eq 41 into eq 43 yields the advection dispersion equation 44 ϕ c t ϕ d c u c 0 eq 44 can be completed by the following boundary conditions 45 c x t c 0 on γ u 46 n d c 0 on γ d where γ u corresponds to the upstream boundary where the salt injection takes place and γ d denotes the downstream boundary at the initial time t 0 we assume that c x t 0 where x denotes any spatial location of the 3d domain solving eq 44 allows for having the salt salinity for each time at any region of the aquifer on the other hand according to waxman and smits 1968 the electrical conductivity of the medium can be seen as the combination of a bulk conductivity related to the pore water conductivity σ f in s m 1 and a surface conductivity σ s in s m 1 related to conduction in the double layer coating the surface of the grains 47 σ σ f f σ s where f dimensionless is the formation factor f φ m and where m dimensionless is the cementation or porosity exponent m 1 in this case study we assume that σ s s m 1 is constant in the aquifer which means that the electrical conductivity changes in the aquifer are induced by the changes in pore water conductivity which are related to the solute concentration in fact the pore water conductivity is related to solute concentration though 48 σ f α c β β e where α is a constant used to account for the conversion of the unit of concentration from kg m 3 to molecules per m3 β and β are the mobility of the cations and anions in the pore water at 25 c β 5 10 8 m 2 s 1 v 1 and β 7 10 8 m 2 s 1 v 1 and e denotes the elementary charge of the electron e 1 6 10 19c combining eqs 47 and 48 allows for explicitly writing the dependence of the electrical conductivity on the solute concentration as 49 σ α c e ϕ m β β σ s now that the governing equations have been presented we describe the time lapse monitoring survey in this numerical case study we simulate the contamination of an aquifer by a saline intrusion the solute is supposed to be non reactive nacl salt the synthetic aquifer covers a volume of 1km 1km 100m a hydraulic gradient is created through the aquifer by imposing a 10 m hydraulic head at one vertical boundary and a 5 m hydraulic head at the opposite boundary the porosity of the aquifer is constant φ 0 30 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is heterogeneous and varies between 10 7m s 1 and 10 3 m s 1 this hydraulic conductivity field was generated using an exponential variogram the migration of the contaminant occurs due to the natural hydraulic gradient through the diffusion and advection processes the contamination is assumed to take place at the left vertical boundary at a rate of 2 kg m 3 the transport equation is solved for a period of 10 days using a time step of 1h this allows for mapping the nacl plume evolution throughout the aquifer for different times the contamination starts from the left region of the aquifer where the time dependent boundary condition is applied and progressively moves across preferential pathways to reach the right boundary after approximately 10 days while augmenting the solute concentration in the aquifer since the electrical conductivity of the medium is related to the solute concentration electrical conductivity imaging is expected to reveals some information about the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the solute plume we assume that the surface conductivity is constant in the aquifer and equals to 10 2 s m 1 an electrical resistivity tomography survey using decentralized stations is performed using a grid of 144 stations placed as in case study 1 the injecting electrode a is placed at the point of coordinate 10 m 10 m 0 m and the second injecting electrode is moving between the stations 17 current injections are performed resulting in a 2448 electric field intensity measurements the injected current has an intensity of 1 a the domain of simulation is discretized into 8 000 regular cells the initial covariance matrix is constructed based on an exponential kernel whose parameters are estimated using the least mean square approach presented in the first study case the truncation order is k 125 this is a reasonable choice given the fast decay of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix the electric field data were intentionally contaminated with a 5 gaussian noise the random walk model is used to update the state variable this means that we do not expect the conductivity to abruptly or quickly change within two consecutive time steps eq 49 is used to derive the electrical conductivity from the solute concentration these conductivity fields are considered to be the true conductivity fields and are used to generate to the electric field data the cskf is then used to predict the evolution of the electrical conductivity for 6 observation times 1 day 2 days 3 days 4 days 5 days 6 days fig 14 shows snapshots of the simulated and estimated electrical conductivities we can notice that the main features of the electric conductivity front resulting from the pollutant transport are well captured and they follow as well the structures of the solute concentration the estimated parameters have a high resolution even for the first time steps where the diffusion process just start to emerge table 1 lists the rms and r 2 values of the true and estimated parameters the low rms and large r 2 values indeed suggest that at least the major features are well resolved the residuals field are plotted on fig 15 one can see that the uncertainties are relatively low even in the vicinity of the bottom of the domain this shows that the contaminant can be tracked even in the deeper areas of the aquifer without the need of installing electrodes in boreholes which is both expensive because of the high cost of drilling and tedious finally we would like to stress that although saline intrusions generally take more time to occur over a kilometric distance we believe that is case study remains interesting for proving the ability of the new system that we present to capture the evolution of large scale physical processes that are of interest for the hydrogeology community such as saline intrusion 4 4 case study 4 in this case study we simulate a recharge experiment in a 1km 1km 200m region this domain is considered to be variably saturated geophysical methods such as the induced polarization method can be used to map the infiltration of water in the vadoze zone and monitor the recharge of the saturated zone of the aquifer from a numerical point of view this requires modelling the groundwater flow and the electric mechanisms associated with it to simulate the groundwater flow in a variably saturated medium the richard s equation needs to solved this will give the saturation of the water in the medium which in turns can be used to compute the electrical conductivity and the chargeability we first briefly recall the constitutive equations and petrophysical relations used to describe the saturation processes richard s equation e g richards 1931 is written as 50 c ρ g s w s h t k r s w k ρ g h q s where c is the specific moisture capacity m 1 sw dimensionless is the water saturation s is the storage coefficient m 1 h m is the hydraulic head t is the time s 1 kr is the relative hydraulic conductivity k m s 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of saturated zone and qs s 1 denotes a source term that represents any external fluid flow sources the van

54 s w s w r s e 1 s w r where swr is the water residual saturation which is the water saturation that a porous material can retain during drainage this water is essentially held by capillary forces plus the effect of sorbed water on the surface of the grains woodruff and revil 2011 revil and lu 2013 the electrical conductivity of the medium can then be expressed in terms of the saturation as e g

study are reported in table 2 we set atmospheric pressure on the bottom boundary and no flow boundaries on the lateral boundaries at the ground surface a no flow boundary condition is assigned expect at the central part of the ground surface where the following hydraulic head boundary was assigned 56 h t 3 e x p t 2 this boundary condition simulates the progressive infiltration of the water through the central area of the ground surface the remaining region of the ground surface of the domain is modeled to be impermeable once the water saturation has been obtained it can be used to compute the electrical conductivity of the medium using eq 55 the recharge experiment is simulated for 150 hours with measurements recorded at every hour an electrical resistivity survey is performed on the site using the same stations configuration as the one described in study case 1 and resulting in 2448 electric field intensity measurements the cskf is used to predict the electrical conductivity and chargeability changes during the injection the saturated permeability is 6 10 8 m2 the domain is discretized into 8 000 unknowns and the truncation order k 125 fig 16 shows the snapshots of the computed and estimated electrical conductivity distributions resepctively the snapshots capture the evolution of the groundwater intrusion in the domain the computed and estimated electrical conductivities follow the same patterns and have the same magnitudes the residuals fig 17 show that the csfk accurately predicts the electrical conductivity evolution all these results show that geoelectrical methods are an excellent tool for monitoring diffusion processes of contaminants in porous media the use of recently developed systems such as the fullwaver system allows for more easily imaging the evolution of these processes in 3d 5 conclusion we presented and discussed a new methodology for acquiring treating and inverting time domain induced polarization and resistivity data with the new generation of induced polarization instrumentation such as the fullwaver system one can directly work on the components of the electrical field and by using some mathematical derivations as shown in the paper ensures that the apparent resistivities and chargeabilties are positive this will ensure that all the measurements can be taken into account and thus no potentially relevant information is omitted from the inverted tomograms in practice the receivers are small decentralized stations that are not linked via cables this advantage solves the issue of capacitive couplings and therefore avoids dealing with unphysical data from a numerical point of view two approaches were used 1 a geostatistical inversion approach that takes the electric field component as data input and performs the estimation of the parameters of interest that is the electrical conductivity and chargeability 2 for time lapse monitoring a compressed kalman filter approach for predicting conductivity and chargeability changes both approaches are large scale oriented as they reduce the dimensionality of the inverse problem and therefore do not require the assembly of large dense jacobian matrices or the computation and storage of covariance matrices these numerical approaches were validated on four synthetic case studies that mimic realistic scenarios including contaminants tracking and the monitoring of water infiltration in an unconfined aquifer many perspectives can be given to the present work for instance in aquifer characterization this equipment could be also used to passively measure the streaming potential responses associated with a series of harmonic pumping tests performed on the aquifer and to perform a joint inversion of the self potential and hydraulic head data to characterize the aquifer for co2 storage in deep geological formation the system can be used to monitor the spreading of the injected co2 plume the numerical tools presented in this paper permit a significant reduction of the computational burden associated with large scale inversion and time lapse monitoring and makes the use of the fullwaver system practicable for the

568,as part of a general trend towards river management solutions that provide more room for the river longitudinal training dams ltds have recently been constructed in the inner bend of the dutch waal river replacing groynes ltds split the river in a main channel and a bank connected side channel with a sill at the entrance in the present study a physical scale model with mobile bed was used to study morphological patterns and discharge division in the entrance region of such a side channel alternative geometric designs of the sill are tested to investigate the controls on the diversion of water and sediment into the side channel after reaching a morphodynamic equilibrium two bar features were observed in the side channel under low flow conditions an inner bend depositional bar emerged against the ltd resembling depositional bars observed in sharp river bends a second bar occurred in the most upstream part of the side channel next to the sill induced by divergence of the flow by widening of the channel and an increasing flow depth after the sill hence defined as a divergence bar the morphologically most active system in the side channel emerges for the configuration in which the sill height decreases in downstream direction for such a geometry the sediment that settles during low flow is largely eroded during high flow reducing maintenance needs a qualitative comparison based on a lab experiment mimicking field conditions demonstrates the realism of the experiments keywords longitudinal training dam river morphology side channel bifurcation physical scale model 1 introduction traditionally groynes have been widely used to fix the planform geometry of lowland rivers with the aim to keep the river navigable and to prevent ice jams przedwojski 1995 verheij et al 2004 yossef and de vriend 2011 groynes are known to have various side effects however among which erosion pits at groyne tips and a reduced ecological value in the riparian zone due to shipping waves ten brinke et al 1999 collas et al 2018 are the most severe to improve the ecosystem services of the river system rivers are allowed more space within restricted boundaries e g rijke et al 2012 van vuren et al 2015 which has a proven positive effect on ecology van den brink et al 1993 palmer et al 2005 and mitigates climate change effects giosan et al 2014 constantinescu et al 2015 longitudinal training dams ltds have been designed as a compromise between purely nature based solutions that favour ecological quality and hard engineering structures that ensure navigability they serve as a flood protection measure secure the fairway depth for shipping and leave enough room for ecological development havinga et al 2009 an ltd is a groyne like structure parallel to the river axis that splits the river in a main navigation channel and a bank connected side channel with a sill at the upstream side due to its orientation parallel to the river axis the flow resistance is limited this causes a lowering of the water level during floods which adds to flood safety of the hinterland during low discharges the flow is mainly restricted to the main channel this effectively reduces the width of the river leading to larger water depths in the main channel which benefits shipping finally ltds are expected to limit bed degradation and to provide favourable ecological conditions compared to groyne fields eerden et al 2011 havinga 2016 although they have been present for years already in france the loire river and germany the main rhine and elbe rivers detailed studies on the hydraulic and morphological effects of ltds are limited recently collas et al 2018 showed that ltds stabilise the flow behind the dam and reduce the influence of ship waves which creates favourable ecological conditions the ability of sediment particles to be transported into the side channel likely depends on the sill side slope and the angle at which water flows over the sill jammers 2017 in the presence of alternate bars in the main channel the two channel ltd system is in general morphologically unstable although a stable configuration might be reached when the upstream end of the ltd is located close to the bar top le et al 2018b in the latter case cyclic morphological behaviour may emerge even without external periodic forcing le et al 2018a the present work builds on prior work of vermeulen et al 2014 who to the authors knowledge were the first to experimentally study ltds they based their physical scale model scale 1 60 on a future projection of the waal river in the netherlands with prototype discharges of 1250 m 3 s 1 and 4600 m 3 s 1 the studied river section was a sand bedded lowland river with particle size distributions characterized by d 50 1 2 mm and d 90 2 0 mm in the physical scale model polystyrene particles were used as a surrogate sediment with d 50 2 1 mm d 90 2 9 mm and ρ s 1055 kg m 3 scaling was based on the shields number keeping the froude number close to prototype values vermeulen et al 2014 concluded that local morphological changes near the intake of an ltd side channel are expected to be limited they also showed that the sediment mobility is slightly overestimated by using polystyrene but dune height agrees well with corresponding prototype values and fairway deepening agrees well with the realised river narrowing by the ltd in the present study the physical model of vermeulen et al 2014 has been modified to match the design that has been built in the waal river in a pilot downstream of the city of tiel on this location ltd side channels replace former groyne fields over a 10 km stretch in the inner bends of the river where a riprap bank is present instead of upstream groynes the intake section of the side channel is chosen such that it matches the location where in former times a natural side channel cut into the floodplain fig 1 at about three quarters downstream from the upstream end a secondary opening with a sill is present in the ltd to enable exchange of water between the two channels even during low discharges in contrast to vermeulen et al 2014 no upstream groynes are constructed and the entrance of the side channel is marked by a sill in line with the ltd itself the latter is also different from the studies by le et al 2018a b who did not use any regulatory structure at the entrance of the side channel and used a thin plate to model the ltd prior studies also assumed a free inflow side channel adopting 1 d bolla pittaluga et al 2003 kleinhans et al 2008 bertoldi et al 2009 van der mark and mosselman 2013 2 d le et al 2018b and quasi 3 d kleinhans et al 2008 numerical models to explore bifurcation stability those studies elaborated on simple hypothetical relationships for sediment division wang et al 1995 the equilibrium discharge diversion to side channels has been studied as a function of various geometrical parameters by van denderen et al 2018 detailed flow patterns have been analysed as a function of various hydraulic and geometric boundary conditions hardy et al 2011 in the present contribution we add an upstream control mechanism to the side channel system in the form of a sill we aim to unravel how the geometry of this sill affects morphological changes and flow patterns around the side channel intake which is important for navigability ecology and dredging efforts we are in particular interested in 1 the morphological effects of possible flow separation downstream of the side channel intake 2 the morphological effects of flow divergence at the side channel entrance and 3 the effect of the sill on the discharge division over the two channels the experimental set up is described in section 2 consisting of the physical scale model and the measurement equipment used section 3 introduces the applied analysis methods the results are shown in section 4 addressing morphological changes flow characteristics and the discharge division thereafter a comparison between lab and field results is provided in section 5 followed by a discussion of the experimental findings in section 6 finally conclusions are formulated in section 7 2 experimental set up 2 1 prototype the ltd pilot in the dutch waal river eerden et al 2011 huthoff et al 2011 serves as a prototype for this scale model study the waal is a sand bedded mildly curved lowland river and the main branch of the rhine river in the netherlands bed morphology is predominantly determined by sediment transported in bedload mode with typical particle sizes of d 50 1 2 mm and d 90 2 0 mm flow velocities in the waal are typically around u 1 m s 1 two characteristic hydraulic conditions were defined consisting of a mean water depth of d 4 m low flow with a corresponding discharge of q 1250 m 3 s 1 and a mean water depth of d 8 m high flow with a corresponding discharge of q 4600 m 3 s 1 the ltd at the location of interest creates a side channel with a typical width of 90 m on a main channel bankfull width of 230 m the cross sectional profile of the prototype ltd is a trapezoid with side slopes of 1 2 5 an upper base of 2 m width and a typical height of 6 5 m 2 2 physical scale model the study s experiments took place in a straight horizontal flume with recirculation facilities for both water and sediment at the kraijenhoff van de leur laboratory for water and sediment dynamics wageningen university research the netherlands the flume measured 0 7 m 2 6 m 12 8 m internally height width length at the upstream end of the flume a stacked pile of pvc tubes served as a flow straightener to suppress large turbulence generated by the inlet geometry inside the flume we constructed a scale model of an ltd with an upstream riprap bank fig 2 adjusting the model of vermeulen et al 2014 a solid base was located between the ltd and the riprap bank where an adjustable gravel sill could be built upon the model was geometrically scaled from the prototype with a scaling factor of n l 60 in all dimensions the model represented a width of 156 m and a length of 720 m in the prototype a sediment layer of 20 cm thick completely covered the solid base of the flume only leaving the ltd 9 2 cm in height the riprap bank and the sill uncovered by recirculating the sediment in the flume the total volume of sediment in the system remained constant throughout the experiment four alternative sill geometries at the ltd side channel intake were studied fig 3 a a uniform low sill height b a downstream increasing sill height c a downstream decreasing sill height and d a uniform elevated sill height we chose these geometries to investigate the effect of differences in total cross sectional flow areas through comparison of alternatives a and d and lateral differences in cross sectional flow area through comparison of alternatives b and c the side slope of the sill was kept constant at 1 2 5 as is the case in the prototype in the waal river although the side slope plays a significant role in sediment transport over the sill jammers 2017 each of these geometries was studied under two hydraulic conditions that were scaled from the earlier mentioned low flow and high flow prototype conditions for each of the sill geometries measurements were carried out after reaching a morphodynamic equilibrium defined here as a dynamic equilibrium in which dune length in the main channel converged to a constant value of typically 70 cm each high flow experiment was carried out directly after the corresponding low flow experiment again allowing the system to reach a morphodynamic equilibrium to achieve dynamic similarity of both hydraulic characteristics and sediment transport in the physical scale model we used lightweight surrogate sediment particles polystyrene with a density of ρ s 1055 kg m 3 and typical sizes of d 50 2 1 mm and d 90 2 9 mm table 1 lists typical values for the hydraulic conditions and sediment characteristics for details on the underlying scaling method we refer to vermeulen et al 2014 who extensively discussed the method and the different non dimensional numbers 2 3 measurement equipment to measure flow velocities we used a vectrino profiler which is a profiling acoustic velocimeter nortek as 2013 this device captures both magnitude and direction of the velocity in vertical bins of 1 mm over a vertical range of 3 cm and at a frequency of 50 hz the lower end of the vertical range coincided with the initial bed level height z 20 cm except on top of the sill z 25 cm additionally a point measurement of the bed level directly underneath the instrument is retrieved we chose the measurement period such that approximately one dune had migrated to minimise the effect of bed mobility on the results the probe of the profiler did not disturb the bed significantly as the probe was located well above the bed with the gathered velocity data we investigated flow patterns around the intake of the ltd side channel and estimated the discharge division over the two channels for the latter the water level was also continuously monitored at eight points along the side walls of the flume for this purpose eight wall bound tubes were coupled to stilling wells outside the flume with each stilling well containing a magnetostrictive linear position sensor the total discharge was also continuously monitored using an electromagnetic flow meter fig 4 gives an overview of the locations of velocity and water level measurements in addition to flow velocities and discharge we monitored bed topography during subsequent phases of the experiment using a line laser scanner the use of a line laser scanner for bed level monitoring is a measurement method in which the bed elevation is detected from the reflection of light projected on the bed making use of a line laser and a 3 d camera allowing the bed level to be measured without disturbing the flow de ruijsscher et al 2018 the bed was scanned with an along flow resolution of 2 mm and an average cross flow resolution of approximately 3 mm in eight parallel partly overlapping swipes in this way the initial dry bed topography was determined as well as the initial bed topography under still water and the final bed topography because we are only interested in the final bed topography the flow was stopped before measuring this has the benefit of reducing the measurement error due to perturbations at the free surface 3 analysis methods 3 1 bed level change to determine bed level changes from the measured bed level values the bed level was interpolated to a regular grid by means of a loess algorithm vermeulen 2016 de ruijsscher et al 2018 now the bed level change δz b per horizontal cell was obtained according to 1 δ z b x y z b final x y z b 0 x y with z b 0 the initial bed level from this the cumulative sedimentation for the side channel was calculated by summing over all bed level cells in the side channel this results in 2 δ v side x 4000 mm y 950 mm δ z b x y δ x δ y with δx and δy the horizontal grid cell dimensions 3 2 flow velocities 3 2 1 depth averaged velocities to analyse the measured flow velocities from the profiling velocimeter spikes were detected and removed using a bivariate kernel distribution this method has been extensively described by islam and zhu 2013 based on earlier work of duong and hazelton 2003 and botev et al 2010 moreover only data points with a correlation of more than 70 for all four transducers are maintained lane et al 1998 and spatial cells with more than 50 missing values are omitted in further analysis the remaining velocity data after applying the above steps was interpolated using a cubic hermite spline for each velocity measurement point the time series was averaged over the 40 min bursts to average out turbulent fluctuations following 3 u 1 t t 1 t u with u the velocity component along the x axis a depth averaged velocity was obtained by integrating the previous result over a vertical range z 1 z 2 according to 4 u 1 z 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 u d z similar equations hold for the v and w components along y and z axis respectively 3 2 2 flow angle the inflow of water into the side channel was studied in more detail using the angle of the flow with the x axis calculated as 5 ϕ arctan v u the minus sign was needed to let ϕ 0 indicate flow into the side channel for high water level experiments a2 d2 ϕ was calculated on top of the sill y 888 mm for low water level experiments a1 d1 this was not possible due to limited water depth and ϕ was measured in the main channel y 1488 mm only velocity data points for which the normalised standard deviation of velocity component v did not exceed an empirically determined critical value of 0 7 were taken into account to avoid misinterpretation of ϕ values due to negligible near bed velocities this normalised standard deviation criterion was defined as 6 σ v u 0 7 3 2 3 discharge estimation an estimation of the discharge in both main and side channel was obtained by depth integrating velocity component u measured over a spanwise line and multiplying with the grid cell size δy as 7 q n 1 n z 1 z 2 u d z i 1 2 z 1 z 0 u z 1 ii 1 2 z wl z 2 u z 2 u z wl iii n δ y with n the total number of grid cells in the spanwise direction term i is the integration of time averaged velocity u over the measured vertical range z 1 z 2 term ii is the integration of linearly interpolated velocities between the lowest measured value u z 1 and u z 0 0 at the bed and term iii is the integration of the linearly extrapolated velocity profile towards the water surface z wl using the upper seven vertical cells to relate the discharge division to the cross sectional area over the sill this cross sectional area was defined as 8 a a 0 x 1 x 2 z sill x z 0 d x with reference cross section a 0 defined as 9 a 0 z ltd z 0 x 2 x 1 where x 1 x 2 4000 7950 mm and z ltd is the height of the ltd crest 3 3 flow contraction an often used method to define flow contraction is based on the quotient μ of the flow cross sectional areas at the location of maximum contraction and downstream of the contraction idel chik 1966 hamill 2001 because the water level was only measured at a limited number of points this is not feasible in the present study therefore an estimator was defined that depends both on the angle of the flow in the side channel just downstream of the ltd head and on the relative height of the bed level close to the ltd in the side channel 10 μ max 2 α π z 590 z 0 h z 0 where α arccos u u denotes the angle between the depth averaged velocity vector and the x axis z 590 is the mean bed level at y 590 mm and h is the mean water level in the main channel the maximum of α was taken over the measured flow velocity measurement locations within x 7985 8985 mm and α was chosen such that α π π 4 results 4 1 morphological changes in the side channel sedimentation and erosion patterns in the side channel of the ltd configuration showed large differences between the high water level regime and the low water level regime filled contours in fig 5 in addition significant differences are observed in patterns between alternative sill geometries in the following we focus consecutively on persistent morphological features including a depositional bar that developed downstream of the ltd head inner bend depositional bar on a depositional bar in the most upstream part of the side channel divergence bar and on the cumulative sedimentation for the entire side channel a schematic overview of these phenomena is provided afterwards in section 6 fig 11 4 1 1 inner bend depositional bar in the low flow experiments fig 5 a depositional bar developed against the slope of the ltd the location and intensity of this region of sedimentation depends on the geometrical characteristics of the sill in situations a1 low uniform sill height and c1 downstream decreasing sill height the general form of the bar showed to be identical although the sedimentation was more intense in case c1 for b1 downstream increasing sill height the bar started approximately 1 m more upstream with the region of sedimentation extending over the width of the side channel no sedimentation occurred in case d1 because the height of the sill was only just below the water level for cases a1 c1 the water flowed obliquely into the side channel creating a channel that curved around the above mentioned inner bend depositional bar because of this a region of erosion was created against the flume wall the longitudinal location of this erosion depends on the angle of inflow and therefore on the sill geometry during the high flow experiments most of the deposited sediment was eroded again and the inner bend depositional bar disappeared still a small region of sedimentation occurred against the ltd slope but the differences between experiments with alternative sill geometries were less pronounced although the flow still curves into the side channel flow velocities close to the ltd in the side channel were now non negligible and quasi parallel to the ltd and the main channel flow fig 5 a2 d2 4 1 2 divergence bar in the most upstream part of the side channel next to the sill a region of sedimentation occurred driven by flow divergence hence we adopt the term divergence bar for this morphological feature in the evolution towards a dynamic equilibrium this bar tilted under an increasing angle with the sill and shifted slightly upstream not shown during the low flow experimental conditions there were remarkable differences between runs with alternative sill geometries first of all the location of the divergence bar was shifted more downstream for c1 downstream decreasing sill height compared to a1 and b1 in addition to that and similar to what was observed for the inner bend depositional bar the deposition was spread out over a larger area for b1 and was absent for d1 due to the limited discharge into the side channel during the high flow experiments the divergence bar hardly changed for a2 for b2 the bar was diminished to its most upstream part whereas for c2 it completely disappeared in terms of flow patterns these differences were reflected in an inflow over the downstream half of the sill for a2 and over the upstream part of the sill for d2 eroding a deep inflow channel in the latter case fig 5 a2 and d2 geometries b and c can be seen as intermediate stages between these two extreme situations with geometry c creating the most dynamic system in terms of morphological changes in the latter experimental set up a large inner bend depositional bar and a divergence bar were observed at low flow whereas these were both almost completely eroded during high flow moreover the main inflow channel was shifted from close to the ltd head to a more sill parallel inflow over the upstream part of the sill 4 1 3 cumulative sedimentation to quantify the net sediment import between the starting situation with flat bed and the situation in morphodynamic equilibrium the cumulative sedimentation in the side channel is visualized in fig 6 hardly any difference was observed in cumulative sedimentation between experiments b and c with a large sedimentation volume in the side channel during low flow and a net erosive effect at the end of a high water period for a low uniform sill height i e large cross sectional area over the sill there was always net sedimentation with respect to the initial flat bed for d high uniform sill height i e small cross sectional area over the sill net erosion occurred under all circumstances although at low enough water levels the flow through the side channel is weak and erosion is negligible the most dynamic system in terms of sedimentation and erosion occurred for intermediate flow cross sectional areas over the sill i e sill geometries b and c this is likely due to the divergence bar being situated next to the downstream half of the sill fig 5 which renders the bar more prone to erosion during high flow 4 2 flow patterns 4 2 1 flow contraction both an inner bend depositional bar and a flow separation zone can give rise to flow contraction at the entrance of the side channel just downstream of the ltd head to quantify this effect eq 10 was used to calculate a flow contraction metric μ which peaks in experiments a1 and c1 fig 7 this implies that during low water levels the flow is contracted downstream of the sill with geometries a1 and c1 high flow experiments a2 c2 did not convincingly show this phenomenon although it is hard to draw conclusions on flow separation when no measurements are available inside the separation zone for experiments b1 and d1 no reliable value of μ could be determined due to weak flow for a high enough sill with uniform height like e g in situation d2 the morphological patterns suggest flow contraction in the side channel lower graph fig 5 however this could not be confirmed based on μ because it happened more downstream outside the region where flow velocity measurements were taken 4 2 2 inflow angle as observed in fig 5 the angle of the flow into the side channel varied depending on both sill geometry and water level to take a more detailed look at this the inflow angle ϕ as defined in eq 5 is shown in fig 8 in x z space for the low flow regime a1 d1 the inflow angle varied with the x coordinate in experiments a1 and b1 representing a low uniform sill height and a downstream increasing sill height respectively the inflow angle higher up in the water column was of equal magnitude over the entire length of the sill in experiment c1 where the sill height decreases downstream the flow angle increased in the downstream direction this indicates that the flow primarily entered the side channel over the downstream half of the sill which is reflected by the sedimentation patterns in fig 5 the fourth plot representing experiment d1 shows flow angles close to zero caused by the side channel entrance being almost completely blocked by the sill for high flow conditions when flow exchange occurs over the entire length of the ltd the inflow angle was of equal magnitude along the entire sill bottom three plots of fig 8 a2 c2 moreover there were hardly any differences between the alternative sill geometries except for the depth ranges although the inflow angle was mostly constant over depth it increased with depth at the most upstream part of the sill 4 3 discharge division the cross sectional area over the sill was not equal for the experiments which influenced the fraction of the total discharge flowing into the side channel fig 9 this is relevant because the water discharge division over the two channels controls the morphological evolution in both main and side channel for the low flow experiments the fraction of the discharge into the side channel increased with the cross sectional area as expected with river narrowing for low water levels and river widening for high water levels the side channel discharge fraction agrees reasonably well with values observed in the field j sieben pers comm 2018 and in a numerical study by huthoff et al 2011 although a slight underestimation is observed there was no significant difference between cases b1 and c1 which suggests that apart from the cross sectional area the geometry of the sill did not influence the discharge division in the high flow experiments there was no significant difference between the discharge division over the two channels related to flow exchange over the ltd crest 5 comparison with field pilot to establish the realism of the experiments a qualitative comparison was performed between the final bed level of experiment a1 and bed level data from multi beam echo soundings mbes in the field pilot the sill at the side channel intake has a uniform low height in the field similar to the situation in experiment a1 the mbes measurements were performed on 7 february 2017 which is more than 15 months after completion of the ltd pilot configuration the total river discharge at tiel 5 km upstream was q 1448 m 3 s 1 whereas minimum mean and maximum discharge over 2017 were q min 543 m 3 s 1 q 1379 m 3 s 1 and q max 5088 m 3 s 1 respectively the crest of the ltd was above the water surface during the field measurements at the side channel bank however remainders of old groynes are present which is different from the vertical flume wall in the scale model the presence of groyne remainders is reflected by the wavy pattern of the shoreline the river is mildly curved at the ltd section with the inflection point near the entrance of the side channel under study the qualitative comparison between the field pilot and experiment a1 shows that the main morphological features are well reproduced fig 10 but differences exist the erosion pit at the side channel flume wall is not observed in the field pilot this may indicate that the erosion pit is merely a flume wall effect which does not occur in the field pilot due to the mild slope of the bank a second explanation lies in the presence of old groyne remainders which stabilise the bank another discrepancy between lab experiments and field pilot regards the divergence bar in the most upstream part of the field pilot side channel which is less pronounced and located more downstream than observed in the scale model in the field pilot less sediment is deposited against the side channel slope of the ltd the more pronounced sedimentation and erosion patterns in the scale model side channel may be explained by the slightly exaggerated mobility of polystyrene particles in the scale model vermeulen et al 2014 6 discussion 6 1 inner bend depositional bar fig 11 offers a schematic overview of the bed morphology in the inlet region for low discharges flow contraction due to the inner bend depositional bar occurs especially in cases with a low sill height near the ltd i e a1 and c1 figs 5 and 7 this resembles flow separation in the inner bend of rivers as described by blanckaert et al 2012 who observed a flow separation cell downstream of the bend apex to better grasp the flow separation and subsequent inner bend depositional bar formation an additional experiment ab1 was performed designed as a combination of a1 and b1 it consists of a horizontal sill as in experiment a1 but with an increasing sill height from 2 5 to 7 5 cm over the downstream 25 of the sill in other words the slope of the transition from the lowest part of the sill to the ltd crest is 1 2 5 1 10 and 1 40 for a1 ab1 and b1 respectively analogous to fig 5 the bed level differences of experiments a1 ab1 and b1 are shown in fig 12 while the inner bend depositional bar is present in all cases shown the inflow angle is different impacting on the pattern of sedimentation and erosion downstream this inflow angle denoted by the black line in fig 12 is a measure of flow separation at the bifurcation point flow separation intensifies with decreasing steepness of the transition from the sill to the ltd crest from a via ab to b to limit the amount of sedimentation in the side channel downstream of the bifurcation point a steep transition is desirable between the sill and the ltd as in configurations a and c 6 2 divergence bar at the most upstream part of the side channel a bar is formed caused by the flow diverting into the side channel and over the sill fig 11 location ii one could argue that the formation of this bar is analogous to the formation of an inner bend bar in case of flow bifurcation for instance at a side channel take off kleinhans et al 2013 and van denderen et al 2018 describe this phenomenon as development of a bar and scour zone possibly associated with a flow separation zone as described previously by neary and odgaard 1993 for a 90 channel offtake although no direct velocity measurements are performed in the triangle enclosed by the divergence bar the flume wall and the rip rap bank fig 5 the absence of morphological activity in this most upstream part of the side channel reflects the absence of a strong horizontal recirculation a similar configuration was studied numerically by van linge 2017 and jammers 2017 they did observe a horizontal recirculation zone upstream in the side channel but found no sediment transport over the sill towards this zone jammers 2017 thus the formation of the divergence bar is dominated by a divergence induced reduced flow velocity by 1 widening of the flow at the side channel entrance and 2 increased water depth after the sill 6 3 sill design and discharge division simulations by le et al 2018a b suggest that for a free inflow ltd system eventually one of the two channels will close this is undesirable because it makes the side channel unsuitable for recreational boating and results in increased discharge and erosion in the main channel the sill at the entrance of the ltd side channel shows to be an effective regulatory structure to prevent the side channel from closing a downstream decreasing sill height configuration c minimises the dredging efforts needed to keep the side channel open in the long term since much of the sediment deposited during low flow is removed during high flow the discharge division q side q tot which is an important driving parameter for morphological evolution in both main and side channel is well below the critical value of 0 27 in experiments b1 d1 fig 9 this critical value has been established as the threshold between effective narrowing and widening of the river after ltd construction this value is scaled from the field value of 0 12 obtained from rijkswaterstaat j sieben pers comm 2018 based on 45 of the normal width of the river being modelled boersema 2012 because the ltd is located in the inner bend of the river with the sill approximately at the inflexion point the actual discharge distribution q side q tot is underestimated in the scale model which is located in a straight flume this does not undermine the above conclusions yet even strengthens the statement that designs b d are preferred over design a in terms of discharge division combining the effects of sill geometry on morphological evolution of the side channel and discharge division over both channels design c is a promising sill geometry to be considered for field implementation 6 4 recommendations for future research although the present study provides clear insights in the morphological effects of horizontal flow separation downstream of the bifurcation at the side channel intake direct measurements of flow velocities in the flow separation cell could provide complementary insights on smaller scale flow patterns and large coherent structures in retrospect using an adv to measure flow velocities did not work out at some locations in the flume due to the limited water depth the water depth cannot easily be increased because non distorted geometric scaling is preferred due to the importance of 3 d flow patterns this calls for the use of additional measurement methods to monitor flow velocities in the physical scale model particle image velocimetry could be used to detect coherent structures at the water surface alternatively 3 d numerical modelling and a field campaign in which measurements are taken close to the ltd using for instance an acoustic doppler current profiler could shed light on the detailed flow patterns in this region 7 conclusions in a physical scale model representing the entrance region of a longitudinal training dam where a sill is constructed persistent morphological patterns are observed which resemble field observations an inner bend depositional bar develops against the side channel side of the ltd analogous to the deposition in the horizontal flow recirculation zone in a sharp river bend this bar is largely eroded again during high flows in the upstream part of the side channel a divergence bar is formed induced by divergence of the flow where the river widens and the depth increases after the sill whether or not the divergence bar is eroded during high flows depends on the geometry of the sill both bar types are also observed in a field pilot in the waal river the degree of erosion or sedimentation in the side channel during low and high flow conditions largely depends on the geometry of the sill which is therefore a suitable instrument for regulating sediment transport into the side channel to limit the amount of sedimentation in the side channel downstream of the bifurcation point a steep transition is desirable between the sill and the ltd crest the discharge into the side channel is primarily affected by the cross sectional area over the sill and little dependent on other sill characteristics such as the longitudinal slope overall a downstream decreasing sill height geometry c is promising because of the balance between minimised net sedimentation effects in the side channel and the required discharge division during low and high water

568,as part of a general trend towards river management solutions that provide more room for the river longitudinal training dams ltds have recently been constructed in the inner bend of the dutch waal river replacing groynes ltds split the river in a main channel and a bank connected side channel with a sill at the entrance in the present study a physical scale model with mobile bed was used to study morphological patterns and discharge division in the entrance region of such a side channel alternative geometric designs of the sill are tested to investigate the controls on the diversion of water and sediment into the side channel after reaching a morphodynamic equilibrium two bar features were observed in the side channel under low flow conditions an inner bend depositional bar emerged against the ltd resembling depositional bars observed in sharp river bends a second bar occurred in the most upstream part of the side channel next to the sill induced by divergence of the flow by widening of the channel and an increasing flow depth after the sill hence defined as a divergence bar the morphologically most active system in the side channel emerges for the configuration in which the sill height decreases in downstream direction for such a geometry the sediment that settles during low flow is largely eroded during high flow reducing maintenance needs a qualitative comparison based on a lab experiment mimicking field conditions demonstrates the realism of the experiments keywords longitudinal training dam river morphology side channel bifurcation physical scale model 1 introduction traditionally groynes have been widely used to fix the planform geometry of lowland rivers with the aim to keep the river navigable and to prevent ice jams przedwojski 1995 verheij et al 2004 yossef and de vriend 2011 groynes are known to have various side effects however among which erosion pits at groyne tips and a reduced ecological value in the riparian zone due to shipping waves ten brinke et al 1999 collas et al 2018 are the most severe to improve the ecosystem services of the river system rivers are allowed more space within restricted boundaries e g rijke et

longitudinal training dams ltds have been designed as a compromise between purely nature based solutions that favour ecological quality and hard engineering structures that ensure navigability they serve as a flood protection measure secure the fairway depth for shipping and leave enough room for ecological development havinga et al 2009 an ltd is a groyne like structure parallel to the river axis that splits the river in a main navigation channel and a bank connected side channel with a sill at the upstream side due to its orientation parallel to the river axis the flow resistance is limited this causes a lowering of the water level during floods which adds to flood safety of the hinterland during low discharges the flow is mainly restricted to the main channel this effectively reduces the width of the river leading to larger water depths in the main channel which benefits shipping finally ltds are expected to limit bed degradation and to provide favourable ecological conditions compared to groyne fields eerden et al 2011 havinga 2016 although they have been present for years already in france the loire river and germany the main rhine and elbe rivers detailed studies on the hydraulic and morphological effects of ltds are limited recently collas et al 2018 showed that ltds stabilise the flow behind the dam and reduce the influence of ship waves which creates favourable ecological conditions the ability of sediment particles to be transported into the side channel likely depends on the sill side slope and the angle at which water flows over the sill jammers 2017 in the presence of alternate bars in the main channel the two channel ltd system is in general morphologically unstable although a stable configuration might be reached when the upstream end of the ltd is located close to the bar top le et al 2018b in the latter case cyclic morphological behaviour may emerge even without external periodic forcing le et al 2018a the present work builds on prior work of vermeulen et al 2014 who to the authors knowledge were the first to experimentally study ltds they based their physical scale model scale 1 60 on a future projection of the waal river in the netherlands with prototype discharges of 1250 m 3 s 1 and 4600 m 3 s 1 the studied river section was a sand bedded lowland river with particle size distributions characterized by d 50 1 2 mm and d 90 2 0 mm in the physical scale model polystyrene particles were used as a surrogate sediment with d 50 2 1 mm d 90 2 9 mm and ρ s 1055 kg m 3 scaling was based on the shields number keeping the froude number close to prototype values vermeulen et al 2014 concluded that local morphological changes near the intake of an ltd side channel are expected to be limited they also showed that the sediment mobility is slightly overestimated by using polystyrene but dune height agrees well with corresponding prototype values and fairway deepening agrees well with the realised river narrowing by the ltd in the present study the physical model of vermeulen et al 2014 has been modified to match the design that has been built in the waal river in a pilot downstream of the city of tiel on this location ltd side channels replace former groyne fields over a 10 km stretch in the inner bends of the river where a riprap bank is present instead of upstream groynes the intake section of the side channel is chosen such that it matches the location where in former times a natural side channel cut into the floodplain fig 1 at about three quarters downstream from the upstream end a secondary opening with a sill is present in the ltd to enable exchange of water between the two channels even during low discharges in contrast to vermeulen et al 2014 no upstream groynes are constructed and the entrance of the side channel is marked by a sill in line with the ltd itself the latter is also different from the studies by le et al 2018a b who did not use any regulatory structure at the entrance of the side channel and used a thin plate to model the ltd prior studies also assumed a free inflow side channel adopting 1 d bolla pittaluga et al 2003 kleinhans et al 2008 bertoldi et al 2009 van der mark and mosselman 2013 2 d le et al 2018b and quasi 3 d kleinhans et al 2008 numerical models to explore bifurcation stability those studies elaborated on simple hypothetical relationships for sediment division wang et al 1995 the equilibrium discharge diversion to side channels has been studied as a function of various geometrical parameters by van denderen et al 2018 detailed flow patterns have been analysed as a function of various hydraulic and geometric boundary conditions hardy et al 2011 in the present contribution we add an upstream control mechanism to the side channel system in the form of a sill we aim to unravel how the geometry of this sill affects morphological changes and flow patterns around the side channel intake which is important for navigability ecology and dredging efforts we are in particular interested in 1 the morphological effects of possible flow separation downstream of the side channel intake 2 the morphological effects of flow divergence at the side channel entrance and 3 the effect of the sill on the discharge division over the two channels the experimental set up is described in section 2 consisting of the physical scale model and the measurement equipment used section 3 introduces the applied analysis methods the results are shown in section 4 addressing morphological changes flow characteristics and the discharge division thereafter a comparison between lab and field results is provided in section 5 followed by a discussion of the experimental findings in section 6 finally conclusions are formulated in section 7 2 experimental set up 2 1 prototype the ltd pilot in the dutch waal river eerden et al 2011 huthoff et al 2011 serves as a prototype for this scale model study the waal is a sand bedded mildly curved lowland river and the main branch of the rhine river in the netherlands bed morphology is predominantly determined by sediment transported in bedload mode with typical particle sizes of d 50 1 2 mm and d 90 2 0 mm flow velocities in the waal are typically around u 1 m s 1 two characteristic hydraulic conditions were defined consisting of a mean water depth of d 4 m low flow with a corresponding discharge of q 1250 m 3 s 1 and a mean water depth of d 8 m high flow with a corresponding discharge of q 4600 m 3 s 1 the ltd at the location of interest creates a side channel with a typical width of 90 m on a main channel bankfull width of 230 m the cross sectional profile of the prototype ltd is a trapezoid with side slopes of 1 2 5 an upper base of 2 m width and a typical height of 6 5 m 2 2 physical scale model the study s experiments took place in a straight horizontal flume with recirculation facilities for both water and sediment at the kraijenhoff van de leur laboratory for water and sediment dynamics wageningen university research the netherlands the flume measured 0 7 m 2 6 m 12 8 m internally height width length at the upstream end of the flume a stacked pile of pvc tubes served as a flow straightener to suppress large turbulence generated by the inlet geometry inside the flume we constructed a scale model of an ltd with an upstream riprap bank fig 2 adjusting the model of vermeulen et al 2014 a solid base was located between the ltd and the riprap bank where an adjustable gravel sill could be built upon the model was geometrically scaled from the prototype with a scaling factor of n l 60 in all dimensions the model represented a width of 156 m and a length of 720 m in the prototype a sediment layer of 20 cm thick completely covered the solid base of the flume only leaving the ltd 9 2 cm in height the riprap bank and the sill uncovered by recirculating the sediment in the flume the total volume of sediment in the system remained constant throughout the experiment four alternative sill geometries at the ltd side channel intake were studied fig 3 a a uniform low sill height b a downstream increasing sill height c a downstream decreasing sill height and d a uniform elevated sill height we chose these geometries to investigate the effect of differences in total cross sectional flow areas through comparison of alternatives a and d and lateral differences in cross sectional flow area through comparison of alternatives b and c the side slope of the sill was kept constant at 1 2 5 as is the case in the prototype in the waal river although the side slope plays a significant role in sediment transport over the sill jammers 2017 each of these geometries was studied under two hydraulic conditions that were scaled from the earlier mentioned low flow and high flow prototype conditions for each of the sill geometries measurements were carried out after reaching a morphodynamic equilibrium defined here as a dynamic equilibrium in which dune length in the main channel converged to a constant value of typically 70 cm each high flow experiment was carried out directly after the corresponding low flow experiment again allowing the system to reach a morphodynamic equilibrium to achieve dynamic similarity of both hydraulic characteristics and sediment transport in the physical scale model we used lightweight surrogate sediment particles polystyrene with a density of ρ s 1055 kg m 3 and typical sizes of d 50 2 1 mm and d 90 2 9 mm table 1 lists typical values for the hydraulic conditions and sediment characteristics for details on the underlying scaling method we refer to vermeulen et al 2014 who extensively discussed the method and the different non dimensional numbers 2 3 measurement equipment to measure flow velocities we used a vectrino profiler which is a profiling acoustic velocimeter nortek as 2013 this device captures both magnitude and direction of the velocity in vertical bins of 1 mm over a vertical range of 3 cm and at a frequency of 50 hz the lower end of the vertical range coincided with the initial bed level height z 20 cm except on top of the sill z 25 cm additionally a point measurement of the bed level directly underneath the instrument is retrieved we chose the measurement period such that approximately one dune had migrated to minimise the effect of bed mobility on the results the probe of the profiler did not disturb the bed significantly as the probe was located well above the bed with the gathered velocity data we investigated flow patterns around the intake of the ltd side channel and estimated the discharge division over the two channels for the latter the water level was also continuously monitored at eight points along the side walls of the flume for this purpose eight wall bound tubes were coupled to stilling wells outside the flume with each stilling well containing a magnetostrictive linear position sensor the total discharge was also continuously monitored using an electromagnetic flow meter fig 4 gives an overview of the locations of velocity and water level measurements in addition to flow velocities and discharge we monitored bed topography during subsequent phases of the experiment using a line laser scanner the use of a line laser scanner for bed level monitoring is a measurement method in which the bed elevation is detected from the reflection of light projected on the bed making use of a line laser and a 3 d camera allowing the bed level to be measured without disturbing the flow de ruijsscher et al 2018 the bed was scanned with an along flow resolution of 2 mm and an average cross flow resolution of approximately 3 mm in eight parallel partly overlapping swipes in this way the initial dry bed topography was determined as well as the initial bed topography under still water and the final bed topography because we are only interested in the final bed topography the flow was stopped before measuring this has the benefit of reducing the measurement error due to perturbations at the free surface 3 analysis methods 3 1 bed level change to determine bed level changes from the measured bed level values the bed level was interpolated to a regular grid by means of a loess algorithm vermeulen 2016 de ruijsscher et al 2018 now the bed level change δz b per horizontal cell was obtained according to 1 δ z b x y z b final x y z b 0 x y with z b 0 the initial bed level from this the cumulative sedimentation for the side channel was calculated by summing over all bed level cells in the side channel this results in 2 δ v side x 4000 mm y 950 mm δ z b x y δ x δ y with δx and δy the horizontal grid cell dimensions 3 2 flow velocities 3 2 1 depth averaged velocities to analyse the measured flow velocities from the profiling velocimeter spikes were detected and removed using a bivariate kernel distribution this method has been extensively described by islam and zhu 2013 based on earlier work of duong and hazelton 2003 and botev et al 2010 moreover only data points with a correlation of more than 70 for all four transducers are maintained lane et al 1998 and spatial cells with more than 50 missing values are omitted in further analysis the remaining velocity data after applying the above steps was interpolated using a cubic hermite spline for each velocity measurement point the time series was averaged over the 40 min bursts to average out turbulent fluctuations following 3 u 1 t t 1 t u with u the velocity component along the x axis a depth averaged velocity was obtained by integrating the previous result over a vertical range z 1 z 2 according to 4 u 1 z 2 z 1 z 1 z 2 u d z similar equations hold for the v and w components along y and z axis respectively 3 2 2 flow angle the inflow of water into the side channel was studied in more detail using the angle of the flow with the x axis calculated as 5 ϕ arctan v u the minus sign was needed to let ϕ 0 indicate flow into the side channel for high water level experiments a2 d2 ϕ was calculated on top of the sill y 888 mm for low water level experiments a1 d1 this was not possible due to limited water depth and ϕ was measured in the main channel y 1488 mm only velocity data points for which the normalised standard deviation of velocity component v did not exceed an empirically determined critical value of 0 7 were taken into account to avoid misinterpretation of ϕ values due to negligible near bed velocities this normalised standard deviation criterion was defined as 6 σ v u 0 7 3 2 3 discharge estimation an estimation of the discharge in both main and side channel was obtained by depth integrating velocity component u measured over a spanwise line and multiplying with the grid cell size δy as 7 q n 1 n z 1 z 2 u d z i 1 2 z 1 z 0 u z 1 ii 1 2 z wl z 2 u z 2 u z wl iii n δ y with n the total number of grid cells in the spanwise direction term i is the integration of time averaged velocity u over the measured vertical range z 1 z 2 term ii is the integration of linearly interpolated velocities between the lowest measured value u z 1 and u z 0 0 at the bed and term iii is the integration of the linearly extrapolated velocity profile towards the water surface z wl using the upper seven vertical cells to relate the discharge division to the cross sectional area over the sill this cross sectional area was defined as 8 a a 0 x 1 x 2 z sill x z 0 d x with reference cross section a 0 defined as 9 a 0 z ltd z 0 x 2 x 1 where x 1 x 2 4000 7950 mm and z ltd is the height of the ltd crest 3 3 flow contraction an often used method to define flow contraction is based on the quotient μ of the flow cross sectional areas at the location of maximum contraction and downstream of the contraction idel chik 1966 hamill 2001 because the water level was only measured at a limited number of points this is not feasible in the present study therefore an estimator was defined that depends both on the angle of the flow in the side channel just downstream of the ltd head and on the relative height of the bed level close to the ltd in the side channel 10 μ max 2 α π z 590 z 0 h z 0 where α arccos u u denotes the angle between the depth averaged velocity vector and the x axis z 590 is the mean bed level at y 590 mm and h is the mean water level in the main channel the maximum of α was taken over the measured flow velocity measurement locations within x 7985 8985 mm and α was chosen such that α π π 4 results 4 1 morphological changes in the side channel sedimentation and erosion patterns in the side channel of the ltd configuration showed large differences between the high water level regime and the low water level regime filled contours in fig 5 in addition significant differences are observed in patterns between alternative sill geometries in the following we focus consecutively on persistent morphological features including a depositional bar that developed downstream of the ltd head inner bend depositional bar on a depositional bar in the most upstream part of the side channel divergence bar and on the cumulative sedimentation for the entire side channel a schematic overview of these phenomena is provided afterwards in section 6 fig 11 4 1 1 inner bend depositional bar in the low flow experiments fig 5 a depositional bar developed against the slope of the ltd the location and intensity of this region of sedimentation depends on the geometrical characteristics of the sill in situations a1 low uniform sill height and c1 downstream decreasing sill height the general form of the bar showed to be identical although the sedimentation was more intense in case c1 for b1 downstream increasing sill height the bar started approximately 1 m more upstream with the region of sedimentation extending over the width of the side channel no sedimentation occurred in case d1 because the height of the sill was only just below the water level for cases a1 c1 the water flowed obliquely into the side channel creating a channel that curved around the above mentioned inner bend depositional bar because of this a region of erosion was created against the flume wall the longitudinal location of this erosion depends on the angle of inflow and therefore on the sill geometry during the high flow experiments most of the deposited sediment was eroded again and the inner bend depositional bar disappeared still a small region of sedimentation occurred against the ltd slope but the differences between experiments with alternative sill geometries were less pronounced although the flow still curves into the side channel flow velocities close to the ltd in the side channel were now non negligible and quasi parallel to the ltd and the main channel flow fig 5 a2 d2 4 1 2 divergence bar in the most upstream part of the side channel next to the sill a region of sedimentation occurred driven by flow divergence hence we adopt the term divergence bar for this morphological feature in the evolution towards a dynamic equilibrium this bar tilted under an increasing angle with the sill and shifted slightly upstream not shown during the low flow experimental conditions there were remarkable differences between runs with alternative sill geometries first of all the location of the divergence bar was shifted more downstream for c1 downstream decreasing sill height compared to a1 and b1 in addition to that and similar to what was observed for the inner bend depositional bar the deposition was spread out over a larger area for b1 and was absent for d1 due to the limited discharge into the side channel during the high flow experiments the divergence bar hardly changed for a2 for b2 the bar was diminished to its most upstream part whereas for c2 it completely disappeared in terms of flow patterns these differences were reflected in an inflow over the downstream half of the sill for a2 and over the upstream part of the sill for d2 eroding a deep inflow channel in the latter case fig 5 a2 and d2 geometries b and c can be seen as intermediate stages between these two extreme situations with geometry c creating the most dynamic system in terms of morphological changes in the latter experimental set up a large inner bend depositional bar and a divergence bar were observed at low flow whereas these were both almost completely eroded during high flow moreover the main inflow channel was shifted from close to the ltd head to a more sill parallel inflow over the upstream part of the sill 4 1 3 cumulative sedimentation to quantify the net sediment import between the starting situation with flat bed and the situation in morphodynamic equilibrium the cumulative sedimentation in the side channel is visualized in fig 6 hardly any difference was observed in cumulative sedimentation between experiments b and c with a large sedimentation volume in the side channel during low flow and a net erosive effect at the end of a high water period for a low uniform sill height i e large cross sectional area over the sill there was always net sedimentation with respect to the initial flat bed for d high uniform sill height i e small cross sectional area over the sill net erosion occurred under all circumstances although at low enough water levels the flow through the side channel is weak and erosion is negligible the most dynamic system in terms of sedimentation and erosion occurred for intermediate flow cross sectional areas over the sill i e sill geometries b and c this is likely due to the divergence bar being situated next to the downstream half of the sill fig 5 which renders the bar more prone to erosion during high flow 4 2 flow patterns 4 2 1 flow contraction both an inner bend depositional bar and a flow separation zone can give rise to flow contraction at the entrance of the side channel just downstream of the ltd head to quantify this effect eq 10 was used to calculate a flow contraction metric μ which peaks in experiments a1 and c1 fig 7 this implies that during low water levels the flow is contracted downstream of the sill with geometries a1 and c1 high flow experiments a2 c2 did not convincingly show this phenomenon although it is hard to draw conclusions on flow separation when no measurements are available inside the separation zone for experiments b1 and d1 no reliable value of μ could be determined due to weak flow for a high enough sill with uniform height like e g in situation d2 the morphological patterns suggest flow contraction in the side channel lower graph fig 5 however this could not be confirmed based on μ because it happened more downstream outside the region where flow velocity measurements were taken 4 2 2 inflow angle as observed in fig 5 the angle of the flow into the side channel varied depending on both sill geometry and water level to take a more detailed look at this the inflow angle ϕ as defined in eq 5 is shown in fig 8 in x z space for the low flow regime a1 d1 the inflow angle varied with the x coordinate in experiments a1 and b1 representing a low uniform sill height and a downstream increasing sill height respectively the inflow angle higher up in the water column was of equal magnitude over the entire length of the sill in experiment c1 where the sill height decreases downstream the flow angle increased in the downstream direction this indicates that the flow primarily entered the side channel over the downstream half of the sill which is reflected by the sedimentation patterns in fig 5 the fourth plot representing experiment d1 shows flow angles close to zero caused by the side channel entrance being almost completely blocked by the sill for high flow conditions when flow exchange occurs over the entire length of the ltd the inflow angle was of equal magnitude along the entire sill bottom three plots of fig 8 a2 c2 moreover there were hardly any differences between the alternative sill geometries except for the depth ranges although the inflow angle was mostly constant over depth it increased with depth at the most upstream part of the sill 4 3 discharge division the cross sectional area over the sill was not equal for the experiments which influenced the fraction of the total discharge flowing into the side channel fig 9 this is relevant because the water discharge division over the two channels controls the morphological evolution in both main and side channel for the low flow experiments the fraction of the discharge into the side channel increased with the cross sectional area as expected with river narrowing for low water levels and river widening for high water levels the side channel discharge fraction agrees reasonably well with values observed in the field j sieben pers comm 2018 and in a numerical study by huthoff et al 2011 although a slight underestimation is observed there was no significant difference between cases b1 and c1 which suggests that apart from the cross sectional area the geometry of the sill did not influence the discharge division in the high flow experiments there was no significant difference between the discharge division over the two channels related to flow exchange over the ltd crest 5 comparison with field pilot to establish the realism of the experiments a qualitative comparison was performed between the final bed level of experiment a1 and bed level data from multi beam echo soundings mbes in the field pilot the sill at the side channel intake has a uniform low height in the field similar to the situation in experiment a1 the mbes measurements were performed on 7 february 2017 which is more than 15 months after completion of the ltd pilot configuration the total river discharge at tiel 5 km upstream was q 1448 m 3 s 1 whereas minimum mean and maximum discharge over 2017 were q min 543 m 3 s 1 q 1379 m 3 s 1 and q max 5088 m 3 s 1 respectively the crest of the ltd was above the water surface during the field measurements at the side channel bank however remainders of old groynes are present which is different from the vertical flume wall in the scale model the presence of groyne remainders is reflected by the wavy pattern of the shoreline the river is mildly curved at the ltd section with the inflection point near the entrance of the side channel under study the qualitative comparison between the field pilot and experiment a1 shows that the main morphological features are well reproduced fig 10 but differences exist the erosion pit at the side channel flume wall is not observed in the field pilot this may indicate that the erosion pit is merely a flume wall effect which does not occur in the field pilot due to the mild slope of the bank a second explanation lies in the presence of old groyne remainders which stabilise the bank another discrepancy between lab experiments and field pilot regards the divergence bar in the most upstream part of the field pilot side channel which is less pronounced and located more downstream than observed in the scale model in the field pilot less sediment is deposited against the side channel slope of the ltd the more pronounced sedimentation and erosion patterns in the scale model side channel may be explained by the slightly exaggerated mobility of polystyrene particles in the scale model vermeulen et al 2014 6 discussion 6 1 inner bend depositional bar fig 11 offers a schematic overview of the bed morphology in the inlet region for low discharges flow contraction due to the inner bend depositional bar occurs especially in cases with a low sill height near the ltd i e a1 and c1 figs 5 and 7 this resembles flow separation in the inner bend of rivers as described by blanckaert et al 2012 who observed a flow separation cell downstream of the bend apex to better grasp the flow separation and subsequent inner bend depositional bar formation an additional experiment ab1 was performed designed as a combination of a1 and b1 it consists of a horizontal sill as in experiment a1 but with an increasing sill height from 2 5 to 7 5 cm over the downstream 25 of the sill in other words the slope of the transition from the lowest part of the sill to the ltd crest is 1 2 5 1 10 and 1 40 for a1 ab1 and b1 respectively analogous to fig 5 the bed level differences of experiments a1 ab1 and b1 are shown in fig 12 while the inner bend depositional bar is present in all cases shown the inflow angle is different impacting on the pattern of sedimentation and erosion downstream this inflow angle denoted by the black line in fig 12 is a measure of flow separation at the bifurcation point flow separation intensifies with decreasing steepness of the transition from the sill to the ltd crest from a via ab to b to limit the amount of sedimentation in the side channel downstream of the bifurcation point a steep transition is desirable between the sill and the ltd as in configurations a and c 6 2 divergence bar at the most upstream part of the side channel a bar is formed caused by the flow diverting into the side channel and over the sill fig 11 location ii one could argue that the formation of this bar is analogous to the formation of an inner bend bar in case of flow bifurcation for instance at a side channel take off kleinhans et al 2013 and van denderen et al 2018 describe this phenomenon as development of a bar and scour zone possibly associated with a flow separation zone as described previously by neary and odgaard 1993 for a 90 channel offtake although no direct velocity measurements are performed in the triangle enclosed by the divergence bar the flume wall and the rip rap bank fig 5 the absence of morphological activity in this most upstream part of the side channel reflects the absence of a strong horizontal recirculation a similar configuration was studied numerically by van linge 2017 and jammers 2017 they did observe a horizontal recirculation zone upstream in the side channel but found no sediment transport over the sill towards this zone jammers 2017 thus the formation of the divergence bar is dominated by a divergence induced reduced flow velocity by 1 widening of the flow at the side channel entrance and 2 increased water depth after the sill 6 3 sill design and discharge division simulations by le et al 2018a b suggest that for a free inflow ltd system eventually one of the two channels will close this is undesirable because it makes the side channel unsuitable for recreational boating and results in increased discharge and erosion in the main channel the sill at the entrance of the ltd side channel shows to be an effective regulatory structure to prevent the side channel from closing a downstream decreasing sill height configuration c minimises the dredging efforts needed to keep the side channel open in the long term since much of the sediment deposited during low flow is removed during high flow the discharge division q side q tot which is an important driving parameter for morphological evolution in both main and side channel is well below the critical value of 0 27 in experiments b1 d1 fig 9 this critical value has been established as the threshold between effective narrowing and widening of the river after ltd construction this value is scaled from the field value of 0 12 obtained from rijkswaterstaat j sieben pers comm 2018 based on 45 of the normal width of the river being modelled boersema 2012 because the ltd is located in the inner bend of the river with the sill approximately at the inflexion point the actual discharge distribution q side q tot is underestimated in the scale model which is located in a straight flume this does not undermine the above conclusions yet even strengthens the statement that designs b d are preferred over design a in terms of discharge division combining the effects of sill geometry on morphological evolution of the side channel and discharge division over both channels design c is a promising sill geometry to be considered for field implementation 6 4 recommendations for future research although the present study provides clear insights in the morphological effects of horizontal flow separation downstream of the bifurcation at the side channel intake direct measurements of flow velocities in the flow separation cell could provide complementary insights on smaller scale flow patterns and large coherent structures in retrospect using an adv to measure flow velocities did not work out at some locations in the flume due to the limited water depth the water depth cannot easily be increased because non distorted geometric scaling is preferred due to the importance of 3 d flow patterns this calls for the use of additional measurement methods to monitor flow velocities in the physical scale model particle image velocimetry could be used to detect coherent structures at the water surface alternatively 3 d numerical modelling and a field campaign in which measurements are taken close to the ltd using for instance an acoustic doppler current profiler could shed light on the detailed flow patterns in this region 7 conclusions in a physical scale model representing the entrance region of a longitudinal training dam where a sill is constructed persistent morphological patterns are observed which resemble field observations an inner bend depositional bar develops against the side channel side of the ltd analogous to the deposition in the horizontal flow recirculation zone in a sharp river bend this bar is largely eroded again during high flows in the upstream part of the side channel a divergence bar is formed induced by divergence of the flow where the river widens and the depth increases after the sill whether or not the divergence bar is eroded during high flows depends on the geometry of the sill both bar types are also observed in a field pilot in the waal river the degree of erosion or sedimentation in the side channel during low and high flow conditions largely depends on the geometry of the sill which is therefore a suitable instrument for regulating sediment transport into the side channel to limit the amount of sedimentation in the side channel downstream of the bifurcation point a steep transition is desirable between the sill and the ltd crest the discharge into the side channel is primarily affected by the cross sectional area over the sill and little dependent on other sill characteristics such as the longitudinal slope overall a downstream decreasing sill height geometry c is promising because of the balance between minimised net sedimentation effects in the side channel and the required discharge division during low and high water

569,tunnel drainage demonstrates a behavior that constantly drains the high ground subsurface water that feeds the overlying vegetative cover the environmental impact of construction process on groundwater table drawdown can be evaluated using groundwater models however considering only the effects of drawdown is insufficient to evaluate the vulnerability between the terrain surface and groundwater table we proposed a vulnerability analysis method based on soil water pressure by including the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac approach we defined the vulnerability based on the wilting point of the terrain vegetation a theoretical case study representing the groundwater level alterations that induce permanent wilting was investigated the vulnerability analysis method takes account of two important factors vegetation type and soil textures the results show that wilting is more infiltration dependent therefore it does not occur immediately once the water table is lower than rooting depth soil water pressure losses caused by groundwater table drawdowns are compensated when sufficient infiltration occurs without sufficient infiltration soil texture is an important factor for the resilience of vegetation cover under the influence of groundwater table drawdown in our case study layered soils lead to a flow behavior which makes the vegetation reach permanent

lee 2008 kværner and snilsberg 2008 li et al 2016a hydrological hydrogeological and environmental impacts on local ecosystem resulting from drawdown induced by tunnel excavation is attracting more research attention cesano et al 2000 raposo et al 2010 sweetenham et al 2017 vincenzi et al 2009 2014 wang et al 2017 groundwater inflow during excavation may cause large drawdowns in the groundwater table thus affecting the energy water balance of any associated ecosystems as reported in a study of a high speed railway tunneling between malaga and cordoba spain gisbert et al 2009 most inter city underground works such as highway and railway tunnels intersect with commercial farmlands or forested regions especially in emerging countries as china ouyang et al 2018 as a result drought instances have been observed on the high groundwater dependent species in the low land areas li et al 2018 therefore any change on groundwater environment or any disturbance on the water balance of catchments may cause environmental impacts detrimental to surrounding vegetation however occurrences of these incidents are hard to predict because they depend on several environmental and hydrological factors jukaine et al 1995 rosenberg et al 2000 accordingly it is essential to combine vegetative atmospheric and hydraulic parameter to address the occurrences of environmental impacts induced by tunnel drainage thus reducing environmental impacts is a challenge from a tunneling perspective previous studies that evaluate environmental impacts during tunnel excavation mostly focused on direct effects such as land hazards huang et al 2015 and water contamination chae et al 2008 vik et al 2000 besides that a few works focused on hydrological impact on groundwater environment from the drawdown perspective attanayake and waterman 2006 introduced a method for the early detection of environmental impacts on water resources by observing groundwater table before and during the tunnel construction liu et al 2015a applied an indicator system to an existing tunnel project to estimate the degree of drainage impact on groundwater environment li et al 2018 evaluated the potential environmental impacts of highway tunnel discharge based on groundwater table drawdowns considering the maximum rooting depth of pine trees growing in the vicinity of the tunnel however previous attempts for impact assessment neglected the availability of water in the soil above the groundwater table and drawdown was considered as the only parameter for establishing the assessment criteria the magnitude of the drawdown that is critical for preventing environmental impacts on vegetative cover and the period of time to reach the wilting point while being exposed to drawdown were not previously established in order to assess the environmental impacts on vegetative cover it is essential to focus on the dynamics of plant available water in topsoil between the terrain surface and groundwater table plant available soil water content has a non linear relationship with soil water pressure suction pressure h depending on soil texture tietje and hennings 1996 and variability of soil texture yeh 1989 it also depends on the infiltration rate and regional flow dynamics controlling the spatial variability of the groundwater table as well as the associated capillary rise fan et al 2017 because the vadose zone acts as a buffer zone between groundwater and atmospheric forcing soil water pressure is a concurrent parameter which interacts with atmospheric forcing granier et al 2000 norero 1969 vegetation type rooting zone fan et al 2017 yu et al 2016 and groundwater level balugani et al 2017 miguez macho et al 2008 zhang and schilling 2006 estimation of environmental impact on this critical zone with limited spatial information requires careful depiction of the physical factors mentioned above in this study vulnerability is defined as the condition when soil water pressure reduces to the wilting point which is caused by tunnel discharge from the perspective of environmental impacts and soil water dynamics the wilting point is the final point where vegetation is not capable of extracting water from the soil furr and reeve 1945 hendrickson and veihmeyer 1945 kirkham 2014 numerical models were developed to address temporal soil plant atmosphere continuum spac simmer et al 2014 for deep and shallow groundwater tables romano et al 1998 van walsum and groenendijk 2008 zeng and decker 2009 zhu et al 2012 although previous studies focused on soil water pressure by stressing key factors e g rooting depth soil texture the coupling of spac with groundwater table drawdown has rarely been evaluated this work aimed to propose a method to evaluate vulnerability conditions in a tunnel area by coupling topsoil water model with groundwater table drawdown the method was used to diagnose the dynamics that drives the vegetation into wilting we employed the vulnerability analysis on a specific case study to analyze whether the case is resilient to tunneling induced drawdown the method has the following components 1 including a model of topsoil water pressure to simulate drawdown effect 2 parameterization of wilting dynamics and its integration into vulnerability 3 impact assessment representing a variety of groundwater table boundary conditions bcs the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides site information and section 3 introduces the vulnerability assessment framework and defines the analysis criteria section 4 focuses on the dynamic behavior of wilting as an integral part of the framework and presents the application of the vulnerability analysis for the study site followed by discussion and conclusion in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study site this section provides information about our study site including location forest cover and vegetation long and short term weather conditions and relevant soil data 2 1 location and climate the mingtang tunnel study site is located on yuexi county anhui province mid eastern china fig 1 a the primary goal of the tunnel is to improve the connection between hubei and anhui provinces the 7 548 km long tunnel runs in an east to west direction 266 272 the tunnel has an average depth of 435 m maximum 548 m minimum 322 m below ground surface the study area around the tunnel 180 km2 as the part of the mingtang catchment corresponds to a deep fractured aquifer composed predominantly of moderately weathered granite and gneiss having three major faults along the tunnel axis chen et al 2016 li et al 2016b 2018 the topography is formed on wide concave valleys to the east and west by moderately steep escarpments across a 300 m elevation on the tunnel area topography ranges from low 300 m to moderate 300 m 800 m and high 800 m 900 m elevations which have relatively thinner soil with high organic content the mingtang region has a sub tropical humid climate annual rainfall for the year of tunnel construction 2013 2014 was 946 4 mm with an average annual temperature of 14 5 c 2 2 land cover and soil the region has been afforested from its original temperate deciduous cover to primarily mature chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata and bamboo forests phyllostachys pubescens and shrubs as understory species fig 1b with sparsely distributed farmlands as is a typical practice in china minghe and ritchie 1999 zhang et al 2011b an examination of a root profile to a depth of 1 m shows the typical forest structure in anhui province zhang et al 2011a the highest grounds have sparse distribution of pine trees pinus massoniana pinus hwangshanensis minor land use types consist of scattered built up areas high ground tea plantations on terraced land and partly irrigated agricultural land in valley bottoms most of the farmland along the corridor connecting the tunnel to highway is paddy field oryza sativa l where the surface is immersed in water for long periods some of the exploration boreholes encountered soft soil layers mainly composed of silt silty clay and soft plastic clay with a thickness of 0 5 2 1 m soil parent material consists of residual clay minerals from fully weathered gneiss and relatively thin silty clay layers soil profiles down to rock bodies extend to more than 20 m on some parts of the tunnel zone according to borehole observations 3 vulnerability assessment framework and methodology in this section we introduced a practical assessment framework to evaluate the vulnerability of a region against tunnel discharge components of framework is demonstrated and physical definition of vulnerability is made regarding to the key factors 3 1 assessment framework vulnerability analysis was conducted across the short term by using limited data which included information about the vegetation derived from literature daily atmospheric readings and typical soil profiles the buffering capacity of topsoil was tested from a vulnerability aspect we introduced the vulnerability assessment based on groundwater table drawdown and dynamic plant wilting section 3 3 from this we introduce a simple preliminary method to inform future tunneling decisions from an eco hydrological perspective fig 2 shows a schematic diagram to summarize the preliminary vulnerability framework and data requirements this framework contains three components modeling data and vulnerability analysis as the principal element of the method the vulnerability assessment framework allows us to test the occurrence of wilting of vegetation and the selected case study exceed the water limit if both conditions are met then the region would be deemed to be vulnerable to tunnel discharge of groundwater the proposed framework includes evaluation of dynamic root zone wilting for local scale of the tunnel region 3 2 vulnerability criteria we build our numerical experiment on the basis of permanent wilting point vulnerable conditions were specified for a wide range of wilting points based on the terrestrial vegetative cover kirkham 2014 the permanent wilting point is the final point of the stress range where plants start to die off and represents soil and vegetation dependent water pressure limits which are in a range of 5000 to 200 000 cm 0 5 to 19 6 mpa for a wide range of species slatyer 1957 according to this definition we defined the stomatal closure pressure h at 5000 cm and the average permanent wilting point hw at 8000 cm 0 79 mpa first criterion is that any condition that lowers topsoil water pressure down to the wilting point is considered as vulnerable the depth that corresponds to the hw of the root zone was called wilting depth δ w and partially occupies the total root depth δ therefore partial drying of root depth was represented as the percentage ratio of wilting depth over the entire root depth δ w δ 100 finally the second criterion for vulnerability status can be summarized as δ w δ δ e δ 0 5 the vulnerability assessment concludes depending on the outcome of the vulnerability analysis which is designed by incorporating dynamic root zone wilting fig 2 to test vulnerability criteria dynamics of soil water pressure from topsoil model reveal wilting status as a function of time depending on defined boundary conditions 3 3 dynamics on root zone wilting following the general characteristics of the mingtang area a basic transient topsoil model was introduced in appendix a this section describes the transient numerical experiment based on the basic topsoil model to reveal root zone wilting dynamics 3 3 1 boundary conditions and model parameters upper soil surface and the lower groundwater table boundary conditions were imposed on the basic topsoil model for simulating the root zone constant soil water flux q 0 and initial pressure h 0 were defined as the prescribed boundary conditions for an isothermal homogeneous soil prescribed boundary conditions were defined for the upper 1 q max q 0 at z 0 and the lower 2 h z t 0 at z z b 5 m partitioning of evapotranspiration et was assumed in the range of liu et al 2015b for sub tropical temperate broad leaved evergreen forest in which a large portion of the forest cover was composed of pine trees thus the annual partitioning ratio was set to be 8 for soil evaporation ε s and 60 for transpiration rate τ while total et was kept constant table 1 according to eq a1 the balance for wilting which is p ε c τ ε s was evaluated to satisfy wilting conditions the unsaturated model was implemented for two single profiles with 20 m thickness sandy loam high saturated conductivity k s 106 cm d and clay loam low saturated conductivity k s 3 6 cm d soil domains model parameter values are listed in table 2 homogeneous soil settings were used for root zone wilting analysis with clay loam and sandy loam soil textures suction in specified conditions was modeled by the inclusion of the hysteresis model lenhard et al 1991 hysteretic soil water characteristic curves for wetting and drying conditions were represented by the ratio of soil water retention parameters nielsen and luckner 1992 parker and lenhard 1987 šimůnek et al 2013 the ratio of wetting and drying parameters were assumed as α w α d 2 24 n w n d 1 and wetting and drying saturated water contents ratio was set as θ s w θ s d 0 9 based on the experiments conducted on a wide range of soil types likos et al 2014 the medium root density ravg 0 1 cm 3 and shape factor parameter b 2 were applied using previously published distribution parameters de jong van lier et al 2006 santos et al 2017 seasonal variations of rooting depth and root density were not considered rooting depths were assumed to be in the range 40 340 cm based on ex situ information taken from the compiled data from the literature see appended research data corresponding to the maximal and minimal values of rooting depths of temperate mixed coniferous and bamboo forests see section 2 thus the rooting depth was assumed to be the mean root depth of 100 cm for the base conditions each soil profile r δ r eq a7 was designed such that about 80 of the total root mass occupied the top portion of the soil yu et al 2007 zhuang et al 2001 which represents the effective root depth the wilting process was simulated for a long time by 1 to 5 day intervals depending on the spatial wilting rate for the pressure field and demonstrated until vulnerability criteria are met see fig 3 3 3 2 integration of vulnerability criteria with root zone wilting behavior results of the transient root zone pressure distributions are illustrated in fig 3 which shows the simulated wilting behavior with the same relative infiltration rates and a constant groundwater table level for two soil textures each pressure distribution represents a specific day early day pressure profiles represent relatively wetter soil than the following days until wilting conditions prevail the results are interpreted to parameterize the behavior of wilting and generalize the physical dynamics of the vulnerability the wilting process is not uni directional it initiates at the effective rooting depth z δ e and spreads over two directions simultaneously fig 3 a wetting front zd where infiltration prevails against transpiration and evaporation limits wilting close to the soil surface therefore we redefine the wilting depth as a modified wilting depth δ w which is the depth after the subtraction of the wetting front depth δ w δ w z d dynamic wilting analysis of root zone suggests that wilting was initially observed between z 10 and 20 cm after 1260 days and reached the vulnerable point δ w δ e on the 2060th day for clay loam fig 3a root zone wilting occurred between the 1560th and 2060th day because the presence of wetting front limited the upward movement of the wilting point δ w occupied approximately 52 of the root zone 52 cm at equilibrium which corresponds to wilting on the whole δ e the wilting process happened between the 21st and 30th day fig 3b for the sandy loam soil similar to the dynamics of wilting in the clay loam soil conversely δ w extended to 90 of the root zone 90 cm and satisfied the vulnerability criteria however the 30 day profile did not represent vulnerability conditions since δ w occupied 37 of the root zone 4 vulnerability assessment of the study site we aimed to capture the impact of early drawdown using the deep groundwater model li et al 2018 shown in fig 4 the groundwater level initially dropped to 15 m but then recovered after 20 days after the recovery maximum drawdown remained at approximately 7 5 m within the 300 day period as a result of groundwater recharge we tested the impact of this behavior on a selected case study at 200 m distance from the mingtang tunnel area which contains nearly saturated layered soil profiles with a shallow groundwater table zb t 1 1 2 m the following sections explain the model design section 4 1 soil profiles and details of specific case study section 4 2 and simulation results sections 4 3 and 4 4 4 1 model design and variable drawdown condition a variable lower bc was imposed on the unit profiles in order to represent time dependent groundwater table drawdown we used a simple transient drawdown model introduced by zhang and schilling 2006 the model is summarized as follows 3 z b t z b t 1 z b t 2 1 e α w t t where zb t is the transient water table depth after the elapse of time t zb t 2 is the asymptotic depth at which the groundwater table becomes stable α wt is the decline coefficient fig 5 here selection of α wt should be made carefully to determine a realistic variation in depth to the water table bc was defined as 4 h z t 0 at z z b t t 1 t t 2 where t 1 and t 2 are the initiation time of drawdown and the designated period after drawdown has finished respectively zb t 2 was set to be the highest saturated depth zb t 2 15 m for the 10 day simulation and initiated at zb t 1 1 2 m based on transient deep groundwater model simulation results in fig 4 for details see li et al 2018 we formulated three scenarios depending on drawdown rates fast α wt 1 0 t 1 moderate α wt 0 2 and slow α wt 0 1 on the 10th day the fast rate curve leads to 15 m moderate and slow curves occur at 12 5 m and 8 9 m groundwater table depths respectively the shift was demonstrated for the layered soil profile down on 15 m and simulations were extended for 300 days 4 2 soil profile the heterogeneous soil profile which is widely seen on study site with layered soil properties was introduced fig 6 in this work soil heterogeneity is restricted to k s associated with each layer on one dimensional vertical domain the layered soil profile was formulated with a shallow groundwater table which was assumed to exist on the low land section of the mingtang tunnel the profile was composed of loamy clay and silty mixture over a thick clay layer table 2 et was selected as 0 54 cm d by averaging weather data and calculated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1997 the average partitioning ratio was estimated from transient atmospheric bc as τ pet 0 75 which is equivalent to a total evaporation of 0 13 cm d rooting depth δ was assumed to be 100 cm the water table depth was set to 1 2 m below the soil surface as a safe condition for pine forest cover dominantly pinus massoniana cunninghamia lanceolata based on feasibility reports from the shanghai wuhan expressway project 4 3 dynamic root zone wilting above the tunnel area in this section our general focus is to test the effect of tunnel discharge induced drawdown on the vicinity of tunnel area groundwater recharge from topsoil was omitted and thus the recovery of the groundwater table was not included fig 7 shows the time dependent response of the topsoil to the drawdown groundwater table drawdown reached the fixed level on different times depending on α wt for the layered profile the difference between pressure distributions was identical due to drawdown rates therefore pressure profiles for only one rate is presented for all the other rates pressure profiles for variable drawdown rates are demonstrated in fig b 1 4 4 impact of heterogeneity on dynamic root zone wilting the equivalent homogeneous profile was formulated based on effective hydraulic conductivity k eff table 2 which is the perpendicular saturated hydraulic conductivity and equals the harmonic mean of hydraulic conductivities for each layer in the layered soil profiles sanchez vila et al 2006 k eff value for the layered soil profile was close to that for a sandy clay texture which was therefore selected for the equivalent homogeneous profile carsel and parrish 1988 same bcs of layered soil profile was imposed on the homogeneous soil profile bcs are summarized in fig 6 results were compared with the equivalent homogeneous soil profile to observe the impact of one dimensional heterogeneity different drawdown rates did not lead to different water pressure profiles fig b1 therefore in fig 7 only profiles of the slow drawdown rate are presented groundwater table drawdown does not correlate with topsoil dynamics directly and the saturated zone persisted between 0 6 m to 1 9 m in contrast to the homogeneous soil profile fig 7b the connection between the deep saturation zone and root depth was not disturbed by a low permeability layer silty clay but this did not limit the development of root wilting neither the heterogeneous soil profile nor the equivalent homogeneous soil profile exhibited wilting conditions in the first 10 days the heterogeneous profile fig 7a water pressure drained down to the wilting pressure in 11 days from the 11th day water pressure decreased to the wilting point and the vulnerability criteria were satisfied δ w δ e on the 220th day in the layered soil however the vulnerable condition occurred on the 300th day in the homogeneous profile the gray area in fig 7a and b overall root zone pressure levels varied independently of the rate of drawdown and this varied due to heterogeneity of soil types 5 discussion 5 1 root zone under vulnerability conditions the results of analyses of dynamic wilting fig 3 based on numerical experiment suggest that the wilting process is not a straightforward phenomenon rather it requires interpretation across time to integrate with the vulnerability assessment framework the wilting process continues until the root wilting depth δ w δ w in the case of the wetting front reaches at least 50 of entire root depth in general δ w depends on zb and soil texture therefore a deep water table may not lead plants to wilt in fine texture soils which have a large capacity to store plant available water conversely δ w may occupy the entire effective root depth under conditions of a shallow water table for coarse texture soils regarding a single zb 5 m dynamic root zone analysis proves that rainfall occurs the wilting process does not initiate directly from the soil surface but at a depth of 30 cm for both textures and δ w extends down to the root zone until pressure equilibrium is satisfied the water pressure in the upper part of the root zone never decreased to the wilting point because of the wetting front that existed within the upper part of the soil profile finally independent of soil texture a sufficient amount of rainfall induced infiltration can secure the water content of the upper part of the root zone and this may neutralize the effect of groundwater drawdown in the dynamic wilting analysis wilting time differs depending on soil texture as expected wilting on a clay loam profile was substantially slower than on a sandy loam soil however in reality infiltration rates vary independently of ks depending on rainfall intensity based on the imposed bcs transpiration rate of the clay loam table 1 was relatively insignificant and this may not indicate vulnerability as seen from the impacts of atmospheric bcs variable rates of pet and p may change the wilting behavior as having ks values lower than clay loam and clay in the long term plant roots and root distribution changes as well as the other vegetative parameters chaves et al 2003 taylor and klepper 1979 however we have not included root growth dynamics in the topsoil model therefore the clay loam soil profile is least likely to reach the state depicted in fig 3 5 2 impact on vulnerable case shallow groundwater table soil we checked the assumption by li et al 2018 which suggested that the highest drawdown that arose was approximately 15 m and that this occurred after the initiation of tunnel drainage fig 4 to examine the impact probability to test the assumption from vulnerability perspective a layered soil profile with a shallow water table located on a low land area was specified and compared with their equivalent homogeneous soil our findings suggest that topsoil water pressure behaves independently of groundwater drawdown an indication of wilting was not present for the initial 10 days furthermore the rate of drawdown did not affect topsoil pressure for daily time scale in general topsoil water pressure was reduced throughout the duration of the 300 day simulation however the vulnerability criteria were not being met for a long time which is an indication that the plant available moisture content for mingtang soil was independent of groundwater drawdown during the early phase the response of the root zone differs according to the heterogeneity of the soil profile thus the response depended on the order of the layers the layered soil profile was composed in such a way that the higher ks clay layer was located above the lower ks silty clay layer and thus the upper layer maintained the supply of plant available water and increased the resistance of pine trees to early wilting the perched water condition kelln et al 2009 created a delay in the drying process induced by groundwater table drawdown fig 7a where the silty clay layer inhibited any decrease in the saturated water level consequently the topsoil water pressure behaved differently according to the varying texture of the soil yeh 1989 the homogeneous soil profile in the case study demonstrated the development of the wilting condition in different way fig 7b where wilting conditions were met with a delay the difference of the wilting dynamics proved that the wilting process is dependent more on soil heterogeneity than bcs therefore soil heterogeneity is a factor that should be carefully addressed which effects the vulnerability assessment results 5 3 preliminary framework for impact control the environmental impact from tunneling perspective is mostly considered as acute effects during construction periods such as pollution or land hazards e g ground settlement however we claim that long term discharge from the tunnel is critical for regional water budget which is directly affected by atmospheric changes and fluctuations of groundwater any discharge level cannot be compensated by the water resources of a local environment for a certain duration of time e g a year or more leads incremental adverse effects on the environment thus may exceed the impact of acute effects therefore the region would be classified as vulnerable the main purpose of the assessment framework is to give preliminary insight for decision makers about the vulnerability of a region against tunnel discharge we designed a simple method that provides sufficient information with the help of numerical models outcomes of dynamic root zone wilting analysis proved that the assessment is successful in linking discharge impact and physical modeling in this study we have conducted vulnerability analysis on a hypothetical case study based on real study site for a short period up to 300 days however we did not include atmospheric changes and focused on dynamic wilting concept it is imperative to extend the analysis to decadal time scales to have a better evaluation of the environmental impact by changes to local weather conditions extension of the vulnerability analysis of the proposed framework may provide the impact of long term atmospheric alterations on vulnerability the framework has the potential to apply regionally to classify locations that are vulnerable to tunnel discharge the precision of assessment can be increased by having more detailed soil profiles and vegetation data 6 summary and conclusion this study introduces a vulnerability assessment framework by coupling topsoil water model with deep tunnel discharge soil water pressure was introduced as a new performance metric for the vulnerability analysis in the unsaturated zone above groundwater table accordingly vulnerability criteria were defined by combining plant wilting and water pressure distribution dynamic root zone wilting process was performed to parameterize vulnerability via transient unsaturated flow simulation theoretical case study was presented to demonstrate the application of vulnerability analysis for layered soil and vegetation cover analysis results for the study site showed that drawdown larger than the root zone depth alone did not satisfy vulnerability criteria transient groundwater table drawdown on topsoil did not manifest vulnerable conditions before the 220th day of the simulation case study results demonstrated that the development of wilting in such occasions depended on the boundary conditions and the formation of the soil types with deep water levels being independent of the rate of tunnel discharge the equivalent homogeneous pressure profile results showed different vulnerability status than observed in the layered soil simulation with a delay of wilting time the study presents deeper insight into potential environmental impacts induced by deep tunnel drainage our future study will focus on the improvement of the vulnerability assessment by integrating atmospheric forcing and the climatic factors into the framework acknowledgments the research was conducted with support from the

the fundamental research funds for central universities appendix a this appendix explains the design and assumptions of the basic transient topsoil model and root water uptake a 1 transient topsoil model the basic model setting was initiated as a transient solution of unsaturated flow for a homogeneous soil profile fig a1 the model was designed to represent the soil plant atmosphere continuum coupled with a tunnel discharge induced groundwater table drawdown root zone wilting could be assessed by analyzing transient root zone pressure profiles in which the transition of water pressure into hw was observed more theoretical cases could be introduced by increasing model complexity over the basic model in the basic model the water balance of the critical zone namely the zone between saturated water level and terrain surface or vadose zone is described by a1 q 0 p i e t p ε c ε s τ where in the absence of surface runoff q 0 is the initial soil water flux p is daily precipitation et and i stand for potential evapotranspiration and relative canopy interception respectively as the parameters to characterize partitioning ε c and ε s represent canopy and soil evaporation respectively it was assumed that all canopy interception is equivalent to ε c meaning all intercepted rainfall evaporates from the vegetation canopy τ is transpiration rate of the associated vegetative cover which is modeled as a function of rooting depth soil water pressure distributions were simulated with hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 the vadose zone was physically modeled by using the richards equation to simulate unsaturated flow as a2 θ z t z k h d h d z 1 s z where z denotes vertical coordinate θ z represents water content h is the soil water pressure and k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity s z is the root water uptake term integrated with the method proposed by feddes 1978 summarized as a3 s z μ h s p z where sp z is potential root water uptake rate l3l 3 t 1 and μ h is a dimensionless stepwise water pressure response function šimunek et al 1992 summarized below a4 μ h 0 h h w h h w h h w h w h h 1 h h where hw is the wilting point pressure and h represents the point of stomatal closure the function regulates root water uptake as plants cease to extract water below hw μ h 0 above hw root water uptake increases linearly up to h as the soil gets wetter conditions at which water pressure exceeds h represent the maximum rate of uptake unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h was modeled using the mualem van genuchten soil hydraulic model with an air

wetting or drying cycles respectively a 2 design of root water uptake rooting systems were designed using the santos model see below where the vegetation assumed to be fully grown and root has not been truncated by any solid obstacle water uptake along the rooting depth δwas controlled by root density distribution function which is modeled as follows santos et al 2017 a7 r δ r b 2 r a v g b ex

supply is provided by the upper 50 of the total rooting depth which we have called the effective rooting depth δ e bennett and doss 1960 root water uptake ceases irreversibly once water pressure within δ e completely reduces to the wilting pressure hw water uptake is arranged in such a way that the plants would immediately start to extract water at a maximum rate when soil water pressure h is less than 1 h max 1 and remains at this maximum rate until h reduces to stomatal pressure h and then diminishes linearly to zero at hw the root water uptake function is shown in fig a1 actual water uptake behaves as a function of pressure distribution as shown in eq a4 and represented by μ h appendix b figs a1 and b1 
569,tunnel drainage demonstrates a behavior that constantly drains the high ground subsurface water that feeds the overlying vegetative cover the environmental impact of construction process on groundwater table drawdown can be evaluated using groundwater models however considering only the effects of drawdown is insufficient to evaluate the vulnerability between the terrain surface and groundwater table we proposed a vulnerability analysis method based on soil water pressure by including the soil plant atmosphere continuum spac approach we defined the vulnerability based on the wilting point of the terrain vegetation a theoretical case study representing the groundwater level alterations that induce permanent wilting was investigated the vulnerability analysis method takes account of two important factors vegetation type and soil textures the results show that wilting is more infiltration dependent therefore it does not occur immediately once the water table is lower than rooting depth soil water pressure losses caused by groundwater table drawdowns are compensated when sufficient infiltration occurs without sufficient infiltration soil texture is an important factor for the resilience of vegetation cover under the influence of groundwater table drawdown in our case study layered soils lead to a flow behavior which makes the vegetation reach permanent wilting earlier than the homogeneous counterpart vulnerability analysis of vegetation cover can be regarded as an important step for an environment friendly tunnel drainage design keywords unsaturated

underground discharge caused by tunneling systems may lead to fundamental changes in the flow dynamics of both saturated scheidler et al 2017 and vadose zones kong et al 2015 the impact of underground tunnel discharge has received little attention from eco hydrological perspective despite of having observable effects on groundwater and surface water butscher et al 2011 chiu and chia 2012 kim and lee 2008 kværner and snilsberg 2008 li et al 2016a hydrological hydrogeological and environmental impacts on local ecosystem resulting from drawdown induced by tunnel excavation is attracting more research attention cesano et al 2000 raposo et al 2010 sweetenham et al 2017 vincenzi et al 2009 2014 wang et al 2017 groundwater inflow during excavation may cause large drawdowns in the groundwater table thus affecting the energy water balance of any associated ecosystems as reported in a study of a high speed railway tunneling between malaga and cordoba spain gisbert et al 2009 most inter city underground works such as highway and railway tunnels intersect with commercial farmlands or forested regions especially in emerging countries as china ouyang et al 2018 as a result drought instances have been observed on the high groundwater dependent species in the low land areas li et al 2018 therefore any change on groundwater environment or any disturbance on the water balance of catchments may cause environmental impacts detrimental to surrounding vegetation however occurrences of these incidents are hard to predict because they depend on several environmental and hydrological factors jukaine et al 1995 rosenberg et al 2000 accordingly it is essential to combine vegetative atmospheric and hydraulic parameter to address the occurrences of environmental impacts induced by tunnel drainage thus reducing environmental impacts is a challenge from a tunneling perspective previous studies that evaluate environmental impacts during tunnel excavation mostly focused on direct effects such as land hazards huang et al 2015 and water contamination chae et al 2008 vik et al 2000 besides that a few works focused on hydrological impact on groundwater environment from the drawdown perspective attanayake and waterman 2006 introduced a method for the early detection of environmental impacts on water resources by observing groundwater table before and during the tunnel construction liu et al 2015a applied an indicator system to an existing tunnel project to estimate the degree of drainage impact on groundwater environment li et al 2018 evaluated the potential environmental impacts of highway tunnel discharge based on groundwater table drawdowns considering the maximum rooting depth of pine trees growing in the vicinity of the tunnel however previous attempts for impact assessment neglected the availability of water in the soil above the groundwater table and drawdown was considered as the only parameter for establishing the assessment criteria the magnitude of the drawdown that is critical for preventing environmental impacts on vegetative cover and the period of time to reach the wilting point while being exposed to drawdown were not previously established in order to assess the environmental impacts on vegetative cover it is essential to focus on the dynamics of plant available water in topsoil between the terrain surface and groundwater table plant available soil water content has a non linear relationship with soil water pressure suction pressure h depending on soil texture tietje and hennings 1996 and variability of soil texture yeh 1989 it also depends on the infiltration rate and regional flow dynamics controlling the spatial variability of the groundwater table as well as the associated capillary rise fan et al 2017 because the vadose zone acts as a buffer zone between groundwater and atmospheric forcing soil water pressure is a concurrent parameter which interacts with atmospheric forcing granier et al 2000 norero 1969 vegetation type rooting zone fan et al 2017 yu et al 2016 and groundwater level balugani et al 2017 miguez macho et al 2008 zhang and schilling 2006 estimation of environmental impact on this critical zone with limited spatial information requires careful depiction of the physical factors mentioned above in this study vulnerability is defined as the condition when soil water pressure reduces to the wilting point which is caused by tunnel discharge from the perspective of environmental impacts and soil water dynamics the wilting point is the final point where vegetation is not capable of extracting water from the soil furr and reeve 1945 hendrickson and veihmeyer 1945 kirkham 2014 numerical models were developed to address temporal soil plant atmosphere continuum spac simmer et al 2014 for deep and shallow groundwater tables romano et al 1998 van walsum and groenendijk 2008 zeng and decker 2009 zhu et al 2012 although previous studies focused on soil water pressure by stressing key factors e g rooting depth soil texture the coupling of spac with groundwater table drawdown has rarely been evaluated this work aimed to propose a method to evaluate vulnerability conditions in a tunnel area by coupling topsoil water model with groundwater table drawdown the method was used to diagnose the dynamics that drives the vegetation into wilting we employed the vulnerability analysis on a specific case study to analyze whether the case is resilient to tunneling induced drawdown the method has the following components 1 including a model of topsoil water pressure to simulate drawdown effect 2 parameterization of wilting dynamics and its integration into vulnerability 3 impact assessment representing a variety of groundwater table boundary conditions bcs the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides site information and section 3 introduces the vulnerability assessment framework and defines the analysis criteria section 4 focuses on the dynamic behavior of wilting as an integral part of the framework and presents the application of the vulnerability analysis for the study site followed by discussion and conclusion in sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 study site this section provides information about our study site including location forest cover and vegetation long and short term weather conditions and relevant soil data 2 1 location and climate the mingtang tunnel study site is located on yuexi county anhui province mid eastern china fig 1 a the primary goal of the tunnel is to improve the connection between hubei and anhui provinces the 7 548 km long tunnel runs in an east to west direction 266 272 the tunnel has an average depth of 435 m maximum 548 m minimum 322 m below ground surface the study area around the tunnel 180 km2 as the part of the mingtang catchment corresponds to a deep fractured aquifer composed predominantly of moderately weathered granite and gneiss having three major faults along the tunnel axis chen et al 2016 li et al 2016b 2018 the topography is formed on wide concave valleys to the east and west by moderately steep escarpments across a 300 m elevation on the tunnel area topography ranges from low 300 m to moderate 300 m 800 m and high 800 m 900 m elevations which have relatively thinner soil with high organic content the mingtang region has a sub tropical humid climate annual rainfall for the year of tunnel construction 2013 2014 was 946 4 mm with an average annual temperature of 14 5 c 2 2 land cover and soil the region has been afforested from its original temperate deciduous cover to primarily mature chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata and bamboo forests phyllostachys pubescens and shrubs as understory species fig 1b with sparsely distributed farmlands as is a typical practice in china minghe and ritchie 1999 zhang et al 2011b an examination of a root profile to a depth of 1 m shows the typical forest structure in anhui province zhang et al 2011a the highest grounds have sparse distribution of pine trees pinus massoniana pinus hwangshanensis minor land use types consist of scattered built up areas high ground tea plantations on terraced land and partly irrigated agricultural land in valley bottoms most of the farmland along the corridor connecting the tunnel to highway is paddy field oryza sativa l where the surface is immersed in water for long periods some of the exploration boreholes encountered soft soil layers mainly composed of silt silty clay and soft plastic clay with a thickness of 0 5 2 1 m soil parent material consists of residual clay minerals from fully weathered gneiss and relatively thin silty clay layers soil profiles down to rock bodies extend to more than 20 m on some parts of the tunnel zone according to borehole observations 3 vulnerability assessment framework and methodology in this section we introduced a practical assessment framework to evaluate the vulnerability of a region against tunnel discharge components of framework is demonstrated and physical definition of vulnerability is made regarding to the key factors 3 1 assessment framework vulnerability analysis was conducted across the short term by using limited data which included information about the vegetation derived from literature daily atmospheric readings and typical soil profiles the buffering capacity of topsoil was tested from a vulnerability aspect we introduced the vulnerability assessment based on groundwater table drawdown and dynamic plant wilting section 3 3 from this we introduce a simple preliminary method to inform future tunneling decisions from an eco hydrological perspective fig 2 shows a schematic diagram to summarize the preliminary vulnerability framework and data requirements this framework contains three components modeling data and vulnerability analysis as the principal element of the method the vulnerability assessment framework allows us to test the occurrence of wilting of vegetation and the selected case study exceed the water limit if both conditions are met then the region would be deemed to be vulnerable to tunnel discharge of groundwater the proposed framework includes evaluation of dynamic root zone wilting for local scale of the tunnel region 3 2 vulnerability criteria we build our numerical experiment on the basis of permanent wilting point vulnerable conditions were specified for a wide range of wilting points based on the terrestrial vegetative cover kirkham 2014 the permanent wilting point is the final point of the stress range where plants start to die off and represents soil and vegetation dependent water pressure limits which are in a range of 5000 to 200 000 cm 0 5 to 19 6 mpa for a wide range of species slatyer 1957 according to this definition we defined the stomatal closure pressure h at 5000 cm and the average permanent wilting point hw at 8000 cm 0 79 mpa first criterion is that any condition that lowers topsoil water pressure down to the wilting point is considered as vulnerable the depth that corresponds to the hw of the root zone was called wilting depth δ w and partially occupies the total root depth δ therefore partial drying of root depth was represented as the percentage ratio of wilting depth over the entire root depth δ w δ 100 finally the second criterion for vulnerability status can be summarized as δ w δ δ e δ 0 5 the vulnerability assessment concludes depending on the outcome of the vulnerability analysis which is designed by incorporating dynamic root zone wilting fig 2 to test vulnerability criteria dynamics of soil water pressure from topsoil model reveal wilting status as a function of time depending on defined boundary conditions 3 3 dynamics on root zone wilting following the general characteristics of the mingtang area a basic transient topsoil model was introduced in appendix a this section describes the transient numerical experiment based on the basic topsoil model to reveal root zone wilting dynamics 3 3 1 boundary conditions and model parameters upper soil surface and the lower groundwater table boundary conditions were imposed on the basic topsoil model for simulating the root zone constant soil water flux q 0 and initial pressure h 0 were defined as the prescribed boundary conditions for an isothermal homogeneous soil prescribed boundary conditions were defined for the upper 1 q max q 0 at z 0 and the lower 2 h z t 0 at z z b 5 m partitioning of evapotranspiration et was assumed in the range of liu et al 2015b for sub tropical temperate broad leaved evergreen forest in which a large portion of the forest cover was composed of pine trees thus the annual partitioning ratio was set to be 8 for soil evaporation ε s and 60 for transpiration rate τ while total et was kept constant table 1 according to eq a1 the balance for wilting which is p ε c τ ε s was evaluated to satisfy wilting conditions the unsaturated model was implemented for two single profiles with 20 m thickness sandy loam high saturated conductivity k s 106 cm d and clay loam low saturated conductivity k s 3 6 cm d soil domains model parameter values are listed in table 2 homogeneous soil settings were used for root zone wilting analysis with clay loam and sandy loam soil textures suction in specified conditions was modeled by the inclusion of the hysteresis model lenhard et al 1991 hysteretic soil water characteristic curves for wetting and drying conditions were represented by the ratio of soil water retention parameters nielsen and luckner 1992 parker and lenhard 1987 šimůnek et al 2013 the ratio of wetting and drying parameters were assumed as α w α d 2 24 n w n d 1 and wetting and drying saturated water contents ratio was set as θ s w θ s d 0 9 based on the experiments conducted on a wide range of soil types likos et al 2014 the medium root density ravg 0 1 cm 3 and shape factor parameter b 2 were applied using previously published distribution parameters de jong van lier et al 2006 santos et al 2017 seasonal variations of rooting depth and root density were not considered rooting depths were assumed to be in the range 40 340 cm based on ex situ information taken from the compiled data from the literature see appended research data corresponding to the maximal and minimal values of rooting depths of temperate mixed coniferous and bamboo forests see section 2 thus the rooting depth was assumed to be the mean root depth of 100 cm for the base conditions each soil profile r δ r eq a7 was designed such that about 80 of the total root mass occupied the top portion of the soil yu et al 2007 zhuang et al 2001 which represents the effective root depth the wilting process was simulated for a long time by 1 to 5 day intervals depending on the spatial wilting rate for the pressure field and demonstrated until vulnerability criteria are met see fig 3 3 3 2 integration of vulnerability criteria with root zone wilting behavior results of the transient root zone pressure distributions are illustrated in fig 3 which shows the simulated wilting behavior with the same relative infiltration rates and a constant groundwater table level for two soil textures each pressure distribution represents a specific day early day pressure profiles represent relatively wetter soil than the following days until wilting conditions prevail the results are interpreted to parameterize the behavior of wilting and generalize the physical dynamics of the vulnerability the wilting process is not uni directional it initiates at the effective rooting depth z δ e and spreads over two directions simultaneously fig 3 a wetting front zd where infiltration prevails against transpiration and evaporation limits wilting close to the soil surface therefore we redefine the wilting depth as a modified wilting depth δ w which is the depth after the subtraction of the wetting front depth δ w δ w z d dynamic wilting analysis of root zone suggests that wilting was initially observed between z 10 and 20 cm after 1260 days and reached the vulnerable point δ w δ e on the 2060th day for clay loam fig 3a root zone wilting occurred between the 1560th and 2060th day because the presence of wetting front limited the upward movement of the wilting point δ w occupied approximately 52 of the root zone 52 cm at equilibrium which corresponds to wilting on the whole δ e the wilting process happened between the 21st and 30th day fig 3b for the sandy loam soil similar to the dynamics of wilting in the clay loam soil conversely δ w extended to 90 of the root zone 90 cm and satisfied the vulnerability criteria however the 30 day profile did not represent vulnerability conditions since δ w occupied 37 of the root zone 4 vulnerability assessment of the study site we aimed to capture the impact of early drawdown using the deep groundwater model li et al 2018 shown in fig 4 the groundwater level initially dropped to 15 m but then recovered after 20 days after the recovery maximum drawdown remained at approximately 7 5 m within the 300 day period as a result of groundwater recharge we tested the impact of this behavior on a selected case study at 200 m distance from the mingtang tunnel area which contains nearly saturated layered soil profiles with a shallow groundwater table zb t 1 1 2 m the following sections explain the model design section 4 1 soil profiles and details of specific case study section 4 2 and simulation results sections 4 3 and 4 4 4 1 model design and variable drawdown condition a variable lower bc was imposed on the unit profiles in order to represent time dependent groundwater table drawdown we used a simple transient drawdown model introduced by zhang and schilling 2006 the model is summarized as follows 3 z b t z b t 1 z b t 2 1 e α w t t where zb t is the transient water table depth after the elapse of time t zb t 2 is the asymptotic depth at which the groundwater table becomes stable α wt is the decline coefficient fig 5 here selection of α wt should be made carefully to determine a realistic variation in depth to the water table bc was defined as 4 h z t 0 at z z b t t 1 t t 2 where t 1 and t 2 are the initiation time of drawdown and the designated period after drawdown has finished respectively zb t 2 was set to be the highest saturated depth zb t 2 15 m for the 10 day simulation and initiated at zb t 1 1 2 m based on transient deep groundwater model simulation results in fig 4 for details see li et al 2018 we formulated three scenarios depending on drawdown rates fast α wt 1 0 t 1 moderate α wt 0 2 and slow α wt 0 1 on the 10th day the fast rate curve leads to 15 m moderate and slow curves occur at 12 5 m and 8 9 m groundwater table depths respectively the shift was demonstrated for the layered soil profile down on 15 m and simulations were extended for 300 days 4 2 soil profile the heterogeneous soil profile which is widely seen on study site with layered soil properties was introduced fig 6 in this work soil heterogeneity is restricted to k s associated with each layer on one dimensional vertical domain the layered soil profile was formulated with a shallow groundwater table which was assumed to exist on the low land section of the mingtang tunnel the profile was composed of loamy clay and silty mixture over a thick clay layer table 2 et was selected as 0 54 cm d by averaging weather data and calculated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1997 the average partitioning ratio was estimated from transient atmospheric bc as τ pet 0 75 which is equivalent to a total evaporation of 0 13 cm d rooting depth δ was assumed to be 100 cm the water table depth was set to 1 2 m below the soil surface as a safe condition for pine forest cover dominantly pinus massoniana cunninghamia lanceolata based on feasibility reports from the shanghai wuhan expressway project 4 3 dynamic root zone wilting above the tunnel area in this section our general focus is to test the effect of tunnel discharge induced drawdown on the vicinity of tunnel area groundwater recharge from topsoil was omitted and thus the recovery of the groundwater table was not included fig 7 shows the time dependent response of the topsoil to the drawdown groundwater table drawdown reached the fixed level on different times depending on α wt for the layered profile the difference between pressure distributions was identical due to drawdown rates therefore pressure profiles for only one rate is presented for all the other rates pressure profiles for variable drawdown rates are demonstrated in fig b 1 4 4 impact of heterogeneity on dynamic root zone wilting the equivalent homogeneous profile was formulated based on effective hydraulic conductivity k eff table 2 which is the perpendicular saturated hydraulic conductivity and equals the harmonic mean of hydraulic conductivities for each layer in the layered soil profiles sanchez vila et al 2006 k eff value for the layered soil profile was close to that for a sandy clay texture which was therefore selected for the equivalent homogeneous profile carsel and parrish 1988 same bcs of layered soil profile was imposed on the homogeneous soil profile bcs are summarized in fig 6 results were compared with the equivalent homogeneous soil profile to observe the impact of one dimensional heterogeneity different drawdown rates did not lead to different water pressure profiles fig b1 therefore in fig 7 only profiles of the slow drawdown rate are presented groundwater table drawdown does not correlate with topsoil dynamics directly and the saturated zone persisted between 0 6 m to 1 9 m in contrast to the homogeneous soil profile fig 7b the connection between the deep saturation zone and root depth was not disturbed by a low permeability layer silty clay but this did not limit the development of root wilting neither the heterogeneous soil profile nor the equivalent homogeneous soil profile exhibited wilting conditions in the first 10 days the heterogeneous profile fig 7a water pressure drained down to the wilting pressure in 11 days from the 11th day water pressure decreased to the wilting point and the vulnerability criteria were satisfied δ w δ e on the 220th day in the layered soil however the vulnerable condition occurred on the 300th day in the homogeneous profile the gray area in fig 7a and b overall root zone pressure levels varied independently of the rate of drawdown and this varied due to heterogeneity of soil types 5 discussion 5 1 root zone under vulnerability conditions the results of analyses of dynamic wilting fig 3 based on numerical experiment suggest that the wilting process is not a straightforward phenomenon rather it requires interpretation across time to integrate with the vulnerability assessment framework the wilting process continues until the root wilting depth δ w δ w in the case of the wetting front reaches at least 50 of entire root depth in general δ w depends on zb and soil texture therefore a deep water table may not lead plants to wilt in fine texture soils which have a large capacity to store plant available water conversely δ w may occupy the entire effective root depth under conditions of a shallow water table for coarse texture soils regarding a single zb 5 m dynamic root zone analysis proves that rainfall occurs the wilting process does not initiate directly from the soil surface but at a depth of 30 cm for both textures and δ w extends down to the root zone until pressure equilibrium is satisfied the water pressure in the upper part of the root zone never decreased to the wilting point because of the wetting front that existed within the upper part of the soil profile finally independent of soil texture a sufficient amount of rainfall induced infiltration can secure the water content of the upper part of the root zone and this may neutralize the effect of groundwater drawdown in the dynamic wilting analysis wilting time differs depending on soil texture as expected wilting on a clay loam profile was substantially slower than on a sandy loam soil however in reality infiltration rates vary independently of ks depending on rainfall intensity based on the imposed bcs transpiration rate of the clay loam table 1 was relatively insignificant and this may not indicate vulnerability as seen from the impacts of atmospheric bcs variable rates of pet and p may change the wilting behavior as having ks values lower than clay loam and clay in the long term plant roots and root distribution changes as well as the other vegetative parameters chaves et al 2003 taylor and klepper 1979 however we have not included root growth dynamics in the topsoil model therefore the clay loam soil profile is least likely to reach the state depicted in fig 3 5 2 impact on vulnerable case shallow groundwater table soil we checked the assumption by li et al 2018 which suggested that the highest drawdown that arose was approximately 15 m and that this occurred after the initiation of tunnel drainage fig 4 to examine the impact probability to test the assumption from vulnerability perspective a layered soil profile with a shallow water table located on a low land area was specified and compared with their equivalent homogeneous soil our findings suggest that topsoil water pressure behaves independently of groundwater drawdown an indication of wilting was not present for the initial 10 days furthermore the rate of drawdown did not affect topsoil pressure for daily time scale in general topsoil water pressure was reduced throughout the duration of the 300 day simulation however the vulnerability criteria were not being met for a long time which is an indication that the plant available moisture content for mingtang soil was independent of groundwater drawdown during the early phase the response of the root zone differs according to the heterogeneity of the soil profile thus the response depended on the order of the layers the layered soil profile was composed in such a way that the higher ks clay layer was located above the lower ks silty clay layer and thus the upper layer maintained the supply of plant available water and increased the resistance of pine trees to early wilting the perched water condition kelln et al 2009 created a delay in the drying process induced by groundwater table drawdown fig 7a where the silty clay layer inhibited any decrease in the saturated water level consequently the topsoil water pressure behaved differently according to the varying texture of the soil yeh 1989 the homogeneous soil profile in the case study demonstrated the development of the wilting condition in different way fig 7b where wilting conditions were met with a delay the difference of the wilting dynamics proved that the wilting process is dependent more on soil heterogeneity than bcs therefore soil heterogeneity is a factor that should be carefully addressed which effects the vulnerability assessment results 5 3 preliminary framework for impact control the environmental impact from tunneling perspective is mostly considered as acute effects during construction periods such as pollution or land hazards e g ground settlement however we claim that long term discharge from the tunnel is critical for regional water budget which is directly affected by atmospheric changes and fluctuations of groundwater any discharge level cannot be compensated by the water resources of a local environment for a certain duration of time e g a year or more leads incremental adverse effects on the environment thus may exceed the impact of acute effects therefore the region would be classified as vulnerable the main purpose of the assessment framework is to give preliminary insight for decision makers about the vulnerability of a region against tunnel discharge we designed a simple method that provides sufficient information with the help of numerical models outcomes of dynamic root zone wilting analysis proved that the assessment is successful in linking discharge impact and physical modeling in this study we have conducted vulnerability analysis on a hypothetical case study based on real study site for a short period up to 300 days however we did not include atmospheric changes and focused on dynamic wilting concept it is imperative to extend the analysis to decadal time scales to have a better evaluation of the environmental impact by changes to local weather conditions extension of the vulnerability analysis of the proposed framework may provide the impact of long term atmospheric alterations on vulnerability the framework has the potential to apply regionally to classify locations that are vulnerable to tunnel discharge the precision of assessment can be increased by having more detailed soil profiles and vegetation data 6 summary and conclusion this study introduces a vulnerability assessment framework by coupling topsoil water model with deep tunnel discharge soil water pressure was introduced as a new performance metric for the vulnerability analysis in the unsaturated zone above groundwater table accordingly vulnerability criteria were defined by combining plant wilting and water pressure distribution dynamic root zone wilting process was performed to parameterize vulnerability via transient unsaturated flow simulation theoretical case study was presented to demonstrate the application of vulnerability analysis for layered soil and vegetation cover analysis results for the study site showed that drawdown larger than the root zone depth alone did not satisfy vulnerability criteria transient groundwater table drawdown on topsoil did not manifest vulnerable conditions before the 220th day of the simulation case study results demonstrated that the development of wilting in such occasions depended on the boundary conditions and the formation of the soil types with deep water levels being independent of the rate of tunnel discharge the equivalent homogeneous pressure profile results showed different vulnerability status than observed in the layered soil simulation with a delay of wilting time the study presents deeper insight into potential environmental impacts induced by deep tunnel drainage our future study will focus on the improvement of the vulnerability assessment by integrating atmospheric forcing and the climatic factors into the framework acknowledgments the research was conducted with support from the

the fundamental research funds for central universities appendix a this appendix explains the design and assumptions of the basic transient topsoil model and root water uptake a 1 transient topsoil model the basic model setting was initiated as a transient solution of unsaturated flow for a homogeneous soil profile fig a1 the model was designed to represent the soil plant atmosphere continuum coupled with a tunnel discharge induced groundwater table drawdown root zone wilting could be assessed by analyzing transient root zone pressure profiles in which the transition of water pressure into hw was observed more theoretical cases could be introduced by increasing model complexity over the basic model in the basic model the water balance of the critical zone namely the zone between saturated water level and terrain surface or vadose zone is described by a1 q 0 p i e t p ε c ε s τ where in the absence of surface runoff q 0 is the initial soil water flux p is daily precipitation et and i stand for potential evapotranspiration and relative canopy interception respectively as the parameters to characterize partitioning ε c and ε s represent canopy and soil evaporation respectively it was assumed that all canopy interception is equivalent to ε c meaning all intercepted rainfall evaporates from the vegetation canopy τ is transpiration rate of the associated vegetative cover which is modeled as a function of rooting depth soil water pressure distributions were simulated with hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 the vadose zone was physically modeled by using the richards equation to simulate unsaturated flow as a2 θ z t z k h d h d z 1 s z where z denotes vertical coordinate θ z represents water content h is the soil water pressure and k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity s z is the root water uptake term integrated with the method proposed by feddes 1978 summarized as a3 s z μ h s p z where sp z is potential root water uptake rate l3l 3 t 1 and μ h is a dimensionless stepwise water pressure response function šimunek et al 1992 summarized below a4 μ h 0 h h w h h w h h w h w h h 1 h h where hw is the wilting point pressure and h represents the point of stomatal closure the function regulates root water uptake as plants cease to extract water below hw μ h 0 above hw root water uptake increases linearly up to h as the soil gets wetter conditions at which water pressure exceeds h represent the maximum rate of uptake unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k h was modeled using the mualem van genuchten soil hydraulic model with an air entry bubbling pressure of 2 cm van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 a5 k h k s s e 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 h 0 s e θ h θ r θ s j θ r where ks is saturated hydraulic conductivity se is effective saturation m is an empirical parameter θ s j and θ r are saturated and residual water contents respectively θ h is volumetric moisture content as a function of water pressure the soil water characteristic release curve θ h is given by a6 θ h θ r θ s j θ r 1 α j h n j m h 0 θ s h 0 where α j nj and m 1 1 nj are empirical parameters for each specified soil texture the subscript j is by either w or d corresponding to wetting or drying cycles respectively a 2 design of root water uptake rooting systems were designed using the santos model see below where the vegetation assumed to be fully grown and root has not been truncated by any solid obstacle water uptake along the rooting depth δwas controlled by root density distribution function which is modeled as follows santos et al 2017 a7 r δ r b 2 r a v g b ex

shape factor parameter the potential root water uptake rate sp z is normalized as a8 s p z r δ r 0 1 r δ r d δ r τ root density distribution was assigned assuming that roughly 70 of the plant s water supply is provided by the upper 50 of the total rooting depth which we have called the effective rooting depth δ e bennett and doss 1960 root water uptake ceases irreversibly once water pressure within δ e completely reduces to the wilting pressure hw water uptake is arranged in such a way that the plants would immediately start to extract water at a maximum rate when soil water pressure h is less than 1 h max 1 and remains at this maximum rate until h reduces to stomatal pressure h and then diminishes linearly to zero at hw the root water uptake function is shown in fig a1 actual water uptake behaves as a function of pressure distribution as shown in eq a4 and represented by μ h appendix b figs a1 and b1
