5465,watershed management practices aim at improving the agricultural productivity in rainfed agricultural areas by conserving rainwater for an extended period the stored rainwater in the harvesting structures is used for meeting crop water demand the water use efficiencies of these structures can be further enhanced through adoption of deficit irrigation management strategies in this study deficit irrigation scheduling is formulated using a simulation optimization framework for a rainfed agricultural area with supplemental irrigation from a check dam in kondepi iwmp area near kondepi mandal prakasam district andhra pradesh india the results from the study indicate that the adoption of irrigation management strategies have the potential to improve the productivity and bring more area under irrigation with an increase of 20 and 140 for yield and irrigated area respectively the outcomes of this study indicate that the proposed method can be suggested for developing optimum irrigation strategies under water deficit in rainfed agriculture having water harvesting structures for an efficient utilization of stored rainwater keywords watershed management rainfed agriculture deficit irrigation check dams agricultural water management water harvesting structures 1 introduction the conflicts between increased demands for food production and declining water availability are the major barrier for sustainable agriculture across the world fao 2013 vörösmarty et al 2000 the problem of water scarcity or limited availability of water is expected to intensify in the future with the projected increase in the world population and the projected changes in the climate i e increase in temperatures along with erratic precipitation patterns jiang et al 2007 malek et al 2018 parry et al 2007 sishodia et al 2018 the worst affected regions due to these changes are expected to be the rainfed agricultural areas from the arid and semi arid regions jin et al 2018 which generally suffer from low productivity and other agro ecological problems azimi et al 2013 wani et al 2009 in this context the productivity from the rainfed regions which contribute to around 60 of the world s food production needs to be enhanced to meet the future food security the extent of rainfed agriculture varies regionally from 60 in south asia to more than 95 of the farmed lands in sub saharan africa devendra and revolution 2016 kerr et al 1996 suresh et al 2014 wani et al 2009 in the indian context nearly fifty one percent of the cultivable land is under rainfed agriculture ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare 2019 which primarily depends on the monsoon rainfall june october the agricultural productivity of the rainfed regions in india is strongly influenced by the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall while some of these areas have ground water reserve the intensive agricultural operations adopted during the green revolution of 1970 1980 have already resulted in declined water tables nicholas et al 2016 in addition the abnormal variability both in space and time in rainfall and temperature associated with changing climate has been a major constraint to crop yield improvements competitiveness and commercialization of rainfed crop tree crops and livestock systems in most of the tropical regions wani et al 2009 numerous evidences have been emerged for decreased agricultural production potential in rainfed agricultural regions across the world with varying rainfall pattern and volume due to changing climate rao 2000 therefore increased food demands inadequate availability of water coupled with uncertain rainfall both in amount and duration steers for sustainable water management strategies in rainfed regions to enhance the agricultural productivity and to meet the future food security surendran et al 2016 winter et al 2017 watershed management practices are adopted in rainfed regions of the world including india to alleviate the agro ecological problems and to improve the productivity in these regions dile et al 2016 kroeger et al 2019 reddy et al 2017 singh et al 2014 vema et al 2018 these practices aim at improving the water availability mainly through construction of various water conservation structures in watersheds syme and reddy 2015 wisser et al 2010 water harvesting structures such as check dams farm ponds percolation tanks etc serve as mechanism to capture the rainwater and surface runoff to act as surface storage and recharge groundwater the stored up water in these structures is utilized for meeting the crop water demands during the soil moisture stress periods while the current watershed management practices are effective in improving the water availability komariah and senge 2013 mishra et al 2013 groundwater recharge dillon 2005 nagaraj et al 2008 samuel and mathew 1997 and agricultural productivity garg et al 2012 kadam et al 2012 their efficiency could be further improved by introducing enhanced irrigation management strategies currently the traditional irrigation methods are adopted to irrigate small area around the conservation structure at the discretion of the stakeholder however traditional irrigation methods consume high amount of water adoption of improved irrigation management strategies would plausibly help increase the extent of the irrigated area which in turn may increase the productivity of the watershed porhemmat et al 2018 surendran et al 2016 among the various irrigation management strategies deficit irrigation management has been proved highly effective to improve the productivity and water use efficiency in water scarce regions bell et al 2018 prasad et al 2006 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 the fundamental principle behind deficit irrigation management is that the water stress during the non critical periods of cropping cycle does not significantly affect the crop yield boggess and ritchie 1988 hence deficit irrigation management strategies focus on minimizing the evaporative losses from the bare soil and providing irrigation only during the critical crop growth period the periods in the cropping cycle where water stress have significant effect on crop productivity are defined as critical cropping periods thus the deficit irrigation strategy aims at minimizing the reduction in crop yield during limited availability of the water against full irrigation although several studies on deficit irrigation management strategies for irrigated agriculture are available azimi et al 2013 bell et al 2018 guo et al 2014 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 its application scope and performance in rainfed agriculture regions with supplemental irrigation from water harvesting structures are poorly evaluated deficit irrigation scheduling is highly complex in nature and is influenced by various factors such as soil moisture soil physical characteristics crop parameters weather parameters throughout the growing season etc and their interactions further the effectiveness of the deficit irrigation scheduling mainly depends on proper identification of critical periods during the crop growth cycle geerts et al 2010 the complexity of its application for rainfed agriculture under watershed management is further augmented by the temporal variability of stored up water in the water harvesting structures since the water harvesting structures for watershed management are usually small in size and store only limited volume of water the accumulated water is either utilized by the stakeholders or lost through evaporation and seepage to groundwater thus the timing of irrigation also becomes a crucial factor as the available water for irrigation reduces if the irrigation is delayed while water is lost through soil evaporation and the extent of irrigated area is reduced in the case of premature irrigation therefore improvement in the agricultural productivity of the rainfed areas mandates studies to develop optimized deficit irrigation schedules for such regions in this study a simulation optimization framework is formulated to develop and implement an improved deficit irrigation strategy for rainfed regions that have water harvesting structures the water availability in the water harvesting structure is simulated using a hydrological model while the crop response to irrigation is simulated by means of a crop growth simulation model the irrigation schedules are generated using an optimizer with the aim of maximizing the agricultural productivity the effectiveness of the formulated framework is demonstrated on kondepi iwmp area which is part of a rainfed watershed in india with check dams as water harvesting structures 2 methodology 2 1 simulation optimization framework in general two determinant factors influence the development of the deficit irrigation schedules for crops growing in rainfed regions with supplementary irrigation from water harvesting structures water availability for irrigation and critical periods of crop growth as mentioned earlier the water availability in the water harvesting structure is simulated using a hydrological model and the crops response to the applied irrigation is evaluated using a crop growth simulation model the optimizer in the simulation optimization framework identifies the irrigation schedules to maximize the agricultural productivity the limited storage of the water harvesting structures restricts irrigation to small fields surrounding the structure in practice the irrigation from these structures is provided to the crops as and when the top soil dries up and is a subjective decision of the farmer hence it is envisaged that the adoption of the formulated deficit irrigation schedules using the simulation optimization framework would increase the irrigated area per structure and consequently improve the crop yield the adopted simulation optimization framework is presented in fig 1 the framework consists of three parts a hydrological model simulation which simulates daily inflow to the check dam the source for irrigation is the water stored up in the check dam b optimizer which determines irrigation schedule and the irrigated area and c crop growth simulation model which simulates crop production for different irrigation schedules the details of the simulation models and problem formulation for optimization are discussed in the following sub sections 2 1 1 hydrological model the hydrological model in this study is employed to evaluate the water inflows to the water harvesting structures and water availability for the irrigation on any given day one of the requirements of the hydrologic model is it should be capable of simulating the hydrologic processes in administrative catchments or area of interest i e catchments unbound by ridge lines since watershed management practices are usually practiced in such areas while any hydrological model that can simulate such areas can be adopted for this study a distributed hydrological model developed by vema et al 2017 that was specifically developed for such areas was used to simulate the inflows to the check dams in this study the hydrologic model has been applied for optimal sizing of the check dams in the considered study catchment in the earlier study by vema et al 2018 note that the choice of the hydrological model would not alter the proposed framework for generating the irrigation schedules and any hydrological model can be adopted in the proposed framework the model uses a grid based spatial discretization scheme and adopts a simple water balance approach eq 1 1 s t s o i 1 t p i q i e i p e r c i g w i where so is the initial soil water content at the start of the day i and st is the final soil water content t is time in days pi is precipitation on day i qi is surface runoff on day i ei is evapotranspiration on day i perci is percolation on day i and gwi is ground water return flow on day i the model simulates at daily time step and the variables are expressed in mm the model simulates all the water balance components such as surface runoff evaporation ground water flow percolation etc at each grid cell the simulated flow in the upstream cells is routed through the grid cells to the watershed outlet the water balance components in the model are simulated using widely tested and accepted methods and algorithms the model is capable to simulate the water harvesting structures and routes the flow in these structures using the variable storage routing method the detailed description of the model is available in vema et al 2017 2 1 2 crop growth simulation model the crops response to the applied irrigation is simulated using aquacrop model hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 developed by fao in 2009 the aquacrop model is simple and robust and the user friendly interface enables the user to analyze different crop production response under different set of environmental conditions to develop effective strategies for deficit irrigation geerts et al 2010 the model has relatively less parameters compared to other crop growth simulation models the inputs to the model include crop physiology soil properties weather data management practices irrigation scheduling and initial conditions for simulating the crop yield and biomass the crop yield in the model is simulated by partitioning the daily evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration the estimated daily transpiration is used to compute the biomass by considering biomass as a factor of net transpiration from the calculated biomass the dry yield is estimated using a parameter called harvest index hio the assumptions made in this study were that sufficient nutrient supply was available to the crop and weed management and pest control practices were adequate so that the controls exerted on the crop yield other than irrigation water availability were eliminated 2 1 3 optimization algorithm as mentioned earlier the deficit irrigation scheduling is a complex non linear optimization problem the irrigation schedule should maximize the area under irrigation and agricultural productivity simultaneously the other important factors to be considered are the water use efficiency and the evaporation losses from the storage to achieve this a multi algorithm genetically adaptive method amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 was used as the optimization algorithm in this study the amalgam utilizes four optimization algorithms namely non dominated sorted genetic algorithm ii particle swarm optimization adaptive metropolis search and differential evolution to arrive at the optimal solution it is expected that the interaction between different optimization algorithms leads to arrive at better results with less function evaluations the detailed description on the amalgam can be found in vrugt and robinson 2007 2 1 4 formulation of optimization problem formulation of the optimization problem for identifying the deficit irrigation schedules involves identification and selection of decision variables and development of objective functions and constraints the main objective is to improve the total crop yield of the rainfed region the crop yield is simulated as a function of the irrigation water applied in the field using the aquacrop model the crop yield as a function of the irrigation input can be written as eq 2 2 y f i 1 t iw i where y is the simulated dry yield in ton ha by aquacrop iw i is depth of applied irrigation water in mm ha to the crop on ith day after sowing das and t is the total number of days in the crop cycle the decision variables in this study are the amount and timing of irrigation along with the area to be irrigated since the irrigated area is a decision variable the objective function is formulated as maximizing the summation of the total dry yield from both the irrigated and rainfed areas non irrigated of the maximum command area of the water harvesting structure eq 3 the total area that can be irrigated from the structure i e command area of the water harvesting structure is fixed and is one of the constraints of the optimization problem eq 8 the other constraints of the optimization problem include no irrigation on a rainy day eq 9 upper limit of the irrigation allocation would be the available water in the check dam eq 6 and daily water storage should not exceed the maximum storage volume of the check dam eq 5 the mathematical formulation of the objective function and the constraints are given in eqs 3 9 3 o f 1 m a x i m i z e y i a i y r a r subjected to 4 s i 1 s i q i e i k sat w s a 1000 i i 5 0 s i c 6 0 i i s i 7 i i iw i a i 10 η 8 a i a r a 9 i i 0 p i 5 f o r i 1 2 t where of1 is the first objective function y i is the dry yield in ton ha from irrigated crop y r is the dry yield in ton ha from rainfed crop a i is the irrigated area in ha of the total command area a of the check dam a r is the rainfed cropping area in ha s i is the water storage in m3 in the check dam at ith das q i is the inflow in m3 to the check dam at ith das e i is the evaporation rate in mm day at ith das k sat is the saturation hydraulic conductivity in mm day wsa is the water surface area in m2 of storage volume in the check dam at ith day i i is the net irrigation volume in m3 supplied by the check dam at ith day c is the maximum capacity of the check dam in m3 η is the overall irrigation efficiency p i is the rainfall depth in mm at ith day and t is the total number of days in crop cycle in this study an irrigation of depth less than 5 mm is not considered significant and consequently any day with a rainfall less than 5 mm is assumed to be a non rainy day an overall irrigation efficiency of 80 was assumed to account for losses during irrigation although the of1 aims at maximizing the productivity from the command area of the water harvesting structure but does not consider the critical periods of crop growth since water stress at other than critical crop growth period during a crop cycle doesn t reduce crop yield significantly irrigating only during the critical period can also be considered as a constraint for better utilization of irrigation water therefore an additional constraint of irrigating during the critical cropping period only eq 10 is added to the above mentioned formulation the variable c in eq 10 is a set containing the days in terms of das which are not part of critical crop growing period the irrigation schedules are developed for both the conditions i e irrigation without considering the critical period case a and irrigation only during the critical period case b 10 i i 0 i c f o r i 1 2 t while the above mentioned formulations are exhaustive in nature and net irrigation application might reduce as compared to a full irrigation the optimal irrigation schedule might result in a greater number of irrigation events in this purview it is possible to have minor irrigation applications on all the possible days which may be infeasible in practice the number of irrigations applied to crop is limited due to various reasons therefore to account for this limitation another objective of minimizing the number of irrigation events was added to the above two formulations the second objective was formulated as eq 11 11 o f 2 m i n i m i z e i 1 t n i i i 0 where of2 is the second objective function and n i is a binary variable and takes a value of 1 if irrigation is applied on ith day otherwise is equal to 0 all the constraints of these optimization problems remain same as earlier for each case the second objective function contradicts to the first objective function as with reduced number of irrigation events the application of water may also get reduced consequently reducing the crop yield if the reduction in yield is not significant for reduced irrigation events the cost of irrigation would be less which would be advantageous to the farmer however if the yield gets reduced significantly the arrived solution maybe no better than the rainfed agriculture similar to the case of the single objective optimization problem two cases of multi objective optimization problems were also formulated without considering any critical crop growth period case c and by restricting the irrigation during the critical cropping period only case d the four cases considered for developing optimum irrigation schedules are presented in table 1 2 2 study area and data the formulated simulation optimization cases to develop irrigation schedules were demonstrated in kondepi iwmp area near kondepi mandal prakasam district andhra pradesh india the study area is located in between latitude 15 23 north and 15 25 north and longitude 79 48 east and 79 53 east and falls under subtropical climate region a detailed description of the study area is presented in vema et al 2018 the cropping practices in kondepi watershed are dominantly rainfed and the agricultural sector is facing severe agro ecological issues such as low productivity soil erosion water scarcity etc the government of india is implementing the integrated watershed management program iwmp in the watershed to improve the water availability and arrest the ecological deterioration of the region under the iwmp program several water conservation structures such as check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks are constructed within the watershed it may be noted that kondepi watershed is not a traditional watershed bounded by ridge lines instead it s a term used to refer the area around kondepi village in which the iwmp program is implemented and thus is referred to as kondepi iwmp area in the subsequent sections the total geographical area of the kondepi iwmp area is 4150 ha where 1100 ha is utilized for agriculture while majority of the farmers in the study area practice rainfed farming some are using drip irrigation method by utilizing the limited groundwater available to them some of the cultivated crops in the catchment are groundnut arachis hypogeae rice oryza sativa red gram cajanus cajan tobacco nicotiana tabcum and bengal gram cicer arietinum among these crops groundnut is the major crop within the watershed the cropping cycle depends on the arrival of north east monsoon and generally july december is considered as cropping period the kondepi iwmp area is further sub divided into 8 micro watersheds based on the administrative boundaries of the encompassing villages of the watershed the proposed methodology to arrive at the deficit irrigation scheduling is demonstrated using one of the check dams in one of the micro watersheds the selected micro watershed has 7 check dams in place and the command area of each check dam was 55 ha arrived at by dividing the entire area of the micro watershed by 7 the proposed framework is tested for the growing season in two years 2000 and 2002 the grid based hydrological model was setup for the watershed to simulate the inflows to the selected check dam for the period of 1st june 2000 to 31st january 2003 the check dam has maximum storage capacity of 1809 41 m3 and an initial storage of 0 14 m3 at the start of the simulation period the weather parameters precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed used in this model were collected from imd dataset pai et al 2015 the srtm dem of 30 m resolutions was used for topographic representation of the watershed while the land use land cover and soil data were obtained from the department of rural development government of andhra pradesh 2 3 aquacrop model setup since groundnut is the predominant crop in the watershed and within the command area of the selected check dam the aquacrop model was set up for the groundnut crop the crop sowing date was fixed based on the local farming practice within the watershed the sowing date for the year 2000 was 1st july 2000 and harvested on 19th october 2000 and the sowing date for the year 2002 was 29th august 2002 and harvested on 17th december 2002 a total rainfall during the cropping period of 2000 and 2002 was 680 mm and 410 mm respectively as some farmers who have groundwater resources are using drip irrigation method it is assumed that the remaining farmers would utilize drip irrigation for irrigating by drawing water from the water harvesting structure consequently during the model setup it was assumed that the drip irrigation technique was employed for irrigating the crop using the water stored in the check dam and water content in the soil was at field capacity on the date of sowing 2 3 1 parameterization of aquacrop model for accurate representation of crop growth simulation the aquacrop model needs to be parameterized the data for calibration of the aquacrop model was not available from the farms of the kondepi watershed therefore experimental data for groundnut crop was collected from an experimental field with similar climatic setting located outside the watershed the data of field experimental study in experimental fields of a 8 block of zonal agricultural research station gandhi krishi vignana kendra university of agricultural sciences bengaluru karnataka india was available for two seasons july to october of 2016 and 2017 biswal 2017 sandeep 2018 the experimental site lies on 13 05 north 77 34 east and elevation of 924 m from mean sea level in karnataka annual normal rainfall at the experimental site is 917 mm the soil type is red sandy clay loam with 70 and 23 sand and clay content respectively the crops were irrigated during the early stage of the crop cycle and at the flowering stage the first step in the model calibration is identifying the sensitive parameters of the model hence a global sensitivity analysis using the sobol method lilburne and tarantola 2009 was performed to identify the sensitive parameters generally model calibration requires substantially large number of observed data to train the model and tune up the parameters accordingly but in this study the available experimental data were only for two years which was not enough to calibrate the crop parameters by auto calibration methods therefore a manual calibration approach using the trial and error method was adopted to estimate the sensitive parameters the parameters with the lowest error in the output were considered as the optimal set of parameters and were used for the crop growth simulations the experimental data for the groundnut crop used for manual calibration of crop parameters is presented in the table 2 2 3 2 identification of critical crop growth period in general the response of crops to water stress varies for a specific magnitude and duration of water stress throughout the cropping cycle the water stress during some specific stages of cropping period reduce the crop yield significantly while during the other periods the effect is inconsequential deficit irrigation management deals with partial application of irrigation to crop during critical periods of crop growth hence the effectiveness of the deficit irrigation management depends on identification of critical periods within the cropping cycle that are most sensitive to water stress in this study the critical crop growth periods for the groundnut crop were identified using the parameterized aquacrop model with the assumption of no rainfall during the crop growth period and controlled irrigation was provided to avoid any external uncontrolled water application the soil moisture at the starting of the cropping period was assumed to be at field capacity in reality the crop may experience a single period of water stress or multiple periods of water stress during the cropping cycle thus to identify all the critical cropping periods two different analysis a single period stress analysis and b multiple period stress analysis were carried out 2 3 2 1 single period stress analysis the single period stress analysis assumes the occurrence of one single continuous period of water stress duration of n days during the cropping cycle the crop is irrigated with a depth of 5 mm for all days from sowing to maturity except for the days where crop experiences the water stress a moving window of n days is progressed from sowing till maturity during which the crop does not receive any supplemental irrigation and the corresponding yield is noted the yield thus obtained was compared with the yield from the baseline scenario which corresponds to the crop yield without experiencing crop yield i e irrigation on all days from sowing to maturity the reduction in the yield of the simulations with water stress periods as compared to baseline scenario provides information to identify the critical periods of the crop growth 2 3 2 2 multiple period stress analysis although the single period stress analysis is useful in identifying the critical crop periods it assumes that the crop experiences only a single spell of water stress during the cropping cycle and is an independent variable which may or may not be true the crop may experience water stress for multiple periods during the cropping period hence to identify the multiple critical periods and the impact of their interactions on the crop productivity a multiple period stress analysis is carried out in multiple period stress analysis two periods of water stress were considered such that they do not overlap with each other the aquacrop model set up and irrigation method remained the same as that used in single period stress analysis the aquacrop model was simulated for all the possible combinations of water stress periods during the crop growth period the reduction in the yield compared to that of the baseline yield indicates the critical crop growth periods the critical crop growth period depends on the climatic setting of the cropping area thus the window size n days in the analysis was estimated based on long term dry spell length of the kondepi watershed the average continuous non rainy days during the cropping period in the kondepi watershed was selected as the period of water stress for the critical crop period analysis 3 results 3 1 manual calibration of aquacrop model crop parameters the aquacrop model was calibrated for the groundnut crop using the data from the experimental site the aquacrop model has 12 crop parameters that affect the crop growth and yield and the range and description of the parameters are tabulated in table 3 the sensitivity of all the 12 parameters were tested using the sobol sensitivity analysis and the sensitivity index of the parameters is shown in fig 2 the results indicate that reference harvest index hio is the most sensitive parameter followed by the biomass water productivity wp the harvest index parameter controls the yield obtained from the biomass produced as the total yield from the crop is the product of the biomass produced and the harvest index at physiological maturity of a crop species the harvest index for non stress condition is termed as reference harvest index biomass water productivity wp is normalized for different climatic conditions and represents a linear relationship between total above ground biomass produced and total amount of water transpired from leaf stomata it is observed that the crop coefficient at maximum canopy cover kctr x was also sensitive however kctr x is a conservative parameter within the aquacrop model and hence any changes is restricted food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2018 the manual calibration of the aquacrop model in this study considered hio and wp only and default values were considered for less sensitive parameters the two sensitive parameters wp and hio were calibrated using the trial and error approach different combinations of the parameters were tested and the parameter values showing minimum deviation from the observed yield were considered as calibrated values as mentioned earlier only two years of data was available for model calibration during which dry yields of 1 85 ton ha and 2 21 ton ha were obtained for years 2016 and 2017 respectively the difference between the observed and simulated dry yields for different values of sensitive parameters wp and hio tested for trial and error are shown in fig 3 the minimum deviation for wp and hio has been observed at 10 g m2 and 30 respectively the calibrated model simulated dry yields of 1 85 ton ha and 2 22 ton ha for years 2016 and 2017 respectively the crop parameters used for simulating the groundnut crop are shown in table 3 3 2 critical crop growth periods historical precipitation data of 43 years 1970 2012 for the kondepi watershed was analyzed to identify the number of continuous non rainy days experienced during the cropping period of july to december the result of the analysis show that the average length of dry spell the crops of the watershed experience was approximately 9 days table 4 the maximum length of continuous non rainy days was found to be up to 28 days during the period of analysis however in most years the number of continuous non rainy days was mostly between 8 and 12 days hence in this study the duration of water stress period for identification of critical crop growth period analysis was considered as 10 days 3 2 1 single period stress analysis the single period stress analysis was performed by considering 10 days of continuous water stress period for the crop it may be noted that no irrigation was provided to the crop during the 10 days considered for identifying the critical crop periods the moving window of 10 days progresses from sowing till maturity and the deviation in the yield was noted yield reduction in the range of 0 1 0 3 ton ha was observed when irrigation was not provided to crop from 41 days after sowing das till maturity fig 4 a similar analysis was performed for different lengths of water stress period such as 13 17 and 20 days to identify the effect of the considered duration for water stress on the critical period identification however the results of the analysis fig 4 indicate that variation in the yield is similar in all the cases of water stress period with a maximum yield reduction observed for water stress during 41 60 das for 10 and 13 days stress period a slight increase in yield was observed when irrigation was not provided at the beginning of crop cycle though the critical periods of crop growth were similar for all the four non irrigation periods the reduction in the yield increased from 9 to 40 with respect to an increase in the continuous non irrigation days from 10 to 20 days 3 2 2 multiple period stress analysis the multiple stress period analysis was carried out by considering two separate period of water stress periods in this analysis 10 days of no irrigation were considered for both the water stress periods the results of the analysis evidently suggest a yield reduction of 0 9 ton ha during the continuous water stress at the beginning of the crop cycle fig 5 for discrete periods of water stress after 10 das until around 30 das caused a slight increase of 0 1 ton ha in the yield compared to no stress condition however continuous stress during this period 10 30 das resulted in a mild yield reduction plausibly due to unavailability of sufficient moisture for seed germination for any water stress after 41 das until 95 das a significant reduction in the crop yield was noted similar to the case of single period stress analysis the results of the single and multiple period stress analysis evidently indicated that the critical periods of crop growth are during the germination period 1 5 das and flowering and pod development period 41 95 das of groundnut crop since the crop requires adequate water for the seed to germinate water stress during this period leads to late germination and thereby reduction in crop yield the flowering of groundnut crop starts at approximately 40 45 das and continues for another 25 days the flowering of groundnut is followed by the pod development which is 30 days long the crop requires water during this reproductive stage and any stress during this period 41 95 das significantly affects the crop yield as it is evident from the both the analysis the identified critical periods in both single and multiple period analysis agreed with the field observation studies reported in rao et al 1985 however the water stress prior to the flowering stage enhances the productivity of the crop which maybe the result of the inhibition in vegetative growth resulting in less transpiration due to water stress this observation is supported by the results of various researchers where they concluded that the reduction in the transpiration and vegetative growth results in better water utilization by the crop for the yield development harris and hawkins 1942 loka and oosterhuis 2012 rao et al 1985 hence it is inferred from the results of the analysis that the duration and timing of water stress period has a significant impact on the crop yield variation 3 3 optimal deficit irrigation schedule the deficit irrigation schedules were developed using four different cases with and without considering the critical periods of crop cycle for both single and multi objective optimization formulations the timing and depth of irrigation along with total area under irrigation were optimized for the objective of maximizing the crop yield in the single objective optimization while an additional objective of minimizing the irrigation events was added in the multi objective optimization 3 3 1 single objective optimization 3 3 1 1 case a in this case single objective optimization was performed without considering the critical periods of crop growth the optimization resulted in 20 and 16 irrigation events fig 6 a c respectively for the year 2000 and 2002 covering an area of 21 73 ha table 5 and 13 67 ha table 6 respectively out of total 55 ha as expected the dry yield from the irrigated area was remarkably higher with 1 59 ton ha and 1 13 ton ha of yield while the rainfed area produced only 0 81 ton ha and 0 71 ton ha for the years 2000 and 2002 respectively the total simulated yield for the irrigated condition from the command area was 61 57 tons for year 2000 and 44 78 tons for year 2002 majority of the irrigation events for both the years were distributed from 45 to 95 das which was identified as critical periods of crop growth while the critical period analysis indicated that the period from 41 to 95 das was critical for crop productivity however some of the days of the critical periods received sufficient rainfall resulting in no irrigation events on those days in addition to the irrigation events in the critical cropping period irrigation events were also observed during germination before flowering and pod filling stages the total amount of irrigation in this case was 23 580 m3 for year 2000 and 14 968 m3 for year 2002 3 3 1 2 case b in this case single objective optimization was performed by constraining irrigation events only during the critical periods of cropping cycle i e 1 5 das and 41 95 das the optimized irrigation schedule has 14 irrigation events fig 6 b d for both the years 2000 and 2002 in this case the area under irrigation for both years 2000 and 2002 was slightly higher as compared to area under irrigation in case a 23 51 ha and 15 06 ha for year 2000 and 2002 respectively however the irrigated yield was observed to be marginally less in both years as compared to case a with 1 42 ton ha in year 2000 and 1 07 ton ha in year 2002 the reduction in the yield in both the years is plausibly the result of missing irrigation event during the germination period combined with total reduced irrigation volume in both years see tables 5 and 6 the substantial reduction in the total irrigation is evident in the total yield 59 tons from the total command area of the check dam in the year 2000 the pattern of irrigation events during the critical crop growing periods was similar to that of case a most of the irrigation events were clustered in the period from 55 to 85 das in the year 2000 and from 75 to 90 das in the year 2002 there were only few irrigation events between 40 and 60 das in both years owing to the rainfall received during the period 3 3 2 multi objective optimization 3 3 2 1 case c in this case the optimization is similar to that of case a with an additional objective of minimizing the number of irrigation events as mentioned earlier the two objectives considered are conflicting objectives thus resulting in the pareto optimal solutions fig 7 the pareto optimal front obtained for case c for both year 2000 and 2002 are shown in fig 7 a and c respectively the x axis of the pareto optimal front is the total number of irrigation events and the y axis is the total yield from the command area of the water harvesting structure the selection of the solution from the pareto optimal front is a subjective decision and any solution from the pareto optimal front can be adopted based on the priorities the pareto optimal front presents a trade off between the number of irrigation events and the total yield obtained it is evident from the fig 7 that as number of irrigation events increase thus increasing the irrigated volume the total yield increases a point with low number of irrigation events would result in reduced application of the irrigation water and consequently result in reduced overall yield however a solution with a greater number of irrigation events increases the total irrigation volume and total yield at the same time increasing the cost of irrigation per ton of produce for instance a solution with 6 irrigation events for case c optimization of year 2000 resulted in an irrigation volume of 7000 m3 and a total dry yield of 53 ton for the same case a solution corresponding to 17 irrigation events results in net irrigation volume of 21 000 m3 for a total yield of 61 37 tons thus a three fold increase in irrigation application only increased the yield by 9 tons since the focus of this study was to maximize the total yield from the command area of check dam and also the maximum irrigation events for this optimization 17 and 13 respectively for the years 2000 and 2002 are either less or comparable to the number of irrigation events obtained for case a and case b the solutions corresponding to maximum total yield were chosen for further analysis the total simulated yield from the command area of the check dam was 61 37 tons in the year 2000 and 44 69 tons for the year 2002 of the selected solutions the irrigation timing and amount for the selected solutions is shown in fig 8 a and c a dry yield of 1 59 ton ha and 1 09 ton ha was obtained from the irrigated area for a net irrigation volume of 21 327 m3 and 12 687 m3 in the years 2000 and 2002 respectively the schedule of the irrigation amounts was similar to that obtained for case a with majority of events obtained during 50 95 das 3 3 2 2 case d the optimization in case d considered the critical periods of crop growth for the multi objective optimization the resulting pareto optimal fronts are presented in fig 7 b and d for both the years the maximum number of irrigation events for case d 15 and 10 were lesser than that obtained from case a consequently the solution corresponding to 15 number of irrigations for the year 2000 and 10 number of irrigations for the year 2002 were chosen for further analysis the resulting total yield from the command area for the years 2000 and 2002 were 59 74 tons and 44 17 tons with the irrigated yield of 1 5 ton ha and 1 01 ton ha respectively the irrigated area under this irrigation schedule was found to be 21 73 ha in the year 2000 and 16 82 ha in the year 2002 with the net irrigation volume of 17 737 m3 and 10 193 m3 tables 5 and 6 respectively the pattern of irrigation schedules was like that obtained in the earlier cases with majority of the events distributed between 60 das and 90 das this optimization considered irrigation only during the critical crop periods and the irrigated volume was lower compared to that obtained for case c resulting in slightly less total yield for both the years 4 comparison of optimization cases the results of the four cases of deficit irrigation scheduling were compared with the crop productivity of the command area under rainfed farming no irrigation scenario as well as full irrigation scenarios the full irrigation scenario corresponds to the currently practiced irrigation approach within the watershed the summary of the results of the 4 optimal cases along with full irrigation and rainfed scenarios is given for the years 2000 table 5 and 2002 table 6 as expected the crop productivity of the irrigated crop is significantly higher compared to the rainfed crop indicating the effectiveness of the check dam the irrigated area under full irrigation scenario was only 9 ha in the year 2000 and 6 ha in the year 2002 while the irrigated area under the deficit irrigation scheduling was between 21 24 ha and 13 16 ha respectively hence it is evident that the deficit irrigation scheduling helps to increase the area under irrigation and the total yield from the command area of the check dam compared to the full irrigation scenario a comparison of the results from the four cases indicate that the maximum yield is obtained for the irrigation schedule in case a however the irrigation application was higher in this case compared to other three deficit irrigation scheduling cases in the year 2000 the total yield from the case b was 4 lesser than that of case a with 30 less net irrigation in the year 2000 but in the year 2002 the total yield obtained in both the cases a and b was similar along with similar utilization of net volume of irrigation water the net irrigation of case c and case d was found to be significantly lower as compared to other cases in year 2002 which can be attributed to the reduction in the number of irrigation events in both cases 13 and 10 for cases c and d respectively as mentioned earlier the optimization in cases c and d was multi objective optimization with objectives of minimizing the number of irrigation events while increasing the total yield from the command area of the check dam the solutions to these two optimization cases are in the form pareto optimal fronts providing a trade off between the number of irrigation events and the total yield from the command area any solution on the pareto optimal front is an optimal solution and selection of the solution is a subjective decision of the decision maker based on the trade off between competing variables das 1999 reed et al 2013 soon and madsen 2005 vema et al 2018 as the number of irrigation events increase the irrigation volume also increases resulting in increase of total yield generally an increase in the irrigation application increases the yield as shown in various studies farahani et al 2009 irmak et al 2000 maier and dietrich 2016 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 yazar et al 2002 however it is also noted in some studies that an increase in the irrigation volume does not necessarily result in same increase in the yield maier and dietrich 2016 thus suggesting that the timing of the irrigation has a higher impact on the yield quantity compared to the quantity of the irrigation geerts et al 2010 geerts and raes 2009 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 a comparison of the 4 optimum irrigation scheduling cases for both the years indicate that most of the irrigation events suggested by the framework are within the critical cropping period thus reinforcing the findings of the previous studies further the addition of constraint of irrigation only during the critical periods of crop growth case b and case d slightly reduced the total yield while slightly increasing the area under irrigation this reduction is plausibly due to the increased evaporation from the longer storage of water in the structure in addition the percolation from the check dam was also increased in case b and case d as compared to case a and case c tables 5 and 6 due to the longer storage of water in the structure a comparison of the yield of the two years across the four optimization scenarios indicate that the agricultural productivity in rainfed regions is primarily dependent on the amount of rainfall received a total of 680 mm of rainfall was received during the growing period of year 2000 while during the growing period of year 2002 only 410 mm of rainfall was received a reduction of 270 mm in rainfall in the year 2002 compared to the year 2000 resulted in a significant reduction in the total yield and area under irrigation while the deficit irrigation scheduling resulted in an increase in the total irrigated area and total yield it also resulted in increase of evaporation losses and seepage from the check dam the water evaporating from the check dam is considered as a loss to the crop but the water percolating from the check dam might help recharge the shallow aquifer thereby rejuvenating the dried up wells in the watershed however this inference needs to be corroborated with further studies on groundwater flow as the inference assumes that the water seeping out of the check dam would recharge the aquifer another benefit of the deficit irrigation scheduling is that the water stored in the check dam for longer time might result in higher releases of water to the downstream for some of the events for instance if the check dam is at 3 4th capacity the water releases to the downstream would be higher as compared to the water released when the check dam storage is at half capacity the excess water released to the downstream would aid in distributing equitable benefits in the watershed which is one of the major challenges in sustainable watershed management dile et al 2016 vema et al 2018 the results from the study suggest that deficit irrigation scheduling has the scope of improving the efficiency of the watershed management practices in terms of agricultural productivity since all the optimization cases resulted in similar results any of the cases could be utilized for developing schedules if the aim of the stakeholders is to maximize the total yield alone optimization in case a could give favorable solutions however if the aim is to maximize the total yield per unit application of irrigation water and increased percolation of water the solutions from case d optimization would be preferable for implementation 5 impact of simulation uncertainty on consequent decisions the effectiveness of the proposed water management strategies for rainfed agriculture with water harvesting structures is demonstrated in the preceding discussion the deficit irrigation scheduling of the irrigation water stored behind the check dams ensued an increase in the total command area of the check dam and the total yield implementation of these solutions in rainfed regions could result in achieving the future food security as well as increasing the effectiveness of the implemented watershed management practices however one of the concerns in implementing the proposed solutions is the reliability accuracy of these solutions the proposed solutions have been arrived using the simulation models and optimization procedures and simulation models have a certain level of uncertainty the uncertainty in the simulation models stem from the accuracy of the input information model parameters and model structure the uncertainty of the simulations from these sources affects the reliability accuracy of the results and consequent decisions the analysis presented in the preceding sections is based on a single simulation of the hydrological model and thus warrants evaluation of the reliability of the effectiveness of the proposed solutions note that all sources of uncertainty are important however this study only investigates the impact of model parameter uncertainty on simulations two simulation models hydrologic and crop growth simulation models were used for developing the irrigation schedules while both the models have parameters that contribute to parametric uncertainty of the simulations the crop growth model was calibrated using the observed data and the error in the model simulations was less on the other hand the hydrological model parameters were only fine tuned using the soft data as no observed records were available for model calibration therefore it is expected that the simulation uncertainty of the hydrological model would have a higher impact on the reliability accuracy of the obtained results as compared to the uncertainty arising from the crop growth simulation models thus only the hydrological model parameter uncertainty and its impact on consequent decisions is evaluated in this study monte carlo approach yu et al 2001 was adopted to perform the uncertainty analysis and evaluating the impact of simulation uncertainty on the final decisions the hydrologic model has 7 parameters whose description and range are provided in vema et al 2017 the parameters of the hydrologic model were sampled from the suggested ranges and several model realizations were generated using the sampled parameter sets 1000 simulations in this study from the monte carlo simulations five simulations corresponding to five different parameter sets were selected and used to develop the irrigation schedules and total yield from the command area of the check dams the selected simulations correspond to minimum mean standard deviation mean mean standard deviation and maximum of the monte carlo simulations and are termed as m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 respectively the five selected hydrologic simulations were used in simulation optimization framework to develop irrigation schedules and optimize the command area of the check dam the preceding analysis showed that the optimization in case a resulted in highest yield for both the years thus for this analysis only case a optimization was considered the total irrigated area and total dry yield obtained from the simulation optimization framework is shown in table 7 for year 2000 and table 8 for year 2002 from the results it is evident that the proposed framework results in higher dry yield compared to rainfed crop and crop getting traditional irrigation the total dry yield was found to vary from 55 to 64 ton for year 2000 and for year 2002 total yield was between 39 and 48 ton as compared to a rainfed yield of 44 77 and 39 11 ton for year 2000 and 2002 respectively the total irrigated area varied from 15 to 24 ha for both the years the results from the analysis show that while there is variation in the total yield and total irrigated area the total yield from the crops simulated with deficit irrigation scheduling was higher compared to rainfed crop and traditional irrigation method the results suggest that the proposed water management strategies can be adopted for improving the efficacy of the water harvesting structures efficiencies further studies are required to reduce the simulation uncertainty especially in such ungauged basins to improve the reliability in the simulations and the decisions based on these simulations 6 summary and conclusion in rainfed regions watershed management practices have improved the availability of water for an extended period however a proper irrigation management in these areas would result in better utilization of the available water in this study a simulation optimization framework is proposed to develop the irrigation schedules for the command area of a check dam the objective of the optimization was to maximize total yield of the output from the command area of the check dam the decision variables of the optimization are irrigation depths and total irrigated area the decision variables are dependent on the available water in the check dam which is simulated using a hydrologic model the irrigation schedules are forced through a parameterized aquacrop model to obtain the yield from the irrigated crop an analysis on identification of critical crop growth period against water stress was done prior to the optimization of irrigation schedule for water deficit conditions results of this analysis indicates that both the magnitude and duration of water stress period has a significant impact on yield reduction water stress only during critical growth stages germination flowering and pod development stage caused significant yield reduction on the other hand water stress of a few days 17 days before beginning of flowering stage resulted in a minor increase in yield the identified critical crop growth periods for the groundnut crop are 1 5 das and 41 95 das the results of the optimization study show that for all the cases the deficit irrigation strategy increased total yield with respect to full irrigation strategy by applying deficit irrigation in a larger cropping area the 4 considered optimization cases case a b c and d yielded similar results however restricting irrigation only on critical crop growth period reduced the amount of net irrigation water without reducing total yield significantly therefore if the objective is to improve the total yield optimization formulation described for case a can be adopted if the objective is to maximize the total yield per unit application of irrigation water and increased percolation of water optimization formulation described in case d can be adopted it can be concluded from the results of this study that the proposed simulation optimization frameworks can be suggested for developing irrigation strategies for water deficit condition in rainfed

5465,watershed management practices aim at improving the agricultural productivity in rainfed agricultural areas by conserving rainwater for an extended period the stored rainwater in the harvesting structures is used for meeting crop water demand the water use efficiencies of these structures can be further enhanced through adoption of deficit irrigation management strategies in this study deficit irrigation scheduling is formulated using a simulation optimization framework for a rainfed agricultural area with supplemental irrigation from a check dam in kondepi iwmp area near kondepi mandal prakasam district andhra pradesh india the results from the study indicate that the adoption of irrigation management strategies have the potential to improve the productivity and bring more area under irrigation with an increase of 20 and 140 for yield and irrigated area respectively the outcomes of this study indicate that the proposed method can be suggested for developing optimum irrigation strategies under water deficit in rainfed agriculture having water harvesting structures for an efficient utilization of stored rainwater keywords watershed management rainfed agriculture deficit irrigation check dams agricultural water management water harvesting structures 1 introduction the conflicts between increased demands for food production and declining water availability are the major barrier for sustainable agriculture across the world fao 2013 vörösmarty et al 2000 the problem of water scarcity or limited availability of water is expected to intensify in the future with the projected increase in the world population and the projected changes in the climate i e increase in temperatures along with erratic precipitation patterns jiang et al 2007 malek et al 2018 parry et al 2007 sishodia et al 2018 the worst affected regions due to these changes are expected to be the rainfed agricultural areas from the arid and semi arid regions jin et al 2018 which generally suffer from low productivity and other agro ecological problems azimi et al 2013 wani et al 2009 in this context the productivity from the rainfed regions which contribute to around 60 of the world s food production needs to be enhanced to meet the future food security the extent of rainfed agriculture varies regionally from 60 in south asia to more than 95 of the farmed lands in sub saharan africa devendra and revolution 2016 kerr et al 1996 suresh et al 2014 wani et al 2009 in the indian context nearly fifty one percent of the cultivable land is under rainfed agriculture ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare 2019 which primarily depends on the monsoon rainfall june october the agricultural productivity of the rainfed regions in india is strongly influenced by the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall while some of these areas have ground water reserve the intensive agricultural operations adopted during the green revolution of 1970 1980 have already resulted in declined water tables nicholas et al 2016 in addition the abnormal variability both in space and time in rainfall and temperature associated with changing climate has been a major constraint to crop yield improvements competitiveness and commercialization of rainfed crop tree crops and livestock systems in most of the tropical regions wani et al 2009 numerous evidences have been emerged for decreased agricultural production potential in rainfed agricultural regions across the world with varying rainfall pattern and volume due to changing climate rao 2000 therefore increased food demands inadequate availability of water coupled with uncertain rainfall both in amount and duration steers for sustainable water management strategies in rainfed regions to enhance the agricultural productivity and to meet the future food security surendran et al 2016 winter et al 2017 watershed management practices are adopted in rainfed regions of the world including india to alleviate the agro ecological problems and to improve the productivity in these regions dile et al 2016 kroeger et al 2019 reddy et al 2017 singh et al 2014 vema et al 2018 these practices aim at improving the water availability mainly through construction of various water conservation structures in watersheds syme and reddy 2015 wisser et al 2010 water harvesting structures such as check dams farm ponds percolation tanks etc serve as mechanism to capture the rainwater and surface runoff to act as surface storage and recharge groundwater the stored up water in these structures is utilized for meeting the crop water demands during the soil moisture stress periods while the current watershed management practices are effective in improving the water availability komariah and senge 2013 mishra et al 2013 groundwater recharge dillon 2005 nagaraj et al 2008 samuel and mathew 1997 and agricultural productivity garg et al 2012 kadam et al 2012 their efficiency could be further improved by introducing enhanced irrigation management strategies currently the traditional irrigation methods are adopted to irrigate small area around the conservation structure at the discretion of the stakeholder however traditional irrigation methods consume high amount of water adoption of improved irrigation management strategies would plausibly help increase the extent of the irrigated area which in turn may increase the productivity of the watershed porhemmat et al 2018 surendran et al 2016 among the various irrigation management strategies deficit irrigation management has been proved highly effective to improve the productivity and water use efficiency in water scarce regions bell et al 2018 prasad et al 2006 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 the fundamental principle behind deficit irrigation management is that the water stress during the non critical periods of cropping cycle does not significantly affect the crop yield boggess and ritchie 1988 hence deficit irrigation management strategies focus on minimizing the evaporative losses from the bare soil and providing irrigation only during the critical crop growth period the periods in the cropping cycle where water stress have significant effect on crop productivity are defined as critical cropping periods thus the deficit irrigation strategy aims at minimizing the reduction in crop yield during limited availability of the water against full irrigation although several studies on deficit irrigation management strategies for irrigated agriculture are available azimi et al 2013 bell et al 2018 guo et al 2014 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 its application scope and performance in rainfed agriculture regions with supplemental irrigation from water harvesting structures are poorly evaluated deficit irrigation scheduling is highly complex in nature and is influenced by various factors such as soil moisture soil physical characteristics crop parameters weather parameters throughout the growing season etc and their interactions further the effectiveness of the deficit irrigation scheduling mainly depends on proper identification of critical periods during the crop growth cycle geerts et al 2010 the complexity of its application for rainfed agriculture under watershed management is further augmented by the temporal variability of stored up water in the water harvesting structures since the water harvesting structures for watershed management are usually small in size and store only limited volume of water the accumulated water is either utilized by the stakeholders or lost through evaporation and seepage to groundwater thus the timing of irrigation also becomes a crucial factor as the available water for irrigation reduces if the irrigation is delayed while water is lost through soil evaporation and the extent of irrigated area is reduced in the case of premature irrigation therefore improvement in the agricultural productivity of the rainfed areas mandates studies to develop optimized deficit irrigation schedules for such regions in this study a simulation optimization framework is formulated to develop and implement an improved deficit irrigation strategy for rainfed regions that have water harvesting structures the water availability in the water harvesting structure is simulated using a hydrological model while the crop response to irrigation is simulated by means of a crop growth simulation model the irrigation schedules are generated using an optimizer with the aim of maximizing the agricultural productivity the effectiveness of the formulated framework is demonstrated on kondepi iwmp area which is part of a rainfed watershed in india with check dams as water harvesting structures 2 methodology 2 1 simulation optimization framework in general two determinant factors influence the development of the deficit irrigation schedules for crops growing in rainfed regions with supplementary irrigation from water harvesting structures water availability for irrigation and critical periods of crop growth as mentioned earlier the water availability in the water harvesting structure is simulated using a hydrological model and the crops response to the applied irrigation is evaluated using a crop growth simulation model the optimizer in the simulation optimization framework identifies the irrigation schedules to maximize the agricultural productivity the limited storage of the water harvesting structures restricts irrigation to small fields surrounding the structure in practice the irrigation from these structures is provided to the crops as and when the top soil dries up and is a subjective decision of the farmer hence it is envisaged that the adoption of the formulated deficit irrigation schedules using the simulation optimization framework would increase the irrigated area per structure and consequently improve the crop yield the adopted simulation optimization framework is presented in fig 1 the framework consists of three parts a hydrological model simulation which simulates daily inflow to the check dam the source for irrigation is the water stored up in the check dam b optimizer which determines irrigation schedule and the irrigated area and c crop growth simulation model which simulates crop production for different irrigation schedules the details of the simulation models and problem formulation for optimization are discussed in the following sub sections 2 1 1 hydrological model the hydrological model in this study is employed to evaluate the water inflows to the water harvesting structures and water availability for the irrigation on any given day one of the requirements of the hydrologic model is it should be capable of simulating the hydrologic processes in administrative catchments or area of interest i e catchments unbound by ridge lines since watershed management practices are usually practiced in such areas while any hydrological model that can simulate such areas can be adopted for this study a distributed hydrological model developed by vema et al 2017 that was specifically developed for such areas was used to simulate the inflows to the check dams in this study the hydrologic model has been applied for optimal sizing of the check dams in the considered study catchment in the earlier study by vema et al 2018 note that the choice of the hydrological model would not alter the proposed framework for generating the irrigation schedules and any hydrological model can be adopted in the proposed framework the model uses a grid based spatial discretization scheme and adopts a simple water balance approach eq 1 1 s t s o i 1 t p i q i e i p e r c i g w i where so is the initial soil water content at the start of the day i and st is the final soil water content t is time in days pi is precipitation on day i qi is surface runoff on day i ei is evapotranspiration on day i perci is percolation on day i and gwi is ground water return flow on day i the model simulates at daily time step and the variables are expressed in mm the model simulates all the water balance components such as surface runoff evaporation ground water flow percolation etc at each grid cell the simulated flow in the upstream cells is routed through the grid cells to the watershed outlet the water balance components in the model are simulated using widely tested and accepted methods and algorithms the model is capable to simulate the water harvesting structures and routes the flow in these structures using the variable storage routing method the detailed description of the model is available in vema et al 2017 2 1 2 crop growth simulation model the crops response to the applied irrigation is simulated using aquacrop model hsiao et al 2009 raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 developed by fao in 2009 the aquacrop model is simple and robust and the user friendly interface enables the user to analyze different crop production response under different set of environmental conditions to develop effective strategies for deficit irrigation geerts et al 2010 the model has relatively less parameters compared to other crop growth simulation models the inputs to the model include crop physiology soil properties weather data management practices irrigation scheduling and initial conditions for simulating the crop yield and biomass the crop yield in the model is simulated by partitioning the daily evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration the estimated daily transpiration is used to compute the biomass by considering biomass as a factor of net transpiration from the calculated biomass the dry yield is estimated using a parameter called harvest index hio the assumptions made in this study were that sufficient nutrient supply was available to the crop and weed management and pest control practices were adequate so that the controls exerted on the crop yield other than irrigation water availability were eliminated 2 1 3 optimization algorithm as mentioned earlier the deficit irrigation scheduling is a complex non linear optimization problem the irrigation schedule should maximize the area under irrigation and agricultural productivity simultaneously the other important factors to be considered are the water use efficiency and the evaporation losses from the storage to achieve this a multi algorithm genetically adaptive method amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 was used as the optimization algorithm in this study the amalgam utilizes four optimization algorithms namely non dominated sorted genetic algorithm ii particle swarm optimization adaptive metropolis search and differential evolution to arrive at the optimal solution it is expected that the interaction between different optimization algorithms leads to arrive at better results with less function evaluations the detailed description on the amalgam can be found in vrugt and robinson 2007 2 1 4 formulation of optimization problem formulation of the optimization problem for identifying the deficit irrigation schedules involves identification and selection of decision variables and development of objective functions and constraints the main objective is to improve the total crop yield of the rainfed region the crop yield is simulated as a function of the irrigation water applied in the field using the aquacrop model the crop yield as a function of the irrigation input can be written as eq 2 2 y f i 1 t iw i where y is the simulated dry yield in ton ha by aquacrop iw i is depth of applied irrigation water in mm ha to the crop on ith day after sowing das and t is the total number of days in the crop cycle the decision variables in this study are the amount and timing of irrigation along with the area to be irrigated since the irrigated area is a decision variable the objective function is formulated as maximizing the summation of the total dry yield from both the irrigated and rainfed areas non irrigated of the maximum command area of the water harvesting structure eq 3 the total area that can be irrigated from the structure i e command area of the water harvesting structure is fixed and is one of the constraints of the optimization problem eq 8 the other constraints of the optimization problem include no irrigation on a rainy day eq 9 upper limit of the irrigation allocation would be the available water in the check dam eq 6 and daily water storage should not exceed the maximum storage volume of the check dam eq 5 the mathematical formulation of the objective function and the constraints are given in eqs 3 9 3 o f 1 m a x i m i z e y i a i y r a r subjected to 4 s i 1 s i q i e i k sat w s a 1000 i i 5 0 s i c 6 0 i i s i 7 i i iw i a i 10 η 8 a i a r a 9 i i 0 p i 5 f o r i 1 2 t where of1 is the first objective function y i is the dry yield in ton ha from irrigated crop y r is the dry yield in ton ha from rainfed crop a i is the irrigated area in ha of the total command area a of the check dam a r is the rainfed cropping area in ha s i is the water storage in m3 in the check dam at ith das q i is the inflow in m3 to the check dam at ith das e i is the evaporation rate in mm day at ith das k sat is the saturation hydraulic conductivity in mm day wsa is the water surface area in m2 of storage volume in the check dam at ith day i i is the net irrigation volume in m3 supplied by the check dam at ith day c is the maximum capacity of the check dam in m3 η is the overall irrigation efficiency p i is the rainfall depth in mm at ith day and t is the total number of days in crop cycle in this study an irrigation of depth less than 5 mm is not considered significant and consequently any day with a rainfall less than 5 mm is assumed to be a non rainy day an overall irrigation efficiency of 80 was assumed to account for losses during irrigation although the of1 aims at maximizing the productivity from the command area of the water harvesting structure but does not consider the critical periods of crop growth since water stress at other than critical crop growth period during a crop cycle doesn t reduce crop yield significantly irrigating only during the critical period can also be considered as a constraint for better utilization of irrigation water therefore an additional constraint of irrigating during the critical cropping period only eq 10 is added to the above mentioned formulation the variable c in eq 10 is a set containing the days in terms of das which are not part of critical crop growing period the irrigation schedules are developed for both the conditions i e irrigation without considering the critical period case a and irrigation only during the critical period case b 10 i i 0 i c f o r i 1 2 t while the above mentioned formulations are exhaustive in nature and net irrigation application might reduce as compared to a full irrigation the optimal irrigation schedule might result in a greater number of irrigation events in this purview it is possible to have minor irrigation applications on all the possible days which may be infeasible in practice the number of irrigations applied to crop is limited due to various reasons therefore to account for this limitation another objective of minimizing the number of irrigation events was added to the above two formulations the second objective was formulated as eq 11 11 o f 2 m i n i m i z e i 1 t n i i i 0 where of2 is the second objective function and n i is a binary variable and takes a value of 1 if irrigation is applied on ith day otherwise is equal to 0 all the constraints of these optimization problems remain same as earlier for each case the second objective function contradicts to the first objective function as with reduced number of irrigation events the application of water may also get reduced consequently reducing the crop yield if the reduction in yield is not significant for reduced irrigation events the cost of irrigation would be less which would be advantageous to the farmer however if the yield gets reduced significantly the arrived solution maybe no better than the rainfed agriculture similar to the case of the single objective optimization problem two cases of multi objective optimization problems were also formulated without considering any critical crop growth period case c and by restricting the irrigation during the critical cropping period only case d the four cases considered for developing optimum irrigation schedules are presented in table 1 2 2 study area and data the formulated simulation optimization cases to develop irrigation schedules were demonstrated in kondepi iwmp area near kondepi mandal prakasam district andhra pradesh india the study area is located in between latitude 15 23 north and 15 25 north and longitude 79 48 east and 79 53 east and falls under subtropical climate region a detailed description of the study area is presented in vema et al 2018 the cropping practices in kondepi watershed are dominantly rainfed and the agricultural sector is facing severe agro ecological issues such as low productivity soil erosion water scarcity etc the government of india is implementing the integrated watershed management program iwmp in the watershed to improve the water availability and arrest the ecological deterioration of the region under the iwmp program several water conservation structures such as check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks are constructed within the watershed it may be noted that kondepi watershed is not a traditional watershed bounded by ridge lines instead it s a term used to refer the area around kondepi village in which the iwmp program is implemented and thus is referred to as kondepi iwmp area in the subsequent sections the total geographical area of the kondepi iwmp area is 4150 ha where 1100 ha is utilized for agriculture while majority of the farmers in the study area practice rainfed farming some are using drip irrigation method by utilizing the limited groundwater available to them some of the cultivated crops in the catchment are groundnut arachis hypogeae rice oryza sativa red gram cajanus cajan tobacco nicotiana tabcum and bengal gram cicer arietinum among these crops groundnut is the major crop within the watershed the cropping cycle depends on the arrival of north east monsoon and generally july december is considered as cropping period the kondepi iwmp area is further sub divided into 8 micro watersheds based on the administrative boundaries of the encompassing villages of the watershed the proposed methodology to arrive at the deficit irrigation scheduling is demonstrated using one of the check dams in one of the micro watersheds the selected micro watershed has 7 check dams in place and the command area of each check dam was 55 ha arrived at by dividing the entire area of the micro watershed by 7 the proposed framework is tested for the growing season in two years 2000 and 2002 the grid based hydrological model was setup for the watershed to simulate the inflows to the selected check dam for the period of 1st june 2000 to 31st january 2003 the check dam has maximum storage capacity of 1809 41 m3 and an initial storage of 0 14 m3 at the start of the simulation period the weather parameters precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed used in this model were collected from imd dataset pai et al 2015 the srtm dem of 30 m resolutions was used for topographic representation of the watershed while the land use land cover and soil data were obtained from the department of rural development government of andhra pradesh 2 3 aquacrop model setup since groundnut is the predominant crop in the watershed and within the command area of the selected check dam the aquacrop model was set up for the groundnut crop the crop sowing date was fixed based on the local farming practice within the watershed the sowing date for the year 2000 was 1st july 2000 and harvested on 19th october 2000 and the sowing date for the year 2002 was 29th august 2002 and harvested on 17th december 2002 a total rainfall during the cropping period of 2000 and 2002 was 680 mm and 410 mm respectively as some farmers who have groundwater resources are using drip irrigation method it is assumed that the remaining farmers would utilize drip irrigation for irrigating by drawing water from the water harvesting structure consequently during the model setup it was assumed that the drip irrigation technique was employed for irrigating the crop using the water stored in the check dam and water content in the soil was at field capacity on the date of sowing 2 3 1 parameterization of aquacrop model for accurate representation of crop growth simulation the aquacrop model needs to be parameterized the data for calibration of the aquacrop model was not available from the farms of the kondepi watershed therefore experimental data for groundnut crop was collected from an experimental field with similar climatic setting located outside the watershed the data of field experimental study in experimental fields of a 8 block of zonal agricultural research station gandhi krishi vignana kendra university of agricultural sciences bengaluru karnataka india was available for two seasons july to october of 2016 and 2017 biswal 2017 sandeep 2018 the experimental site lies on 13 05 north 77 34 east and elevation of 924 m from mean sea level in karnataka annual normal rainfall at the experimental site is 917 mm the soil type is red sandy clay loam with 70 and 23 sand and clay content respectively the crops were irrigated during the early stage of the crop cycle and at the flowering stage the first step in the model calibration is identifying the sensitive parameters of the model hence a global sensitivity analysis using the sobol method lilburne and tarantola 2009 was performed to identify the sensitive parameters generally model calibration requires substantially large number of observed data to train the model and tune up the parameters accordingly but in this study the available experimental data were only for two years which was not enough to calibrate the crop parameters by auto calibration methods therefore a manual calibration approach using the trial and error method was adopted to estimate the sensitive parameters the parameters with the lowest error in the output were considered as the optimal set of parameters and were used for the crop growth simulations the experimental data for the groundnut crop used for manual calibration of crop parameters is presented in the table 2 2 3 2 identification of critical crop growth period in general the response of crops to water stress varies for a specific magnitude and duration of water stress throughout the cropping cycle the water stress during some specific stages of cropping period reduce the crop yield significantly while during the other periods the effect is inconsequential deficit irrigation management deals with partial application of irrigation to crop during critical periods of crop growth hence the effectiveness of the deficit irrigation management depends on identification of critical periods within the cropping cycle that are most sensitive to water stress in this study the critical crop growth periods for the groundnut crop were identified using the parameterized aquacrop model with the assumption of no rainfall during the crop growth period and controlled irrigation was provided to avoid any external uncontrolled water application the soil moisture at the starting of the cropping period was assumed to be at field capacity in reality the crop may experience a single period of water stress or multiple periods of water stress during the cropping cycle thus to identify all the critical cropping periods two different analysis a single period stress analysis and b multiple period stress analysis were carried out 2 3 2 1 single period stress analysis the single period stress analysis assumes the occurrence of one single continuous period of water stress duration of n days during the cropping cycle the crop is irrigated with a depth of 5 mm for all days from sowing to maturity except for the days where crop experiences the water stress a moving window of n days is progressed from sowing till maturity during which the crop does not receive any supplemental irrigation and the corresponding yield is noted the yield thus obtained was compared with the yield from the baseline scenario which corresponds to the crop yield without experiencing crop yield i e irrigation on all days from sowing to maturity the reduction in the yield of the simulations with water stress periods as compared to baseline scenario provides information to identify the critical periods of the crop growth 2 3 2 2 multiple period stress analysis although the single period stress analysis is useful in identifying the critical crop periods it assumes that the crop experiences only a single spell of water stress during the cropping cycle and is an independent variable which may or may not be true the crop may experience water stress for multiple periods during the cropping period hence to identify the multiple critical periods and the impact of their interactions on the crop productivity a multiple period stress analysis is carried out in multiple period stress analysis two periods of water stress were considered such that they do not overlap with each other the aquacrop model set up and irrigation method remained the same as that used in single period stress analysis the aquacrop model was simulated for all the possible combinations of water stress periods during the crop growth period the reduction in the yield compared to that of the baseline yield indicates the critical crop growth periods the critical crop growth period depends on the climatic setting of the cropping area thus the window size n days in the analysis was estimated based on long term dry spell length of the kondepi watershed the average continuous non rainy days during the cropping period in the kondepi watershed was selected as the period of water stress for the critical crop period analysis 3 results 3 1 manual calibration of aquacrop model crop parameters the aquacrop model was calibrated for the groundnut crop using the data from the experimental site the aquacrop model has 12 crop parameters that affect the crop growth and yield and the range and description of the parameters are tabulated in table 3 the sensitivity of all the 12 parameters were tested using the sobol sensitivity analysis and the sensitivity index of the parameters is shown in fig 2 the results indicate that reference harvest index hio is the most sensitive parameter followed by the biomass water productivity wp the harvest index parameter controls the yield obtained from the biomass produced as the total yield from the crop is the product of the biomass produced and the harvest index at physiological maturity of a crop species the harvest index for non stress condition is termed as reference harvest index biomass water productivity wp is normalized for different climatic conditions and represents a linear relationship between total above ground biomass produced and total amount of water transpired from leaf stomata it is observed that the crop coefficient at maximum canopy cover kctr x was also sensitive however kctr x is a conservative parameter within the aquacrop model and hence any changes is restricted food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2018 the manual calibration of the aquacrop model in this study considered hio and wp only and default values were considered for less sensitive parameters the two sensitive parameters wp and hio were calibrated using the trial and error approach different combinations of the parameters were tested and the parameter values showing minimum deviation from the observed yield were considered as calibrated values as mentioned earlier only two years of data was available for model calibration during which dry yields of 1 85 ton ha and 2 21 ton ha were obtained for years 2016 and 2017 respectively the difference between the observed and simulated dry yields for different values of sensitive parameters wp and hio tested for trial and error are shown in fig 3 the minimum deviation for wp and hio has been observed at 10 g m2 and 30 respectively the calibrated model simulated dry yields of 1 85 ton ha and 2 22 ton ha for years 2016 and 2017 respectively the crop parameters used for simulating the groundnut crop are shown in table 3 3 2 critical crop growth periods historical precipitation data of 43 years 1970 2012 for the kondepi watershed was analyzed to identify the number of continuous non rainy days experienced during the cropping period of july to december the result of the analysis show that the average length of dry spell the crops of the watershed experience was approximately 9 days table 4 the maximum length of continuous non rainy days was found to be up to 28 days during the period of analysis however in most years the number of continuous non rainy days was mostly between 8 and 12 days hence in this study the duration of water stress period for identification of critical crop growth period analysis was considered as 10 days 3 2 1 single period stress analysis the single period stress analysis was performed by considering 10 days of continuous water stress period for the crop it may be noted that no irrigation was provided to the crop during the 10 days considered for identifying the critical crop periods the moving window of 10 days progresses from sowing till maturity and the deviation in the yield was noted yield reduction in the range of 0 1 0 3 ton ha was observed when irrigation was not provided to crop from 41 days after sowing das till maturity fig 4 a similar analysis was performed for different lengths of water stress period such as 13 17 and 20 days to identify the effect of the considered duration for water stress on the critical period identification however the results of the analysis fig 4 indicate that variation in the yield is similar in all the cases of water stress period with a maximum yield reduction observed for water stress during 41 60 das for 10 and 13 days stress period a slight increase in yield was observed when irrigation was not provided at the beginning of crop cycle though the critical periods of crop growth were similar for all the four non irrigation periods the reduction in the yield increased from 9 to 40 with respect to an increase in the continuous non irrigation days from 10 to 20 days 3 2 2 multiple period stress analysis the multiple stress period analysis was carried out by considering two separate period of water stress periods in this analysis 10 days of no irrigation were considered for both the water stress periods the results of the analysis evidently suggest a yield reduction of 0 9 ton ha during the continuous water stress at the beginning of the crop cycle fig 5 for discrete periods of water stress after 10 das until around 30 das caused a slight increase of 0 1 ton ha in the yield compared to no stress condition however continuous stress during this period 10 30 das resulted in a mild yield reduction plausibly due to unavailability of sufficient moisture for seed germination for any water stress after 41 das until 95 das a significant reduction in the crop yield was noted similar to the case of single period stress analysis the results of the single and multiple period stress analysis evidently indicated that the critical periods of crop growth are during the germination period 1 5 das and flowering and pod development period 41 95 das of groundnut crop since the crop requires adequate water for the seed to germinate water stress during this period leads to late germination and thereby reduction in crop yield the flowering of groundnut crop starts at approximately 40 45 das and continues for another 25 days the flowering of groundnut is followed by the pod development which is 30 days long the crop requires water during this reproductive stage and any stress during this period 41 95 das significantly affects the crop yield as it is evident from the both the analysis the identified critical periods in both single and multiple period analysis agreed with the field observation studies reported in rao et al 1985 however the water stress prior to the flowering stage enhances the productivity of the crop which maybe the result of the inhibition in vegetative growth resulting in less transpiration due to water stress this observation is supported by the results of various researchers where they concluded that the reduction in the transpiration and vegetative growth results in better water utilization by the crop for the yield development harris and hawkins 1942 loka and oosterhuis 2012 rao et al 1985 hence it is inferred from the results of the analysis that the duration and timing of water stress period has a significant impact on the crop yield variation 3 3 optimal deficit irrigation schedule the deficit irrigation schedules were developed using four different cases with and without considering the critical periods of crop cycle for both single and multi objective optimization formulations the timing and depth of irrigation along with total area under irrigation were optimized for the objective of maximizing the crop yield in the single objective optimization while an additional objective of minimizing the irrigation events was added in the multi objective optimization 3 3 1 single objective optimization 3 3 1 1 case a in this case single objective optimization was performed without considering the critical periods of crop growth the optimization resulted in 20 and 16 irrigation events fig 6 a c respectively for the year 2000 and 2002 covering an area of 21 73 ha table 5 and 13 67 ha table 6 respectively out of total 55 ha as expected the dry yield from the irrigated area was remarkably higher with 1 59 ton ha and 1 13 ton ha of yield while the rainfed area produced only 0 81 ton ha and 0 71 ton ha for the years 2000 and 2002 respectively the total simulated yield for the irrigated condition from the command area was 61 57 tons for year 2000 and 44 78 tons for year 2002 majority of the irrigation events for both the years were distributed from 45 to 95 das which was identified as critical periods of crop growth while the critical period analysis indicated that the period from 41 to 95 das was critical for crop productivity however some of the days of the critical periods received sufficient rainfall resulting in no irrigation events on those days in addition to the irrigation events in the critical cropping period irrigation events were also observed during germination before flowering and pod filling stages the total amount of irrigation in this case was 23 580 m3 for year 2000 and 14 968 m3 for year 2002 3 3 1 2 case b in this case single objective optimization was performed by constraining irrigation events only during the critical periods of cropping cycle i e 1 5 das and 41 95 das the optimized irrigation schedule has 14 irrigation events fig 6 b d for both the years 2000 and 2002 in this case the area under irrigation for both years 2000 and 2002 was slightly higher as compared to area under irrigation in case a 23 51 ha and 15 06 ha for year 2000 and 2002 respectively however the irrigated yield was observed to be marginally less in both years as compared to case a with 1 42 ton ha in year 2000 and 1 07 ton ha in year 2002 the reduction in the yield in both the years is plausibly the result of missing irrigation event during the germination period combined with total reduced irrigation volume in both years see tables 5 and 6 the substantial reduction in the total irrigation is evident in the total yield 59 tons from the total command area of the check dam in the year 2000 the pattern of irrigation events during the critical crop growing periods was similar to that of case a most of the irrigation events were clustered in the period from 55 to 85 das in the year 2000 and from 75 to 90 das in the year 2002 there were only few irrigation events between 40 and 60 das in both years owing to the rainfall received during the period 3 3 2 multi objective optimization 3 3 2 1 case c in this case the optimization is similar to that of case a with an additional objective of minimizing the number of irrigation events as mentioned earlier the two objectives considered are conflicting objectives thus resulting in the pareto optimal solutions fig 7 the pareto optimal front obtained for case c for both year 2000 and 2002 are shown in fig 7 a and c respectively the x axis of the pareto optimal front is the total number of irrigation events and the y axis is the total yield from the command area of the water harvesting structure the selection of the solution from the pareto optimal front is a subjective decision and any solution from the pareto optimal front can be adopted based on the priorities the pareto optimal front presents a trade off between the number of irrigation events and the total yield obtained it is evident from the fig 7 that as number of irrigation events increase thus increasing the irrigated volume the total yield increases a point with low number of irrigation events would result in reduced application of the irrigation water and consequently result in reduced overall yield however a solution with a greater number of irrigation events increases the total irrigation volume and total yield at the same time increasing the cost of irrigation per ton of produce for instance a solution with 6 irrigation events for case c optimization of year 2000 resulted in an irrigation volume of 7000 m3 and a total dry yield of 53 ton for the same case a solution corresponding to 17 irrigation events results in net irrigation volume of 21 000 m3 for a total yield of 61 37 tons thus a three fold increase in irrigation application only increased the yield by 9 tons since the focus of this study was to maximize the total yield from the command area of check dam and also the maximum irrigation events for this optimization 17 and 13 respectively for the years 2000 and 2002 are either less or comparable to the number of irrigation events obtained for case a and case b the solutions corresponding to maximum total yield were chosen for further analysis the total simulated yield from the command area of the check dam was 61 37 tons in the year 2000 and 44 69 tons for the year 2002 of the selected solutions the irrigation timing and amount for the selected solutions is shown in fig 8 a and c a dry yield of 1 59 ton ha and 1 09 ton ha was obtained from the irrigated area for a net irrigation volume of 21 327 m3 and 12 687 m3 in the years 2000 and 2002 respectively the schedule of the irrigation amounts was similar to that obtained for case a with majority of events obtained during 50 95 das 3 3 2 2 case d the optimization in case d considered the critical periods of crop growth for the multi objective optimization the resulting pareto optimal fronts are presented in fig 7 b and d for both the years the maximum number of irrigation events for case d 15 and 10 were lesser than that obtained from case a consequently the solution corresponding to 15 number of irrigations for the year 2000 and 10 number of irrigations for the year 2002 were chosen for further analysis the resulting total yield from the command area for the years 2000 and 2002 were 59 74 tons and 44 17 tons with the irrigated yield of 1 5 ton ha and 1 01 ton ha respectively the irrigated area under this irrigation schedule was found to be 21 73 ha in the year 2000 and 16 82 ha in the year 2002 with the net irrigation volume of 17 737 m3 and 10 193 m3 tables 5 and 6 respectively the pattern of irrigation schedules was like that obtained in the earlier cases with majority of the events distributed between 60 das and 90 das this optimization considered irrigation only during the critical crop periods and the irrigated volume was lower compared to that obtained for case c resulting in slightly less total yield for both the years 4 comparison of optimization cases the results of the four cases of deficit irrigation scheduling were compared with the crop productivity of the command area under rainfed farming no irrigation scenario as well as full irrigation scenarios the full irrigation scenario corresponds to the currently practiced irrigation approach within the watershed the summary of the results of the 4 optimal cases along with full irrigation and rainfed scenarios is given for the years 2000 table 5 and 2002 table 6 as expected the crop productivity of the irrigated crop is significantly higher compared to the rainfed crop indicating the effectiveness of the check dam the irrigated area under full irrigation scenario was only 9 ha in the year 2000 and 6 ha in the year 2002 while the irrigated area under the deficit irrigation scheduling was between 21 24 ha and 13 16 ha respectively hence it is evident that the deficit irrigation scheduling helps to increase the area under irrigation and the total yield from the command area of the check dam compared to the full irrigation scenario a comparison of the results from the four cases indicate that the maximum yield is obtained for the irrigation schedule in case a however the irrigation application was higher in this case compared to other three deficit irrigation scheduling cases in the year 2000 the total yield from the case b was 4 lesser than that of case a with 30 less net irrigation in the year 2000 but in the year 2002 the total yield obtained in both the cases a and b was similar along with similar utilization of net volume of irrigation water the net irrigation of case c and case d was found to be significantly lower as compared to other cases in year 2002 which can be attributed to the reduction in the number of irrigation events in both cases 13 and 10 for cases c and d respectively as mentioned earlier the optimization in cases c and d was multi objective optimization with objectives of minimizing the number of irrigation events while increasing the total yield from the command area of the check dam the solutions to these two optimization cases are in the form pareto optimal fronts providing a trade off between the number of irrigation events and the total yield from the command area any solution on the pareto optimal front is an optimal solution and selection of the solution is a subjective decision of the decision maker based on the trade off between competing variables das 1999 reed et al 2013 soon and madsen 2005 vema et al 2018 as the number of irrigation events increase the irrigation volume also increases resulting in increase of total yield generally an increase in the irrigation application increases the yield as shown in various studies farahani et al 2009 irmak et al 2000 maier and dietrich 2016 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 yazar et al 2002 however it is also noted in some studies that an increase in the irrigation volume does not necessarily result in same increase in the yield maier and dietrich 2016 thus suggesting that the timing of the irrigation has a higher impact on the yield quantity compared to the quantity of the irrigation geerts et al 2010 geerts and raes 2009 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 a comparison of the 4 optimum irrigation scheduling cases for both the years indicate that most of the irrigation events suggested by the framework are within the critical cropping period thus reinforcing the findings of the previous studies further the addition of constraint of irrigation only during the critical periods of crop growth case b and case d slightly reduced the total yield while slightly increasing the area under irrigation this reduction is plausibly due to the increased evaporation from the longer storage of water in the structure in addition the percolation from the check dam was also increased in case b and case d as compared to case a and case c tables 5 and 6 due to the longer storage of water in the structure a comparison of the yield of the two years across the four optimization scenarios indicate that the agricultural productivity in rainfed regions is primarily dependent on the amount of rainfall received a total of 680 mm of rainfall was received during the growing period of year 2000 while during the growing period of year 2002 only 410 mm of rainfall was received a reduction of 270 mm in rainfall in the year 2002 compared to the year 2000 resulted in a significant reduction in the total yield and area under irrigation while the deficit irrigation scheduling resulted in an increase in the total irrigated area and total yield it also resulted in increase of evaporation losses and seepage from the check dam the water evaporating from the check dam is considered as a loss to the crop but the water percolating from the check dam might help recharge the shallow aquifer thereby rejuvenating the dried up wells in the watershed however this inference needs to be corroborated with further studies on groundwater flow as the inference assumes that the water seeping out of the check dam would recharge the aquifer another benefit of the deficit irrigation scheduling is that the water stored in the check dam for longer time might result in higher releases of water to the downstream for some of the events for instance if the check dam is at 3 4th capacity the water releases to the downstream would be higher as compared to the water released when the check dam storage is at half capacity the excess water released to the downstream would aid in distributing equitable benefits in the watershed which is one of the major challenges in sustainable watershed management dile et al 2016 vema et al 2018 the results from the study suggest that deficit irrigation scheduling has the scope of improving the efficiency of the watershed management practices in terms of agricultural productivity since all the optimization cases resulted in similar results any of the cases could be utilized for developing schedules if the aim of the stakeholders is to maximize the total yield alone optimization in case a could give favorable solutions however if the aim is to maximize the total yield per unit application of irrigation water and increased percolation of water the solutions from case d optimization would be preferable for implementation 5 impact of simulation uncertainty on consequent decisions the effectiveness of the proposed water management strategies for rainfed agriculture with water harvesting structures is demonstrated in the preceding discussion the deficit irrigation scheduling of the irrigation water stored behind the check dams ensued an increase in the total command area of the check dam and the total yield implementation of these solutions in rainfed regions could result in achieving the future food security as well as increasing the effectiveness of the implemented watershed management practices however one of the concerns in implementing the proposed solutions is the reliability accuracy of these solutions the proposed solutions have been arrived using the simulation models and optimization procedures and simulation models have a certain level of uncertainty the uncertainty in the simulation models stem from the accuracy of the input information model parameters and model structure the uncertainty of the simulations from these sources affects the reliability accuracy of the results and consequent decisions the analysis presented in the preceding sections is based on a single simulation of the hydrological model and thus warrants evaluation of the reliability of the effectiveness of the proposed solutions note that all sources of uncertainty are important however this study only investigates the impact of model parameter uncertainty on simulations two simulation models hydrologic and crop growth simulation models were used for developing the irrigation schedules while both the models have parameters that contribute to parametric uncertainty of the simulations the crop growth model was calibrated using the observed data and the error in the model simulations was less on the other hand the hydrological model parameters were only fine tuned using the soft data as no observed records were available for model calibration therefore it is expected that the simulation uncertainty of the hydrological model would have a higher impact on the reliability accuracy of the obtained results as compared to the uncertainty arising from the crop growth simulation models thus only the hydrological model parameter uncertainty and its impact on consequent decisions is evaluated in this study monte carlo approach yu et al 2001 was adopted to perform the uncertainty analysis and evaluating the impact of simulation uncertainty on the final decisions the hydrologic model has 7 parameters whose description and range are provided in vema et al 2017 the parameters of the hydrologic model were sampled from the suggested ranges and several model realizations were generated using the sampled parameter sets 1000 simulations in this study from the monte carlo simulations five simulations corresponding to five different parameter sets were selected and used to develop the irrigation schedules and total yield from the command area of the check dams the selected simulations correspond to minimum mean standard deviation mean mean standard deviation and maximum of the monte carlo simulations and are termed as m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 respectively the five selected hydrologic simulations were used in simulation optimization framework to develop irrigation schedules and optimize the command area of the check dam the preceding analysis showed that the optimization in case a resulted in highest yield for both the years thus for this analysis only case a optimization was considered the total irrigated area and total dry yield obtained from the simulation optimization framework is shown in table 7 for year 2000 and table 8 for year 2002 from the results it is evident that the proposed framework results in higher dry yield compared to rainfed crop and crop getting traditional irrigation the total dry yield was found to vary from 55 to 64 ton for year 2000 and for year 2002 total yield was between 39 and 48 ton as compared to a rainfed yield of 44 77 and 39 11 ton for year 2000 and 2002 respectively the total irrigated area varied from 15 to 24 ha for both the years the results from the analysis show that while there is variation in the total yield and total irrigated area the total yield from the crops simulated with deficit irrigation scheduling was higher compared to rainfed crop and traditional irrigation method the results suggest that the proposed water management strategies can be adopted for improving the efficacy of the water harvesting structures efficiencies further studies are required to reduce the simulation uncertainty especially in such ungauged basins to improve the reliability in the simulations and the decisions based on these simulations 6 summary and conclusion in rainfed regions watershed management practices have improved the availability of water for an extended period however a proper irrigation management in these areas would result in better utilization of the available water in this study a simulation optimization framework is proposed to develop the irrigation schedules for the command area of a check dam the objective of the optimization was to maximize total yield of the output from the command area of the check dam the decision variables of the optimization are irrigation depths and total irrigated area the decision variables are dependent on the available water in the check dam which is simulated using a hydrologic model the irrigation schedules are forced through a parameterized aquacrop model to obtain the yield from the irrigated crop an analysis on identification of critical crop growth period against water stress was done prior to the optimization of irrigation schedule for water deficit conditions results of this analysis indicates that both the magnitude and duration of water stress period has a significant impact on yield reduction water stress only during critical growth stages germination flowering and pod development stage caused significant yield reduction on the other hand water stress of a few days 17 days before beginning of flowering stage resulted in a minor increase in yield the identified critical crop growth periods for the groundnut crop are 1 5 das and 41 95 das the results of the optimization study show that for all the cases the deficit irrigation strategy increased total yield with respect to full irrigation strategy by applying deficit irrigation in a larger cropping area the 4 considered optimization cases case a b c and d yielded similar results however restricting irrigation only on critical crop growth period reduced the amount of net irrigation water without reducing total yield significantly therefore if the objective is to improve the total yield optimization formulation described for case a can be adopted if the objective is to maximize the total yield per unit application of irrigation water and increased percolation of water optimization formulation described in case d can be adopted it can be concluded from the results of this study that the proposed simulation optimization frameworks can be suggested for developing irrigation strategies for water deficit condition in rainfed

5466,time lapse electrical resistivity imaging eri combined with salt tracers can enhance our understanding of subsurface flow and transport in ditch drained agroecosystems in a nearly level field adjacent to a drainage ditch we installed 192 electrodes in a 72 m2 plot along with five hydrometric stations to enable time lapse eri monitoring during storms immediately prior to a wintertime rainstorm we applied 5 kg of kbr to a shallow trench located roughly 11 m upgradient from the ditch antecedent conditions prior to the storm were wet assuring a hydrologically connected state that favored tracer dissolution and movement in the subsurface we monitored the evolution of the tracer plume with eri over a seven day period four dimensional 4d delineation of precipitation and tracer transport using time lapse eri showed that the tracer plume moved preferentially downward through a discontinuity in the argillic horizon within the first 57 hrs over the following 79 hrs the tracer plume exhibited steady lateral movement towards the drainage ditch within a more permeable sandy horizon situated just below the argillic a spatial moment analysis of logarithmic changes in conductivity in the sand layer revealed seepage velocities ranging from 0 0027 to 0 0482 m d 1 these values were positively correlated with hydraulic gradients suggesting laminar flow processes typical of sandy aquifers increasing groundwater velocities with hydraulic gradients suggest that solute transfers from groundwater to ditch are likely to be faster in storms especially during wet periods even so predominantly slow lateral transport within the sandy horizon even during storms indicates that critical source areas of pollutant loss are likely within a few meters of the ditch

terrain with shallow soils burt and mcdonnell 2015 comparably fewer studies have examined hydrological processes in low relief settings where topography is not the main driver of runoff generation anderson and kneale 1982 devito et al 2005 recently several studies have examined runoff mechanisms du et al 2016 zimmer and mcglynn 2017a hydrologic connectivity klaus et al 2015 and stream groundwater interactions zimmer and mcglynn 2017b in low relief forested watersheds extending this hydrological insight to flat agricultural landscapes would be most advantageous as a defining feature of many flat agroecosystems is open ditch drainage which lowers water tables for crop production and subsequently alters the flow transport and travel times of groundwater within the drainage network dunn and mackay 1996 because ditching often increases subsurface runoff and attendant nonpoint source nutrient losses from agriculture blann et al 2009 it is essential to examine the evolution of subsurface flow pathways that connect agricultural landscapes with ditch drainage waters traditionally subsurface flow paths connecting hillslopes riparian areas and streams have been inferred with point based measurements such as piezometers soil moisture probes and tensiometers blume and van meerveld 2015 for instance burt et al 2002 and vidon and hill 2004 used distributed groundwater level measurements in wells and piezometers to examine the role of water table fluctuations on subsurface processes in stream riparian zones while dense point based monitoring networks have provided much needed insight into the spatial and temporal variability of subsurface flows characterizing finer scale processes like preferential flows through macropores or interflow above soil discontinuities e g restrictive layers has remained difficult blume and van meerveld 2015 in many cases detailed groundwater monitoring has been coupled with conservative anionic tracers such as chloride and bromide to more fully explore the travel times and connectivity of subsurface flow pathways studies of this nature have been conducted across a range of topographic settings including steep hillslopes anderson et al 2009a mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 gentle slopes jackson et al 2016 and in flat terrain campbell et al 1995 for tracer studies in flatter areas an insufficient density of monitoring wells has oftentimes precluded the accurate delineation of groundwater flow paths and the detection of tracer breakthroughs doetsch et al 2012 in these instances near surface geophysics may be a useful complement to distributed groundwater monitoring by wells and lysimeters doetsch et al 2012 parsekian et al 2015 for review electrical resistivity imaging eri is a near surface geophysical method that is increasingly used to non invasively reveal subsurface flow paths singha et al 2014 the strong analogy between fluid flow and electrical charge transport in porous media means that hydrological connectivity can be detected when flow paths are larger than the resolution of the imaging thus eri provides relatively continuous spatial information that overcomes some limitations of traditional methods that require interpolation between sparsely distributed point based measurements time lapse eri can track the evolution of moisture or solute fronts as long as the physical properties of the soil that also influence resistivity remain constant over time when coupled with geoelectric tracers chloride and bromide salts time lapse eri will inform interpretations of shallow groundwater movement cassiani et al 2006 doetsch et al 2012 kobierska et al 2015 preferential flow wehrer et al 2014 wehrer and slater 2015 and tracer travel times for subsurface flow scaini et al 2016 a recent study by lamb et al 2019 paired saline tracer tests with time lapse eri to examine the role of vertical and lateral subsurface flows in a sloping agricultural field with tile drainage clearly the application of time lapse eri in studies of subsurface processes continues to expand singha et al 2014 with artificially drained agricultural landscapes receiving greater attention still the use of time lapse eri to reveal the generation travel time and hydrologic connectivity of subsurface flows in ditch drained landscapes remains nascent to date low relief agroecosystems on the lower delmarva peninsula present a unique opportunity to assess time lapse eri and tracers in the context of open ditch drainage many ditch drained landscapes on the lower delmarva are situated in extremely flat terrain slopes generally 3 consequently subsurface flow represents the prevailing source of water to ditches supplying more than 90 of ditch discharge during storm events kleinman et al 2007 even so evidence of the specific hydrological processes involved in subsurface runoff generation in the vicinity of drainage ditches remains piecemeal at best research with intact soil columns suggests finely textured soils on the lower delmarva are prone to rapid preferential flow through macropores kleinman et al 2015a b while point based monitoring with piezometers indicates the potential for perched lateral flow atop restrictive soil horizons e g clay rich argillic layers and shallow subsurface flow through coarser underlying sands vadas et al 2007 indeed one means for synthesizing these disparate lines of hydrologic evidence is to conduct tracer injection experiments sharpley et al 2015 by pairing time lapse eri studies of tracer transport with hydrometric data we aim to paint a more complete picture of subsurface flow processes in the vicinity of drainage ditches on the lower delmarva peninsula in this study we highlight the advantages of using time lapse eri to monitor the rainfall induced migration of surface applied salt tracers near an intermittent drainage ditch on maryland s lower eastern shore we collected highly detailed time lapse eri datasets during a wintertime storm event when antecedent conditions were nearly saturated wet antecedent conditions favored a hydrologically connected state that would be conducive to vertical and lateral flows grayson et al 1997 which was critical to the success of the experiment specific study objectives were to i examine the spatial extent and structure of subsurface flow paths in 2d 3d and 4d and ii estimate the travel times of subsurface runoff between the cropped field and the ditch overall the study reveals that wet hydrologically connected states offer ideal conditions during which time lapse eri and conservative tracers can be used to study the temporal and spatial evolution of vertical and lateral flows in ditch drained landscapes 2 site description our study was conducted at the university of maryland eastern shore umes research and teaching farm hereafter the farm which is located on the lower delmarva peninsula near princess anne md fig 1 the climate of the region is humid and subtropical with mean annual temperatures approaching 14 1 c and annual rainfall averaging 109 7 cm during the thirty year period from 1981 to 2010 prism climate group 2017 land surface elevations range from 1 4 to 8 3 m above mean sea level and the topography is flat with 95 of the farm having slopes of 3 or less based on 1 m lidar data seasonal high water tables are often within 0 25 m of the land surface and the majority of soils on the farm 89 are poorly to very poorly drained silt loams and sandy loams as a result open ditch drainage in and around the farm is widespread 2 1 selection of time lapse eri site we established a 72 m2 plot in close proximity to an ephemeral drainage ditch for time lapse eri experiments with salt tracers topographic surveys using a total station of the 72 m2 plot found a slope of about 1 5 the plot was aligned parallel to the prevailing flow direction of surficial groundwater in the field which is generally orthogonal to the drainage ditch during non storm periods the plot size and dimensions 11 5 m by 6 2 m attempted to balance our ability to characterize flow and transport with hydrometric measurements over a sufficient area near the ditch while still having adequate resolution for eri to detect changes in bulk conductivity associated with preferential flows the agricultural drainage and soil conditions on the farm are characteristic of the lower delmarva peninsula the open drainage ditch downgradient of the 72 m2 plot drains the southern border of a 1 5 ha cropped field the field is managed with conventional tillage and planted with grain corn and soybeans in a two year rotation fig 1 bottom panel soils at the site primarily belong to the quindocqua series see table 1 for general soil properties which occupy 63 of the farm quindocqua soils feature 25 cm of loamy topsoils underlain by an argillic horizon btg1 and btg2 horizons that typically extends from 25 to 80 cm below the surface beneath the argillic horizon lies an extensive layer of fine sand the argillic horizon likely acts as a restrictive feature that greatly inhibits vertical water movement and is therefore thought to play an important role in perched water table development and shallow interflow generation at the site vadas et al 2007 regional groundwater primarily flows through the sandy horizons below the argillic layer 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrometric and climate monitoring the farm features an established network of hydrometric monitoring sites that supported our eri experiments a campbell scientific climate station fig 1 top panel recorded precipitation measurements every 5 min using a met one instruments model 385 tipping bucket rain gauge connected to a campbell cr10x datalogger the upper and lower ends of the ditch draining the 1 5 ha field were equipped with 1 m h flumes that measured stage height every 5 min with a handar incremental shaft encoder model 436b connected to a campbell cr10x datalogger the 1 5 ha field also featured a network of piezometers installed at depths ranging from 0 25 to 3 m rising head slug tests in sixteen piezometers near the eri site indicated saturated hydraulic conductivities of 0 27 m d 1 in the argillic horizon to 0 59 m d 1 in sandy subsoil horizons based on the methods of hvorslev 1951 we established five pairs fig 2 a of shallow 0 25 m and deep 1 m piezometers within the 72 m2 plot fig 2b deep piezometers were equipped with decagon ctd 10 sensors that measured water level mm water temperature c and electrical conductivity ms cm 1 hydraulic heads in the deep piezometers were determined by referencing all depth to groundwater values to a common elevation datum shallow piezometers had a decagon es 2 sensor that provided added measurements of electrical conductivity during periods of elevated groundwater volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 soil temperature c and bulk electrical conductivity ms cm 1 were monitored at depths of 0 13 and 0 63 m approximate midpoints of the two upper soil horizons using decagon 5te sensors installed adjacent to the four outer monitoring stations fig 2b all sensors were connected to decagon em50 dataloggers and recorded data at 5 min intervals see fig 3 3 2 electrical resistivity imaging eri electrical resistivity the inverse of electrical conductivity quantifies how strongly a material opposes the flow of an electric current in porous media it is controlled by moisture content pore water fluid conductivity temperature and physical properties of the soil such as porosity and or mineral grain size electrical resistivity imaging eri is an active source geophysical method that typically uses two electrodes to inject a low frequency direct current dc into the ground and measure the resulting voltage drop between two other receiving electrodes binley 2015 for review the eri grid consisted of 192 stainless steel surface electrodes within the 72 m2 plot arranged in 8 rows of 24 electrodes fig 2a within each row electrodes were spaced 0 5 m apart and adjacent rows were spaced 1 m apart the electrode grid was oriented such that the downgradient flow towards the ditch was along each row fig 2a a secured storage shed housed a resistivity imaging system iris instruments france four marine batteries and a rugged laptop computer that could be accessed remotely the storage shed was raised with corner cinderblocks so overland flow was unimpeded during storms we collected an eri sequence of 14 785 measurements for each survey using a dipole dipole configuration which is where the current injection electrode pair are offset from the voltage recording electrode pairs by an integer multiplier of the electrode spacing this configuration permitted rapid data acquisition using the iris system moreover the dipole dipole configuration has been shown to resolve vertical contrasts in resistivity more effectively than other conventional electrode configurations such as wenner binley and kemna 2005 this system enabled us to track the lateral and vertical migration of conductivity changes toward the ditch by examining temporal conductivity changes in the soil it was important to minimize the time over which each survey was collected while maximizing the number of measurements for better current density coverage decreasing data acquisition times reduces temporal smearing which can have a more pronounced effect during high rainfall intensities contact resistances were checked for consistency 3 kω before each scheduling of measurements we assessed data noise with reciprocal analysis koestel et al 2008 slater et al 2000 using a set of reciprocal measurements i e the current and receiving electrodes were interchanged collected before and after each storm any measurement with a reciprocal error greater than 10 was removed reciprocal error is defined as δ v 1 δ v 2 where subscripts 1 and 2 represent the normal and reciprocal measurement respectively data quality was high for this site using the above criterion greater than 90 of the original measurements on average remained in each dataset 3 2 1 modeling and inversion conductivity models of the subsurface were computed using e4d johnson 2014 which is a 4d modeling and inversion code designed to run on distributed memory parallelized high computing linux systems the code uses an unstructured tetrahedral finite element mesh to discretize the field space refinement mesh points were added near each electrode location to reduce numerical errors lowry et al 1989 the total number of mesh elements was 828 156 even with mesh refinement the finite element mesh inherently causes numerical errors using a homogeneous earth any measurement with a numerical modeling error greater than 3 was filtered from the dataset before inverse modeling inverse methods are used to solve for a distribution of bulk electrical conductivity that best fits the field observations the eri inverse problem is inherently underdetermined i e non unique such that fitting the data alone can produce a variety of models some unrealistic to limit the models that can fit the data the inverse problem is typically posed as a regularized optimization problem an objective function φ is formulated that seeks to optimize the tradeoff between the data misfit φ d and model structure φ m controlled by a regularization coefficient β binley and kemna 2005 sasaki 1994 1 φ φ d α β φ m where 2 φ d w d d f m 2 3 φ m w m m m r e f 2 in eq 1 and 2 φ d is a measure of the difference between d and the calculated data f m from the estimated bulk electrical conductivity distribution m w d is a data weight matrix to account for error in the observations binley 2015 in eq 1 and 3 φ m is a measure of the model complexity in m and is a penalty term that minimizes unrealistic model structure m r e f is a previous model solution the matrix w m describes the similarity between neighboring mesh elements making up m the formulation shown in eq 3 uses an l2 norm which smoothes the bulk electrical conductivity between neighboring model parameters for this experiment it is reasonable to assume that the migration of tracer represents a smooth conductivity transition while there is a propensity for preferential pathways the resolution of the bulk eri measurement and the mesh discretization are not sufficient to capture individual pathways which can be centimeters wide using a smoothness model constraint eq 3 we assume that the visualized model has at least the amount of structure imaged a time lapse eri inversion was performed and a common post filtering was applied to each dataset in the series to obtain a common sequence of measurements this allowed the sensitivity structure across the time series to remain constant a background conductivity structure was inverted from a baseline dataset using smoothness constraints between neighboring elements the next dataset in the series was inverted for changes from the background conductivity structure m r e f in eq 3 while incorporating a smoothness constraint in time each subsequent dataset in the time series was inverted for changes from the previous time step incorporating smoothness time constraints inverting for changes from a previous time step allowed the conductivity structure to vary smoothly over the time series johnson 2014 3 2 2 spatial moment analysis spatial moments were used to estimate average seepage velocities this type of analysis has been used to track 3d movement of a tracer using concentration data e g freyberg 1986 rajaram and gelhar 1991 and has been extended to analyze eri conductivity models singha and gorelick 2005 spatial moments analysis uses time lapse changes in conductivity in logarithmic scale from a background model and focuses on the zeroth and first order moments the zeroth moment is the sum of all conductivity changes the first order moment normalized by the zeroth order moment yields the center of the change in conductivity in y and z directions singha and gorelick 2005 noted that regularization and artifacts in the eri inversion can adversely impact the spatial moments however these can be decreased when considering time lapse changes koestel et al 2009 once the center of conductivity change is known seepage velocities are computed using the 3d distance between two centers and dividing by the time elapsed which is the time difference between two data acquisition times compared to seepage velocities from sparse groundwater sampling measurements the estimates from this analysis are less likely to yield localized values 3 3 tracer test design during natural rainfall events a conservative conductive tracer was combined with time lapse eri to image subsurface hydrologic flow pathways that connected the 1 5 ha field with the ditch during storms while infiltration of precipitation will increase subsurface bulk conductivities addition of the tracer provided a more pronounced contrast at least one order of magnitude higher compared with the addition of precipitation alone the tracer test was conducted during a natural rain event table 2 that occurred in mid february 2016 we distributed 5 kg of analytical grade potassium bromide kbr evenly across and within a shallow trench 5 m long 0 20 m wide 0 25 m deep that was backfilled with pea gravel 2 cm diameter the purpose of the trench was to ensure tracer injection in the topsoil horizon just above the argillic layer favoring subsurface rather than overland transport reuter et al 1998 during storms it was assumed that infiltrating rainfall would dissolve the kbr tracer the exact amount of tracer dissolution input to the subsurface was unknown and that fluid containing the dissolved kbr would travel through the subsurface governed mainly by advective dispersive transport ultimately the goal of the natural tracer experiment was to characterize as thoroughly as possible the spatial and temporal development of vertical and lateral flow paths under natural rainfall conditions e g anderson et al 2009b time lapse eri datasets collected during the natural storm event were referenced against a background eri dataset collected prior to the storm in order to represent the effects of tracer addition in the subsurface 4 results 4 1 hydrometric and climatic observations the winter of 2016 was preceded by an abnormally dry fall with infrequent rainfall events increasingly frequent precipitation during the winter months of december 2015 to february 2016 resulted in a wet up period during which water tables rose and soil moisture levels regularly exceeded 0 3 m3 m 3 saturation ratio 75 especially during storms soil moisture levels at 0 63 m were nearly saturated saturation ratio 90 from january 2016 onward in response to shallow water tables that often remained within 0 5 m of the surface moreover wet wintertime soil conditions and the prevalence of positive hydraulic gradients from field to ditch often led to hydrologically connected states preceding most of the storms that happened during this period all wintertime precipitation events including the storm we monitored in february 2016 had recurrence intervals of about one year 4 2 background conductivity structure from eri a background eri dataset was collected in march 2015 prior to trench construction tracer addition in order to image the subsurface conductivity structure associated with the lithology three distinct layers are visible in 2d cross sections fig 4 a top conductive layer approximately 0 50 m thick a middle less conductive layer roughly 1 5 m thick and a bottom layer beginning at about 2 5 m depth this matches well with the conceptual soil profile fig 2b table 1 and conductivities are consistent with the site stratigraphy the sensitivity of the eri measurements to the data is highest in the middle of the grid away from the edges at depth i e higher density of measurements the sensitivity matrix was computed as an approximation of model resolution kemna 2000 fig 4 is from the region of the model with the highest sensitivity 4 3 time lapse characterization during a natural storm event 4 3 1 eri noise level assessment time lapse eri inversions can create image artifacts adjacent to areas of strong decreases in resistivity which are common in areas with a highly heterogeneous subsurface e g miller et al 2008 in order to focus the time lapse eri inversion results on changes caused from the infiltration of rainwater and or rainwater combined with kbr we show increases in conductivity from a background conductivity structure time lapse analysis of five eri datasets collected at 12 hour intervals 6 days after any significant rainfall from april 18 20 2016 i e during dry non changing conditions revealed temperature dependent changes in the surface conductivity fig s1 at depths greater than 1 m the images showed no changes above a lower threshold equal to 5 7 this threshold was therefore set as the lower limit of resistivity change to display in the eri time lapse results below 4 3 2 eri of salt plume during a natural storm event three eri time lapse images fig 5 b d are presented at times denoted by dashed vertical black lines in the hydrologic data plots fig 5a these images are oriented along cross section b b refer to fig 2a where the groundwater flow direction is from left to right in the images the trench is towards the left side of the electrode grid and the ditch is on the right hand side the color scale is a logarithmic change in conductivity from the background dataset the lower limit equal to 0 024 s m 1 s m 1 is equivalent to an increase from the background conductivity of 5 7 as per the noise level assessment the february 2016 storm event is shown in fig 5 and the background time reference for this series is 22 feb 2016 07 32 five kg of kbr were added to the trench shortly after the background time reference and therefore all images in the series depict a high logarithmic conductivity change in the region surrounding the trench fig 5b d depict a slow progression of the tracer through the subsurface to about 2 m depth which emanated from a vertically oriented preferential pathway connecting the topsoil layer with the sandy soils below the argillic horizon notably this pathway appears slightly offset from the trench location hydraulic loading was highest in fig 5c following the addition of 19 6 mm of precipitation on 25 feb 2016 table 2 even so spatial fluctuations in logarithmic conductivity did not extensively change during the time period depicted in fig 5c spatial changes at depth were more extensive 80 h later fig 5d even though there was no additional precipitation given the logarithmic conductivity changes in fig 5c d occurred below the water table we assumed these changes were mainly due to advection related to the natural groundwater gradient to further examine tracer transport information in the eri models absolute conductivity for depths 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 m is plotted for four locations downstream of the trench fig 6 over the time of the data acquisition the x axis in fig 6 is the time since the tracer was input to the trench and corresponds to the time steps in the acquired datasets which is the discretization of the color scale in fig 7 see below filled in markers along a depth plot represent the first time step for which the change in conductivity exceeds 5 7 from background conductivities i e above noise levels representing definitive tracer arrival location a shows a decrease in conductivity at the beginning of the data acquisition which we presume are artifacts in the time lapse inversion due to close proximity to the infiltrating tracer which is an area with a high increase in conductivity conductivities at location b remain fairly constant at all depths and exceed noise levels at 3 m and 112 h after the tracer was input location c which is adjacent to the trench exceeds noise levels soon after the precipitation event occurs refer to fig 5a and exhibits a pattern of progressively later tracer arrivals with increasing depth location d shows late breakthrough of the tracer at depths of 2 5 and 3 m fig 7 shows the estimated first arrival time of tracer i e the first time step in the data series where the increase in logarithmic conductivity exceeds 5 7 above background across the eri plot for depth slices ranging from 1 5 m to 4 m each circle pixel represents a center location around which logarithmic changes in conductivity from background 5 7 were spatially averaged to account for the variable cell size in the unstructured mesh the pixel averaging was done across 0 5 m in the x direction and 0 25 m in the y direction corresponding to half the electrode spacing in both directions making the spatial resolution of each pixel equal to the electrode spacing no increases in conductivity 5 7 were detected below 4 m fig 7 reveals the distribution of changes in conductivity across the eri plot which is representative of tracer first arrival times while tracer arrives early local to the trench tracer arrival is not spread evenly along the trench axis with the region immediately downgradient of the trench showing more rapid infiltration of the tracer moreover the region of downward tracer propagation shown in fig 5 becomes progressively smaller in size as depth increases from 1 5 to 3 m fig 7a d suggesting the potential for preferential transport in addition to the small area of early tracer breakthrough at 3 m spatially extensive tracer transport is evidenced by changes in conductivity that exceed 5 7 within most of the plot between the trench and the ditch at this depth the predominate direction of tracer transport is captured by the distribution of first arrival times between the trench and the ditch at depths of 2 5 m and greater the tracer plume exhibits fairly uniform lateral movement toward the drainage ditch 4 4 spatial moment analysis and supporting evidence the spatial moment analysis was performed on logarithmic conductivity changes deeper than 1 m to focus on transport in the deeper sand layer where tracer transport towards the ditch was captured in the eri images figs 5 7 fig 8 shows the estimated changes in seepage velocity from the spatial moment analysis alongside precipitation over the course of the storm the color scale denotes travel time days for tracer to travel 11 m being the distance from the ditch to the trench travel time is inversely proportional to seepage velocity with the highest seepage velocities concurrent with or shortly following intense rainfall bursts the maximum estimated seepage velocity was 0 0482 m d 1 during times of no or minimal precipitation 1 mm groundwater travel times from the trench to the ditch easily exceeded one year continuous electrical conductivity measurements in soils and shallow groundwater provided supporting evidence for the spatial moment analyses from eri fig s2 using wilcoxon signed rank tests we compared the median electrical conductivity of soil 0 13 m sensor in topsoil and 0 63 m sensor in the argillic horizon and groundwater 0 25 and 1 m piezometers for two time periods five months before kbr tracer was added 25 mar 2015 to 30 sep 2015 and five months afterward 29 feb 2016 to 30 jun 2016 while we saw no significant changes in the electrical conductivity of soil topsoil and argillic horizons or shallow 0 25 m groundwater in response to kbr application data not shown electrical conductivity of deeper groundwater increased significantly following kbr application in three of the five 1 m piezometers aligned through the center of the eri plot about 3 7 m downgradient of the trench fig s2 thus tracer transport does not appear to be occurring in the upper soil horizons but instead occurs mostly in the sand layer as indicated by the eri images 5 discussion 5 1 characterizing subsurface flow paths with time lapse eri combining eri with a conservative tracer enabled us to delineate spatiotemporal changes in conductivity as a function of hydraulic loading at a ditch drained agricultural field site during wet conditions typical of winter and spring just prior to the february storm a shallow water table maintained near saturation in the topsoil saturation ratio 78 and argillic saturation ratio 95 horizons and the presence of ditch baseflow suggested some initial hydrologic connectivity with groundwater subsurface transport towards the ditch primarily occurred within the cg fine sand soil horizon the eri showed consistent changes in logarithmic conductivity in the sand layer as a direct result of hydraulic loading and addition of tracer figs 5 and 8 and these changes were supported by increases in the electrical conductivity of groundwater in the three 1 m piezometers aligned across the center of the plot fig s2 the first eri images fig 5a taken shortly after an intense rainfall burst on 24 feb indicated the tracer moved laterally a short distance before migrating quickly downward through the argillic horizon and into the underlying sand fig 5b this is supported by the 4d transport depicted in fig 7b d down to 3 m depth vertical percolation in the eri plot could have been facilitated by macropores below the resolution of eri in the argillic horizon fig 5c which are prevalent in quindocqua kleinman et al 2015a b and similarly fine textured soils toor and sims 2015 on the farm or possibly by periglacial features that are common to the delmarva region losco et al 2010 small hydraulic conductivity contrasts between the topsoil and argillic layers table 1 coupled with the flat terrain support the idea of very short downslope travel distances prior to percolation du et al 2016 klaus and jackson 2018 once the tracer reached the sandy layer it then migrated laterally toward the ditch fig 5b d and 7 therefore while discontinuities in the argillic horizon enabled vertical hydrologic transfers it was the uniform lateral movement of groundwater through sandy subsoils that appeared to be the main pathway by which water and solutes moved from the field to the drainage ditch this conclusion mostly concurs with prior work on the farm by vadas et al 2007 and kleinman et al 2007 although in our study lateral flows seemed to occur mostly in the sandy horizon where sufficient hydraulic gradients prevailed and not as interflow above the flatter argillic layer as previously hypothesized in these studies as shown here time lapse eri has distinct benefits over these earlier point based monitoring approaches as it can reveal a more complete picture of the continua of subsurface flow paths connecting the field and the ditch 5 2 inferring lateral subsurface flow rates with spatial moment analysis spatial moment analysis of eri data provided important insights into the velocity of shallow groundwater flow at the farm lateral seepage velocities i e velocities in open pore space in the sandy layer ranged from 0 0027 to 0 0482 m d 1 with center coordinates in the direction of the ditch over time few if any studies have assessed the temporal and spatial variation of seepage velocities during short duration storm events in low gradient watersheds even so average seepage velocities at the farm were generally similar to other coastal plain settings where longer duration tracer studies have been conducted with piezometers in surficial sandy aquifers for instance bosch et al 1994 estimated linear groundwater velocities of 0 01 0 03 m d 1 through a loamy sand soil in the riparian area of a flat 1 5 slope watershed in georgia s gulf atlantic coastal plain elsewhere a salt tracer study by campbell et al 1995 in florida s coastal plain region reported plume velocities of 0 02 0 12 m d 1 at several low gradient 0 1 1 7 slope sites with sandy soils seepage velocities and the magnitude of the measured hydraulic gradient exhibited a significant positive correlation fig 9 positive relationships between seepage velocity and hydraulic gradient are generally expected in fine sandy aquifers where darcian flow conditions are likely to prevail soni et al 1978 notably the february storm was relatively small with low hydraulic gradients 0 05 as such it remains unclear if the linear correlation between seepage velocity and hydraulic gradient would hold for larger less frequent storm events even so the observed increases in seepage velocity with hydraulic gradient clearly indicate that solute transfers in shallow groundwater are likely to be faster in storms during wet periods seepage velocities from the spatial moment analysis on eri data also afforded an opportunity to estimate solute travel times in the vicinity of the ditch for instance travel times from the trench to the ditch distance 11 m ranged from just under a year 359 days at the height of the storm to about 5 years 1827 days at the base of the recession period fig 9 thus even during stormflow periods subsurface transport of water and dissolved solutes is likely to be slow notably sanford et al 2012 showed that groundwater return times i e travel times from the point of groundwater recharge to the point of discharge in streams could range from 10 to 50 years in near stream areas in the middle and lower regions of the delmarva if we assume the middle of the field 40 m from the ditch represents the groundwater divide then travel times from the point of recharge in the surficial aquifer to the point of discharge in the ditch could take roughly 20 years on average range 4 years during stormflow to 38 years during baseflow recession which is reasonable given the findings of sanford et al 2012 5 3 applicability of time lapse eri to other storm events a separate storm event from 29 sept 2015 to 06 oct 2015 was imaged using eri and kbr as a tracer in the same experimental setup as described for the february storm relative to the february storm fig 5a antecedent conditions for the october storm were 36 drier saturation ratio 54 while the total precipitation was three fold greater 82 mm fig 10 a similar to fig 5 changes in conductivity indicate tracer transport from the trench towards the ditch fig 10b d however large conductivity changes are imaged near the surface in response to the increased precipitation rate the kbr tracer was added to the trench after an initial burst of precipitation on 29 sep 2015 see green arrow in fig 10a therefore it was unclear if the cause of the increases in conductivity below the argillic horizon were from the tracer alone or were associated with soil saturation processes brought on by the prior precipitation we postulate that antecedent conditions may regulate tracer transport dynamics in these flat landscapes with wetter conditions raising the likelihood of hydrologically connected flows however additional experiments under controlled conditions are necessary to formulate a more complete model of flow and transport processes in this low relief agroecosystem 5 4 implications for nutrient fate and transport time lapse eri of tracer transport during the february storm revealed rapid downward transfers to groundwater followed by slow groundwater movement towards the drainage ditch this series of subsurface hydrological processes has important implications for nutrient fate and transport on the farm as well as in similar flat ditch drained fields found throughout the lower delmarva for instance the ditch in this study drained cropped fields that had regularly received poultry litter and commercial fertilizers activities that have produced substantial nitrogen n legacies in groundwater tesoriero et al 2013 and phosphorus p legacies in soils sharpley et al 2013 because the surficial aquifer underlying the farm possesses persistently elevated nitrate n concentrations mean 27 mg n l 1 travel times on the order of years to decades imply long lag times between changes in nutrient management on the farm and water quality response sanford and pope 2013 moreover even though time lapse eri confirmed the importance of rapid vertical percolation during storms a process that quickly mobilizes legacy soil p and leaches it to shallow groundwater kleinman et al 2015a b lateral transport primarily occurred in the sandy aquifer where slow travel times prevailed as such critical source areas of p transfers are likely to be within a few m of the drainage ditch during storm events that last several days vadas et al 2007 and could possibly extend to 10 m from the ditch on annual time scales in which successive storms incrementally mobilize and transport p in subsurface flow future studies that combine reactive nutrient tracers with saline tracers are needed to help refine these inferences as the transport of reactive solutes is likely to be inhibited relative to conservative solutes due to uptake and release processes that affect nutrients in soils 6 conclusions time lapse eri of tracer transport allowed for a more complete 4d picture of subsurface flow evolution in the vicinity of open ditches draining flat agricultural fields typical of the lower delmarva peninsula images of changes in conductivity after a wintertime storm event under wet antecedent conditions revealed vertical transport through a shallow argillic horizon followed by lateral subsurface transport within a lower more permeable cg sand horizon hydrometric datasets provided important supporting information to the eri seepage velocities allowing for inferences of flow and transport processes travel times inferred from eri seepage velocities matched previous estimates and showed that solute movement was generally slow 20 years within these artificially drained agroecosystems as such critical source areas of pollutant loss in flat ditch drained landscapes are likely to be within a few m of drainage

5466,time lapse electrical resistivity imaging eri combined with salt tracers can enhance our understanding of subsurface flow and transport in ditch drained agroecosystems in a nearly level field adjacent to a drainage ditch we installed 192 electrodes in a 72 m2 plot along with five hydrometric stations to enable time lapse eri monitoring during storms immediately prior to a wintertime rainstorm we applied 5 kg of kbr to a shallow trench located roughly 11 m upgradient from the ditch antecedent conditions prior to the storm were wet assuring a hydrologically connected state that favored tracer dissolution and movement in the subsurface we monitored the evolution of the tracer plume with eri over a seven day period four dimensional 4d delineation of precipitation and tracer transport using time lapse eri showed that the tracer plume moved preferentially downward through a discontinuity in the argillic horizon within the first 57 hrs over the following 79 hrs the tracer plume exhibited steady lateral movement towards the drainage ditch within a more permeable sandy horizon situated just below the argillic a spatial moment analysis of logarithmic changes in conductivity in the sand layer revealed seepage velocities ranging from 0 0027 to 0 0482 m d 1 these values were positively correlated with hydraulic gradients suggesting laminar flow processes typical of sandy aquifers increasing groundwater velocities with hydraulic gradients suggest that solute transfers from groundwater to ditch are likely to be faster in storms especially during wet periods even so predominantly slow lateral transport within the sandy horizon even during storms indicates that critical source areas of pollutant loss are likely within a few meters of the ditch keywords time lapse electrical resistivity imaging eri first arrival times seepage velocities delmarva peninsula 1 introduction experimental studies in watersheds are central to understanding the evolution of hydrological flow pathways that link agricultural landscapes riparian areas and streams to date our knowledge of runoff generation largely stems from hillslope studies done in steep terrain with shallow soils burt and mcdonnell 2015 comparably fewer studies have examined hydrological processes in low relief settings where topography is not the main driver of runoff generation anderson and kneale 1982 devito et al 2005 recently several studies have examined runoff mechanisms du et al 2016 zimmer and mcglynn 2017a hydrologic connectivity klaus et al 2015 and stream groundwater interactions zimmer and mcglynn 2017b in low relief forested watersheds extending this hydrological insight to flat agricultural landscapes would be most advantageous as a defining feature of many flat agroecosystems is open ditch drainage which lowers water tables for crop production and subsequently alters the flow transport and travel times of groundwater within the drainage network dunn and mackay 1996 because ditching often increases subsurface runoff and attendant nonpoint source nutrient losses from agriculture blann et al 2009 it is essential to examine the evolution of subsurface flow pathways that connect agricultural landscapes with ditch drainage waters traditionally subsurface flow paths connecting hillslopes riparian areas and streams have been inferred with point based measurements such as piezometers soil moisture probes and tensiometers blume and van meerveld 2015 for instance burt et al 2002 and vidon and hill 2004 used distributed groundwater level measurements in wells and piezometers to examine the role of water table fluctuations on subsurface processes in stream riparian zones while dense point based monitoring networks have provided much needed insight into the spatial and temporal variability of subsurface flows characterizing finer scale processes like preferential flows through macropores or interflow above soil discontinuities e g restrictive layers has remained difficult blume and van meerveld 2015 in many cases detailed groundwater monitoring has been coupled with conservative anionic tracers such as chloride and bromide to more fully explore the travel times and connectivity of subsurface flow pathways studies of this nature have been conducted across a range of topographic settings including steep hillslopes anderson et al 2009a mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 gentle slopes jackson et al 2016 and in flat terrain campbell et al 1995 for tracer studies in flatter areas an insufficient density of monitoring wells has oftentimes precluded the accurate delineation of groundwater flow paths and the detection of tracer breakthroughs doetsch et al 2012 in these instances near surface geophysics may be a useful complement to distributed groundwater monitoring by wells and lysimeters doetsch et al 2012 parsekian et al 2015 for review electrical resistivity imaging eri is a near surface geophysical method that is increasingly used to non invasively reveal subsurface flow paths singha et al 2014 the strong analogy between fluid flow and electrical charge transport in porous media means that hydrological connectivity can be detected when flow paths are larger than the resolution of the imaging thus eri provides relatively continuous spatial information that overcomes some limitations of traditional methods that require interpolation between sparsely distributed point based measurements time lapse eri can track the evolution of moisture or solute fronts as long as the physical properties of the soil that also influence resistivity remain constant over time when coupled with geoelectric tracers chloride and bromide salts time lapse eri will inform interpretations of shallow groundwater movement cassiani et al 2006 doetsch et al 2012 kobierska et al 2015 preferential flow wehrer et al 2014 wehrer and slater 2015 and tracer travel times for subsurface flow scaini et al 2016 a recent study by lamb et al 2019 paired saline tracer tests with time lapse eri to examine the role of vertical and lateral subsurface flows in a sloping agricultural field with tile drainage clearly the application of time lapse eri in studies of subsurface processes continues to expand singha et al 2014 with artificially drained agricultural landscapes receiving greater attention still the use of time lapse eri to reveal the generation travel time and hydrologic connectivity of subsurface flows in ditch drained landscapes remains nascent to date low relief agroecosystems on the lower delmarva peninsula present a unique opportunity to assess time lapse eri and tracers in the context of open ditch drainage many ditch drained landscapes on the lower delmarva are situated in extremely flat terrain slopes generally 3 consequently subsurface flow represents the prevailing source of water to ditches supplying more than 90 of ditch discharge during storm events kleinman et al 2007 even so evidence of the specific hydrological processes involved in subsurface runoff generation in the vicinity of drainage ditches remains piecemeal at best research with intact soil columns suggests finely textured soils on the lower delmarva are prone to rapid preferential flow through macropores kleinman et al 2015a b while point based monitoring with piezometers indicates the potential for perched lateral flow atop restrictive soil horizons e g clay rich argillic layers and shallow subsurface flow through coarser underlying sands vadas et al 2007 indeed one means for synthesizing these disparate lines of hydrologic evidence is to conduct tracer injection experiments sharpley et al 2015 by pairing time lapse eri studies of tracer transport with hydrometric data we aim to paint a more complete picture of subsurface flow processes in the vicinity of drainage ditches on the lower delmarva peninsula in this study we highlight the advantages of using time lapse eri to monitor the rainfall induced migration of surface applied salt tracers near an intermittent drainage ditch on maryland s lower eastern shore we collected highly detailed time lapse eri datasets during a wintertime storm event when antecedent conditions were nearly saturated wet antecedent conditions favored a hydrologically connected state that would be conducive to vertical and lateral flows grayson et al 1997 which was critical to the success of the experiment specific study objectives were to i examine the spatial extent and structure of subsurface flow paths in 2d 3d and 4d and ii estimate the travel times of subsurface runoff between the cropped field and the ditch overall the study reveals that wet hydrologically connected states offer ideal conditions during which time lapse eri and conservative tracers can be used to study the temporal and spatial evolution of vertical and lateral flows in ditch drained landscapes 2 site description our study was conducted at the university of maryland eastern shore umes research and teaching farm hereafter the farm which is located on the lower delmarva peninsula near princess anne md fig 1 the climate of the region is humid and subtropical with mean annual temperatures approaching 14 1 c and annual rainfall averaging 109 7 cm during the thirty year period from 1981 to 2010 prism climate group 2017 land surface elevations range from 1 4 to 8 3 m above mean sea level and the topography is flat with 95 of the farm having slopes of 3 or less based on 1 m lidar data seasonal high water tables are often within 0 25 m of the land surface and the majority of soils on the farm 89 are poorly to very poorly drained silt loams and sandy loams as a result open ditch drainage in and around the farm is widespread 2 1 selection of time lapse eri site we established a 72 m2 plot in close proximity to an ephemeral drainage ditch for time lapse eri experiments with salt tracers topographic surveys using a total station of the 72 m2 plot found a slope of about 1 5 the plot was aligned parallel to the prevailing flow direction of surficial groundwater in the field which is generally orthogonal to the drainage ditch during non storm periods the plot size and dimensions 11 5 m by 6 2 m attempted to balance our ability to characterize flow and transport with hydrometric measurements over a sufficient area near the ditch while still having adequate resolution for eri to detect changes in bulk conductivity associated with preferential flows the agricultural drainage and soil conditions on the farm are characteristic of the lower delmarva peninsula the open drainage ditch downgradient of the 72 m2 plot drains the southern border of a 1 5 ha cropped field the field is managed with conventional tillage and planted with grain corn and soybeans in a two year rotation fig 1 bottom panel soils at the site primarily belong to the quindocqua series see table 1 for general soil properties which occupy 63 of the farm quindocqua soils feature 25 cm of loamy topsoils underlain by an argillic horizon btg1 and btg2 horizons that typically extends from 25 to 80 cm below the surface beneath the argillic horizon lies an extensive layer of fine sand the argillic horizon likely acts as a restrictive feature that greatly inhibits vertical water movement and is therefore thought to play an important role in perched water table development and shallow interflow generation at the site vadas et al 2007 regional groundwater primarily flows through the sandy horizons below the argillic layer 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrometric and climate monitoring the farm features an established network of hydrometric monitoring sites that supported our eri experiments a campbell scientific climate station fig 1 top panel recorded precipitation measurements every 5 min using a met one instruments model 385 tipping bucket rain gauge connected to a campbell cr10x datalogger the upper and lower ends of the ditch draining the 1 5 ha field were equipped with 1 m h flumes that measured stage height every 5 min with a handar incremental shaft encoder model 436b connected to a campbell cr10x datalogger the 1 5 ha field also featured a network of piezometers installed at depths ranging from 0 25 to 3 m rising head slug tests in sixteen piezometers near the eri site indicated saturated hydraulic conductivities of 0 27 m d 1 in the argillic horizon to 0 59 m d 1 in sandy subsoil horizons based on the methods of hvorslev 1951 we established five pairs fig 2 a of shallow 0 25 m and deep 1 m piezometers within the 72 m2 plot fig 2b deep piezometers were equipped with decagon ctd 10 sensors that measured water level mm water temperature c and electrical conductivity ms cm 1 hydraulic heads in the deep piezometers were determined by referencing all depth to groundwater values to a common elevation datum shallow piezometers had a decagon es 2 sensor that provided added measurements of electrical conductivity during periods of elevated groundwater volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 soil temperature c and bulk electrical conductivity ms cm 1 were monitored at depths of 0 13 and 0 63 m approximate midpoints of the two upper soil horizons using decagon 5te sensors installed adjacent to the four outer monitoring stations fig 2b all sensors were connected to decagon em50 dataloggers and recorded data at 5 min intervals see fig 3 3 2 electrical resistivity imaging eri electrical resistivity the inverse of electrical conductivity quantifies how strongly a material opposes the flow of an electric current in porous media it is controlled by moisture content pore water fluid conductivity temperature and physical properties of the soil such as porosity and or mineral grain size electrical resistivity imaging eri is an active source geophysical method that typically uses two electrodes to inject a low frequency direct current dc into the ground and measure the resulting voltage drop between two other receiving electrodes binley 2015 for review the eri grid consisted of 192 stainless steel surface electrodes within the 72 m2 plot arranged in 8 rows of 24 electrodes fig 2a within each row electrodes were spaced 0 5 m apart and adjacent rows were spaced 1 m apart the electrode grid was oriented such that the downgradient flow towards the ditch was along each row fig 2a a secured storage shed housed a resistivity imaging system iris instruments france four marine batteries and a rugged laptop computer that could be accessed remotely the storage shed was raised with corner cinderblocks so overland flow was unimpeded during storms we collected an eri sequence of 14 785 measurements for each survey using a dipole dipole configuration which is where the current injection electrode pair are offset from the voltage recording electrode pairs by an integer multiplier of the electrode spacing this configuration permitted rapid data acquisition using the iris system moreover the dipole dipole configuration has been shown to resolve vertical contrasts in resistivity more effectively than other conventional electrode configurations such as wenner binley and kemna 2005 this system enabled us to track the lateral and vertical migration of conductivity changes toward the ditch by examining temporal conductivity changes in the soil it was important to minimize the time over which each survey was collected while maximizing the number of measurements for better current density coverage decreasing data acquisition times reduces temporal smearing which can have a more pronounced effect during high rainfall intensities contact resistances were checked for consistency 3 kω before each scheduling of measurements we assessed data noise with reciprocal analysis koestel et al 2008 slater et al 2000 using a set of reciprocal measurements i e the current and receiving electrodes were interchanged collected before and after each storm any measurement with a reciprocal error greater than 10 was removed reciprocal error is defined as δ v 1 δ v 2 where subscripts 1 and 2 represent the normal and reciprocal measurement respectively data quality was high for this site using the above criterion greater than 90 of the original measurements on average remained in each dataset 3 2 1 modeling and inversion conductivity models of the subsurface were computed using e4d johnson 2014 which is a 4d modeling and inversion code designed to run on distributed memory parallelized high computing linux systems the code uses an unstructured tetrahedral finite element mesh to discretize the field space refinement mesh points were added near each electrode location to reduce numerical errors lowry et al 1989 the total number of mesh elements was 828 156 even with mesh refinement the finite element mesh inherently causes numerical errors using a homogeneous earth any measurement with a numerical modeling error greater than 3 was filtered from the dataset before inverse modeling inverse methods are used to solve for a distribution of bulk electrical conductivity that best fits the field observations the eri inverse problem is inherently underdetermined i e non unique such that fitting the data alone can produce a variety of models some unrealistic to limit the models that can fit the data the inverse problem is typically posed as a regularized optimization problem an objective function φ is formulated that seeks to optimize the tradeoff between the data misfit φ d and model structure φ m controlled by a regularization coefficient β binley and kemna 2005 sasaki 1994 1 φ φ d α β φ m where 2 φ d w d d f m 2 3 φ m w m m m r e f 2 in eq 1 and 2 φ d is a measure of the difference between d and the calculated data f m from the estimated bulk electrical conductivity distribution m w d is a data weight matrix to account for error in the observations binley 2015 in eq 1 and 3 φ m is a measure of the model complexity in m and is a penalty term that minimizes unrealistic model structure m r e f is a previous model solution the matrix w m describes the similarity between neighboring mesh elements making up m the formulation shown in eq 3 uses an l2 norm which smoothes the bulk electrical conductivity between neighboring model parameters for this experiment it is reasonable to assume that the migration of tracer represents a smooth conductivity transition while there is a propensity for preferential pathways the resolution of the bulk eri measurement and the mesh discretization are not sufficient to capture individual pathways which can be centimeters wide using a smoothness model constraint eq 3 we assume that the visualized model has at least the amount of structure imaged a time lapse eri inversion was performed and a common post filtering was applied to each dataset in the series to obtain a common sequence of measurements this allowed the sensitivity structure across the time series to remain constant a background conductivity structure was inverted from a baseline dataset using smoothness constraints between neighboring elements the next dataset in the series was inverted for changes from the background conductivity structure m r e f in eq 3 while incorporating a smoothness constraint in time each subsequent dataset in the time series was inverted for changes from the previous time step incorporating smoothness time constraints inverting for changes from a previous time step allowed the conductivity structure to vary smoothly over the time series johnson 2014 3 2 2 spatial moment analysis spatial moments were used to estimate average seepage velocities this type of analysis has been used to track 3d movement of a tracer using concentration data e g freyberg 1986 rajaram and gelhar 1991 and has been extended to analyze eri conductivity models singha and gorelick 2005 spatial moments analysis uses time lapse changes in conductivity in logarithmic scale from a background model and focuses on the zeroth and first order moments the zeroth moment is the sum of all conductivity changes the first order moment normalized by the zeroth order moment yields the center of the change in conductivity in y and z directions singha and gorelick 2005 noted that regularization and artifacts in the eri inversion can adversely impact the spatial moments however these can be decreased when considering time lapse changes koestel et al 2009 once the center of conductivity change is known seepage velocities are computed using the 3d distance between two centers and dividing by the time elapsed which is the time difference between two data acquisition times compared to seepage velocities from sparse groundwater sampling measurements the estimates from this analysis are less likely to yield localized values 3 3 tracer test design during natural rainfall events a conservative conductive tracer was combined with time lapse eri to image subsurface hydrologic flow pathways that connected the 1 5 ha field with the ditch during storms while infiltration of precipitation will increase subsurface bulk conductivities addition of the tracer provided a more pronounced contrast at least one order of magnitude higher compared with the addition of precipitation alone the tracer test was conducted during a natural rain event table 2 that occurred in mid february 2016 we distributed 5 kg of analytical grade potassium bromide kbr evenly across and within a shallow trench 5 m long 0 20 m wide 0 25 m deep that was backfilled with pea gravel 2 cm diameter the purpose of the trench was to ensure tracer injection in the topsoil horizon just above the argillic layer favoring subsurface rather than overland transport reuter et al 1998 during storms it was assumed that infiltrating rainfall would dissolve the kbr tracer the exact amount of tracer dissolution input to the subsurface was unknown and that fluid containing the dissolved kbr would travel through the subsurface governed mainly by advective dispersive transport ultimately the goal of the natural tracer experiment was to characterize as thoroughly as possible the spatial and temporal development of vertical and lateral flow paths under natural rainfall conditions e g anderson et al 2009b time lapse eri datasets collected during the natural storm event were referenced against a background eri dataset collected prior to the storm in order to represent the effects of tracer addition in the subsurface 4 results 4 1 hydrometric and climatic observations the winter of 2016 was preceded by an abnormally dry fall with infrequent rainfall events increasingly frequent precipitation during the winter months of december 2015 to february 2016 resulted in a wet up period during which water tables rose and soil moisture levels regularly exceeded 0 3 m3 m 3 saturation ratio 75 especially during storms soil moisture levels at 0 63 m were nearly saturated saturation ratio 90 from january 2016 onward in response to shallow water tables that often remained within 0 5 m of the surface moreover wet wintertime soil conditions and the prevalence of positive hydraulic gradients from field to ditch often led to hydrologically connected states preceding most of the storms that happened during this period all wintertime precipitation events including the storm we monitored in february 2016 had recurrence intervals of about one year 4 2 background conductivity structure from eri a background eri dataset was collected in march 2015 prior to trench construction tracer addition in order to image the subsurface conductivity structure associated with the lithology three distinct layers are visible in 2d cross sections fig 4 a top conductive layer approximately 0 50 m thick a middle less conductive layer roughly 1 5 m thick and a bottom layer beginning at about 2 5 m depth this matches well with the conceptual soil profile fig 2b table 1 and conductivities are consistent with the site stratigraphy the sensitivity of the eri measurements to the data is highest in the middle of the grid away from the edges at depth i e higher density of measurements the sensitivity matrix was computed as an approximation of model resolution kemna 2000 fig 4 is from the region of the model with the highest sensitivity 4 3 time lapse characterization during a natural storm event 4 3 1 eri noise level assessment time lapse eri inversions can create image artifacts adjacent to areas of strong decreases in resistivity which are common in areas with a highly heterogeneous subsurface e g miller et al 2008 in order to focus the time lapse eri inversion results on changes caused from the infiltration of rainwater and or rainwater combined with kbr we show increases in conductivity from a background conductivity structure time lapse analysis of five eri datasets collected at 12 hour intervals 6 days after any significant rainfall from april 18 20 2016 i e during dry non changing conditions revealed temperature dependent changes in the surface conductivity fig s1 at depths greater than 1 m the images showed no changes above a lower threshold equal to 5 7 this threshold was therefore set as the lower limit of resistivity change to display in the eri time lapse results below 4 3 2 eri of salt plume during a natural storm event three eri time lapse images fig 5 b d are presented at times denoted by dashed vertical black lines in the hydrologic data plots fig 5a these images are oriented along cross section b b refer to fig 2a where the groundwater flow direction is from left to right in the images the trench is towards the left side of the electrode grid and the ditch is on the right hand side the color scale is a logarithmic change in conductivity from the background dataset the lower limit equal to 0 024 s m 1 s m 1 is equivalent to an increase from the background conductivity of 5 7 as per the noise level assessment the february 2016 storm event is shown in fig 5 and the background time reference for this series is 22 feb 2016 07 32 five kg of kbr were added to the trench shortly after the background time reference and therefore all images in the series depict a high logarithmic conductivity change in the region surrounding the trench fig 5b d depict a slow progression of the tracer through the subsurface to about 2 m depth which emanated from a vertically oriented preferential pathway connecting the topsoil layer with the sandy soils below the argillic horizon notably this pathway appears slightly offset from the trench location hydraulic loading was highest in fig 5c following the addition of 19 6 mm of precipitation on 25 feb 2016 table 2 even so spatial fluctuations in logarithmic conductivity did not extensively change during the time period depicted in fig 5c spatial changes at depth were more extensive 80 h later fig 5d even though there was no additional precipitation given the logarithmic conductivity changes in fig 5c d occurred below the water table we assumed these changes were mainly due to advection related to the natural groundwater gradient to further examine tracer transport information in the eri models absolute conductivity for depths 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 m is plotted for four locations downstream of the trench fig 6 over the time of the data acquisition the x axis in fig 6 is the time since the tracer was input to the trench and corresponds to the time steps in the acquired datasets which is the discretization of the color scale in fig 7 see below filled in markers along a depth plot represent the first time step for which the change in conductivity exceeds 5 7 from background conductivities i e above noise levels representing definitive tracer arrival location a shows a decrease in conductivity at the beginning of the data acquisition which we presume are artifacts in the time lapse inversion due to close proximity to the infiltrating tracer which is an area with a high increase in conductivity conductivities at location b remain fairly constant at all depths and exceed noise levels at 3 m and 112 h after the tracer was input location c which is adjacent to the trench exceeds noise levels soon after the precipitation event occurs refer to fig 5a and exhibits a pattern of progressively later tracer arrivals with increasing depth location d shows late breakthrough of the tracer at depths of 2 5 and 3 m fig 7 shows the estimated first arrival time of tracer i e the first time step in the data series where the increase in logarithmic conductivity exceeds 5 7 above background across the eri plot for depth slices ranging from 1 5 m to 4 m each circle pixel represents a center location around which logarithmic changes in conductivity from background 5 7 were spatially averaged to account for the variable cell size in the unstructured mesh the pixel averaging was done across 0 5 m in the x direction and 0 25 m in the y direction corresponding to half the electrode spacing in both directions making the spatial resolution of each pixel equal to the electrode spacing no increases in conductivity 5 7 were detected below 4 m fig 7 reveals the distribution of changes in conductivity across the eri plot which is representative of tracer first arrival times while tracer arrives early local to the trench tracer arrival is not spread evenly along the trench axis with the region immediately downgradient of the trench showing more rapid infiltration of the tracer moreover the region of downward tracer propagation shown in fig 5 becomes progressively smaller in size as depth increases from 1 5 to 3 m fig 7a d suggesting the potential for preferential transport in addition to the small area of early tracer breakthrough at 3 m spatially extensive tracer transport is evidenced by changes in conductivity that exceed 5 7 within most of the plot between the trench and the ditch at this depth the predominate direction of tracer transport is captured by the distribution of first arrival times between the trench and the ditch at depths of 2 5 m and greater the tracer plume exhibits fairly uniform lateral movement toward the drainage ditch 4 4 spatial moment analysis and supporting evidence the spatial moment analysis was performed on logarithmic conductivity changes deeper than 1 m to focus on transport in the deeper sand layer where tracer transport towards the ditch was captured in the eri images figs 5 7 fig 8 shows the estimated changes in seepage velocity from the spatial moment analysis alongside precipitation over the course of the storm the color scale denotes travel time days for tracer to travel 11 m being the distance from the ditch to the trench travel time is inversely proportional to seepage velocity with the highest seepage velocities concurrent with or shortly following intense rainfall bursts the maximum estimated seepage velocity was 0 0482 m d 1 during times of no or minimal precipitation 1 mm groundwater travel times from the trench to the ditch easily exceeded one year continuous electrical conductivity measurements in soils and shallow groundwater provided supporting evidence for the spatial moment analyses from eri fig s2 using wilcoxon signed rank tests we compared the median electrical conductivity of soil 0 13 m sensor in topsoil and 0 63 m sensor in the argillic horizon and groundwater 0 25 and 1 m piezometers for two time periods five months before kbr tracer was added 25 mar 2015 to 30 sep 2015 and five months afterward 29 feb 2016 to 30 jun 2016 while we saw no significant changes in the electrical conductivity of soil topsoil and argillic horizons or shallow 0 25 m groundwater in response to kbr application data not shown electrical conductivity of deeper groundwater increased significantly following kbr application in three of the five 1 m piezometers aligned through the center of the eri plot about 3 7 m downgradient of the trench fig s2 thus tracer transport does not appear to be occurring in the upper soil horizons but instead occurs mostly in the sand layer as indicated by the eri images 5 discussion 5 1 characterizing subsurface flow paths with time lapse eri combining eri with a conservative tracer enabled us to delineate spatiotemporal changes in conductivity as a function of hydraulic loading at a ditch drained agricultural field site during wet conditions typical of winter and spring just prior to the february storm a shallow water table maintained near saturation in the topsoil saturation ratio 78 and argillic saturation ratio 95 horizons and the presence of ditch baseflow suggested some initial hydrologic connectivity with groundwater subsurface transport towards the ditch primarily occurred within the cg fine sand soil horizon the eri showed consistent changes in logarithmic conductivity in the sand layer as a direct result of hydraulic loading and addition of tracer figs 5 and 8 and these changes were supported by increases in the electrical conductivity of groundwater in the three 1 m piezometers aligned across the center of the plot fig s2 the first eri images fig 5a taken shortly after an intense rainfall burst on 24 feb indicated the tracer moved laterally a short distance before migrating quickly downward through the argillic horizon and into the underlying sand fig 5b this is supported by the 4d transport depicted in fig 7b d down to 3 m depth vertical percolation in the eri plot could have been facilitated by macropores below the resolution of eri in the argillic horizon fig 5c which are prevalent in quindocqua kleinman et al 2015a b and similarly fine textured soils toor and sims 2015 on the farm or possibly by periglacial features that are common to the delmarva region losco et al 2010 small hydraulic conductivity contrasts between the topsoil and argillic layers table 1 coupled with the flat terrain support the idea of very short downslope travel distances prior to percolation du et al 2016 klaus and jackson 2018 once the tracer reached the sandy layer it then migrated laterally toward the ditch fig 5b d and 7 therefore while discontinuities in the argillic horizon enabled vertical hydrologic transfers it was the uniform lateral movement of groundwater through sandy subsoils that appeared to be the main pathway by which water and solutes moved from the field to the drainage ditch this conclusion mostly concurs with prior work on the farm by vadas et al 2007 and kleinman et al 2007 although in our study lateral flows seemed to occur mostly in the sandy horizon where sufficient hydraulic gradients prevailed and not as interflow above the flatter argillic layer as previously hypothesized in these studies as shown here time lapse eri has distinct benefits over these earlier point based monitoring approaches as it can reveal a more complete picture of the continua of subsurface flow paths connecting the field and the ditch 5 2 inferring lateral subsurface flow rates with spatial moment analysis spatial moment analysis of eri data provided important insights into the velocity of shallow groundwater flow at the farm lateral seepage velocities i e velocities in open pore space in the sandy layer ranged from 0 0027 to 0 0482 m d 1 with center coordinates in the direction of the ditch over time few if any studies have assessed the temporal and spatial variation of seepage velocities during short duration storm events in low gradient watersheds even so average seepage velocities at the farm were generally similar to other coastal plain settings where longer duration tracer studies have been conducted with piezometers in surficial sandy aquifers for instance bosch et al 1994 estimated linear groundwater velocities of 0 01 0 03 m d 1 through a loamy sand soil in the riparian area of a flat 1 5 slope watershed in georgia s gulf atlantic coastal plain elsewhere a salt tracer study by campbell et al 1995 in florida s coastal plain region reported plume velocities of 0 02 0 12 m d 1 at several low gradient 0 1 1 7 slope sites with sandy soils seepage velocities and the magnitude of the measured hydraulic gradient exhibited a significant positive correlation fig 9 positive relationships between seepage velocity and hydraulic gradient are generally expected in fine sandy aquifers where darcian flow conditions are likely to prevail soni et al 1978 notably the february storm was relatively small with low hydraulic gradients 0 05 as such it remains unclear if the linear correlation between seepage velocity and hydraulic gradient would hold for larger less frequent storm events even so the observed increases in seepage velocity with hydraulic gradient clearly indicate that solute transfers in shallow groundwater are likely to be faster in storms during wet periods seepage velocities from the spatial moment analysis on eri data also afforded an opportunity to estimate solute travel times in the vicinity of the ditch for instance travel times from the trench to the ditch distance 11 m ranged from just under a year 359 days at the height of the storm to about 5 years 1827 days at the base of the recession period fig 9 thus even during stormflow periods subsurface transport of water and dissolved solutes is likely to be slow notably sanford et al 2012 showed that groundwater return times i e travel times from the point of groundwater recharge to the point of discharge in streams could range from 10 to 50 years in near stream areas in the middle and lower regions of the delmarva if we assume the middle of the field 40 m from the ditch represents the groundwater divide then travel times from the point of recharge in the surficial aquifer to the point of discharge in the ditch could take roughly 20 years on average range 4 years during stormflow to 38 years during baseflow recession which is reasonable given the findings of sanford et al 2012 5 3 applicability of time lapse eri to other storm events a separate storm event from 29 sept 2015 to 06 oct 2015 was imaged using eri and kbr as a tracer in the same experimental setup as described for the february storm relative to the february storm fig 5a antecedent conditions for the october storm were 36 drier saturation ratio 54 while the total precipitation was three fold greater 82 mm fig 10 a similar to fig 5 changes in conductivity indicate tracer transport from the trench towards the ditch fig 10b d however large conductivity changes are imaged near the surface in response to the increased precipitation rate the kbr tracer was added to the trench after an initial burst of precipitation on 29 sep 2015 see green arrow in fig 10a therefore it was unclear if the cause of the increases in conductivity below the argillic horizon were from the tracer alone or were associated with soil saturation processes brought on by the prior precipitation we postulate that antecedent conditions may regulate tracer transport dynamics in these flat landscapes with wetter conditions raising the likelihood of hydrologically connected flows however additional experiments under controlled conditions are necessary to formulate a more complete model of flow and transport processes in this low relief agroecosystem 5 4 implications for nutrient fate and transport time lapse eri of tracer transport during the february storm revealed rapid downward transfers to groundwater followed by slow groundwater movement towards the drainage ditch this series of subsurface hydrological processes has important implications for nutrient fate and transport on the farm as well as in similar flat ditch drained fields found throughout the lower delmarva for instance the ditch in this study drained cropped fields that had regularly received poultry litter and commercial fertilizers activities that have produced substantial nitrogen n legacies in groundwater tesoriero et al 2013 and phosphorus p legacies in soils sharpley et al 2013 because the surficial aquifer underlying the farm possesses persistently elevated nitrate n concentrations mean 27 mg n l 1 travel times on the order of years to decades imply long lag times between changes in nutrient management on the farm and water quality response sanford and pope 2013 moreover even though time lapse eri confirmed the importance of rapid vertical percolation during storms a process that quickly mobilizes legacy soil p and leaches it to shallow groundwater kleinman et al 2015a b lateral transport primarily occurred in the sandy aquifer where slow travel times prevailed as such critical source areas of p transfers are likely to be within a few m of the drainage ditch during storm events that last several days vadas et al 2007 and could possibly extend to 10 m from the ditch on annual time scales in which successive storms incrementally mobilize and transport p in subsurface flow future studies that combine reactive nutrient tracers with saline tracers are needed to help refine these inferences as the transport of reactive solutes is likely to be inhibited relative to conservative solutes due to uptake and release processes that affect nutrients in soils 6 conclusions time lapse eri of tracer transport allowed for a more complete 4d picture of subsurface flow evolution in the vicinity of open ditches draining flat agricultural fields typical of the lower delmarva peninsula images of changes in conductivity after a wintertime storm event under wet antecedent conditions revealed vertical transport through a shallow argillic horizon followed by lateral subsurface transport within a lower more permeable cg sand horizon hydrometric datasets provided important supporting information to the eri seepage velocities allowing for inferences of flow and transport processes travel times inferred from eri seepage velocities matched previous estimates and showed that solute movement was generally slow 20 years within these artificially drained agroecosystems as such critical source areas of pollutant loss in flat ditch drained landscapes are likely to be within a few m of drainage ditches on typical event timescales and as much as 10 m away from ditches over the course of a typical year credit authorship contribution statement j robinson methodology software formal analysis

5467,geological heterogeneity is a key factor affecting rates and patterns of groundwater flow and the evolution of salinity distributions in coastal aquifers the hydrogeologic systems of volcanic aquifers are characterized by lava flows that can form connected geologic structures in the subsurface surface based geostatistical techniques were adopted to generate geologically realistic statistically equivalent model realizations of a hydrogeologic system based on that of the big island of hawaii conduit models the density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport code seawat was used to perform 3d simulations to investigate subsurface flow and salt transport through these random realizations statistically equivalent geological systems generated with sequential indicator simulation sis and equivalent homogeneous systems were also simulated for comparison simulation results show that conduit realizations tend to have more complex salinity distributions with larger mixing zones for which the center of mass is farther offshore compared to homogeneous and sis realizations the zone of groundwater discharge is also farther offshore than for homogeneous and sis models with higher point fluxes of both fresh and saline water and greater spatial variability this highlights the importance of the geometry of geologic features in coastal groundwater flow and solute transport processes in highly heterogeneous aquifers it also points to the importance of preferential flow with implications for both coastal groundwater resource management and solute fluxes

over many length scales particularly for coastal aquifers where variable density flow and transport are commonly present simmons et al 2001 dagan and zeitoun 1998 first adopted a sharp interface approach to investigate effects of layered one dimensional heterogeneity on the saltwater freshwater interface in a confined aquifer they identified that prediction of interface shape and of saltwater intrusion in heterogeneous aquifers involves significant uncertainty and the approach developed in their study could be used to determine confidence intervals a sharp interface approach was used to investigate heterogeneity effects on coastal saltwater intrusion processes al bitar and ababou 2005 chang and yeh 2010 dokou and karatzas 2012 however this approach does not allow assessment of mixing dynamics effects of geologic heterogeneity on freshwater saltwater mixing in coastal aquifers have been investigated numerically using the classic small scale benchmark problem for variable density flow the henry problem henry 1959 held et al 2005 abarca 2006 held et al 2005 used homogenization theory to derive expressions for the effective hydraulic conductivity and dispersivities in 2d isotropic and anisotropic heterogeneous permeability fields their numerical results showed that heterogeneities in permeability primarily affect the transient evolution of saltwater intrusion whereas the steady state salinity distribution is less sensitive to spatially varying permeability and longitudinal dispersion abarca 2006 integrated natural heterogeneity into the henry problem and found that heterogeneity caused the toe to recede and increased both the width and slope of the mixing zone the shape of the interface and the saltwater flux strongly correlated to the distribution of permeability in each geological realization lu et al 2013 conducted laboratory experiments complemented with numerical simulations to investigate effects of heterogeneity on the steady state freshwater saltwater mixing zone in stratified coastal aquifers their results demonstrated significant impacts of aquifer stratification on the spatial extent of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone for example in an aquifer stratified with a low k layer underlain by a high k layer slanting upward flow of diluted saltwater and re circulated seawater flow are refracted at the interface between the two layers leading to streamline separation and a broader mixing zone in the low k layer nofal et al 2015 used lithological data collected from drilled groups of multi depth wells to assess effects of heterogeneity on saltwater intrusion processes in nile delta aquifers the results of stratigraphy and hydrochemistry assessments identified a multi wedge system for swi in the nile delta aquifer the shape and direction of the wedges differed between the different layers of the aquifer according to the salinity and density of the groundwater in each layer while these studies shed light on the impact of heterogeneity on coastal aquifer salinity the heterogeneity considered in these systems was either simplified stratigraphy with multiple horizontal layers with distinct hydraulic properties or multi gaussian permeability distributions with short length scales relative to the domain in highly heterogeneous coastal aquifers in particular fractured and karst systems networks of high permeability geologic structures are also found to play an important role in nearshore groundwater flow and associated mixing with seawater ghasemizadeh et al 2012 sebben et al 2015 sebben and werner

michael et al 2003 schlüter et al 2004 burnett et al 2006 studies have shown that the geometry of heterogeneity is a critical factor affecting sgd cherkauer and nader 1989 mulligan et al 2007 johnson et al 2008 grossman et al 2010 schornberg et al 2010 dimova et al 2012 russoniello et al 2013 heterogeneity can significantly enhance seawater recirculation kerrou and renard 2010 michael et al 2016 thereby increasing total sgd stieglitz et al 2008 kalbus et al 2009 montiel et al 2018 performed a comprehensive assessment of the total groundwater discharge to adjacent coastal waters from highly heterogeneous coastal karst aquifers in southern spain their study identified significant spatial variability of groundwater discharge via submarine springs due to development of the conduits which complicates exchange between terrestrial groundwater and seawater volcanic systems such as aquifers of hawaii are highly heterogeneous and are both vulnerable to swi and important conduits for sgd field investigations of sgd in hawaii show evidence of point discharge of groundwater offshore johnson et al 2008 street et al 2008 karl et al 2009 peterson et al 2009 these are likely due to lava tubes which are well documented in hawaii greeley 1971 fornari 1986 koeppen et al 2013 and should play a crucial role in aquifer dynamics due to their high hydraulic conductivity k however current models of the coasts of hawaii and other similar islands often assume a homogeneous or near homogeneous system for groundwater resource assessment e g souza and voss 1987 oki 1999 gingerich and voss 2005 as such the connected nature of high k facies is often neglected in studies of hawaiian sgd and swi to date the influence of continuous lava tube features on salinity distributions in the subsurface and rates and patterns of sgd have not been characterized quantitatively here we compare heterogeneous systems with lava tube features to those with less continuous features and equivalent homogeneous aquifers we develop numerical models that represent a portion of the coastline of the big island of hawaii and simulated variable density groundwater flow and salt transport to examine geologic influence on salinity distributions and rates and patterns of sgd 2 methodology hydraulic conductivity fields representative of a volcanic aquifers conduit models were generated using a combined process based and surface based geostatistical modeling code that simulates eruption events and the resultant volcanic deposition modified from koneshloo et al 2018 in the study area fig 1 a flows from the hualalai volcano are dominant and aquifer model parameters representative of hualalai deposits were used because simulation of the entire volcano from vent to the offshore is time consuming and only a small portion is needed for the study area lava flows were generated randomly along a row of vents 20 km from the shoreline 10 km closer than the actual vent the initial digital elevation model dem was a 10 m 10 m 2 m grid of 400 cells 100 cells with a constant slope of 0 0625 elevation ranged from 500 m at the top to 0 m at the bottom lava flows were constrained by no flow boundaries along the landward and shore perpendicular edges of the model domain six facies were simulated aa clinker transitional lava pahoehoe ash and lava tubes lava flows were composed of a 90 m wide 3 m deep channel of solid aa in the majority of flows the interior 1 m wide channel was replaced by lava tube conduits in 8 of flows and by transitional lava in 17 5 of flows pahoehoe was simulated as an inflated field extending from the end of lava flows hon et al 1994 ash was simulated as a thin nearly uniform deposit across the entire domain with decreasing thickness with distance from the vent occurring for 1 of eruption events two meters of clinker were deposited on top of each aa deposit macdonald 1972 proportions of the six facies are given in table 1 hunt et al 1988 miler et al 1997 garcia et al 2007 ducci 2010 facies probabilities and some dimensions e g size of inflated pahoehoe fields were chosen to approximate proportions observed in a core through mauna loa and mauna kea deposits 40 km from a vent garcia et al 2007 but with higher aa and lower pahoehoe proportions to represent a hualalai type system at a distance of 12 km from a vent wentworth and macdonald 1953 rowland and walker 1990 to achieve this pahoehoe fields were extended 300 m out from the end of lava tubes instead of kilometers as can sometimes be seen in the field and thickness was varied between 1 m and 3 m hon et al 1994 the conduit models included 15 000 flow events to generate large three dimensional heterogeneous deposits six unique realizations were simulated in order to create multiple statistically independent volcanic aquifer models a section of the aquifer model representing the saturated portion of a nearshore volcanic aquifer was selected as the domain for simulating nearshore groundwater flow and salt transport processes at a similar distance from the vent as the kahaluu beach park is from the hualalai vent the volcano responsible for the lava flows in that region the size of the domain was 1000 m in the across shore direction shoreline was located at 500 m and 300 m in the along shore direction fig 1b the vertical depth of the domain was 100 m for the onshore part and gradually decreased to 10 m offshore the total number of vertical cells remained the same with the size changing from 2 m to 0 2 m the resulting offshore slope of 0 18 is consistent with nearshore bathymetry in that area based on data from noaa s national center for environmental information ncei https maps ngdc noaa gov viewers bathymetry post processing was necessary to connect facies to represent continuous lava tubes for the flow and transport simulations individual tubes resulting from particular lava flows were isolated and cells were converted to tube facies to connect the cell faces such that no gaps were left allowing simulated groundwater flow to occur continuously through the feature the process maintained the input width and thickness of lava tubes such that they remained consistent with literature this filling in process had the effect of nearly doubling the lava tube facies percentage and reducing the aa percentage by a corresponding amount 3 compared to the inputs to the initial simulation a second set of heterogeneous models were created to represent systems with different geometry of geologic structure than those of the conduit models indicator variograms were calculated for each facies and 3 d direction for each conduit simulation variogram models similar but not identical to each of these were used in sequential indicator simulations sis conducted in sgems remy et al 2009 on the same grid as that of the conduit models this produced a set of six sis models each of which corresponded to a conduit model variogram models were exponential parameters are given in table s1 a k value was assigned to each facies type in the heterogeneous models conduit and sis for use in the flow and transport models table 1 values were selected for each facies within established ranges in the literature where available the k value of transitional lava is not well established and was chosen to be between that of aa and pahoehoe the k value for lava tubes was chosen to be two orders of magnitude higher than the next highest k i e clinker homogeneous realizations with equivalent horizontal and vertical k were also generated for each conduit realization this was done by simulating groundwater flow horizontally and vertically through each realization and then calculating k from the simulated flow using darcy s law domain discretization was equivalent to that of the heterogeneous models numerical models were developed in 3d using seawat guo and langevin 2002 to simulate density dependent groundwater flow and salt transport fig 1 for three dimensional domain selection a distance of 500 m from the shoreline was set as the location of the landward boundary due to computational constraints on the model size head values 500 m from the coastline range from 0 5 m to 1 5 m depending on location within the study area mapper 2017 https maps waterdata usgs gov heads in other nearshore areas around hawaii reach up to 4 m so a head boundary of 2 5 m was chosen to approximate generally representative shoreline conditions we note that this results in different freshwater flux for each model realization since the flux is dependent on the head gradient fixed and effective k variable however this is more realistic than applying a constant flux which would result in very different and in many cases unrealistic head values at the landward boundary further applying a constant flux to a heterogeneous system results in very large variations in head depending on the facies to which flux is applied which results in unrealistically large variations in flux across the landward boundary thus a constant head boundary was chosen the offshore boundary extended 500 m offshore so that 1 the seaward boundary did not interfere with mixing zone calculations and 2 the groundwater discharge could extend offshore as observed in previous studies a constant head value of 0 m was assigned to the offshore top and vertical boundaries all other boundaries were no flow transport boundary conditions were constant concentration of 0 g l along the landward vertical boundary and 35 g l along the offshore top and vertical boundaries all other boundaries were zero flux all seawat simulations were run until both flow fields and salinity distributions reached steady state and results were quantified by several metrics the inland extent of saline water is the farthest inland location with a salinity of 35 g l the offshore extent of freshwater is the farthest offshore location with salinity of 1 g l mixing zone volume is the volume of the domain containing cells between 10 and 90 seawater salinity mixing zone center of mass for the cross shore directions is the center of mass of that volume in the x direction for a given row from onshore boundary to offshore boundary of the model domain averaged over the rows 1 x center i 1 n m i x i i 1 n m i where mi is equal to the salinity value of a given cell along the row and xi is equal to the x coordinate of that same cell the ratio of saline to fresh sgd relates the magnitude of saline circulation to fresh throughflow variability in sgd was characterized as the variance of discharge along every row in the along shore direction for the length of the offshore domain 3 results simulation results show substantial differences in subsurface salinity distributions among the three geologic model types conduit models displayed complex salinity distributions that differed from the saltwater wedges of the equivalent homogeneous simulations figs 2 s1 and s2 salinity in the conduit simulations varied in the along shore direction and exhibited both fresh and saline water in locations not consistent with equivalent homogeneous systems the sis models had wedge shaped distributions generally extending inland from the shoreline similar to homogeneous simulations but more irregular and with wider mixing zones fig 2 c f the differences in salinity distributions particularly for the two heterogeneous cases are most likely due to distinct spatial patterns of high k features that are highly connected for the conduit case fig s3 the brackish water mass in the conduit models extended farther offshore in every case compared to the sis and homogeneous models fig 3 a the horizontal position of the mixing zone center of mass for conduit cases was on average 140 m offshore sis and homogeneous cases had mixing zones that were on average centered 30 m and 20 m onshore of the shoreline respectively the location of the center of mass of conduit model mixing zones was more variable than the other cases ranging from the shoreline to 220 m offshore offshore freshwater extent was further seaward for conduit cases compared to sis and equivalent homogeneous cases for all realizations and in some cases by several hundred meters fig 3b since the homogeneous models were derived from the conduit models the effective hydraulic conductivities are the same as such the specific geometry of the geology in the conduit models is responsible for farther offshore extent of the freshwater the volume of the mixing zone is greater for heterogeneous cases compared to homogeneous cases fig 4 due to mixing enhanced by heterogeneity sis cases had the largest mixing zones of the three aquifer types this is most likely due to lower connectivity of high permeability geologic structures resulting in less freshwater recharge and more landward saltwater freshwater mixing in aquifers the offshore groundwater discharge and recharge patterns differed among the three aquifer types figs 5 and s4 in homogeneous models discharge was focused at the shoreline consistent with theory and recharge occurred offshore in heterogeneous models discharge rates were generally higher at the shoreline than offshore but discharge extended farther offshore more so in the conduit cases compared to sis cases in sis simulations few discharge cells were present 100 m offshore there were a few high volume discharge cells in the nearshore within 10 m of shoreline for sis cases which are likely due to clusters of high k cells fig s5 because there is not the same level of connectivity as in conduit cases however the high discharge is not found further offshore in conduit simulations focused patterns of both discharge and saltwater recharge corresponding to lava tubes were apparent fig s5 groundwater discharge is highly variable in both along and across shore directions in heterogeneous aquifers whereas sgd decreases sharply exponentially in theory with distance offshore the sgd rate in heterogeneous aquifers can be high hundreds of meters offshore fig 6 a c the variability of dischage in the along shore direction was also much greater over a larger offshore area in the conduit cases than in either the homogeneous or sis cases fig 6d f homogeneous and sis cases both have variance spikes at the shoreline where discharge is concentrated the conduit cases have high variance across the offshore domain additionally the conduit and sis cases have variances several orders of magnitude larger than the homogeneous case total fresh and saline sgd varied among model types fig 7 on average fresh discharge was greatest in homogeneous models sis models had the lowest average fresh discharge the difference in average fresh discharge and therefore fresh inflow among different cases occurred because the same equivalent head 2 5 m was imposed at the inland boundary resulting in a different freshwater recharge rate for each model depending on equivalent hydraulic conductivity and aquifer connectivity saline discharge or saltwater circulation driven by subsurface density gradients was greatest in conduit models followed by sis and homogeneous models variability was high in both types of heterogeneous models and low in homogeneous models particularly for fresh sgd the ratio of saline to fresh sgd was greater than 1 for all heterogeneous cases and was as high as 92 and 32 5 for conduit and sis cases respectively fig 8 the ratio was less than 1 for all the equivalent homogeneous cases this is likely due to relatively large freshwater discharge and lower offshore extent of the discharge zone for homogeneous cases compared to heterogeneous cases in addition salinity distributions are complex in both conduit and sis cases leading to multiple density driven circulation cells and high saline to fresh sgd ratios as shown in previous studies michael et al 2016 compared to a monotonic distribution and thin mixing zone in homogeneous cases 4 discussion through comparison of two types of heterogeneity with and without conduits but with similar facies proportions and variograms we demonstrate that geologic structure is a critical factor in determining salinity distributions in coastal aquifers in the simulations salinity patterns in conduit cases were highly variable and mixing zones far offshore compared to more typical wedge type mixing zones in the sis and homogeneous cases this is a somewhat different result from michael et al 2016 which showed that salinity distributions in sis generated heterogeneous aquifers can differ substantially from equivalent homogenous simulations for models with highly continuous facies in the across shore direction the extent to which sis type heterogeneous geometries result in complex salinity distributions similar to those of our conduit models likely depends on the extent of onshore to offshore facies continuity compared to model extent for our simulations the sis variogram ranges were 15 m to 40 m depending on the realization and facies which was 1 5 4 of the total domain length in michael et al 2016 the variogram range for high continuity models was 50 km which was 25 of the domain length whereas the low continuity models had a variogram range of only 5 km 5 of the domain length similarly to our sis simulations the low continuity sis simulations of michael et al 2016 had salinity distributions similar to but slightly more variable than the equivalent homogeneous simulations thus it is important to understand and model the degree of connectivity in a system relative to domain size another factor that is likely to affect salinity and sgd in coastal aquifers is the proportion of high k and low k facies for example the models of michael et al 2016 were comprised of 20 clay and 16 coarse sand this contrasts with our models comprised of 75 aa and 6 lava tube the large proportion of low k facies and the disconnected nature of higher k facies may also contribute to the differences between the sis heterogeneity in our results and the heterogeneity in prior studies when mixing occurs salinity distributions change from a typical homogeneous case with more complex salinity distributions there also comes an increase in the amount of saline recirculation and therefore saline sgd comparison of the ratio of saline sgd to fresh sgd fig 8 in the three cases showed that the conduit simulations consistently exhibited more saline circulation than either the homogeneous or sis simulations fig 7 shows that conduit cases have the highest volume of saline water this all indicates that regardless of specific geometry a conduit system will have a higher rate of density driven saltwater circulation than either homogeneous systems or sis type systems knowing this influences the methods by which such systems are studied and should also inform the amount of data that needs to be collected before such a system can be properly analyzed the distance that fresh groundwater extends offshore and saline groundwater extends inland are important for water resources assessment cohen et al 2010 post et al 2013 knight et al 2018 as sea level and populations rise saltwater intrusion will be an increasing problem for coastal communities and knowledge of how and where the intrusion is likely to occur and the volume of fresh water available for extraction could greatly aid in mitigation efforts freshened groundwater has been shown to occur tens of kilometers offshore or more within continental shelves post et al 2013 the offshore extent of fresh water depends on many factors such as the large scale hydraulic gradient between inland and sea glacial and sea level history the nature of sedimentary deposits at the sea bed low k drapes for example and whether aquifers or high k conduits outcrop offshore in the case of hawaii bathymetry is steep such that freshened groundwater cannot extend as far offshore even if geologic conditions are favorable however our simulations indicate that the continuous high k conduits conduct fresh groundwater farther offshore than heterogeneous systems with less connected geometry or homogeneous aquifers additionally the saline water in the lava tube system did not extend as far inland as homogeneous cases indicating that conduit systems may have more of a buffer against seawater intrusion however these high k conduits can also allow fast preferential flow inland in response to pumping more work is necessary to characterize transient responses to human perturbations and hydrologic change the preferential flow through high k conduits not only conducts freshwater farther offshore it also results in further offshore sgd and more complex spatial patterns including point discharges these simulated patterns are consistent with observations of sgd in hawaii grossman et al 2010 collected over a thousand depth profiles of surface water temperature and salinity in kaloko honokohau national historical park on the northern edge of our study area to examine the influence of sgd on the nearshore water properties and found that sgd extends between 100 m and 1000 m offshore to depths ranging between 1 and 5 m aerial thermal infrared mapping of groundwater discharge in the same area reported in johnson et al 2008 shows that sgd occurs 1 km of the coast and identified several point sources of sgd these point discharges and several others were confirmed and fluxes quantified at six sites along the west coast of the big island using ra and rn isotopes peterson et al 2009 dimova et al 2012 used electrical resistivity er to examine the dynamics of the freshwater saltwater interface and rates of sgd at a point discharge in kiholo bay just to the north of our study area they show that fresh groundwater discharges at least 65 m offshore and suggest that the er images reveal cross sections of lava tubes with dimensions of 10 15 m similar to those in our simulations thus both the nature and offshore extent of sgd in our simulations as well as the nature of the conduits are supported by observations the modeling results and sgd observations indicate that in systems like hawaii where connected high k facies i e conduits are present care must be taken in designing coastal field studies to overcome the high degree of heterogeneity of both salinity and sgd because the variance in sgd in conduit models was orders of magnitude greater than the sis and homogeneous counterparts a large number of measurements is necessary to sufficiently characterize sgd the complex salinity distributions present a similar challenge and would require a greater number of measurements or different non point approaches for characterization and management when focusing on regions that have continuous connected features best practices for characterization should include multiple measurement methods including both direct i e wells or seepage meters and indirect e g resistivity or thermal imagery approaches similar conclusions can be drawn for other aquifer systems with continuous geologic features such as karstic fractures or ancient paleochannels systems similar to an sis simulation could include deltas or glacial fields an understanding of the underlying geometry of the system should inform the type locations and number of measurements for coastal aquifer system characterization this study assumed a steady state condition for simulating nearshore groundwater flow and salt transport processes taking into account density effects in reality both tides and waves act on nearshore aquifers such oceanic forcing is likely to cause additional pore water flow oscillations which in turn complicate nearshore mixing dynamics of freshwater and saltwater particularly in the presence of connected heterogeneity other factors that are likely to influence effects of geologic heterogeneity on groundwater flow and salinity distributions in volcanic aquifers include tempo spatial variability of nearshore morphology potentially large within facies variations in k long term sea level oscillations and seasonal variability e g precipitation and evaporation another consideration is the geologic model while we aimed to reproduce the aquifer structure of hawaii as realistically as possible see koneshloo et al 2018 data on all aspects including facies proportions feature geometry and hydraulic conductivity values are sparse high quality datasets from well and core drilling are expensive but higher resolution information on facies distributions proportions and k values would improve our ability to create more realistic models either statistically or deterministically this information is very valuable both onshore and offshore to improve understanding of the land sea connections in volcanic systems further work is necessary to identify connected structures relevant to groundwater flow and solute transport in volcanic and other similar aquifers nonetheless we believe that this work provides a sound basis for future studies on the dynamics of aquifer ocean interactions in highly heterogeneous coastal aquifers 5 conclusion coastal groundwater systems are important resources for island communities where in some cases the entire freshwater supply comes from groundwater understanding how and where groundwater discharges is important for proper management in addition knowledge of seawater circulation and mixing zone dynamics in aquifers is crucial for understanding geochemical reactions that are affected by such processes in volcanic aquifers lava tubes can act as conduits for groundwater in a less permeable matrix of lava flows such preferential flow can have an important impact on groundwater salinity distributions and sgd this investigation showed that the geometry of heterogeneity in coastal aquifers has a substantial effect on distributions of salinity and sgd more connected conduit realizations had more complex salinity distributions and in general farther offshore discharge of fresh and brackish groundwater than homogeneous or sis realizations freshwater saltwater mixing zones were also greatest in conduit models with centers of mass farther offshore than in the other cases conduits resulted in higher rates of point source discharge of both fresh and saline water extending far offshore discharge was most highly variable in conduit cases somewhat less so for sis cases and very low for homogeneous cases the ratio of saline to fresh sgd was much greater in heterogeneous simulations due primarily to the rate of saltwater circulation driven by density gradients which is enhanced in systems with complex salinity distributions these results are consistent with brackish point source discharge observed offshore in western coast of hawaii they also indicate a need for multiple points and methods of sampling in areas where conduit type heterogeneous geology is expected to occur in a coastal setting it is clear from this work that geologic setting and the resulting geometry of aquifer heterogeneity strongly control groundwater flow salinity and sgd in coastal systems and should be considered in managing water

5467,geological heterogeneity is a key factor affecting rates and patterns of groundwater flow and the evolution of salinity distributions in coastal aquifers the hydrogeologic systems of volcanic aquifers are characterized by lava flows that can form connected geologic structures in the subsurface surface based geostatistical techniques were adopted to generate geologically realistic statistically equivalent model realizations of a hydrogeologic system based on that of the big island of hawaii conduit models the density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport code seawat was used to perform 3d simulations to investigate subsurface flow and salt transport through these random realizations statistically equivalent geological systems generated with sequential indicator simulation sis and equivalent homogeneous systems were also simulated for comparison simulation results show that conduit realizations tend to have more complex salinity distributions with larger mixing zones for which the center of mass is farther offshore compared to homogeneous and sis realizations the zone of groundwater discharge is also farther offshore than for homogeneous and sis models with higher point fluxes of both fresh and saline water and greater spatial variability this highlights the importance of the geometry of geologic features in coastal groundwater flow and solute transport processes in highly heterogeneous aquifers it also points to the importance of preferential flow with implications for both coastal groundwater resource management and solute fluxes

over many length scales particularly for coastal aquifers where variable density flow and transport are commonly present simmons et al 2001 dagan and zeitoun 1998 first adopted a sharp interface approach to investigate effects of layered one dimensional heterogeneity on the saltwater freshwater interface in a confined aquifer they identified that prediction of interface shape and of saltwater intrusion in heterogeneous aquifers involves significant uncertainty and the approach developed in their study could be used to determine confidence intervals a sharp interface approach was used to investigate heterogeneity effects on coastal saltwater intrusion processes al bitar and ababou 2005 chang and yeh 2010 dokou and karatzas 2012 however this approach does not allow assessment of mixing dynamics effects of geologic heterogeneity on freshwater saltwater mixing in coastal aquifers have been investigated numerically using the classic small scale benchmark problem for variable density flow the henry problem henry 1959 held et al 2005 abarca 2006 held et al 2005 used homogenization theory to derive expressions for the effective hydraulic conductivity and dispersivities in 2d isotropic and anisotropic heterogeneous permeability fields their numerical results showed that heterogeneities in permeability primarily affect the transient evolution of saltwater intrusion whereas the steady state salinity distribution is less sensitive to spatially varying permeability and longitudinal dispersion abarca 2006 integrated natural heterogeneity into the henry problem and found that heterogeneity caused the toe to recede and increased both the width and slope of the mixing zone the shape of the interface and the saltwater flux strongly correlated to the distribution of permeability in each geological realization lu et al 2013 conducted laboratory experiments complemented with numerical simulations to investigate effects of heterogeneity on the steady state freshwater saltwater mixing zone in stratified coastal aquifers their results demonstrated significant impacts of aquifer stratification on the spatial extent of the freshwater saltwater mixing zone for example in an aquifer stratified with a low k layer underlain by a high k layer slanting upward flow of diluted saltwater and re circulated seawater flow are refracted at the interface between the two layers leading to streamline separation and a broader mixing zone in the low k layer nofal et al 2015 used lithological data collected from drilled groups of multi depth wells to assess effects of heterogeneity on saltwater intrusion processes in nile delta aquifers the results of stratigraphy and hydrochemistry assessments identified a multi wedge system for swi in the nile delta aquifer the shape and direction of the wedges differed between the different layers of the aquifer according to the salinity and density of the groundwater in each layer while these studies shed light on the impact of heterogeneity on coastal aquifer salinity the heterogeneity considered in these systems was either simplified stratigraphy with multiple horizontal layers with distinct hydraulic properties or multi gaussian permeability distributions with short length scales relative to the domain in highly heterogeneous coastal aquifers in particular fractured and karst systems networks of high

thereby increasing total sgd stieglitz et al 2008 kalbus et al 2009 montiel et al 2018 performed a comprehensive assessment of the total groundwater discharge to adjacent coastal waters from highly heterogeneous coastal karst aquifers in southern spain their study identified significant spatial variability of groundwater discharge via submarine springs due to development of the conduits which complicates exchange between terrestrial groundwater and seawater volcanic systems such as aquifers of hawaii are highly heterogeneous and are both vulnerable to swi and important conduits for sgd field investigations of sgd in hawaii show evidence of point discharge of groundwater offshore johnson et al 2008 street et al 2008 karl et al 2009 peterson et al 2009 these are likely due to lava tubes which are well documented in hawaii greeley 1971 fornari 1986 koeppen et al 2013 and should play a crucial role in aquifer dynamics due to their high hydraulic conductivity k however current models of the coasts of hawaii and other similar islands often assume a homogeneous or near homogeneous system for groundwater resource assessment e g souza and voss 1987 oki 1999 gingerich and voss 2005 as such the connected nature of high k facies is often neglected in studies of hawaiian sgd and swi to date the influence of continuous lava tube features on salinity distributions in the subsurface and rates and patterns of sgd have not been characterized quantitatively here we compare heterogeneous systems with lava tube features to those with less continuous features and equivalent homogeneous aquifers we develop numerical models that represent a portion of the coastline of the big island of hawaii and simulated variable density groundwater flow and salt transport to examine geologic influence on salinity distributions and rates and patterns of sgd 2 methodology hydraulic conductivity fields representative of a volcanic aquifers conduit models were generated using a combined process based and surface based geostatistical modeling code that simulates eruption events and the resultant volcanic deposition modified from koneshloo et al 2018 in the study area fig 1 a flows from the hualalai volcano are dominant and aquifer model parameters representative of hualalai deposits were used because simulation of the entire volcano from vent to the offshore is time consuming and only a small portion is needed for the study area lava flows were generated randomly along a row of vents 20 km from the shoreline 10 km closer than the actual vent the initial digital elevation model dem was a 10 m 10 m 2 m grid of 400 cells 100 cells with a constant slope of 0 0625 elevation ranged from 500 m at the top to 0 m at the bottom lava flows were constrained by no flow boundaries along the landward and shore perpendicular edges of the model domain six facies were simulated aa clinker transitional lava pahoehoe ash and lava tubes lava flows were composed of a 90 m wide 3 m deep channel of solid aa in the majority of flows the interior 1 m wide channel was replaced by lava tube conduits in 8 of flows and by transitional lava in 17 5 of flows pahoehoe was simulated as an inflated field extending from the end of lava flows hon et al 1994 ash was simulated as a thin nearly uniform deposit across the entire domain with decreasing thickness with distance from the vent occurring for 1 of eruption events two meters of clinker were deposited on top of each aa deposit macdonald 1972 proportions of the six facies are given in table 1 hunt et al 1988 miler et al 1997 garcia et al 2007 ducci 2010 facies probabilities and some dimensions e g size of inflated pahoehoe fields were chosen to approximate proportions observed in a core through mauna loa and mauna kea deposits 40 km from a vent garcia et al 2007 but with higher aa and lower pahoehoe proportions to represent a hualalai type system at a distance of 12 km from a vent wentworth and macdonald 1953 rowland and walker 1990 to achieve this pahoehoe fields were extended 300 m out from the end of lava tubes instead of kilometers as can sometimes be seen in the field and thickness was varied between 1 m and 3 m hon et al 1994 the conduit models included 15 000 flow events to generate large three dimensional heterogeneous deposits six unique realizations were simulated in order to create multiple statistically independent volcanic aquifer models a section of the aquifer model representing the saturated portion of a nearshore volcanic aquifer was selected as the domain for simulating nearshore groundwater flow and salt transport processes at a similar distance from the vent as the kahaluu beach park is from the hualalai vent the volcano responsible for the lava flows in that region the size of the domain was 1000 m in the across shore direction shoreline was located at 500 m and 300 m in the along shore direction fig 1b the vertical depth of the domain was 100 m for the onshore part and gradually decreased to 10 m offshore the total number of vertical cells remained the same with the size changing from 2 m to 0 2 m the resulting offshore slope of 0 18 is consistent with nearshore bathymetry in that area based on data from noaa s national center for environmental information ncei https maps ngdc noaa gov viewers bathymetry post processing was necessary to connect facies to represent continuous lava tubes for the flow and transport simulations individual tubes resulting from particular lava flows were isolated and cells were converted to tube facies to connect the cell faces such that no gaps were left allowing simulated groundwater flow to occur continuously through the feature the process maintained the input width and thickness of lava tubes such that they remained consistent with literature this filling in process had the effect of nearly doubling the lava tube facies percentage and reducing the aa percentage by a corresponding amount 3 compared to the inputs to the initial simulation a second set of heterogeneous models were created to represent systems with different geometry of geologic structure than those of the conduit models indicator variograms were calculated for each facies and 3 d direction for each conduit simulation variogram models similar but not identical to each of these were used in sequential indicator simulations sis conducted in sgems remy et al 2009 on the same grid as that of the conduit models this produced a set of six sis models each of which corresponded to a conduit model variogram models were exponential parameters are given in table s1 a k value was assigned to each facies type in the heterogeneous models conduit and sis for use in the flow and transport models table 1 values were selected for each facies within established ranges in the literature where available the k value of transitional lava is not well established and was chosen to be between that of aa and pahoehoe the k value for lava tubes was chosen to be two orders of magnitude higher than the next highest k i e clinker homogeneous realizations with equivalent horizontal and vertical k were also generated for each conduit realization this was done by simulating groundwater flow horizontally and vertically through each realization and then calculating k from the simulated flow using darcy s law domain discretization was equivalent to that of the heterogeneous models numerical models were developed in 3d using seawat guo and langevin 2002 to simulate density dependent groundwater flow and salt transport fig 1 for three dimensional domain selection a distance of 500 m from the shoreline was set as the location of the landward boundary due to computational constraints on the model size head values 500 m from the coastline range from 0 5 m to 1 5 m depending on location within the study area mapper 2017 https maps waterdata usgs gov heads in other nearshore areas around hawaii reach up to 4 m so a head boundary of 2 5 m was chosen to approximate generally representative shoreline conditions we note that this results in different freshwater flux for each model realization since the flux is dependent on the head gradient fixed and effective k variable however this is more realistic than applying a constant flux which would result in very different and in many cases unrealistic head values at the landward boundary further applying a constant flux to a heterogeneous system results in very large variations in head depending on the facies to which flux is applied which results in unrealistically large variations in flux across the landward boundary thus a constant head boundary was chosen the offshore boundary extended 500 m offshore so that 1 the seaward boundary did not interfere with mixing zone calculations and 2 the groundwater discharge could extend offshore as observed in previous studies a constant head value of 0 m was assigned to the offshore top and vertical boundaries all other boundaries were no flow transport boundary conditions were constant concentration of 0 g l along the landward vertical boundary and 35 g l along the offshore top and vertical boundaries all other boundaries were zero flux all seawat simulations were run until both flow fields and salinity distributions reached steady state and results were quantified by several metrics the inland extent of saline water is the farthest inland location with a salinity of 35 g l the offshore extent of freshwater is the farthest offshore location with salinity of 1 g l mixing zone volume is the volume of the domain containing cells between 10 and 90 seawater salinity mixing zone center of mass for the cross shore directions is the center of mass of that volume in the x direction for a given row from onshore boundary to offshore boundary of the model domain averaged over the rows 1 x center i 1 n m i x i i 1 n m i where mi is equal to the salinity value of a given cell along the row and xi is equal to the x coordinate of that same cell the ratio of saline to fresh sgd relates the magnitude of saline circulation to fresh throughflow variability in sgd was characterized as the variance of discharge along every row in the along shore direction for the length of the offshore domain 3 results simulation results show substantial differences in subsurface salinity distributions among the three geologic model types conduit models displayed complex salinity distributions that differed from the saltwater wedges of the equivalent homogeneous simulations figs 2 s1 and s2 salinity in the conduit simulations varied in the along shore direction and exhibited both fresh and saline water in locations not consistent with equivalent homogeneous systems the sis models had wedge shaped distributions generally extending inland from the shoreline similar to homogeneous simulations but more irregular and with wider mixing zones fig 2 c f the differences in salinity distributions particularly for the two heterogeneous cases are most likely due to distinct spatial patterns of high k features that are highly connected for the conduit case fig s3 the brackish water mass in the conduit models extended farther offshore in every case compared to the sis and homogeneous models fig 3 a the horizontal position of the mixing zone center of mass for conduit cases was on average 140 m offshore sis and homogeneous cases had mixing zones that were on average centered 30 m and 20 m onshore of the shoreline respectively the location of the center of mass of conduit model mixing zones was more variable than the other cases ranging from the shoreline to 220 m offshore offshore freshwater extent was further seaward for conduit cases compared to sis and equivalent homogeneous cases for all realizations and in some cases by several hundred meters fig 3b since the homogeneous models were derived from the conduit models the effective hydraulic conductivities are the same as such the specific geometry of the geology in the conduit models is responsible for farther offshore extent of the freshwater the volume of the mixing zone is greater for heterogeneous cases compared to homogeneous cases fig 4 due to mixing enhanced by heterogeneity sis cases had the largest mixing zones of the three aquifer types this is most likely due to lower connectivity of high permeability geologic structures resulting in less freshwater recharge and more landward saltwater freshwater mixing in aquifers the offshore groundwater discharge and recharge patterns differed among the three aquifer types figs 5 and s4 in homogeneous models discharge was focused at the shoreline consistent with theory and recharge occurred offshore in heterogeneous models discharge rates were generally higher at the shoreline than offshore but discharge extended farther offshore more so in the conduit cases compared to sis cases in sis simulations few discharge cells were present 100 m offshore there were a few high volume discharge cells in the nearshore within 10 m of shoreline for sis cases which are likely due to clusters of high k cells fig s5 because there is not the same level of connectivity as in conduit cases however the high discharge is not found further offshore in conduit simulations focused patterns of both discharge and saltwater recharge corresponding to lava tubes were apparent fig s5 groundwater discharge is highly variable in both along and across shore directions in heterogeneous aquifers whereas sgd decreases sharply exponentially in theory with distance offshore the sgd rate in heterogeneous aquifers can be high hundreds of meters offshore fig 6 a c the variability of dischage in the along shore direction was also much greater over a larger offshore area in the conduit cases than in either the homogeneous or sis cases fig 6d f homogeneous and sis cases both have variance spikes at the shoreline where discharge is concentrated the conduit cases have high variance across the offshore domain additionally the conduit and sis cases have variances several orders of magnitude larger than the homogeneous case total fresh and saline sgd varied among model types fig 7 on average fresh discharge was greatest in homogeneous models sis models had the lowest average fresh discharge the difference in average fresh discharge and therefore fresh inflow among different cases occurred because the same equivalent head 2 5 m was imposed at the inland boundary resulting in a different freshwater recharge rate for each model depending on equivalent hydraulic conductivity and aquifer connectivity saline discharge or saltwater circulation driven by subsurface density gradients was greatest in conduit models followed by sis and homogeneous models variability was high in both types of heterogeneous models and low in homogeneous models particularly for fresh sgd the ratio of saline to fresh sgd was greater than 1 for all heterogeneous cases and was as high as 92 and 32 5 for conduit and sis cases respectively fig 8 the ratio was less than 1 for all the equivalent homogeneous cases this is likely due to relatively large freshwater discharge and lower offshore extent of the discharge zone for homogeneous cases compared to heterogeneous cases in addition salinity distributions are complex in both conduit and sis cases leading to multiple density driven circulation cells and high saline to fresh sgd ratios as shown in previous studies michael et al 2016 compared to a monotonic distribution and thin mixing zone in homogeneous cases 4 discussion through comparison of two types of heterogeneity with and without conduits but with similar facies proportions and variograms we demonstrate that geologic structure is a critical factor in determining salinity distributions in coastal aquifers in the simulations salinity patterns in conduit cases were highly variable and mixing zones far offshore compared to more typical wedge type mixing zones in the sis and homogeneous cases this is a somewhat different result from michael et al 2016 which showed that salinity distributions in sis generated heterogeneous aquifers can differ substantially from equivalent homogenous simulations for models with highly continuous facies in the across shore direction the extent to which sis type heterogeneous geometries result in complex salinity distributions similar to those of our conduit models likely depends on the extent of onshore to offshore facies continuity compared to model extent for our simulations the sis variogram ranges were 15 m to 40 m depending on the realization and facies which was 1 5 4 of the total domain length in michael et al 2016 the variogram range for high continuity models was 50 km which was 25 of the domain length whereas the low continuity models had a variogram range of only 5 km 5 of the domain length similarly to our sis simulations the low continuity sis simulations of michael et al 2016 had salinity distributions similar to but slightly more variable than the equivalent homogeneous simulations thus it is important to understand and model the degree of connectivity in a system relative to domain size another factor that is likely to affect salinity and sgd in coastal aquifers is the proportion of high k and low k facies for example the models of michael et al 2016 were comprised of 20 clay and 16 coarse sand this contrasts with our models comprised of 75 aa and 6 lava tube the large proportion of low k facies and the disconnected nature of higher k facies may also contribute to the differences between the sis heterogeneity in our results and the heterogeneity in prior studies when mixing occurs salinity distributions change from a typical homogeneous case with more complex salinity distributions there also comes an increase in the amount of saline recirculation and therefore saline sgd comparison of the ratio of saline sgd to fresh sgd fig 8 in the three cases showed that the conduit simulations consistently exhibited more saline circulation than either the homogeneous or sis simulations fig 7 shows that conduit cases have the highest volume of saline water this all indicates that regardless of specific geometry a conduit system will have a higher rate of density driven saltwater circulation than either homogeneous systems or sis type systems knowing this influences the methods by which such systems are studied and should also inform the amount of data that needs to be collected before such a system can be properly analyzed the distance that fresh groundwater extends offshore and saline groundwater extends inland are important for water resources assessment cohen et al 2010 post et al 2013 knight et al 2018 as sea level and populations rise saltwater intrusion will be an increasing problem for coastal communities and knowledge of how and where the intrusion is likely to occur and the volume of fresh water available for extraction could greatly aid in mitigation efforts freshened groundwater has been shown to occur tens of kilometers offshore or more within continental shelves post et al 2013 the offshore extent of fresh water depends on many factors such as the large scale hydraulic gradient between inland and sea glacial and sea level history the nature of sedimentary deposits at the sea bed low k drapes for example and whether aquifers or high k conduits outcrop offshore in the case of hawaii bathymetry is steep such that freshened groundwater cannot extend as far offshore even if geologic conditions are favorable however our simulations indicate that the continuous high k conduits conduct fresh groundwater farther offshore than heterogeneous systems with less connected geometry or homogeneous aquifers additionally the saline water in the lava tube system did not extend as far inland as homogeneous cases indicating that conduit systems may have more of a buffer against seawater intrusion however these high k conduits can also allow fast preferential flow inland in response to pumping more work is necessary to characterize transient responses to human perturbations and hydrologic change the preferential flow through high k conduits not only conducts freshwater farther offshore it also results in further offshore sgd and more complex spatial patterns including point discharges these simulated patterns are consistent with observations of sgd in hawaii grossman et al 2010 collected over a thousand depth profiles of surface water temperature and salinity in kaloko honokohau national historical park on the northern edge of our study area to examine the influence of sgd on the nearshore water properties and found that sgd extends between 100 m and 1000 m offshore to depths ranging between 1 and 5 m aerial thermal infrared mapping of groundwater discharge in the same area reported in johnson et al 2008 shows that sgd occurs 1 km of the coast and identified several point sources of sgd these point discharges and several others were confirmed and fluxes quantified at six sites along the west coast of the big island using ra and rn isotopes peterson et al 2009 dimova et al 2012 used electrical resistivity er to examine the dynamics of the freshwater saltwater interface and rates of sgd at a point discharge in kiholo bay just to the north of our study area they show that fresh groundwater discharges at least 65 m offshore and suggest that the er images reveal cross sections of lava tubes with dimensions of 10 15 m similar to those in our simulations thus both the nature and offshore extent of sgd in our simulations as well as the nature of the conduits are supported by observations the modeling results and sgd observations indicate that in systems like hawaii where connected high k facies i e conduits are present care must be taken in designing coastal field studies to overcome the high degree of heterogeneity of both salinity and sgd because the variance in sgd in conduit models was orders of magnitude greater than the sis and homogeneous counterparts a large number of measurements is necessary to sufficiently characterize sgd the complex salinity distributions present a similar challenge and would require a greater number of measurements or different non point approaches for characterization and management when focusing on regions that have continuous connected features best practices for characterization should include multiple measurement methods including both direct i e wells or seepage meters and indirect e g resistivity or thermal imagery approaches similar conclusions can be drawn for other aquifer systems with continuous geologic features such as karstic fractures or ancient paleochannels systems similar to an sis simulation could include deltas or glacial fields an understanding of the underlying geometry of the system should inform the type locations and number of measurements for coastal aquifer system characterization this study assumed a steady state condition for simulating nearshore groundwater flow and salt transport processes taking into account density effects in reality both tides and waves act on nearshore aquifers such oceanic forcing is likely to cause additional pore water flow oscillations which in turn complicate nearshore mixing dynamics of freshwater and saltwater particularly in the presence of connected heterogeneity other factors that are likely to influence effects of geologic heterogeneity on groundwater flow and salinity distributions in volcanic aquifers include tempo spatial variability of nearshore morphology potentially large within facies variations in k long term sea level oscillations and seasonal variability e g precipitation and evaporation another consideration is the geologic model while we aimed to reproduce the aquifer structure of hawaii as realistically as possible see koneshloo et al 2018 data on all aspects including facies proportions feature geometry and hydraulic conductivity values are sparse high quality datasets from well and core drilling are expensive but higher resolution information on facies distributions proportions and k values would improve our ability to create more realistic models either statistically or deterministically this information is very valuable both onshore and offshore to improve understanding of the land sea connections in volcanic systems further work is necessary to identify connected structures relevant to groundwater flow and solute transport in volcanic and other similar aquifers nonetheless we believe that this work provides a sound basis for future studies on the dynamics of aquifer ocean interactions in highly heterogeneous coastal aquifers 5 conclusion coastal groundwater systems are important resources for island communities where in some cases the entire freshwater supply comes from groundwater understanding how and where groundwater discharges is important for proper management in addition knowledge of seawater circulation and mixing zone dynamics in aquifers is crucial for understanding geochemical reactions that are affected by such processes in volcanic aquifers lava tubes can act as conduits for groundwater in a less permeable matrix of lava flows such preferential flow can have an important impact on groundwater salinity distributions and sgd this investigation showed that the geometry of heterogeneity in coastal aquifers has a substantial effect on distributions of salinity and sgd more connected conduit realizations had more complex salinity distributions and in general farther offshore discharge of fresh and brackish groundwater than homogeneous or sis realizations freshwater saltwater mixing zones were also greatest in conduit models with centers of mass farther offshore than in the other cases conduits resulted in higher rates of point source discharge of both fresh and saline water extending far offshore discharge was most highly variable in conduit cases somewhat less so for sis cases and very low for homogeneous cases the ratio of saline to fresh sgd was much greater in heterogeneous simulations due primarily to the rate of saltwater circulation driven by density gradients which is enhanced in systems with complex salinity distributions these results are consistent with brackish point source discharge observed offshore in western coast of hawaii they also indicate a need for multiple points and methods of sampling in areas where conduit type heterogeneous geology is expected to occur in a coastal setting it is clear from this work that geologic setting and the resulting geometry of aquifer heterogeneity strongly control groundwater flow salinity and sgd in coastal systems and should be considered in managing water

past few decades there is growth in evidence of intensification of the global hydrologic cycle due to climate change associated with anthropogenic forcing in this perspective there is a need for effective and efficient hydrometric network for monitoring water quantity and quality related parameters in different subsystems of the hydrologic cycle this is because timely availability of data is useful for various purposes such as i water resources planning assessment to upkeep human and ecosystem needs ii forecasting extreme hydrologic events and assessing the associated risk and iii

spatially clustered and short lived because most of the data collection is reliant on development projects ruhi et al 2018 enormous loss in hydrometric monitoring network has been observed in the past few decades in both developed and developing countries due to economic constraints and changing government priorities lanfear and hirsch 1999 spence et al 2007 mishra and coulibaly 2009 ruhi et al 2018 for a hydrometric network design it is important to account for spatial and temporal variability of the target hydrometric variable s considering the economical and network density aspects it is vital to have an optimized network with minimum redundancy of information krajewski et al 1991 bardossy and das 2008 in the recent decades there is growth in interest to develop approaches for i identifying deficit zones in the existing stream gauge network and for ii designing an optimized network mishra and coulibaly 2010 the existing methods for network design include statistical methods moss 1982 tasker 1986 morin et al 1979 burn and goulter 1991 information theory based methods husain 1987 husain 1989 yang and burn 1994 mishra and coulibaly 2010 samuel et al 2011 leach et al 2015 user survey based methods singh et al 1986 davar and brimley 1990 hybrid methods fiering 1965 pardo iguzquiza 1998 markus et al 2003 samuel et al 2013 physiographic component based methods carpenter et al 1987 basist et al 1994 laize 2004 skok 2006 and sampling strategies bras et al 1988 tsintikidis et al 2002 mishra and coulibaly 2009 provided an extensive review of various commonly used hydrometric network design methods and concluded that the entropy based method is one of the most promising options for network design keum et al 2017 had done an extensive review of literature on entropy applications to water monitoring network and concluded that a comparative study among multiple entropy design methods discretization approaches and data characterization should be done to provide generic guidelines for hydrologic network design however to date none of the studies have focused on these aspects and no standardized approach has evolved for hydrometric network design many researchers have applied the classical shannon entropy method shannon 1948 for hydrometric network design by prioritizing stream gauges the prioritization is done to reduce the redundancy by minimizing mutual information of stream gauges alfonso et al 2010a alfonso et al 2010b brunsell 2010 mishra and coulibaly 2010 mahjouri and kerachian 2011 li et al 2012 mishra and coulibaly 2014 leach et al 2015 keum and coulibaly 2017 however the application of the classical shannon entropy for gauge network design has some limitations if uniform probability distribution is considered to determine the probability required for estimation of entropy shannon entropy does not have a fixed upper bound this limitation was overcome by pal and pal 1991 by introducing a new entropy approach called exponential entropy whose advantages are yet to be explored in the context of hydrometric network design in applying shannon mutual information for real time scenarios probabilities are unknown and must be estimated with a finite set of observations by calculating their frequency of occurrence in analysis with a continuous random variable probability density could be estimated by i discretizing observations of the variable ching et al 1995 into some arbitrary number of bins and using the information to estimate probabilities or ii using parzen window kwak and choi 2002 discretization can lead to information loss shen and jensen 2004 li et al 2012 whereas estimation of probability density with parzen window is time consuming in order to overcome these limitations yu et al 2011 proposed a new approach called fuzzy information entropy which permits the computation of mutual information between numerical or fuzzy variables without discretization however the potential of fuzzy information entropy is not tested in the context of hydrometric network design the primary objective of this study is to develop a methodology for optimal design of hydrometric network using fuzzy information entropy potential of the developed methodology is demonstrated over conventional shannon information entropy approach and its related theoretical improvement eebm exponential entropy based methodology by application to hydrometric network in mahanadi basin of india which is frequently prone to floods the second objective is to investigate the effect of various bin size estimation rules on shannon and exponential entropy estimates and identify if the estimates obtained using any of the rules closely resemble fuzzy entropy estimates the effect of entropy estimation method and bin size estimation rule was examined on prioritization of stations for data collection identification of stream gauge deficit zones and design of optimal hydrometric network in mahanadi river basin the third objective is to evaluate adequacy of stream gauge networks in sixteen river basins of peninsular india covering 0 64 million km2 using the proposed methodology to get a glimpse of the scenario of hydrometric networks in those basins the remainder of this paper is structured as follows background on classical shannon information entropy method and its related theoretical improvements exponential information entropy fuzzy information entropy methods are provided in section 2 the methodology proposed for optimal design of hydrometric network is presented in section 3 in section 4 firstly investigations are carried out to evaluate performance of the proposed methodology on mahanadi basin and to illustrate its advantages following this the third objective is addressed finally summary and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 background 2 1 entropy entropy theory gained wide attention over the past few decades and has several applications in hydrology and water resources engineering e g singh 1997 the entropy of a system is generally defined as a measure of inherent disorderliness within the system one of the most distinctive and highlighting features of entropy approach is that hydrometric monitoring networks can be assessed or designed by simultaneously considering each station s individual information gain and mutual information transfer between the stations in the network advantages of such a design approach include i better tailoring optimization of monitoring network to specific applications by accounting the information gain from each station ii flexibility to add user specific criteria and iii ability to accommodate the rising demand for additional stations to meet various needs in the design of optimal monitoring network using multi objective optimization keum et al 2017 let there be n observations of a discrete random variable x such as streamflow whose feasible range could be divided into k discrete intervals shannon 1948 used a measure δ i to quantify the gain in information on the variable x from data points in k th discrete data interval as 1 δ i k x log 1 p n k x log p n k x where n k x is the frequency number of observations of data falling into k th interval which when divided by n yields relative frequency p n k x which denotes the probability of x lying in the interval k therefore k 1 k p n k x 1 and 0 p n k x 1 shannon marginal entropy h s x is a measure of uncertainty in x which is quantified as the expected value of δ i k x 2 h s x e δ i k x k 1 k p n k x log p n k x the base of the logarithm is usually considered as 2 uncertainty for a pair of discrete random variables x and y depicting flows at two stations can be defined by joint entropy h s x y as 3 h s x y k 1 k l 1 l p n k x n l y log p n k x n l y p n k x p n l y where p n k x n l y is the joint probability of an outcome corresponding to k th and l th data intervals of x and y respectively the number of discrete data class intervals for x and y could be based on the ranges of flows observed at the two stations it can be noted from eqs 1 and 2 that in the case of shannon logarithmic entropy measure as p n k x 0 δ i k x and h s x further when p n k x 0 δ i k x and h s x are not defined on the other hand as p n k x 1 δ i k x 0 and h s x 0 when p n k x 1 δ i k x 0 and h s x 0 this implies that the upper bound of shannon entropy is not well defined when p n k x 0 or p n k x 0 when small bin sizes are considered in order to increase accuracy or decrease loss of information the number of data points falling in each bin and hence frequency and entropy value tend to zero this has implications when entropy methods are considered in hydrometric network design in order to overcome this limitation of conventional shannon entropy method pal and pal 1991 considered exponential gain function eq 4 in lieu of logarithmic gain function associated with classical shannon entropy eq 1 as the exponential gain function has several desirable properties 4 δ i k x e 1 p n k x pal and pal 1991 derived expressions for the marginal exponential entropy of random variable x eq 5 and the joint exponential entropy for random variables x and y eq 6 5 h exp x e δ i k x k 1 k p n k x e 1 p n k x 1 6 h exp x y k 1 k l 1 l p n k x n l y e 1 p n k x n l y 1 discretization of data points into different bins to compute entropy leads to information loss in analysis with both conventional shannon entropy and the related improvement exponential entropy e g kotsiantis and kanellopoulos 2006 yu et al 2011 therefore the choice of appropriate bin size is essential to alleviate loss of information but there is no universally established procedure for selection of bin size to address this issue yu et al 2011 derived fuzzy entropy based on shannon entropy to directly compute mutual information between numerical and fuzzy variables based on a relation matrix for discrete variables a crisp equivalence relation matrix can be computed from data and entropy can be estimated in the case of continuous variables fuzzy binary relations are used to compute the relation matrix thus fuzzy information entropy is directly calculated for both continuous and discrete variables without discretization of data points in fuzzy information entropy a relation matrix is formed for each of the stations in the hydrometric network by using streamflow records available for the station let x 1 x n denote observations e g streamflow values at a station which are depicted by a random variable x further let f x represent a fuzzy attribute set which has a fuzzy equivalence relation r f x with x the attribute set may include information related to physiography land use landcover soil and climate descriptors of the catchment contributing flow to the station the fuzzy equivalence relation could be expressed by a relation matrix m r f x as m r f x r 11 x r 12 x r 1 n x r 21 x r 22 x r 2 n x r n 1 x r n 2 x r nn x where 7 r ij x r f x x i x j exp x i x j 2 i j 1 n fuzzy marginal entropy is estimated as 8 h f x 1 n i 1 n log x i r f x n 1 n i 1 n log j 1 n r ij x n it is a common practice to consider the base of the logarithmic function as 2 fuzzy joint entropy between two stations whose observations are depicted by random variables x and y could be estimated as 9 h f x y h f r f x r f y 1 n i 1 n log x i r f x y i r f y n where f y represents the fuzzy attribute set which has a fuzzy equivalence relation r f y with y in order to compute x i r f x y i r f y the intersection of the relation matrices m r f x and m r f y corresponding to x and y is determined as 10 m r f x m r f y r 11 x r 12 x r 1 n x r 21 x r 22 x r 2 n x r n 1 x r n 2 x r nn x r 11 y r 12 y r 1 n y r 21 y r 22 y r 2 n y r n 1 y r n 2 y r nn y r 11 x y r 12 x y r 1 n x y r 21 x y r 22 x y r 2 n x y r n 1 x y r n 2 x y r nn x y mutual information is the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another random variable two random variables have high redundancy if mutual information value is high and they are completely independent if the mutual information value is equal to zero for the random variables x and y mutual information i x y can be computed as 11 i x y h x h y h x y the exponential entropy and fuzzy entropy measures are yet to be used in the context of hydrometric network design 2 2 bin size determination methods discretization of data points is essential to compute the entropy estimates in the case of both shannon and exponential entropy methods as the underlying distribution of flow data is unknown the discretization is quite challenging as no best bin size estimate exists and different bin sizes can reveal different features of the data too small bin width may lead to a histogram that is overly rough whereas too large bin width results in smooth histogram when compared to the true probability density function pdf an increase in roughness causes the variance of estimated pdf to be too high whereas increase in smoothness results in a significant amount of bias therefore based on the actual data distribution and goals of the analysis appropriate bin size may vary and hence experimentation is required to fix the optimal bin width some options available for bin size estimation include i sturge s rule sturges 1926 ii rice rule lane 2006 iii doane s formula doane 1976 iv bendat and piersol formula bendat and piersol 1966 v cochran s formula cochran 1954 vi knuth s rule knuth 2006 vii freedman diaconis rule freedman and diaconis 1981 viii

13 18 respectively following this bin width h corresponding to the k value is determined using eq 12 whereas for the rules formulae numbered vii ix bin width h is first estimated using eqs 19 21 respectively the estimate of h is then used in eq 12 to determine k 12 k max i 1 n x i min i 1 n x i h where max and min are functions considered for determining maximum and minimum values in the

value of h min was considered to be equal to the minimum measurement resolution 1 cm of gauges in the study area whereas hmax was set as the range of flow observations further details on the procedure for computation of optimal bin width using shimazaki and shinomoto rule can be found in khan and valeo 2016 3 proposed methodology a methodology based on fuzzy information entropy is proposed for evaluation and design of hydrometric network in a river basin it adapts ideas scattered in previous studies alfonso et al 2010a mishra and coulibaly 2010 samuel et al 2013 and proposes the use of fuzzy entropy in lieu of shannon and exponential entropy owing to its advantages the methodology involves the following steps 1 prioritizing ranking of stream gauge stations in the existing hydrometric network this would help in identifying stations that have high or low significance in gathering flow information gauges having high significance could be possibly upgraded by making them automated for meeting short or long term goals on the other hand gauges that have less significance could be decommissioned or moved to another location if there are economical constraints in their maintenance ranking of existing stations in a river basin should be carried out by ensuring that it meets two conditions c1 flows at stations should have less redundant information i e having less inter site dependence and mutual information and c2 each station should individually provide high information content implying high marginal entropy alfonso et al 2010a to prioritise gauges in the study area for each station i i 1 n estimate a marginal entropy h x i and b mutual information with each of the n stations including itself in order to prepare a mutual information vector ν i m i x i x 1 m i x i x i m i x i x j m i x i x n where m i x i x j denotes mutual information for i th station with j th station determined by considering an effective entropy procedure mutual information of a station with itself e g m i x i x i is equal to its marginal entropy station s r where r 1 which has the maximum marginal entropy indicating highest importance in gathering flow information is identified as h x s r max 1 i n h x i and ranked first in the desired ranks set ξ the mutual information vector ν s corresponding to the station s r is prepared and its elements are divided into two sets namely independent set and dependent set the independent set s s r ind comprises mi values which are lower than a specified threshold ε and the dependent set s s r dep comprises mi values that are above the threshold high mi value between any two stations indicates that flows at those stations have high redundancy implying that the presence of only one of those stations could be adequate to gather information on flows in the study area from s s r ind the stations which have mutual information with station s in the ranks set ξ are noted among the noted stations the one having the highest marginal entropy value is identified as the next ranked station s r 1 in the ranks set ξ to fulfill the condition c2 further ν s is updated by combining the mutual information vectors of the stations s r and s r 1 elements of the updated ν s are divided into independent and dependent sets considering the threshold ε as described above from the independent set stations which have mi with stations in ξ are noted from among those noted stations the one with highest marginal entropy is chosen and assigned the next rank in the ranks set the foregoing process of ranking of stations is continued till all the stations in the basin are assigned priority ranks 2 identifying stream gauge deficit zones in a river basin to identify the deficit zones entropy estimates marginal entropy joint entropy and mutual information are obtained for each station using fuzzy entropy procedure the mutual information is determined between the observed flows x i and estimated flows x i for each station i 1 n at monthly scale by considering x for y in eq 11 let ω denote the total number of months for which the n stations have contemporaneous record the equations useful for estimating different entropy measures in analysis with shannon entropy exponential entropy and the proposed fuzzy entropy are provided in section 2 1 at each station the flows x i are estimated using the information on observed monthly flows at all other n 1 stations for this purpose multiple linear regression mlr relationships of the form x i a i b i z i are developed where z i is a n 1 ω matrix containing contemporaneous flows observed at all other n 1 stations while a i and b i are matrices containing regression parameters whose dimensions are 1 ω and 1 n 1 respectively a similar procedure was considered in a previous study mishra and coulibaly 2010 for analysis with shannon entropy to identify stream gauge deficit zones the mutual information of station i denoted as m i i indicates redundancy of information transfer between the station i and the other n 1 stations a high low value for mutual information indicates high low dependence 3 mutual information index mii value was computed for each station i as m i i m i min m i max m i min where m i max and m i min denote respectively the maximum and minimum among the mi values of all the stations in the river basin the computed mii values could be spatially interpolated using any effective method e g spline tension method the river basin could be classified into five zones based on the interpolated mii values the zones are referred to as highly deficit 0 mii 0 2 deficit 0 2 mii 0 4 average 0 4 mii 0 6 above average 0 6 mii 0 8 and excess 0 8 mii 1 0 if a zone is classified as above average or excess in terms of mii the existing hydrometric network in the zone could be deemed adequate implying there is no need for expansion of the network calculation of the required number of potential stations this involves regionalization of the study area e g river basin into different physiographic units in order to assess the adequacy of the stream gauge network the world meteorological organization wmo 2008 recommends minimum density of streamflow stations in km2 station to be 1000 1875 1875 2750 300 and 20 000 for mountains interior plains hilly undulating areas coastal areas small islands and polar arid regions respectively based on this the minimum required number of gauges for each of the physiographic units could be determined however it is to be noted that there is ambiguity in classifying a given area into different physiographic units as there are no established guidelines let m denote the minimum requirement of gauges over all the physiographic units in the target river basin if m exceeds the count of existing stations n then density of streamflow stations in the basin could be considered inadequate on the other hand if n is much larger than m then the number of available stations could be deemed excessive in both cases the physiographic unit s for which the original station count is higher lower than the minimum required number of potential stations has to be identified in a physiographic unit which has excessive stations the stations could be ranked using the procedure described in step 1 subsequently the stations to be decommissioned could be identified one at a time in descending order of their ranks until the station mii value is 0 6 or the number of stations remaining in the physiographic unit after decommissioning is equal to the minimum required number of potential stations for the physiographic unit on the other hand if the station count is inadequate in any physiographic unit then difference between the required and available number of stations could be computed to determine the additional number of stations to be commissioned using procedure described in step 4 to ensure validity of the minimum density requirements of wmo 2008 4 determination of potential locations of additional stations to expand an existing hydrometric network possible locations of additional p stations could be chosen from outlets of sub basins delineated in the study area river basin sensitivity analysis could be performed to fix a threshold area for delineation of adequate number of sub basins possibly using arcgis software such that the count of existing stations together with the identified potential locations for additional stations is more than the minimum requirement determined in step 3 for different physiographic units in the target river basin 5 estimation of streamflow at the identified potential locations contemporaneous flows are generated at potential locations of stations a hydrologic model capable of simulating flows in an ungauged basin can be used for this purpose the generated flows together with the observed flows at the existing stations are used to compute entropy measures marginal entropy joint entropy mutual information for use in step 6 6 optimization of the hydrometric network any potential optimization algorithm e g nsga ii fast non dominated sorting genetic algorithm could be considered to determine the optimal number of stations required for expansion of the hydrometric network in the target river basin two objective functions are chosen in this study one of those minimizes fuzzy mutual information which quantifies dependence of flow at each station on flows at all other stations and the other maximizes fuzzy joint entropy which provides the maximum information content with minimum shared information between each station and other stations further decision variables are considered as the total number of stations in the expanded network p n and constraint is set as n p m based on step 4 4 case study 4 1 study area and its streamflow network the area chosen for case study comprises 16 river basins in peninsula india which encompass about 52 of the total geographical area of the country containing more than half of its population the area is located towards south of vindhya and satpura mountain ranges fig 1 and it has a typical monsoon climate with large spatial and temporal variation in rainfall and temperature owing to which there is a highly skewed distribution of water resources table 1 provides details of physiography drainage area climate mean temperature mean annual rainfall and hydrometric network number of gauges and the period over which they have a contemporaneous record pertaining to the 16 river basins the gauges are maintained by the central water commission cwc of india and their daily records were available from the wris water resources information system database www india wris nrsc gov in monthly streamflows were estimated from the daily records overall records of 317 stations were available in the river basins out of which 291 stations were active up to 2006 nearly 20 stations have continuous records over the 50 year period since 1965 further about 150 stations have continuous records over a 30 year period between 1985 and 2012 the density of gauges decreased considerably since 2004 fig 2 possibly due to a decline in financial resources for maintaining gauges and shifting of gauges for achieving short term goals priorities similar observations were made by ruhi et al 2018 on a global scale using analogous figure in this context it is essential to investigate adequacy of stream gauge networks in indian river basins as there is no such previous study for investigations on the hydrometric network in river basins 281 stations having at least 9 years of contemporaneous records were considered fig 2 data gaps in the records of selected stations were ensured to be 20 as in the previous studies e g mishra and coulibaly 2010 and those gaps were filled using arima kalman smoothening technique moritz et al 2015 before embarking on application of proposed fuzzy entropy method to the entire peninsula india potential of the method in overcoming drawbacks of shannon entropy and exponential entropy methods was investigated by considering hydrometric network in mahanadi basin comprising 19 stations having flow records from 1989 to 2012 table 1 following this fuzzy entropy method was used to assess adequacy of stream gauges in hydrometric networks of other river basins in peninsula india 4 2 prioritizing stations in the existing hydrometric network of mahanadi basin prioritization of stations in terms of their importance in gathering flow information is required in studies undertaken to redesign retrofit a network possibly by shifting decommissioning existing gauges or adding new gauges from this perspective priority ranks were assigned to the existing stream gauges in mahanadi basin using the procedure described in step 1 of section 3 in analysis with fuzzy entropy method fuzzy entropy estimates were obtained for the 19 stations and they were used to determine ranks for the stations in order of their importance a major limitation issue in determining station ranks in the case of analysis with shannon and exponential entropy methods is that entropy estimates obtained using the methods are sensitive to class interval or bin size chosen to discretize data of the stations considered e g valdes et al 1975 chapman 1986 chacon hurtado et al 2017 often modelers consider different bin size estimation rules therefore to illustrate sensitivity of entropy estimates to bin size probability entropy estimates were determined by considering nine bin size estimation rules formulae described in section 2 2 the optimum number of bins k were estimated to be 881 13 92 35 21 58 33 949 and 27 792 respectively using freedman diaconis rule sturge s rule scott s rule rice rule doane s formula bendat and piersol formula cochran s formula knuth s rule and shimazaki and shinomoto rule this indicates that there is considerable uncertainty in bin size estimates obtained using different rules the optimum number of bins determined using shimazaki and shinomoto rule were found to be very large when compared with those determined using the other rules formulae this is because with decrease in h value in the range h min h max the value of cost function cd decreased exponentially consequently the chosen optimal bin width h was equal to hmin and the corresponding optimum number of bins k attained a large value as evident from eq 12 even the estimates of k obtained using freedman diaconis rule and knuth s rule were marginally high in analysis with knuth s rule the optimum number of bins corresponds to maximum value for logarithm of the marginal posterior probability function eq 18 the graph plotted between the number of bins on abscissa versus estimate of the function as ordinate was positively skewed the function attained its peak value at m 949 and decreased drastically thereafter in analysis with freedman diaconis rule the estimate of bin width h was smaller as the interquartile range of flow data was smaller hence the corresponding number of bins k was a large value as evident from eq 12 none of the bin size estimates can be considered preferable as there is no universally superior bin size estimation rule formula hence a detailed insight of bin size effect on entropy estimates was deemed necessary the station ranks obtained using shannon entropy method by considering bin size based on freedman diaconis rule sturge s rule were found to be mostly consistent inconsistent with the ranks obtained using fuzzy entropy method further ranks obtained by considering knuth s rule were comparable to those obtained using freedman diaconis rule for several stations fig 3 on the other hand ranks obtained using exponential entropy method were not consistent with those obtained based on fuzzy entropy method or shannon entropy method with bin sizes determined using any of the rules formulae among the shannon and exponential entropy methods the latter exhibited higher sensitivity in station ranks to the chosen bin size rule formula figs 3 and 4 to gain further insight into sensitivity of the shannon and exponential entropy methods to bin size h was varied from 0 5 to 10 m3 s as noted in mishra and coulibaly 2010 by considering 0 5 m3 s increments station ranks were determined for every bin size in the chosen interval 0 5 10 in analysis with both the methods results obtained in the case of shannon entropy method indicated that station ranks were less sensitive to bin size chosen in the interval 5 5 10 and several of those ranks were comparable to those determined using fuzzy entropy method interestingly for majority of stations the ranks determined using fuzzy entropy method are more consistent with ranks obtained corresponding to bin widths 2 m3 s k 6948 2 5 m3 s k 5558 and 4 m3 s k 3474 than with ranks computed using shannon entropy method by considering different bin size estimation rules fig 5 on the other hand in the case of exponential entropy method uncertainty in station ranks to bin size was generally high in the interval 0 5 10 and it was found to be highest for the range 0 5 5 overall the results indicated that ranks assigned to stations based on shannon and exponential entropy methods generally vary sometimes significantly with bin size causing ambiguity in deciding correct ranks for stations this issue is overcome by resorting to fuzzy entropy method as the method alleviates discretization of data into bins 4 3 identification of stream gauge deficit zones in mahanadi basin stream gauge deficit zones were identified in mahanadi basin by analysing spatial variability of mii estimates obtained using fuzzy entropy method and existing shannon and exponential entropy methods by considering bin sizes determined using nine rules formulae as described in step 2 of section 3 to determine mii flows x i were predicted using the mlr approach markus et al 2003 considering the assumptions of linearity to be appropriate analysis was carried out on streamflow records of the basin to verify if four major assumptions of mlr approach i e linearity multivariate normality multicollinearity and homoscedasticity were satisfied for this purpose residuals were determined between x i and x i the linearity cohen et al 1983 and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested using scatter plots between standardized residuals and standardized x i values for each of the stations the plots exhibited linear pattern indicating that the assumption of linearity is valid further data points depicting residuals in the plot appeared evenly distributed about the linear pattern over the range of all the predicted values x i indicating that the assumption of homoscedasticity is valid further probability plots and q q plots of the residuals were considered to check validity of multivariate normality assumption the plots indicated that the residuals could be considered as normally distributed for majority of the stations slight deviations from normality may not induce bias in mlr coefficients e g williams et al 2013 even the inter site pearson s product moment correlations were found to be weak for majority of stations in the study area indicating multicollinearity assumption could be considered applicable to determine mii estimates of marginal entropy joint entropy and mutual information mi were obtained for all the existing stations in the river basin using each of the entropy methods fuzzy shannon and exponential the area of the basin was classified into 5 mii zones based on interpolated mii values they are referred to as highly deficit zone 0 mii 0 2 deficit zone 0 2 mii 0 4 average zone 0 4 mii 0 6 above average zone 0 6 mii 0 8 and excess zone 0 8 mii 1 a comparative study of entropy estimates obtained corresponding to various bin size determination methods was carried out to understand the extent of uncertainty prevailing within each entropy method shannon exponential in order to investigate this mii maps were created as described in section 3 step 2 corresponding to each entropy method and bin size determination method formula listed in section 2 2 separately and the pba mii percentage of the basin area falling in different mii zones were compared fig 6 in analysis with shannon entropy method the pba mii obtained using scott s rule and freedman diaconis rule were highly comparable with the corresponding estimates obtained using fuzzy entropy method in contrast pba mii obtained using sturge s rule and rice rule were much different table 3 a in analysis with exponential entropy method data discretization using scott s rule yielded pba mii which appeared similar to those from fuzzy entropy method table 3 b 4 4 determination of the required number of potential stations and their locations to assess if density of stream gauges in the existing network meets wmo 2008 guidelines area of mahanadi basis was classified into four physiographic units low lying coastal interior plains hilly undulating and mountainous areas using 30 m resolution srtm dem table 2 regions having elevation 100 m were classified as low lying coastal areas whereas those having elevation in the range 100 400 m and 400 600 m were referred to as interior plains and hilly undulating areas respectively mountainous areas were considered as those having elevation greater than 600 m estimates of the minimum number of gauges for each physiographic unit were determined separately considering wmo 2008 guidelines described in step 3 of section 3 table 2 and total minimum requirement of gauges stations for the basin as well as each physiographic unit were computed the existing number 19 of gauges in the mahanadi network was way below the minimum requirement of 83 stations estimated by wmo 2008 guidelines hence expansion of the existing network is deemed mandatory for the basin in order to identify various feasible options for locating at least 64 83 19 additional stations threshold area for delineating sub basins in mahanadi basin was chosen as 0 64 of the basin area 1 41 589 km2 which yielded 98 sub basins the outlets of those 98 sub basins were considered as potential locations for the proposed additional stations 4 5 estimation of streamflow at potential gauge locations using swat monthly streamflows at the potential gauge locations in mahanadi basin were generated using arcswat for the period 1989 2012 over which contemporaneous observed monthly flows were available for the 19 existing stations swat is a physically based semi distributed model which simulates hydrological processes e g runoff streamflow evapotranspiration in a river basin by dividing it into sub basins which are further discretized into various hydrological response units hrus that are homogeneous in slope soil land use landcover and management conditions the model lumps the outflow of various hrus in a sub basin to obtain the total runoff ensuring overall water balance which is subsequently routed through the channel network in the river basin to obtain the total runoff at the basin outlet further details on swat can be found in neitsch et al 2011 input to a swat model includes data related to topography climate land use landcover lulc and soils the topography of the basin was considered in the form of 90 m resolution srtm shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model dem climate data included that on i daily rainfall 0 25 resolution for the period 1979 2017 and daily temperature 1 resolution for the period 1979 2012 procured from imd india meteorological department ii wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation 0 3125 resolution for the period 1948 2015 from cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis database the lulc data was extracted from a 1 km resolution global land cover characterization glcc database which was prepared using avhrr source imagery covering the period 1992 1993 further soil data was based on 1 5 million resolution world soil maps of fao unesco food and agricultural organisation of the united nations united nations educational scientific and cultural organisation to calibrate swat mahanadi basin was delineated into sub basins corresponding to the 19 gauging stations using arcswat the sub basins encompass the entire basin area the swat was calibrated using the swat cup to simulate monthly flows in each of the 19 sub basins for the period 1989 2012 the calibration involved identification of the sensitive parameters out of the 20 parameters given in table 4 for each basin separately by performing sensitivity analysis through sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 abbaspour et al 2004 procedure using swat cup calibration and uncertainty programs the model performance was evaluated in terms of four performance measures nse r2 ioa and pi described in appendix boxplots showing variation of estimates of each of these measures across the 19 stations are presented in fig 7 from the figure it can be noted that average estimates of nse ioa and r2 across 19 stations are 0 63 0 86 and 0 70 respectively further average estimate of pi across the stations for 1 2 and 3 month lead times was 0 61 0 786 0 83 respectively hence the performance of the calibrated swat model is deemed fairly good the calibrated model was subsequently used to generate monthly flows for the period 1989 2012 at the 98 potential station locations identified in section 4 4 each of which is situated in one of the 19 sub basins of the mahanadi basin 4 6 optimization of the hydrometric network using nsga ii optimization algorithm nsga ii was used to identify optimal locations from the 98 potential locations for setting up new stations in the mahanadi basin to meet wmo s 2008 guidelines it is an elitist multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea which uses an efficient crowding distance assignment methodology deb et al 2002 this algorithm has a good global search ability to find a set of well distributed non dominated solutions at an acceptable level i e pareto optimal solutions it is used to minimize the chosen two objective functions subject to one constraint step 6 of section 3 the estimates of mutual information and joint entropy computed using shannon exponential and fuzzy entropy methods were obtained based on contemporaneous flows at 117 locations including 19 existing stations and 98 potential locations in the basin for the period 1989 2012 the number of decision variables was 117 each decision variable depicts information on continuation or establishment of a station gauge at each of the referred 117 locations the 117 decision variables were considered in the form of a binary encoded chromosome string having 117 bits with each bit representing a location in the basin the decision variables bits corresponding to all the existing stations were set to 1 indicating that they are to be retained in the optimized network whereas bits corresponding to the 98 potential new locations had the flexibility to be set to either 1 if there can be a station at the new location or zero otherwise one hundred chromosomes strings were randomly generated within the search space to represent the population the optimization algorithm was run for 2000 iterations each comprising 100 chromosomes by considering crossover probability and mutation rate as 0 8 and 0 001 respectively thus overall 200 100 chromosomes each depicting a different network configuration were obtained and analysed to arrive at the pareto optimal solution in the case of fuzzy entropy method there were 102 pareto optimal points each depicting a different network configuration out of which 40 points were chosen from the central region of the pareto optimal solution for identification of the optimal network configuration in the 40 network configurations apart from the 19 existing stations 66 potential new stations locations with the highest repeated occurrences i e at least more than 70 repetitions were identified to meet wmo 2008 recommendations see section 4 4 the number of gauges required in hilly undulating regions coastal region interior plains and mountainous regions of the study area were estimated to be 12 6 52 and 13 respectively which together add to 83 stations among the physiographic regions mountainous region has limited spatial extent 8 4 of the total area and is not geographically contiguous it is rather scattered along the periphery of the mahanadi river basin and does not contain any major stream hence estimated 13 stream gauge stations are not deemed necessary in those mountainous areas among the existing 19 stations 1 is in hilly undulating region 1 is located in coastal region and the remaining 17 are located in interior plains apart from the 19 existing stations and 13 estimated for mountainous areas locations of 51 83 19 13 additional stations had to be identified from the 66 potential new gauge locations in order to meet the minimum density requirements of wmo 2008 in different physiographic units for this purpose priority ranks were assigned to the 66 new station locations following the procedure described in step 1 of section 3 subsequently the stations falling in each physiographic unit and their corresponding ranks were taken into account to identify optimal locations of additional gauges in the physiographic units the newly identified station locations were 11 s1 s11 in hilly undulating region 5 s12 s16 in coastal region and 35 s17 s51 in interior plains the 51 additional stations s1 s51 along with the existing 19 gauged stations form the suggested optimal hydrometric network in the mahanadi basin fig 8 the optimal network determined using the proposed fuzzy entropy method is compared with optimal networks designed using shannon and exponential entropy methods considering the nine bin size determination rules formulae for each of the latter methods table 5 shows the effect of bin size determination rules formulae on i the number of pareto optimal solutions ii estimate of station count in the optimal network and iii the number of stations which match with those in the optimal network found using fuzzy entropy method in general considerable differences were evident in network configurations obtained using both shannon and exponential entropy methods by considering different bin size estimation rules in comparison to exponential entropy method shannon entropy method yielded networks whose configurations had more resemblance to configuration of the network obtained using fuzzy entropy method the resemblance was specifically more for the configurations found using freedman diaconis rule table 5 in analysis based on shannon entropy method with freedman diaconis rule 116 pareto optimal network configurations were obtained in which 76 stations had more repeated occurrences among the 76 stations 56 were found in the optimal network determined using fuzzy entropy method analysis with exponential entropy method failed to generate pareto optimal solution for the objective function when bin width was chosen using sturge s rule scott s rule knuth s rule or doane s formula see table 5 overall it can be inferred from the results presented in this section that in analysis with shannon and exponential entropy methods there is considerable uncertainty in entropy estimates which are used for prioritizing stations determining pba mii and design of optimal networks the uncertainty is alleviated in analysis with proposed fuzzy entropy method further it is found that results based on shannon entropy method with bin size computed using freedman diaconis rule are somewhat comparable to those based on the fuzzy entropy method the fuzzy entropy method which is more appealing is considered in the following section for analysis on other river basins in the peninsular india 4 7 assessment of adequacy of existing streamgauge networks in 16 river basins of peninsula india analysis on the 317 stations maintained by cwc in the peninsular river basins of india indicated that the density of existing stations decreased drastically by 2004 hence it is essential to evaluate the adequacy of the existing streamgauge networks and plan for optimal expansion of the same if necessary for this purpose streamgauge deficit zones were identified in 16 river basins of peninsula india using the procedure described in step 2 of section 3 considering fuzzy entropy procedure which was found effective in the previous section the fmii interpolation maps were created for all the 16 river basins fig 9 and the percentage of area belonging to each fmii zone was calculated for each basin table 2 results indicate that in 11 out of 16 basins more than 32 of the area is classified as belonging to highly deficit and deficit zones it can also be noted that 8 out of 16 basins have more than 40 000 km2 area belonging to highly deficit and deficit zones further among all the basins largest area 1 25 124 km2 in godavari basin and largest percentage area 78 5 in pennar basin belong to these two deficit zones which are very sparse in terms of gauges indicating that expansion of hydrometric network in those areas is necessary in order to validate the inferences further regionalisation analysis was carried out to categorise each basin into different wmo physiographic units mountains interior plains hilly undulating areas coastal areas small islands and polar arid regions the minimum number of stations required for each physiographic unit was calculated separately to arrive at the minimum number of stations required in each basin to meet the wmo guidelines results indicated that out of the 16 basins 6 have more than 42 of their area in coastal regions and another 8 have more than 41 of their area in interior plains the remaining two basins have a larger part of their area classified as hilly undulating or mountainous table 2 thus it was inferred that station density in all the peninsular basins was way below the minimum density guidelines set by wmo 2008 and this indicates pressing demand for expansion of the existing networks 5 summary and conclusions fuzzy entropy methodology is presented for design of hydrometric network advantage of the methodology over shannon and exponential entropy methods was demonstrated through a case study on mahanadi basin in india by considering various bin size estimation methods rules in analysis with the latter two methods the investigations showed that bin size estimation or discretisation of data induces considerable uncertainty in shannon and exponential entropy estimates which has associated problems artefacts this uncertainty is overcome by the proposed fuzzy entropy method as it alleviates the need for discretisation of data this is the first study of its kind which compares the effect of bin width computed using nine different bin size estimation rules along with arbitrarily chosen bin sizes on the shannon and exponential entropy estimates and applications based on them concerning i determination of station priority ranks ii identification of stream gauge deficit zones and iii design of optimal hydrometric network in river basins priority ranks assigned to stream gauge stations in mahanadi basin using fuzzy entropy method were compared with those obtained with shannon entropy method the ranks were more comparable for sees shannon entropy estimates obtained for arbitrarily chosen bin widths equal to 2 m3 s k 6948 2 5 m3 s k 5558 and 4 m3 s k 3474 they were fairly comparable when sees were determined using freedman diaconis rule and knuth s rule and least comparable when sees were determined using shrug s rule on the other hand there is great discrepancy in ranks assigned to stations in analysis with exponential entropy determined by considering all the nine bin size estimation rules and arbitrarily choosing bin sizes in the range 0 5 10 entropy estimates obtained using each of the methods were considered to determine stream gauge deficit zones in mahanadi basin the zones resulting from shannon entropy estimates obtained with freedman diaconis rule and from exponential entropy estimates obtained with scot s rule resembled the zones formed using the fuzzy entropy estimates both shannon and exponential entropy methods showed the highest variability in pba mii in analysis with doane s formula overall uncertainty in percentage of the basin area classified into different mii zones is less with shannon entropy method than with the exponential entropy method the nsga ii optimisation procedure suggested for determining optimal hydrometric network provides several feasible pareto optimal solutions the results obtained with different entropy methods and nine bin size estimation rules wherever applicable indicated that the number of pareto optimal solutions as well as the number of optimal number of stations vary with chosen entropy method and bin size since the fuzzy entropy method does not involve data discretisation the method is deemed to perform better and the results showed that networks determined using both shannon and exponential entropy estimates obtained with freedman diaconis rule resemble that formed using fuzzy entropy method in general the estimates obtained using shannon entropy method were closer to those obtained using the fuzzy entropy method however there is no agreement as to which bin size estimation method would yield accurate result with the shannon entropy approach and there is no standardized established procedure to determine optimum bin width these inferences are in agreement with the findings of previous studies e g gislason and goldfield 1984 the idea of optimum bin width is to choose a bin width sufficiently large to capture the major features in the data while ignoring fine details due to random sampling fluctuations however as the fuzzy entropy method does not involve discretization of data to bins and considers each value separately to form a relation matrix it takes into account even the finer details associated with the data there is lack of information on the existing scenario of stream gauge networks in indian river basins hence a case study was performed on 16 river basins in peninsula india using the proposed fuzzy entropy method to identify stream gauge deficit excess zones and assess if the existing stream gauge networks in those basins meet wmo 2008 guidelines the results revealed that stream gauge networks in peninsular india are inadequate for effective monitoring of flows and there is a need for their expansion in all the 16 river basins the number of existing stations in the peninsular india having at least 9 years of contemporaneous records is only 281 however analysis performed by considering wmo guidelines indicate need for at least 1007 stations for properly monitoring flows in the 16 basins the information discerned in this study would be useful to the concerned government agencies for taking decisions on improving the network configuration through expansion installing new stations and relocation decommissioning of stations wherever necessary the proposed methodology could be applied to river basins in various other parts of the world to strengthen the conclusions drawn based on this study in making such attempts it is to be noted that the wmo recommendations are for setting up a minimum network as initial stage the network could be further expanded based on factors such as spatial variability of local regional water needs population density flood risk flow regime alterations and other factors it is also worth mentioning that the proposed methodology could be readily considered for the evaluation of networks monitoring other hydro meteorological e g precipitation temperature and hydrological e g groundwater variables and water

monitoring various other hydrometeorological variables keywords fuzzy entropy shannon entropy exponential entropy hydrometric monitoring network bin size estimation methods india 1 introduction in the past few decades there is growth in evidence of intensification of the global hydrologic cycle due to climate change associated with anthropogenic forcing in this perspective there is a need for effective and efficient hydrometric network for monitoring water quantity and quality related parameters in different subsystems of the hydrologic cycle this is because timely availability of data is useful for various purposes such as i water resources planning assessment to upkeep human and ecosystem needs ii forecasting extreme hydrologic events and assessing the associated risk and iii assessment of the effects of flow regime alterations and related flow ecology interactions although many developed countries have dense and largely operative stream gauge stations they tend to be spatially clustered and short lived because most of the data collection is reliant on development projects ruhi et al 2018 enormous loss in hydrometric monitoring network has been observed in the past few decades in both developed and developing countries due to economic constraints and changing government priorities lanfear and hirsch 1999 spence et al 2007 mishra and coulibaly 2009 ruhi et al 2018 for a hydrometric network design it is important to account for spatial and temporal variability of the target hydrometric variable s considering the economical and network density aspects it is vital to have an optimized network with minimum redundancy of information krajewski et al 1991 bardossy and das 2008 in the recent decades there is growth in interest to develop approaches for i identifying deficit zones in the existing stream gauge network and for ii designing an optimized network mishra and coulibaly 2010 the existing methods for network design include statistical methods moss 1982 tasker 1986 morin et al 1979 burn and goulter 1991 information theory based methods husain 1987 husain 1989 yang and burn 1994 mishra and coulibaly 2010 samuel et al 2011 leach et al 2015 user survey based methods singh et al 1986 davar and brimley 1990 hybrid methods fiering 1965 pardo iguzquiza 1998 markus et al 2003 samuel et al 2013 physiographic component based methods carpenter et al 1987 basist et al 1994 laize 2004 skok 2006 and sampling strategies bras et al 1988 tsintikidis et al 2002 mishra and coulibaly 2009 provided an extensive review of various commonly used hydrometric network design methods and concluded that the entropy based method is one of the most promising options for network design keum et al 2017 had done an extensive review of literature on entropy applications to water monitoring network and concluded that a comparative study among multiple entropy design methods discretization approaches and data characterization should be done to provide generic guidelines for hydrologic network design however to date none of the studies have focused on these aspects and no standardized approach has evolved for hydrometric network design many researchers have applied the classical shannon entropy method shannon 1948 for hydrometric network design by prioritizing stream gauges the prioritization is done to reduce the redundancy by minimizing mutual information of stream gauges alfonso et al 2010a alfonso et al 2010b brunsell 2010 mishra and coulibaly 2010 mahjouri and kerachian 2011 li et al 2012 mishra and coulibaly 2014 leach et al 2015 keum and coulibaly 2017 however the application of the classical shannon entropy for gauge network design has some limitations if uniform probability distribution is considered to determine the probability required for estimation of entropy shannon entropy does not have a fixed upper bound this limitation was overcome by pal and pal 1991 by introducing a new entropy approach called exponential entropy whose advantages are yet to be explored in the context of hydrometric network design in applying shannon mutual information for real time scenarios probabilities are unknown and must be estimated with a finite set of observations by calculating their frequency of occurrence in analysis with a continuous random variable probability density could be estimated by i discretizing observations of the variable ching et al 1995 into some arbitrary number of bins and using the information to estimate probabilities or ii using parzen window kwak and choi 2002 discretization can lead to information loss shen and jensen 2004 li et al 2012 whereas estimation of probability density with parzen window is time consuming in order to overcome these limitations yu et al 2011 proposed a new approach called fuzzy information entropy which permits the computation of mutual information between numerical or fuzzy variables without discretization however the potential of fuzzy information entropy is not tested in the context of hydrometric network design the primary objective of this study is to develop a methodology for optimal design of hydrometric network using fuzzy information entropy potential of the developed methodology is demonstrated over conventional shannon information entropy approach and its related theoretical improvement eebm exponential entropy based methodology by application to hydrometric network in mahanadi basin of india which is frequently prone to floods the second objective is to investigate the effect of various bin size estimation rules on shannon and exponential entropy estimates and identify if the estimates obtained using any of the rules closely resemble fuzzy entropy estimates the effect of entropy estimation method and bin size estimation rule was examined on prioritization of stations for data collection identification of stream gauge deficit zones and design of optimal hydrometric network in mahanadi river basin the third objective is to evaluate adequacy of stream gauge networks in sixteen river basins of peninsular india covering 0 64 million km2 using the proposed methodology to get a glimpse of the scenario of hydrometric networks in those basins the remainder of this paper is structured as follows background on classical shannon information entropy method and its related theoretical improvements exponential information entropy fuzzy information entropy methods are provided in section 2 the methodology proposed for optimal design of hydrometric network is presented in section 3 in section 4 firstly investigations are carried out to evaluate performance of the proposed methodology on mahanadi basin and to illustrate its advantages following this the third objective is addressed finally summary and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 background 2 1 entropy entropy theory gained wide attention over the past few decades and has several applications in hydrology and water resources engineering e g singh 1997 the entropy of a system is generally defined as a measure of inherent disorderliness within the system one of the most distinctive and highlighting features of entropy approach is that hydrometric monitoring networks can be assessed or designed by simultaneously considering each station s individual information gain and mutual information transfer between the stations in the network advantages of such a design approach include i better tailoring optimization of monitoring network to specific applications by accounting the information gain from each station ii flexibility to add user specific criteria and iii ability to accommodate the rising demand for additional stations to meet various needs in the design of optimal monitoring network using multi objective optimization keum et al 2017 let there be n observations of a discrete random variable x such as streamflow whose feasible range could be divided into k discrete intervals shannon 1948 used a measure δ i to quantify the gain in information on the variable x from data points in k th discrete data interval as 1 δ i k x log 1 p n k x log p n k x where n k x is the frequency number of observations of data falling into k th interval which when divided by n yields relative frequency p n k x which denotes the probability of x lying in the interval k therefore k 1 k p n k x 1 and 0 p n k x 1 shannon marginal entropy h s x is a measure of uncertainty in x which is quantified as the expected value of δ i k x 2 h s x e δ i k x k 1 k p n k x log p n k x the base of the logarithm is usually considered as 2 uncertainty for a pair of discrete random variables x and y depicting flows at two stations can be defined by joint entropy h s x y as 3 h s x y k 1 k l 1 l p n k x n l y log p n k x n l y p n k x p n l y where p n k x n l y is the joint probability of an outcome corresponding to k th and l th data intervals of x and y respectively the number of discrete data class intervals for x and y could be based on the ranges of flows observed at the two stations it can be noted from eqs 1 and 2 that in the case of shannon logarithmic entropy measure as p n k x 0 δ i k x and h s x further when p n k x 0 δ i k x and h s x are not defined on the other hand as p n k x 1 δ i k x 0 and h s x 0 when p n k x 1 δ i k x 0 and h s x 0 this implies that the upper bound of shannon entropy is not well defined when p n k x 0 or p n k x 0 when small bin sizes are considered in order to increase accuracy or decrease loss of information the number of data points falling in each bin and hence frequency and entropy value tend to zero this has implications when entropy methods are considered in hydrometric network design in order to overcome this limitation of conventional shannon entropy method pal and pal 1991 considered exponential gain function eq 4 in lieu of logarithmic gain function associated with classical shannon entropy eq 1 as the exponential gain function has several desirable properties 4 δ i k x e 1 p n k x pal and pal 1991 derived expressions for the marginal exponential entropy of random variable x eq 5 and the joint exponential entropy for random variables x and y eq 6 5 h exp x e δ i k x k 1 k p n k x e 1 p n k x 1 6 h exp x y k 1 k l 1 l p n k x n l y e 1 p n k x n l y 1 discretization of data points into different bins to compute entropy leads to information loss in analysis with both conventional shannon entropy and the related improvement exponential entropy e g kotsiantis and kanellopoulos 2006 yu et al 2011 therefore the choice of appropriate bin size is essential to alleviate loss of information but there is no universally established procedure for selection of bin size to address this issue yu et al 2011 derived fuzzy entropy based on shannon entropy to directly compute mutual information between numerical and fuzzy variables based on a relation matrix for discrete variables a crisp equivalence relation matrix can be computed from data and entropy can be estimated in the case of continuous variables fuzzy binary relations are used to compute the relation matrix thus fuzzy information entropy is directly calculated for both continuous and discrete variables without discretization of data points in fuzzy information entropy a relation matrix is formed for each of the stations in the hydrometric network by using streamflow records available for the station let x 1 x n denote observations e g streamflow values at a station which are depicted by a random variable x further let f x represent a fuzzy attribute set which has a fuzzy equivalence relation r f x with x the attribute set may include information related to physiography land use landcover soil and climate descriptors of the catchment contributing flow to the station the fuzzy equivalence relation could be expressed by a relation matrix m r f x as m r f x r 11 x r 12 x r 1 n x r 21 x r 22 x r 2 n x r n 1 x r n 2 x r nn x where 7 r ij x r f x x i x j exp x i x j 2 i j 1 n fuzzy marginal entropy is estimated as 8 h f x 1 n i 1 n log x i r f x n 1 n i 1 n log j 1 n r ij x n it is a common practice to consider the base of the logarithmic function as 2 fuzzy joint entropy between two stations whose observations are depicted by random variables x and y could be estimated as 9 h f x y h f r f x r f y 1 n i 1 n log x i r f x y i r f y n where f y represents the fuzzy attribute set which has a fuzzy equivalence relation r f y with y in order to compute x i r f x y i r f y the intersection of the relation matrices m r f x and m r f y corresponding to x and y is determined as 10 m r f x m r f y r 11 x r 12 x r 1 n x r 21 x r 22 x r 2 n x r n 1 x r n 2 x r nn x r 11 y r 12 y r 1 n y r 21 y r 22 y r 2 n y r n 1 y r n 2 y r nn y r 11 x y r 12 x y r 1 n x y r 21 x y r 22 x y r 2 n x y r n 1 x y r n 2 x y r nn x y mutual information is the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another random variable two random variables have high redundancy if mutual information value is high and they are completely independent if the mutual information value is equal to zero for the random variables x and y mutual information i x y can be computed as 11 i x y h x h y h x y the exponential entropy and fuzzy entropy measures are yet to be used in the context of hydrometric network design 2 2 bin size determination methods discretization of data points is essential to compute the entropy estimates in the case of both shannon and exponential entropy methods as the underlying distribution of flow data is unknown the discretization is quite challenging as no best bin size estimate exists and different bin sizes can reveal different features of the data too small bin width may lead to a histogram that is overly rough whereas too large bin width results in smooth histogram when compared to the true probability density function pdf an increase in roughness causes the variance of estimated pdf to be too high whereas increase in smoothness results in a significant amount of bias therefore based on the actual data distribution and goals of the analysis appropriate bin size may vary and hence experimentation is required to fix the optimal bin width some options available for bin size estimation include i sturge s rule sturges 1926 ii rice rule lane 2006 iii

for computation of optimal bin width using shimazaki and shinomoto rule can be found in khan and valeo 2016 3 proposed methodology a methodology based on fuzzy information entropy is proposed for evaluation and design of hydrometric network in a river basin it adapts ideas scattered in previous studies alfonso et al 2010a mishra and coulibaly 2010 samuel et al 2013 and proposes the use of fuzzy entropy in lieu of shannon and exponential entropy owing to its advantages the methodology involves the following steps 1 prioritizing ranking of stream gauge stations in the existing hydrometric network this would help in identifying stations that have high or low significance in gathering flow information gauges having high significance could be possibly upgraded by making them automated for meeting short or long term goals on the other hand gauges that have less significance could be decommissioned or moved to another location if there are economical constraints in their maintenance ranking of existing stations in a river basin should be carried out by ensuring that it meets two conditions c1 flows at stations should have less redundant information i e having less inter site dependence and mutual information and c2 each station should individually provide high information content implying high marginal entropy alfonso et al 2010a to prioritise gauges in the study area for each station i i 1 n estimate a marginal entropy h x i and b mutual information with each of the n stations including itself in order to prepare a mutual information vector ν i m i x i x 1 m i x i x i m i x i x j m i x i x n where m i x i x j denotes mutual information for i th station with j th station determined by considering an effective entropy procedure mutual information of a station with itself e g m i x i x i is equal to its marginal entropy station s r where r 1 which has the maximum marginal entropy indicating highest importance in gathering flow information is identified as h x s r max 1 i n h x i and ranked first in the desired ranks set ξ the mutual information vector ν s corresponding to the station s r is prepared and its elements are divided into two sets namely independent set and dependent set the independent set s s r ind comprises mi values which are lower than a specified threshold ε and the dependent set s s r dep comprises mi values that are above the threshold high mi value between any two stations indicates that flows at those stations have high redundancy implying that the presence of only one of those stations could be adequate to gather information on flows in the study area from s s r ind the stations which have mutual information with station s in the ranks set ξ are noted among the noted stations the one having the highest marginal entropy value is identified as the next ranked station s r 1 in the ranks set ξ to fulfill the condition c2 further ν s is updated by combining the mutual information vectors of the stations s r and s r 1 elements of the updated ν s are divided into independent and dependent sets considering the threshold ε as described above from the independent set stations which have mi with stations in ξ are noted from among those noted stations the one with highest marginal entropy is chosen and assigned the next rank in the ranks set the foregoing process of ranking of stations is continued till all the stations in the basin are assigned priority ranks 2 identifying stream gauge deficit zones in a river basin to identify the deficit zones entropy estimates marginal entropy joint entropy and mutual information are obtained for each station using fuzzy entropy procedure the mutual information is determined between the observed flows x i and estimated flows x i for each station i 1 n at monthly scale by considering x for y in eq 11 let ω denote the total number of months for which the n stations have contemporaneous record the equations useful for estimating different entropy measures in analysis with shannon entropy exponential entropy and the proposed fuzzy entropy are provided in section 2 1 at each station the flows x i are estimated using the information on observed monthly flows at all other n 1 stations for this purpose multiple linear regression mlr relationships of the form x i a i b i z i are developed where z i is a n 1 ω matrix containing contemporaneous flows observed at all other n 1 stations while a i and b i are matrices containing regression parameters whose dimensions are 1 ω and 1 n 1 respectively a similar procedure was considered in a previous study mishra and coulibaly 2010 for analysis with shannon entropy to identify stream gauge deficit zones the mutual information of station i denoted as m i i indicates redundancy of information transfer between the station i and the other n 1 stations a high low value for mutual information indicates high low dependence 3 mutual information index mii value was computed for each station i as m i i m i min m i max m i min where m i max and m i min denote respectively the maximum and minimum among the mi values of all the stations in the river basin the computed mii values could be spatially interpolated using any effective method e g spline tension method the river basin could be classified into five zones based on the interpolated mii values the zones are referred to as highly deficit 0 mii 0 2 deficit 0 2 mii 0 4 average 0 4 mii 0 6 above average 0 6 mii 0 8 and excess 0 8 mii 1 0 if a zone is classified as above average or excess in terms of mii the existing hydrometric network in the zone could be deemed adequate implying there is no need for expansion of the network calculation of the required number of potential stations this involves regionalization of the study area e g river basin into different physiographic units in order to assess the adequacy of the stream gauge network the world meteorological organization wmo 2008 recommends minimum density of streamflow stations in km2 station to be 1000 1875 1875 2750 300 and 20 000 for mountains interior plains hilly undulating areas coastal areas small islands and polar arid regions respectively based on this the minimum required number of gauges for each of the physiographic units could be determined however it is to be noted that there is ambiguity in classifying a given area into different physiographic units as there are no established guidelines let m denote the minimum requirement of gauges over all the physiographic units in the target river basin if m exceeds the count of existing stations n then density of streamflow stations in the basin could be considered inadequate on the other hand if n is much larger than m then the number of available stations could be deemed excessive in both cases the physiographic unit s for which the original station count is higher lower than the minimum required number of potential stations has to be identified in a physiographic unit which has excessive stations the stations could be ranked using the procedure described in step 1 subsequently the stations to be decommissioned could be identified one at a time in descending order of their ranks until the station mii value is 0 6 or the number of stations remaining in the physiographic unit after decommissioning is equal to the minimum required number of potential stations for the physiographic unit on the other hand if the station count is inadequate in any physiographic unit then difference between the required and available number of stations could be computed to determine the additional number of stations to be commissioned using procedure described in step 4 to ensure validity of the minimum density requirements of wmo 2008 4 determination of potential locations of additional stations to expand an existing hydrometric network possible locations of additional p stations could be chosen from outlets of sub basins delineated in the study area river basin sensitivity analysis could be performed to fix a threshold area for delineation of adequate number of sub basins possibly using arcgis software such that the count of existing stations together with the identified potential locations for additional stations is more than the minimum requirement determined in step 3 for different physiographic units in the target river basin 5 estimation of streamflow at the identified potential locations contemporaneous flows are generated at potential locations of stations a hydrologic model capable of simulating flows in an ungauged basin can be used for this purpose the generated flows together with the observed flows at the existing stations are used to compute entropy measures marginal entropy joint entropy mutual information for use in step 6 6 optimization of the hydrometric network any potential optimization algorithm e g nsga ii fast non dominated sorting genetic algorithm could be considered to determine the optimal number of stations required for expansion of the hydrometric network in the target river basin two objective functions are chosen in this study one of those minimizes fuzzy mutual information which quantifies dependence of flow at each station on flows at all other stations and the other maximizes fuzzy joint entropy which provides the maximum information content with minimum shared information between each station and other stations further decision variables are considered as the total number of stations in the expanded network p n and constraint is set as n p m based on step 4 4 case study 4 1 study area and its streamflow network the area chosen for case study comprises 16 river basins in peninsula india which encompass about 52 of the total geographical area of the country containing more than half of its population the area is located towards south of vindhya and satpura mountain ranges fig 1 and it has a typical monsoon climate with large spatial and temporal variation in rainfall and temperature owing to which there is a highly skewed distribution of water resources table 1 provides details of physiography drainage area climate mean temperature mean annual rainfall and hydrometric network number of gauges and the period over which they have a contemporaneous record pertaining to the 16 river basins the gauges are maintained by the central water commission cwc of india and their daily records were available from the wris water resources information system database www india wris nrsc gov in monthly streamflows were estimated from the daily records overall records of 317 stations were available in the river basins out of which 291 stations were active up to 2006 nearly 20 stations have continuous records over the 50 year period since 1965 further about 150 stations have continuous records over a 30 year period between 1985 and 2012 the density of gauges decreased considerably since 2004 fig 2 possibly due to a decline in financial resources for maintaining gauges and shifting of gauges for achieving short term goals priorities similar observations were made by ruhi et al 2018 on a global scale using analogous figure in this context it is essential to investigate adequacy of stream gauge networks in indian river basins as there is no such previous study for investigations on the hydrometric network in river basins 281 stations having at least 9 years of contemporaneous records were considered fig 2 data gaps in the records of selected stations were ensured to be 20 as in the previous studies e g mishra and coulibaly 2010 and those gaps were filled using arima kalman smoothening technique moritz et al 2015 before embarking on application of proposed fuzzy entropy method to the entire peninsula india potential of the method in overcoming drawbacks of shannon entropy and exponential entropy methods was investigated by considering hydrometric network in mahanadi basin comprising 19 stations having flow records from 1989 to 2012 table 1 following this fuzzy entropy method was used to assess adequacy of stream gauges in hydrometric networks of other river basins in peninsula india 4 2 prioritizing stations in the existing hydrometric network of mahanadi basin prioritization of stations in terms of their importance in gathering flow information is required in studies undertaken to redesign retrofit a network possibly by shifting decommissioning existing gauges or adding new gauges from this perspective priority ranks were assigned to the existing stream gauges in mahanadi basin using the procedure described in step 1 of section 3 in analysis with fuzzy entropy method fuzzy entropy estimates were obtained for the 19 stations and they were used to determine ranks for the stations in order of their importance a major limitation issue in determining station ranks in the case of analysis with shannon and exponential entropy methods is that entropy estimates obtained using the methods are sensitive to class interval or bin size chosen to discretize data of the stations considered e g valdes et al 1975 chapman 1986 chacon hurtado et al 2017 often modelers consider different bin size estimation rules therefore to illustrate sensitivity of entropy estimates to bin size probability entropy estimates were determined by considering nine bin size estimation rules formulae described in section 2 2 the optimum number of bins k were estimated to be 881 13 92 35 21 58 33 949 and 27 792 respectively using freedman diaconis rule sturge s rule scott s rule rice rule doane s formula bendat and piersol formula cochran s formula knuth s rule and shimazaki and shinomoto rule this indicates that there is considerable uncertainty in bin size estimates obtained using different rules the optimum number of bins determined using shimazaki and shinomoto rule were found to be very large when compared with those determined using the other rules formulae this is because with decrease in h value in the range h min h max the value of cost function cd decreased exponentially consequently the chosen optimal bin width h was equal to hmin and the corresponding optimum number of bins k attained a large value as evident from eq 12 even the estimates of k obtained using freedman diaconis rule and knuth s rule were marginally high in analysis with knuth s rule the optimum number of bins corresponds to maximum value for logarithm of the marginal posterior probability function eq 18 the graph plotted between the number of bins on abscissa versus estimate of the function as ordinate was positively skewed the function attained its peak value at m 949 and decreased drastically thereafter in analysis with freedman diaconis rule the estimate of bin width h was smaller as the interquartile range of flow data was smaller hence the corresponding number of bins k was a large value as evident from eq 12 none of the bin size estimates can be considered preferable as there is no universally superior bin size estimation rule formula hence a detailed insight of bin size effect on entropy estimates was deemed necessary the station ranks obtained using shannon entropy method by considering bin size based on freedman diaconis rule sturge s rule were found to be mostly consistent inconsistent with the ranks obtained using fuzzy entropy method further ranks obtained by considering knuth s rule were comparable to those obtained using freedman diaconis rule for several stations fig 3 on the other hand ranks obtained using exponential entropy method were not consistent with those obtained based on fuzzy entropy method or shannon entropy method with bin sizes determined using any of the rules formulae among the shannon and exponential entropy methods the latter exhibited higher sensitivity in station ranks to the chosen bin size rule formula figs 3 and 4 to gain further insight into sensitivity of the shannon and exponential entropy methods to bin size h was varied from 0 5 to 10 m3 s as noted in mishra and coulibaly 2010 by considering 0 5 m3 s increments station ranks were determined for every bin size in the chosen interval 0 5 10 in analysis with both the methods results obtained in the case of shannon entropy method indicated that station ranks were less sensitive to bin size chosen in the interval 5 5 10 and several of those ranks were comparable to those determined using fuzzy entropy method interestingly for majority of stations the ranks determined using fuzzy entropy method are more consistent with ranks obtained corresponding to bin widths 2 m3 s k 6948 2 5 m3 s k 5558 and 4 m3 s k 3474 than with ranks computed using shannon entropy method by considering different bin size estimation rules fig 5 on the other hand in the case of exponential entropy method uncertainty in station ranks to bin size was generally high in the interval 0 5 10 and it was found to be highest for the range 0 5 5 overall the results indicated that ranks assigned to stations based on shannon and exponential entropy methods generally vary sometimes significantly with bin size causing ambiguity in deciding correct ranks for stations this issue is overcome by resorting to fuzzy entropy method as the method alleviates discretization of data into bins 4 3 identification of stream gauge deficit zones in mahanadi basin stream gauge deficit zones were identified in mahanadi basin by analysing spatial variability of mii estimates obtained using fuzzy entropy method and existing shannon and exponential entropy methods by considering bin sizes determined using nine rules formulae as described in step 2 of section 3 to determine mii flows x i were predicted using the mlr approach markus et al 2003 considering the assumptions of linearity to be appropriate analysis was carried out on streamflow records of the basin to verify if four major assumptions of mlr approach i e linearity multivariate normality multicollinearity and homoscedasticity were satisfied for this purpose residuals were determined between x i and x i the linearity cohen et al 1983 and homoscedasticity assumptions were tested using scatter plots between standardized residuals and standardized x i values for each of the stations the plots exhibited linear pattern indicating that the assumption of linearity is valid further data points depicting residuals in the plot appeared evenly distributed about the linear pattern over the range of all the predicted values x i indicating that the assumption of homoscedasticity is valid further probability plots and q q plots of the residuals were considered to check validity of multivariate normality assumption the plots indicated that the residuals could be considered as normally distributed for majority of the stations slight deviations from normality may not induce bias in mlr coefficients e g williams et al 2013 even the inter site pearson s product moment correlations were found to be weak for majority of stations in the study area indicating multicollinearity assumption could be considered applicable to determine mii estimates of marginal entropy joint entropy and mutual information mi were obtained for all the existing stations in the river basin using each of the entropy methods fuzzy shannon and exponential the area of the basin was classified into 5 mii zones based on interpolated mii values they are referred to as highly deficit zone 0 mii 0 2 deficit zone 0 2 mii 0 4 average zone 0 4 mii 0 6 above average zone 0 6 mii 0 8 and excess zone 0 8 mii 1 a comparative study of entropy estimates obtained corresponding to various bin size determination methods was carried out to understand the extent of uncertainty prevailing within each entropy method shannon exponential in order to investigate this mii maps were created as described in section 3 step 2 corresponding to each entropy method and bin size determination method formula listed in section 2 2 separately and the pba mii percentage of the basin area falling in different mii zones were compared fig 6 in analysis with shannon entropy method the pba mii obtained using scott s rule and freedman diaconis rule were highly comparable with the corresponding estimates obtained using fuzzy entropy method in contrast pba mii obtained using sturge s rule and rice rule were much different table 3 a in analysis with exponential entropy method data discretization using scott s rule yielded pba mii which appeared similar to those from fuzzy entropy method table 3 b 4 4 determination of the required number of potential stations and their locations to assess if density of stream gauges in the existing network meets wmo 2008 guidelines area of mahanadi basis was classified into four physiographic units low lying coastal interior plains hilly undulating and mountainous areas using 30 m resolution srtm dem table 2 regions having elevation 100 m were classified as low lying coastal areas whereas those having elevation in the range 100 400 m and 400 600 m were referred to as interior plains and hilly undulating areas respectively mountainous areas were considered as those having elevation greater than 600 m estimates of the minimum number of gauges for each physiographic unit were determined separately considering wmo 2008 guidelines described in step 3 of section 3 table 2 and total minimum requirement of gauges stations for the basin as well as each physiographic unit were computed the existing number 19 of gauges in the mahanadi network was way below the minimum requirement of 83 stations estimated by wmo 2008 guidelines hence expansion of the existing network is deemed mandatory for the basin in order to identify various feasible options for locating at least 64 83 19 additional stations threshold area for delineating sub basins in mahanadi basin was chosen as 0 64 of the basin area 1 41 589 km2 which yielded 98 sub basins the outlets of those 98 sub basins were considered as potential locations for the proposed additional stations 4 5 estimation of streamflow at potential gauge locations using swat monthly streamflows at the potential gauge locations in mahanadi basin were generated using arcswat for the period 1989 2012 over which contemporaneous observed monthly flows were available for the 19 existing stations swat is a physically based semi distributed model which simulates hydrological processes e g runoff streamflow evapotranspiration in a river basin by dividing it into sub basins which are further discretized into various hydrological response units hrus that are homogeneous in slope soil land use landcover and management conditions the model lumps the outflow of various hrus in a sub basin to obtain the total runoff ensuring overall water balance which is subsequently routed through the channel network in the river basin to obtain the total runoff at the basin outlet further details on swat can be found in neitsch et al 2011 input to a swat model includes data related to topography climate land use landcover lulc and soils the topography of the basin was considered in the form of 90 m resolution srtm shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model dem climate data included that on i daily rainfall 0 25 resolution for the period 1979 2017 and daily temperature 1 resolution for the period 1979 2012 procured from imd india meteorological department ii wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation 0 3125 resolution for the period 1948 2015 from cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis database the lulc data was extracted from a 1 km resolution global land cover characterization glcc database which was prepared using avhrr source imagery covering the period 1992 1993 further soil data was based on 1 5 million resolution world soil maps of fao unesco food and agricultural organisation of the united nations united nations educational scientific and cultural organisation to calibrate swat mahanadi basin was delineated into sub basins corresponding to the 19 gauging stations using arcswat the sub basins encompass the entire basin area the swat was calibrated using the swat cup to simulate monthly flows in each of the 19 sub basins for the period 1989 2012 the calibration involved identification of the sensitive parameters out of the 20 parameters given in table 4 for each basin separately by performing sensitivity analysis through sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 abbaspour et al 2004 procedure using swat cup calibration and uncertainty programs the model performance was evaluated in terms of four performance measures nse r2 ioa and pi described in appendix boxplots showing variation of estimates of each of these measures across the 19 stations are presented in fig 7 from the figure it can be noted that average estimates of nse ioa and r2 across 19 stations are 0 63 0 86 and 0 70 respectively further average estimate of pi across the stations for 1 2 and 3 month lead times was 0 61 0 786 0 83 respectively hence the performance of the calibrated swat model is deemed fairly good the calibrated model was subsequently used to generate monthly flows for the period 1989 2012 at the 98 potential station locations identified in section 4 4 each of which is situated in one of the 19 sub basins of the mahanadi basin 4 6 optimization of the hydrometric network using nsga ii optimization algorithm nsga ii was used to identify optimal locations from the 98 potential locations for setting up new stations in the mahanadi basin to meet wmo s 2008 guidelines it is an elitist multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea which uses an efficient crowding distance assignment methodology deb et al 2002 this algorithm has a good global search ability to find a set of well distributed non dominated solutions at an acceptable level i e pareto optimal solutions it is used to minimize the chosen two objective functions subject to one constraint step 6 of section 3 the estimates of mutual information and joint entropy computed using shannon exponential and fuzzy entropy methods were obtained based on contemporaneous flows at 117 locations including 19 existing stations and 98 potential locations in the basin for the period 1989 2012 the number of decision variables was 117 each decision variable depicts information on continuation or establishment of a station gauge at each of the referred 117 locations the 117 decision variables were considered in the form of a binary encoded chromosome string having 117 bits with each bit representing a location in the basin the decision variables bits corresponding to all the existing stations were set to 1 indicating that they are to be retained in the optimized network whereas bits corresponding to the 98 potential new locations had the flexibility to be set to either 1 if there can be a station at the new location or zero otherwise one hundred chromosomes strings were randomly generated within the search space to represent the population the optimization algorithm was run for 2000 iterations each comprising 100 chromosomes by considering crossover probability and mutation rate as 0 8 and 0 001 respectively thus overall 200 100 chromosomes each depicting a different network configuration were obtained and analysed to arrive at the pareto optimal solution in the case of fuzzy entropy method there were 102 pareto optimal points each depicting a different network configuration out of which 40 points were chosen from the central region of the pareto optimal solution for identification of the optimal network configuration in the 40 network configurations apart from the 19 existing stations 66 potential new stations locations with the highest repeated occurrences i e at least more than 70 repetitions were identified to meet wmo 2008 recommendations see section 4 4 the number of gauges required in hilly undulating regions coastal region interior plains and mountainous regions of the study area were estimated to be 12 6 52 and 13 respectively which together add to 83 stations among the physiographic regions mountainous region has limited spatial extent 8 4 of the total area and is not geographically contiguous it is rather scattered along the periphery of the mahanadi river basin and does not contain any major stream hence estimated 13 stream gauge stations are not deemed necessary in those mountainous areas among the existing 19 stations 1 is in hilly undulating region 1 is located in coastal region and the remaining 17 are located in interior plains apart from the 19 existing stations and 13 estimated for mountainous areas locations of 51 83 19 13 additional stations had to be identified from the 66 potential new gauge locations in order to meet the minimum density requirements of wmo 2008 in different physiographic units for this purpose priority ranks were assigned to the 66 new station locations following the procedure described in step 1 of section 3 subsequently the stations falling in each physiographic unit and their corresponding ranks were taken into account to identify optimal locations of additional gauges in the physiographic units the newly identified station locations were 11 s1 s11 in hilly undulating region 5 s12 s16 in coastal region and 35 s17 s51 in interior plains the 51 additional stations s1 s51 along with the existing 19 gauged stations form the suggested optimal hydrometric network in the mahanadi basin fig 8 the optimal network determined using the proposed fuzzy entropy method is compared with optimal networks designed using shannon and exponential entropy methods considering the nine bin size determination rules formulae for each of the latter methods table 5 shows the effect of bin size determination rules formulae on i the number of pareto optimal solutions ii estimate of station count in the optimal network and iii the number of stations which match with those in the optimal network found using fuzzy entropy method in general considerable differences were evident in network configurations obtained using both shannon and exponential entropy methods by considering different bin size estimation rules in comparison to exponential entropy method shannon entropy method yielded networks whose configurations had more resemblance to configuration of the network obtained using fuzzy entropy method the resemblance was specifically more for the configurations found using freedman diaconis rule table 5 in analysis based on shannon entropy method with freedman diaconis rule 116 pareto optimal network configurations were obtained in which 76 stations had more repeated occurrences among the 76 stations 56 were found in the optimal network determined using fuzzy entropy method analysis with exponential entropy method failed to generate pareto optimal solution for the objective function when bin width was chosen using sturge s rule scott s rule knuth s rule or doane s formula see table 5 overall it can be inferred from the results presented in this section that in analysis with shannon and exponential entropy methods there is considerable uncertainty in entropy estimates which are used for prioritizing stations determining pba mii and design of optimal networks the uncertainty is alleviated in analysis with proposed fuzzy entropy method further it is found that results based on shannon entropy method with bin size computed using freedman diaconis rule are somewhat comparable to those based on the fuzzy entropy method the fuzzy entropy method which is more appealing is considered in the following section for analysis on other river basins in the peninsular india 4 7 assessment of adequacy of existing streamgauge networks in 16 river basins of peninsula india analysis on the 317 stations maintained by cwc in the peninsular river basins of india indicated that the density of existing stations decreased drastically by 2004 hence it is essential to evaluate the adequacy of the existing streamgauge networks and plan for optimal expansion of the same if necessary for this purpose streamgauge deficit zones were identified in 16 river basins of peninsula india using the procedure described in step 2 of section 3 considering fuzzy entropy procedure which was found effective in the previous section the fmii interpolation maps were created for all the 16 river basins fig 9 and the percentage of area belonging to each fmii zone was calculated for each basin table 2 results indicate that in 11 out of 16 basins more than 32 of the area is classified as belonging to highly deficit and deficit zones it can also be noted that 8 out of 16 basins have more than 40 000 km2 area belonging to highly deficit and deficit zones further among all the basins largest area 1 25 124 km2 in godavari basin and largest percentage area 78 5 in pennar basin belong to these two deficit zones which are very sparse in terms of gauges indicating that expansion of hydrometric network in those areas is necessary in order to validate the inferences further regionalisation analysis was carried out to categorise each basin into different wmo physiographic units mountains interior plains hilly undulating areas coastal areas small islands and polar arid regions the minimum number of stations required for each physiographic unit was calculated separately to arrive at the minimum number of stations required in each basin to meet the wmo guidelines results indicated that out of the 16 basins 6 have more than 42 of their area in coastal regions and another 8 have more than 41 of their area in interior plains the remaining two basins have a larger part of their area classified as hilly undulating or mountainous table 2 thus it was inferred that station density in all the peninsular basins was way below the minimum density guidelines set by wmo 2008 and this indicates pressing demand for expansion of the existing networks 5 summary and conclusions fuzzy entropy methodology is presented for design of hydrometric network advantage of the methodology over shannon and exponential entropy methods was demonstrated through a case study on mahanadi basin in india by considering various bin size estimation methods rules in analysis with the latter two methods the investigations showed that bin size estimation or discretisation of data induces considerable uncertainty in shannon and exponential entropy estimates which has associated problems artefacts this uncertainty is overcome by the proposed fuzzy entropy method as it alleviates the need for discretisation of data this is the first study of its kind which compares the effect of bin width computed using nine different bin size estimation rules along with arbitrarily chosen bin sizes on the shannon and exponential entropy estimates and applications based on them concerning i determination of station priority ranks ii identification of stream gauge deficit zones and iii design of optimal hydrometric network in river basins priority ranks assigned to stream gauge stations in mahanadi basin using fuzzy entropy method were compared with those obtained with shannon entropy method the ranks were more comparable for sees shannon entropy estimates obtained for arbitrarily chosen bin widths equal to 2 m3 s k 6948 2 5 m3 s k 5558 and 4 m3 s k 3474 they were fairly comparable when sees were determined using freedman diaconis rule and knuth s rule and least comparable when sees were determined using shrug s rule on the other hand there is great discrepancy in ranks assigned to stations in analysis with exponential entropy determined by considering all the nine bin size estimation rules and arbitrarily choosing bin sizes in the range 0 5 10 entropy estimates obtained using each of the methods were considered to determine stream gauge deficit zones in mahanadi basin the zones resulting from shannon entropy estimates obtained with freedman diaconis rule and from exponential entropy estimates obtained with scot s rule resembled the zones formed using the fuzzy entropy estimates both shannon and exponential entropy methods showed the highest variability in pba mii in analysis with doane s formula overall uncertainty in percentage of the basin area classified into different mii zones is less with shannon entropy method than with the exponential entropy method the nsga ii optimisation procedure suggested for determining optimal hydrometric network provides several feasible pareto optimal solutions the results obtained with different entropy methods and nine bin size estimation rules wherever applicable indicated that the number of pareto optimal solutions as well as the number of optimal number of stations vary with chosen entropy method and bin size since the fuzzy entropy method does not involve data discretisation the method is deemed to perform better and the results showed that networks determined using both shannon and exponential entropy estimates obtained with freedman diaconis rule resemble that formed using fuzzy entropy method in general the estimates obtained using shannon entropy method were closer to those obtained using the fuzzy entropy method however there is no agreement as to which bin size estimation method would yield accurate result with the shannon entropy approach and there is no standardized established procedure to determine optimum bin width these inferences are in agreement with the findings of previous studies e g gislason and goldfield 1984 the idea of optimum bin width is to choose a bin width sufficiently large to capture the major features in the data while ignoring fine details due to random sampling fluctuations however as the fuzzy entropy method does not involve discretization of data to bins and considers each value separately to form a relation matrix it takes into account even the finer details associated with the data there is lack of information on the existing scenario of stream gauge networks in indian river basins hence a case study was performed on 16 river basins in peninsula india using the proposed fuzzy entropy method to identify stream gauge deficit excess zones and assess if the existing stream gauge networks in those basins meet wmo 2008 guidelines the results revealed that stream gauge networks in peninsular india are inadequate for effective monitoring of flows and there is a need for their expansion in all the 16 river basins the number of existing stations in the peninsular india having at least 9 years of contemporaneous records is only 281 however analysis performed by considering wmo guidelines indicate need for at least 1007 stations for properly monitoring flows in the 16 basins the information discerned in this study would be useful to the concerned government agencies for taking decisions on improving the network configuration through expansion installing new stations and relocation decommissioning of stations wherever necessary the proposed methodology could be applied to river basins in various other parts of the world to strengthen the conclusions drawn based on this study in making such attempts it is to be noted that the wmo recommendations are for setting up a minimum network as initial stage the network could be further expanded based on factors such as spatial variability of local regional water needs population density flood risk flow regime alterations and other factors it is also worth mentioning that the proposed methodology could be readily considered for the evaluation of networks monitoring other hydro meteorological e g precipitation temperature and hydrological e g groundwater variables and water

5469,the increasing population in south china is exposed to benggang erosion that deteriorates slope stability and agricultural production however the influence of subsurface flow especially macropore flow on the development of benggang erosion and the collapse of benggang remains inadequately studied to address this issue we measured the spatial distribution of soil macropores on an active benggang eroded slope in a subtropical region in china during the experimental period of 20151221 to 20180116 two collapse events were observed on the study slope in addition the soil water content at the depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm was monitored at a time interval of five minutes at six sites along the slope the velocities of vertical subsurface flow traveling between measured soil depths were determined based on the difference in the response time of soil water content to rainfall along the depth further the reynolds number re of subsurface flow in different water patterns e g darcy flow df and preferential flow pf was calculated based on soil pore size and flow velocity results indicate that the number of macropores near the benggang wall i e the most active area of erosion on a benggang slope was almost twice that on the upper slope the presence of abundant macropores near the benggang wall facilitated faster subsurface flow and a greater variation in soil water content in time and space which significantly influenced benggang erosion and collapse for both the df and pf the maximum re was detected near the benggang wall the re of pf was ten times higher than that of df the re being greater than 3 was the threshold to initiate pf moreover the larger re of pf likely enhanced the leaching of fine soil particles and promoted the occurrence of benggang erosion this study confirms the key role of macropore flow in benggang erosion which helps better understanding modeling and controlling of benggang erosion keywords hydropedology macropore flow preferential flow reynolds number soil erosion slope stability 1 introduction soil erosion has become a significant threat to environmental and ecological sustainability in china in the hilly areas of the subtropical region in south china benggang erosion has been recognized as the most extensive soil degradation process especially in the red soil area overlying on the granite parent material chen et al 2013 benggang fig 1 a professional term used by chinese researchers refers to an erosional phenomenon that the slope and the soil body vertically collapse under the combined forces of water flow and gravity shi 1991 a typical benggang is composed of a catchment slope a gully head also called the benggang wall the most active area in the slope an avalanche pile a flow channel and an alluvial fan lin huang 2009 there are more than 483 400 km2 benggang erosion areas have been observed in over 300 cities in south china liang et al 2009 benggang has caused severe soil erosion which jeopardizes agricultural production and food security in china zhang et al 2014 with the urban sprawls and increasing population in china more people are now exposed to benggang erosion risks wu zhong 1997 therefore an in depth understanding of the development of benggang erosion and benggang collapse has become an important issue of significant public and scientific interest li et al 2009 some efforts have been pursued to explore the mechanisms governing benggang erosion jiang et al 2014 liu and zhang 2015 these studies suggested that the dynamics of benggang erosion are complicated which are jointly controlled by the interaction between soil structures e g soil pores bulk density and texture and external conditions e g rainfall characteristics and terrain attributes jiang et al 2014 among these controlling factors the effects of soil properties and surface runoff on benggang collapse have been extensively studied e g luo et al 2009 tao et al 2015 for example liu ling 2011 proposed that the loose granite material is the favorable geological setting for the occurrence of benggang erosion wu wang 2000 believed that the surface runoff washes soil particles on the benggang slope and promotes the formation of soil pores the increasing soil porosity facilitates infiltration and deeper percolation shi 1991 introduced that the infiltration and redistribution process in the soil body have exacerbated the uneven distribution of soil water content which caused the spatially variable distribution of gravity in different parts of the soil body then under the combined forces of water flow and gravity the collapse of bengang occurs however the influence of subsurface flow on the development of benggang erosion and the collapse of benggang has not been well studied the prevalence of subsurface flow has been observed in many types of soil and landscapes lin 2010 beven germann 2013 macropore flow i e flow through biopores erosion cavities cracks fissures is the most frequently observed subsurface flow type guo lin 2018 once the water pressure on the soil matrix macropore interface exceeds the water entry pressure water converges to macropores generating macropore flow that abruptly increases the flow rate jarvis 2010 although macropores usually constitute only a small volume fraction of the total soil porosity they may dominate near saturated flow in the subsurface luxmoore et al 1990 previous studies indicated that macropores with equivalent diameters larger than 0 3 0 5 mm could direct rapid flow beven germann 1982 jarvis 2010 besides the size macropores are distinct from small soil pores also called matrix pores in hydraulic functions such as continuity tortuosity and connectivity beven and germann 1982 which further determines the pathway velocity and magnitude of macropore flow macropore flow is the primary route for the rapid long range transport of soil solutions such as water and fine soil particles xu et al 2016 due to the faster flow rate and greater flow momentum than matrix flow the influence of macropore flow on the stability of the soil body is more significant jomaa et al 2013 some studies suggested that subsurface flow including both preferential flow pf and darcy flow df can be the main driving force of soil subsurface erosion liu et al 2003 after fine soil particles are transported via macropore flow and are washed out from the soil body of the slope only the coarse particles act as the skeleton structures of the soil moret fernández gonzález cebollada 2009 this process not only causes the soil to hollow but also forms smoother seepage channels in the soil appels et al 2016 which often trigger the collapse of the slope additionally the loss of the fine soil particles can increase the local porosity and permeability of the shallow soil of the slope adams et al 2011 these fine particles will deposit in the deeper subsoil and favors the formation of a less permeable layer which considerably blocks deep percolation of subsurface flow posadas et al 2003 hence the permeability coefficient of the soil decreases in the subsoil and a temporary water stagnation zone or a perched water table forms above the less permeable layer and impairs soil strength wu et al 2016 which may induce a benggang erosion therefore we hypothesize that subsurface flow especially macropore flow plays a key role in the development of benggang erosion and the collapse of a benggang slope the hydrodynamic characteristics of subsurface flow such as velocity distribution flow shear force and energy loss have been taken into account to improve soil erosion model e g zimmermann et al 2012 al kayssi mustafa 2016 however there is no established theory to calculate the hydrodynamic characteristics of macropore flow given the similarity of macropore flow and pipeline flow the principles formulae and methods of estimating pipeline flow dynamics can be used to characterize macropore flow dong et al 2013 the reynolds number re is the main hydraulic factor that represents the hydrodynamics characteristics of water flow determining re of macropore flow can therefore help understand the role of macropore flow in benggang development the aims of this study are as follows 1 to reveal the spatial distribution of macropores in a typical benggang slope and the influence of macropore on soil water content distribution and the occurrence of macropore flow and 2 to calculate the re for different flow patterns of subsurface flow e g darcy flow through soil matrix and preferential flow along macropores and examine the influence of the dynamics of subsurface flow in the development of benggang erosion 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area was located in tongcheng county 113 36 114 4 e and 29 2 29 24 n hubei province china fig 1 the study site has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an annual rainfall of approximately 1512 8 mm fig 2 the annual average 1981 2017 air temperature is 16 1 c china meteorological administration this region is underlain by granite bedrock which is highly weathered due to the humid climate and derives a thick loose and deep soil layer the granite weathering crust in studied hillslope can generally be 10 20 m in depth the soil is basically a strongly acidic to acidic soil in the test area the soils are developed from granite classified as ultisols by the u s soil taxonomy system the hillslope has a vegetation coverage of less than 30 dominated by the forked fern dicranopteris dichotoma thunb bernh there are a total of 1102 benggang slopes in the county 2005 remote sensing survey of soil and water loss in hubei province and most of the benggang slopes are still experiencing erosion field experiments were conducted on a representative hilly slope an active benggang area where two collapses occurred on 20160602 and 20170624 the study hillslope sits at nw 60 fig 1 13 m in height and approximately 19 m in length from the benggang wall to the top of the slope with a slope gradient from 30 to 50 the benggang wall is steeper than 75 with a depth of approximately 5 2 m the soil on the slope changes with the slope position the surface soil horizon a horizon is shallow and is generally lost by water erosion with a small amount of a horizon on the upper part of the slope there is no a horizon in the middle and lower parts of the slope a subsurface red clayey layer b horizon is exposed to air with a sandy soil layer bc horizon in the deeper part of the soil profile and the detritus gravels c horizon remained below in soil profile throughout the field investigation at all sites the soils at the depth of 20 40 cm are a red clayey layer at depths of 40 80 cm are a transitional layer from red clayey soil to sandy soil layer but soils at a depth of 80 m turn out to be a sandy layer on lower parts of the slope the detailed data of soil texture at different slope positions and different depths are shown in table1 2 2 high frequency soil water content monitoring this study focuses on a typical benggang catchment slope two parallel soil water content and soil temperature monitoring zones l and r were established in the direction from the benggang wall along the top of the slope each monitoring zone was established with three monitoring sites from the benggang wall at 11 3 6 1 and 2 0 m labeled as l1 l2 l3 and r1 r2 r3 respectively four layers 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm were monitored at each site soil water and precipitation data collected from 20151221 to 20180116 were used in this study to embed the soil water sensor at different depths of the soil profile a pit 20 cm width and 80 cm depth was dug at each site with the longer side oriented along the hillslope a vertical array of soil moisture sensors was installed according to soil horizons four sensors approximately 7 cm in length smec 300 sm ec temp sensor spectrum technologies inc were horizontally installed at the depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm in one side of the pit sensors at each site connect to one data collector watchdog 2400 spectrum technologies inc to concurrently measure the volumetric water content the sensors were calibrated before they were installed and the readings were obtained at a frequency of every 5 min or 2 min interval in the rainy period of summer the precipitation data was monitored by a weather station watchdog 219 2000 spectrum technologies inc after the installation of the equipment the cutting ring soil samples r 3 h 8 cm for the unsaturated water conductivity measurement system the intact cutting ring soil samples r 2 5 h 5 1 cm and the soil samples for analyzing soil properties were collected at the depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm there are three replicates for per locus 72 samples for each kind of the cutting rings after these samples have been taken the pit was backfilled by soil with similar properties 2 3 soil macropore the bulk density total porosity saturated volume water content were measured by the drying weighing method zwarich shaykewich 1969 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured by a constant head hydraulic head was 9 88 cm method amoozegar 1989 the soil texture was determined using a pipetting method following the procedure proposed by day 1965 the number of soil pores in different diameter ranges were calculated by the data measured by tension infiltration and unsaturated water conductivity measurement system and more detailed soil pore distribution was obtained based on the soil water characteristic curve swcc according to brooks corey 1964 the diameter is calculated as d 3 h where h cm h2o is the height of the water applied to the matrix suction d mm is the diameter of the soil pore equivalent to the suction the soil water content corresponding to a soil matrix suction was measured during the soil wetting tension infiltration and drying unsaturated water conductivity measurement system processes during the soil wetting process we conducted the tension infiltration experiments at a site before the installation of soil moisture sensors to measure soil pore distribution t method a tension infiltrometer 20 cm base soil measurement equipment company arizona usa was used under the suction of 15 cm h2o 9 cm h2o and 3 cm h2o after each suction was measured the soil sample was taken to determine the soil water content by weighing method after drying every time the infiltration finished the wet soil layer with a thickness of 3 4 cm was removed and then the infiltration was repeated in the same place on one soil layer the tension infiltration was repeated three times eventually a pit formed this pit was a hole for embedding the probe the method refers to the embedded probe process when we did tension infiltration every suction corresponds to a corresponding diameter of the soil pores when the infiltration rate reached a stable state all the pores smaller than the corresponding diameter were filled with water and then the number of soil pores smaller than that diameter was calculated according to the soil water content after the end of two suction infiltrations the difference in the soil water content is the number of different soil pores between the two diameters when the matrix suction is 3 cm h2o all the soil pores with a diameter of less than 1 mm are filled with water luxmoore et al 1990 at this time subtracting the residual water content from the total volume water content is the number of pores larger than 1 mm during a soil drying process a series of matrix suction and soil water content values of one soil layer were measured by an unsaturated water conductivity measurement system ku pf apparatus dt 04 01 umwelt geräte technik gmbh ger to determine soil pore distribution u method the measurements were repeated three times two microtensiometers the suction range is 0 800 cm h2o were inserted at a distance of 2 5 cm from the top and bottom of the ring cutter the change in the soil matrix suction and the soil water content of the cutting ring sample during the soil drying process was measured every 10 min each soil matrix suction has a corresponding soil water content and soil pore diameter the number of soil pores of different diameters was calculated in the same way as the process used by the tension infiltrometer but the soil matrix suction was the average of two gauge microtensiometers after all the experiments were completed the soil water characteristic data obtained from the tension infiltrometer and the ku pf apparatus was input to the retc u s salinity laboratory 4500 glenwood drive riverside ca 92051 computer program in the program the swcc was fitted and drawn by the vg model van genuchten 1980 and a more specific distribution of the soil macropores was calculated the vg model in soil was calculated as 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ m3 m3 is the balanced volume water content θr m3 m3 is the residual water content θs m3 m3 is the saturated water content h m is the matrix suction α n and m are empirical fitting parameters m 1 1 n in model fitting process according to the instructions for the tension infiltrometer and the relevant instructions of the retc software published by u s salinity laboratory van genuchten et al 1991 simunek and van genuchten 2000 the parameters such as θr θs h α and n were calculated by adding the measured soil texture and bulk density to the retc software then three soil matrix suction and balanced water content measured points were used to estimate the swcc by vg model in this process the balanced volume water content and matrix suction are considered as variables raw data and the others are fitting parameters 2 4 the calculation of the reynolds number re the re is the ratio of the momentum of the water flow and viscous forces this number comprehensively represents the size of the water flow channel and linear velocity of the flow in soil the re of the subsurface flow in soil was calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 re u d v 3 u a s t where u m s is the water flow linear velocity in soil ν m2 s is the viscosity coefficient of water at a certain temperature in this study the value is 0 8 10 6 m2 s at an actual air temperature of 30 c d m is the diameter of the soil pore equivalent to the suction s m is the length of the water flow infiltration path the product of the distance between the different soil layers t s is the separated time when rainwater infiltrated into the different soil layers a is the curvature of the soil water infiltration channel the ratio of the actual length of the path through which the water flows and the distance between the soil layers according to the brooks corey equation in this study we adopted the value of 2 brooks 1964 in this study soil pores that exhibit a diameter greater than 1 mm were considered as macropores the matrix suction of the corresponding macropores is less than 3 cm h2o according to the definition of macropores given by luxmoore 1981 the diameter of soil pores 1 mm are macropores 1 mm also is the minimum diameter of macropores in this study during the two rainfall events the pore diameter was selected as 1 mm when the re of macropore pf was actually calculated the pore diameter in calculating the re of df was the equivalent pore size represented by the matrix suction determined by the water content in the simulation curve during the soil wetting process the key parameters in the calculation process were the infiltration time and the infiltration rate the time difference of rainwater reached to different soil layers was used to calculate the infiltration rate the starting time point selected when calculating the re of the pf was the node at which the pf began to occur between the two soil layers during the infiltration process the starting time point selected when calculating the re of the df was the node at which rainwater began to maintain a stable uniform infiltration between the two soil layers the determination of pf and df was operated through the coordination of soil water content and soil temperature that was proposed by tao et al 2017 2 5 statistics from 20160101 to 20171231 we measured the soil water content for 288 times at each site per day the daily average of precipitation was used for further analysis in order to reflect the influence of macropores distribution on the dynamic change of soil water content the coefficient of variation cv of the daily average soil water content at different sites was calculated the one way anova analysis of the re when df was the dominating form during the two rainfalls events used to determine whether there is a significant difference in the re of darcy flow at different sites and depths at the same time the spatial heterogeneity of re was determined by calculating the standard deviation sd throughout the whole study a 5 significance level was considered all statistical analyses were performed with the software origin 8 0 origin lab corporation northampton massachusetts usa 3 results 3 1 the spatial distribution of soil pores on a benggang slope the distribution of soil pores on the slope was calculated by swcc the swccs obtained via the two methods are compared in fig 3 the slope of swccs of two different processes varied with slope positions when closer to the benggang wall the soil matrix suction increased slowly with a decrease in soil water content for example in most soil layers of the l3 and r3 sites the soil water content was 0 37 m3 m3 when the corresponding soil matrix suction was 3 cm h2o during the soil wetting process however at the l1 and r1 sites on the upper part of the slope the soil water content was 0 40 m3 m3 when the soil matrix suction was 3 cm h2o the slope of the swcc of the deeper soil layer was smaller and the soil matrix suction increased more slowly with a decrease in soil water content for example the surface soil water content was 0 40 m3 m3 when the soil matrix suction of the surface soil layer was 3 cm h2o during the soil wetting process except for the l3 and r3 sites however in the deep soil layer the corresponding soil water content was 0 38 m3 m3 when the soil matrix suction was 3 cm h2o the swcc directly reflected the distribution of soil pores the soil pore distributions at different sites and different soil layers are shown in fig 4 the law of the soil pore distribution was similar to that of the swcc in this study the t method is more likely to reflect the existence of macropores because the disc infiltrometer has a larger diameter than soil cores used for u method there were more macropores in the lower part of the slope and in deeper soil layers in addition the soil macropores on the right side of the slope i e r1 r2 and r3 were also much larger than the left side i e l1 l2 and l3 these patterns of soil pore distribution remained very similar regardless of the wetting or drying processes however at the same site the number of macropores calculated in the soil wetting process was greater than the drying process the difference in the number of macropores between two methods amplified with the increasing number of macropores the difference of macropore proportion reached the maximum of 4 48 at the 60 80 cm depth at the r3 site fig 4 in the lower part of the slope the average proportion of macropores measured during the wetting process was 4 61 while the value was 2 58 for the upper part of the slope the average proportion of macropores in two slope positions was 2 83 and 1 79 respectively measured during the soil drying process the proportion of macropores in the lower part of the slope was almost twice that in the upper part of the slope the largest proportion of macropores 9 72 or 5 44 by two methods was detected at the 60 80 cm depth at the r3 site there were more macropores in deeper soil layers the average proportion of the macropores at the 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm depth at the six sites was 1 46 2 73 3 56 and 4 38 respectively during the soil wetting process however during the soil drying process the corresponding values changed to 1 89 2 02 1 98 and 2 64 respectively the difference in the number of macropores along the soil depth was more noticeable during the soil wetting process 3 2 the influence of soil pore distribution on soil water movement and soil water distribution on 20160602 the precipitation was 92 6 mm the rainwater on the right side of the slope with more macropores reached soil depths of 40 60 and 80 cm almost within 3 h especially at the r3 site the soil water content in 60 80 cm soil layer and 40 60 cm layer increased simultaneously after infiltration there are several sudden increases and decreases in the soil water content fig 5 all these variations indicated the occurrence of pf in r3 however the increase in the soil water content on the left and upper part of the slope was relatively gentle for example at the l1 site there was no sudden change in the soil water content in another example at the l3 site there was no rapid movement of soil water the rainwater reached depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm in sequence after 2 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h of rainfall respectively on 20170624 the precipitation was 112 2 mm the change in the soil water content was similar to that of 20160602 however the phenomenon of macropores accelerating water movement was even more pronounced this acceleration was true even on the left side of the slope with relatively few of macropores at the r2 and r3 sites the soil water content in 60 80 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers began to increase simultaneously fig 6 in addition the soil water content in the 60 80 cm soil layer quickly exceeded the upper layer 40 60 cm in a short period of time at the r1 site the rainwater also reached soil depths of 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm at the same time however the difference from the rainfall on 20160602 is that the soil water content in different soil layers also increased at the same time at the l2 and l3 sites specifically the rapid increase and decrease in soil water content also appeared at a depth of 80 cm at the l3 site where there was no pf during the last precipitation these results show that there was pf at all five sites except l1 the existence of macropores is the main reason for the pf the distributions of the soil water content differed with slope positions and soil layers in precipitation dates fig 7 as the number of macropores increases the average soil water content decreases but the cv of the soil water content increases the daily average soil water content in the upper part of the slope was higher than that in the lower part of the slope but the cv of soil water content in different slope positions was opposite the average soil water content at the l1 and r1 sites maintained a high level and the average soil water content was 0 38 m3 m3 and 0 29 m3 m3 at l1 and r1 respectively the water content in the lower part of the slope was much lower than that in the upper part of the slope the average water contents at l3 and r3 were 0 29 m3 m3 and 0 26 m3 m3 respectively in general the average soil water content on the upper part of the slope was higher than that on the lower slope with a trend of θl1 θl2 θl3 and θr1 θr2 θr3 the level of soil water content variations was the smallest on the upper part of the slope indicated by a low cv ranging from 2 91 to 9 88 and the soil water content variation on the lower part of the slope was the largest with a high cv ranging from 5 65 to 13 56 the difference in soil water content at different depths was small and the interannual distribution was less affected by rainfall the cv of the soil water content in the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm soil layers at the six sites were 6 04 6 77 6 29 and 7 49 respectively the cv in the 60 80 cm soil layer was slightly larger the existence of macropores greatly accelerated the movement of soil water and exacerbated the spatial variability of the water distribution along the entire slope 3 3 the reynolds number of subsurface flows during two torrential rainfall events the re and the related calculation parameters when the rainwater infiltrated during the two rainfall events that caused the collapse of benggang are shown in table 2 when df was the dominating form of the subsurface flow regime the re was very small the re values at different locations and depths on the slope were positively related to the number of macropores at almost all sites the re increased from the surface soil to the deep subsoil table 2 the maximum value of re 0 61 was observed in the 60 80 cm soil layer at r3 when df was the dominating form the re of df was more discrete and greater when the soil near the benggang wall the average re at the upper middle and lower slopes were 0 1128 0 2140 and 0 1969 and 0 2561 0 3094 and 0 4729 during the two rainfall events respectively the standard deviations sds of the re were 0 1203 and 0 4703 at the upper slope and lower slope during the second rainfall which had a greater total amount and longer duration than the first rainfall event the sd of the re of the lower slope was four times that of the upper slope additionally in the deeper soil the re of df was more discrete and greater the average re values of the 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm soil layers were 0 0510 0 1790 and 0 2944 and 0 1889 0 3306 and 0 5202 during the two rainfall events respectively especially during the second rainfall the sd of the re in the 20 40 cm soil layer at different slope positions was 0 0907 while it was 0 4662 in the 60 80 cm soil layer from fig 8 there are significant differences p 0 05 in the re of the different slopes and different soil layers during the two precipitations the re was also calculated when macropore pf occurred in table 2 most of the pf occurred in the deeper soil layers at the lower part of the slope the re of pf was ten times that of df and was generally greater than 3 the calculation was executed according to the state at which the macropores were filled with water and the diameter of the macropores was selected to be a minimum value of 1 mm the velocity of the vertical down flow was approximately 0 3 cm s in general there was no smaller value than 0 3 cm s which was a limit therefore 3 was a critical value a re greater than 3 was a sign for the occurrence of pf the maximum re when pf occurred was in the 60 80 cm soil layer at r3 where the re was 9 however limited by the depth of the monitored soil layer and the monitoring frequency of soil water the value may not be the maximum when the span of the water flow infiltration path was 60 cm equal to the maximum monitored soil depth the water flow movement time was equal to the minimum monitoring time interval of 2 min and the maximum re was 9 4 discussions 4 1 the spatial heterogeneity of soil macropores on the benggang slope the distribution of macropores on the benggang slope varied with slope position and soil depth in this paper the number of macropores was large when the soil was close to the benggang wall or the soil was located in a deeper layer the number of macropores in the lower part of the slope was almost twice that in the upper part of the slope the formation of soil macropores is mainly affected by water erosion geological activities and soil texture watanabe kugisaki 2017 the rapid and dramatic changes in soil water are one of the reasons for the abundant macropores near the benggang wall the rapid infiltration flow can not only increase the total amount of water entering the soil but also allow water to infiltrate deeper soil the fast moving water stream can carry a large number of fine particles with the long term erosion of the water stream soil voids are formed and macropores are developed koestel larsbo 2014 simultaneously as the soil water content increases or decreases the soil body can also expand or shrink to produce macropores in addition when benggang erosion occurs a large quantity of soil collapses under hydraulic and gravitational forces the collapse of the benggang wall pulls the soil near the benggang wall to form a large number of vertical fractures and weak structural planes these highly correlated soil fractures can easily become channels for rapid water movement menichino et al 2014 the weak structural planes further accelerate the movement of water flow which then promotes macropore formation tsuboyama et al 1994 the pull of the collapse of the benggang wall is another reason for the abundant macropores near the benggang wall on the benggang slope there were more macropores in the deep soil layer the topsoil in the benggang slope is clay loam soil and the lower layer is sand soil under the same conditions sand soil with a lighter texture can always easily form macropores pierret pankhurst 1999 in highly permeable non adhesive sand soil when there is a head gradient and the force acting on the soil particles exceeds the bearing capacity of the soil structure it is easy to produce natural soil piping jones 2010 because of the good permeability of sand rainfall infiltrates rapidly in sand and can easily reach deeper layers of soil additionally due to the weak structural properties of sand the soil structure is easily destroyed as a large number of fine soil particles are washed away a large number of voids between the soil particles form macropores yassar et al 2000 the sand layer at a deep depth on the benggang slope is a natural hotbed for the formation of macropores 4 2 the influence of soil macropore on soil water movement and benggang erosion the existing research results show that the macropore structural plane formed by various joints and fissures in the loose and deeply weathered granite shell can be easily fractured shi et al 2012 in this paper as the soil approaches to the benggang wall the number of macropores increases significantly these macropores cut through each other and are extremely conducive to the infiltration of rainwater and surface runoff flow the existence of macropores increases the infiltration rate of the rainwater and become a rapidly moving path of soil water buttle mcdonald 2015 the rapid water conduction of macropores is an important precipitating factor for the collapse of benggang this process accelerates the development of a collapse by accelerating rainfall infiltration increasing the weight of the soil body when the gravity of a soil body rich in water exceeds the stress that the soil can carry the soil body will collapse along the macropore structural plane ollobarren et al 2016 larsen et al 2010 have studied the effect of the pore water pressure on landslide occurrences and determined that the rapid change in macropore water pressure is an important factor for facilitating landslide occurrences similarly in this paper when the soil was close to the benggang wall area the soil water content varied greatly and the water movement was more vigorous during the two rainfalls this infiltrating water accumulates rapidly in the macropores and forms a positive pore water pressure so that the cohesion and shear strength between the soils disappear furthermore the rapidly changing pore water pressure can expand the fracture increase the number of macropores and promote the development of benggang erosion in addition the presence of macropores reduces the shear strength of the soil a decrease in the shear strength of the soil tends to cause a collapse of the benggang wall the infiltrating water through macropores can also wash away the fine soil particles in the soil which destroys the structure of the soil layer fine soil particles can enhance the cohesion between soil particles and soil shear strength hatami 2010 as the fine particles are washed away the shear strength of the soil decreases suo et al 2018 also believed that the degree of cementation of a weathered crust positively correlates with the content of fine particles in the soil abundant of fine particles in the weathered soil can improve the erosion resistance of the soil body mouri et al 2014 in this paper there are abundant of macropores in the lower layer of the benggang slope which will make a large number of fine particles in the soil easily washed away this effect results in a reduction in the cohesion of the benggang soil a decrease in the impact resistance and the easy collapse of the benggang wall under the dual action of rapid infiltration of macropores and the gravity of the benggang wall soil new macropores will be gradually generated by this cycle the collapse will be increasingly more serious 4 3 using the re to determine the effect of subsurface flow on benggang erosion in this study for df or pf the value of re was relatively large when the soil was close to the benggang wall or the soil was located in a deeper soil layer the larger pore size and the high flow velocity of water are the main reasons for the larger value of re hultmark et al 2012 when the darcy flow occurs the infiltration of rainwater follows darcy s law i e the water flow is uniformly infiltrated along the decreasing direction of the soil water potential under the effect of the hydraulic gradient at this time because the soil pore diameter for transporting rainwater is small and the flow velocity is slow the re of the darcy flow is small however more macropores can still promote the movement of water flow so the re of df that occurs in the soil with more macropores will also increase when pf occurred the re was much greater than when df was the dominating form the movement of the pf does not follow darcy s law at this point the pf migrates quickly disorderly and non uniformly downward through the macropores bypassing part of the soil matrix gerke et al 2015 miyazaki 2006 believed that when df is the dominating flow form in sand soil the re ranges from 0 01 to 0 1 and the re of pf is 1 10 in this paper when pf occurs and the water flows in a macropore channel with a diameter equal to 1 mm the minimum re is 3 when the diameter of the macropores is larger than 1 mm the re must be greater than this value in addition when the re is 3 the minimum velocity of the sediment flow is 0 3 cm s 1 considering that sand will increase the viscosity coefficient of the water flow when the sediment concentration in the water increases the speed of the water flow must be greater than this value to generate pf in this case the re is also necessarily greater than 3 a re of subsurface flow more than 3 is a criterion for determining the occurrence of pf we consider another extreme case when there is no cohesion between the soil particles for example the velocity of vertical down flow in coarse glass particles with an average diameter of 1 mm is approximately 1 cm s 1 and the re for this flow is estimated to be 10 miyazaki 2006 since the re depends on the physical condition of the flow in soils when the diameter of macropores is 1 mm the re of pf in soils is estimated to be less than 10 but is close to this value the re is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the ratio of the momentum an important indicator reflecting the flow shear force τ and viscous forces f of water flow mark et al 2007 have shown that a hydraulic factor such as the re the ability of water flow to destroy the soil and strip the soil particles in this study the relationship between subsurface flow and benggang erosion was determined by using the re variation during the rainfall infiltration process on slopes with different macropore distributions the re reached its maximum value in the deep soil layer on the lower part of the slope where the macropores were abundant for both the df and pf the larger re represents a greater τ of the subsurface flow and will also enhance the scouring of soil particles mazzuoli et al 2016 the finer the soil particles are the less shearing force is required for washing chen et al 2016 foster meyer 1972 proposed that when the τ is greater than the critical shear stress of the soil the soil particles are denuded the washing of the fine particles by the τ of subsurface flow is an important cause of the development of benggang erosion wang et al 2014 the re can also be used to characterize the degree of turbulence and the flow pattern in soil sahu et al 2009 the flow pattern is a basic parameter for characterizing the flow dynamics in soil and is directly related to runoff and sediment transport calculations in the soil the flow pattern is divided into the laminar flow and turbulent flow jonsson sparrow 1965 when the re is small the effect of f on the flow field is greater than that of τ at this time the disturbance of the flow velocity in the flow field is damped by f and the flow is laminar flow in contrast if the re is large the effect of τ on the flow field is greater than that of f sposito 1980 under the influence of τ it is easy to develop a disordered and irregular turbulent flow when the re is greater than a certain value the laminar flow becomes the turbulent flow in open channel flow and pipeline flow this value is generally considered to be equal to 150 300 eguchi et al 1983 in subsurface flow this value is much smaller because of the extremely small diameter of soil pores but no clear value is currently given in the case of subsurface flow when the minimum diameter of macropores is used as the characteristic length laminar flow is predominant when the re is less than 10 miyazaki 2006 due to the limitation of characteristic length the maximum value of the re of pf under an extreme condition that without viscous is 10 under a condition of non viscous the pattern of pf is very close or even turns into the turbulent flow studies have shown that when the flow changes to turbulent flow both the flow characteristics and the erosion power will undergo an essential change and the sediment production and sediment transport capacity will increase several times or by several orders of magnitude fattahi et al 2016 when pf occurs the re of the subsurface flow is several dozen times that of the df the presence of pf greatly accelerates the scouring and migration of soil particles and promotes the development of benggang erosion 5 conclusions the distribution of macropores on a benggang erosion slope was measured in the field in subtropical china on the benggang erosion slope the closer to the benggang wall the deeper the soil and the greater the number of macropores the number of macropores in the lower part of the slope is almost twice that in the upper part of the slope the distribution of macropores causes different water flow patterns and an uneven distribution of soil water content more macropores lead to a faster water infiltration rate and a greater variation in soil water content a large number of macropores and rapidly changing soil water content are key triggering factors for the occurrence of benggang erosion on a benggang slope the rich macropores increase the re of the subsurface flow the re when pf occurs is ten times higher than the re when df occurs when pf occurs the re is greater than 3 and this value is a threshold for generating pf moreover a larger re means a larger flow shear force which accelerates the scouring and migration of fine soil particles destroys the structure of the soil layer and promotes the development of benggang erosion in addition the calculation and comparison of re under different flow patterns can be widely used in future studies to establish the hydraulic model of subsurface flow and predict

5469,the increasing population in south china is exposed to benggang erosion that deteriorates slope stability and agricultural production however the influence of subsurface flow especially macropore flow on the development of benggang erosion and the collapse of benggang remains inadequately studied to address this issue we measured the spatial distribution of soil macropores on an active benggang eroded slope in a subtropical region in china during the experimental period of 20151221 to 20180116 two collapse events were observed on the study slope in addition the soil water content at the depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm was monitored at a time interval of five minutes at six sites along the slope the velocities of vertical subsurface flow traveling between measured soil depths were determined based on the difference in the response time of soil water content to rainfall along the depth further the reynolds number re of subsurface flow in different water patterns e g darcy flow df and preferential flow pf was calculated based on soil pore size and flow velocity results indicate that the number of macropores near the benggang wall i e the most active area of erosion on a benggang slope was almost twice that on the upper slope the presence of abundant macropores near the benggang wall facilitated faster subsurface flow and a greater variation in soil water content in time and space which significantly influenced benggang erosion and collapse for both the df and pf the maximum re was detected near the benggang wall the re of pf was ten times higher than that of df the re being greater than 3 was the threshold to initiate pf moreover the larger re of pf likely enhanced the leaching of fine soil particles and promoted the occurrence of benggang erosion this study confirms the key role of macropore flow in benggang erosion which helps better understanding modeling and controlling of benggang erosion keywords hydropedology macropore flow preferential flow reynolds number soil erosion slope stability 1 introduction soil erosion has become a significant threat to environmental and ecological sustainability in china in the hilly areas of the subtropical region in south china benggang erosion has been recognized as the most extensive soil degradation process especially in the red soil area overlying on the granite parent material chen et al 2013 benggang fig 1 a professional term used by chinese researchers refers to an erosional phenomenon that the slope and the soil body vertically collapse under the combined forces of water flow and gravity shi 1991 a typical benggang is composed of a catchment slope a gully head also called the benggang wall the most active area in the slope an avalanche pile a flow channel and an alluvial fan lin huang 2009 there are more than 483 400 km2 benggang erosion areas have been observed in over 300 cities in south china liang et al 2009 benggang has caused severe soil erosion which jeopardizes agricultural production and food security in china zhang et al 2014 with the urban sprawls and increasing population in china more people are now exposed to benggang erosion risks wu zhong 1997 therefore an in depth understanding of the development of benggang erosion and benggang collapse has become an important issue of significant public and scientific interest li et al 2009 some efforts have been pursued to explore the mechanisms governing benggang erosion jiang et al 2014 liu and zhang 2015 these studies suggested that the dynamics of benggang erosion are complicated which are jointly controlled by the interaction between soil structures e g soil pores bulk density and texture and external conditions e g rainfall characteristics and terrain attributes jiang et al 2014 among these controlling factors the effects of soil properties and surface runoff on benggang collapse have been extensively studied e g luo et al 2009 tao et al 2015 for example liu ling 2011 proposed that the loose granite material is the favorable geological setting for the occurrence of benggang erosion wu wang 2000 believed that the surface runoff washes soil particles on the benggang slope and promotes the formation of soil pores the increasing soil porosity facilitates infiltration and deeper percolation shi 1991 introduced that the infiltration and redistribution process in the soil body have exacerbated the uneven distribution of soil water content which caused the spatially variable distribution of gravity in different parts of the soil body then under the combined forces of water flow and gravity the collapse of bengang occurs however the influence of subsurface flow on the development of benggang erosion and the collapse of benggang has not been well studied the prevalence of subsurface flow has been observed in many types of soil and landscapes lin 2010 beven germann 2013 macropore flow i e flow through biopores erosion cavities cracks fissures is the most frequently observed subsurface flow type guo lin 2018 once the water pressure on the soil matrix macropore interface exceeds the water entry pressure water converges to macropores generating macropore flow that abruptly increases the flow rate jarvis 2010 although macropores usually constitute only a small volume fraction of the total soil porosity they may dominate near saturated flow in the subsurface luxmoore et al 1990 previous studies indicated that macropores with equivalent diameters larger than 0 3 0 5 mm could direct rapid flow beven germann 1982 jarvis 2010 besides the size macropores are distinct from small soil pores also called matrix pores in hydraulic functions such as continuity tortuosity and connectivity beven and germann 1982 which further determines the pathway velocity and magnitude of macropore flow macropore flow is the primary route for the rapid long range transport of soil solutions such as water and fine soil particles xu et al 2016 due to the faster flow rate and greater flow momentum than matrix flow the influence of macropore flow on the stability of the soil body is more significant jomaa et al 2013 some studies suggested that subsurface flow including both preferential flow pf and darcy flow df can be the main driving force of soil subsurface erosion liu et al 2003 after fine soil particles are transported via macropore flow and are washed out from the soil body of the slope only the coarse particles act as the skeleton structures of the soil moret fernández gonzález cebollada 2009 this process not only causes the soil to hollow but also forms smoother seepage channels in the soil appels et al 2016 which often trigger the collapse of the slope additionally the loss of the fine soil particles can increase the local porosity and permeability of the shallow soil of the slope adams et al 2011 these fine particles will deposit in the deeper subsoil and favors the formation of a less permeable layer which considerably blocks deep percolation of subsurface flow posadas et al 2003 hence the permeability coefficient of the soil decreases in the subsoil and a temporary water stagnation zone or a perched water table forms above the less permeable layer and impairs soil strength wu et al 2016 which may induce a benggang erosion therefore we hypothesize that subsurface flow especially macropore flow plays a key role in the development of benggang erosion and the collapse of a benggang slope the hydrodynamic characteristics of subsurface flow such as velocity distribution flow shear force and energy loss have been taken into account to improve soil erosion model e g zimmermann et al 2012 al kayssi mustafa 2016 however there is no established theory to calculate the hydrodynamic characteristics of macropore flow given the similarity of macropore flow and pipeline flow the principles formulae and methods of estimating pipeline flow dynamics can be used to characterize macropore flow dong et al 2013 the reynolds number re is the main hydraulic factor that represents the hydrodynamics characteristics of water flow determining re of macropore flow can therefore help understand the role of macropore flow in benggang development the aims of this study are as follows 1 to reveal the spatial distribution of macropores in a typical benggang slope and the influence of macropore on soil water content distribution and the occurrence of macropore flow and 2 to calculate the re for different flow patterns of subsurface flow e g darcy flow through soil matrix and preferential flow along macropores and examine the influence of the dynamics of subsurface flow in the development of benggang erosion 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area was located in tongcheng county 113 36 114 4 e and 29 2 29 24

china meteorological administration this region is underlain by granite bedrock which is highly weathered due to the humid climate and derives a thick loose and deep soil layer the granite weathering crust in studied hillslope can generally be 10 20 m in depth the soil is basically a strongly acidic to acidic soil in the test area the soils are developed from granite classified as ultisols by the u s soil taxonomy system the hillslope has a vegetation coverage of less than 30 dominated by the forked fern dicranopteris dichotoma thunb bernh there are a total of 1102 benggang slopes in the county 2005 remote sensing survey of soil and water loss in hubei province and most of the benggang slopes are still experiencing erosion field experiments were conducted on a representative hilly slope an active benggang area where two collapses occurred on 20160602 and 20170624 the study hillslope sits at nw 60 fig 1 13 m in height and approximately 19 m in length from the benggang wall to the top of the slope with a slope gradient from 30 to 50 the benggang wall is steeper than 75 with a depth of approximately 5 2 m the soil on the slope changes with the slope position the surface soil horizon a horizon is shallow and is generally lost by water erosion with a small amount of a horizon on the upper part of the slope there is no a horizon in the middle and lower parts of the slope a subsurface red clayey layer b horizon is exposed to air with a sandy soil layer bc horizon in the deeper part of the soil profile and the detritus gravels c horizon remained below in soil profile throughout the field investigation at all sites the soils at the depth of 20 40 cm are a red clayey layer at depths of 40 80 cm are a transitional layer from red clayey soil to sandy soil layer but soils at a depth of 80 m turn out to be a sandy layer on lower parts of the slope the detailed data of soil texture at different slope positions and different depths are shown in table1 2 2 high frequency soil water content monitoring this study focuses on a typical benggang catchment slope two parallel soil water content and soil temperature monitoring zones l and r were established in the direction from the benggang wall along the top of the slope each monitoring zone was established with three monitoring sites from the benggang wall at 11 3 6 1 and 2 0 m labeled as l1 l2 l3 and r1 r2 r3 respectively four layers 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm were monitored at each site soil water and precipitation data collected from 20151221 to 20180116 were used in this study to embed the soil water sensor at different depths of the soil profile a pit 20 cm width and 80 cm depth was dug at each site with the longer side oriented along the hillslope a vertical array of soil moisture sensors was installed according to soil horizons four sensors approximately 7 cm in length smec 300 sm ec temp sensor spectrum technologies inc were horizontally installed at the depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm in one side of the pit sensors at each site connect to one data collector watchdog 2400 spectrum technologies inc to concurrently measure the volumetric water content the sensors were calibrated before they were installed and the readings were obtained at a frequency of every 5 min or 2 min interval in the rainy period of summer the precipitation data was monitored by a weather station watchdog 219 2000 spectrum technologies inc after the installation of the equipment the cutting ring soil samples r 3 h 8 cm for the unsaturated water conductivity measurement system the intact cutting ring soil samples r 2 5 h 5 1 cm and the soil samples for analyzing soil properties were collected at the depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm there are three replicates for per locus 72 samples for each kind of the cutting rings after these samples have been taken the pit was backfilled by soil with similar properties 2 3 soil macropore the bulk density total porosity saturated volume water content were measured by the drying weighing method zwarich shaykewich 1969 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured by a constant head hydraulic head was 9 88 cm method amoozegar 1989 the soil texture was determined using a pipetting method following the procedure proposed by day 1965 the number of soil pores in different diameter ranges were calculated by the data measured by tension infiltration and unsaturated water conductivity measurement system and more detailed soil pore distribution was obtained based on the soil water characteristic curve swcc according to brooks corey 1964 the diameter is calculated as d 3 h where h cm h2o is the height of the water applied to the matrix suction d mm is the diameter of the soil pore equivalent to the suction the soil water content corresponding to a soil matrix suction was measured during the soil wetting tension infiltration and drying unsaturated water conductivity measurement system processes during the soil wetting process we conducted the tension infiltration experiments at a site before the installation of soil moisture sensors to measure soil pore distribution t method a tension infiltrometer 20 cm base soil measurement equipment company arizona usa was used under the suction of 15 cm h2o 9 cm h2o and 3 cm h2o after each suction was measured the soil sample was taken to determine the soil water content by weighing method after drying every time the infiltration finished the wet soil layer with a thickness of 3 4 cm was removed and then the infiltration was repeated in the same place on one soil layer the tension infiltration was repeated three times eventually a pit formed this pit was a hole for embedding the probe the method refers to the embedded probe process when we did tension infiltration every suction corresponds to a corresponding diameter of the soil pores when the infiltration rate reached a stable state all the pores smaller than the corresponding diameter were filled with water and then the number of soil pores smaller than that diameter was calculated according to the soil water content after the end of two suction infiltrations the difference in the soil water content is the number of different soil pores between the two diameters when the matrix suction is 3 cm h2o all the soil pores with a diameter of less than 1 mm are filled with water luxmoore et al 1990 at this time subtracting the residual water content from the total volume water content is the number of pores larger than 1 mm during a soil drying process a series of matrix suction and soil water content values of one soil layer were measured by an unsaturated water conductivity measurement system ku pf apparatus dt 04 01 umwelt geräte technik gmbh ger to determine soil pore distribution u method the measurements were repeated three times two microtensiometers the suction range is 0 800 cm h2o were inserted at a distance of 2 5 cm from the top and bottom of the ring cutter the change in the soil matrix suction and the soil water content of the cutting ring sample during the soil drying process was measured every 10 min each soil matrix suction has a corresponding soil water content and soil pore diameter the number of soil pores of different diameters was calculated in the same way as the process used by the tension infiltrometer but the soil matrix suction was the average of two gauge microtensiometers after all the experiments were completed the soil water characteristic data obtained from the tension infiltrometer and the ku pf apparatus was input to the retc u s salinity laboratory 4500 glenwood drive riverside ca 92051 computer program in the program the swcc was fitted and drawn by the vg model van genuchten 1980 and a more specific distribution of the soil macropores was calculated the vg model in soil was calculated as 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ m3 m3 is the balanced volume water content θr m3 m3 is the residual water content θs m3 m3 is the saturated water content h m is the matrix suction α n and m are empirical fitting parameters m 1 1 n in model fitting process according to the instructions for the tension infiltrometer and the relevant instructions of the retc software published by u s salinity laboratory van genuchten et al 1991 simunek and van genuchten 2000 the parameters such as θr θs h α and n were calculated by adding the measured soil texture and bulk density to the retc software then three soil matrix suction and balanced water content measured points were used to estimate the swcc by vg model in this process the balanced volume water content and matrix suction are considered as variables raw data and the others are fitting parameters 2 4 the calculation of the reynolds number re the re is the ratio of the momentum of the water flow and viscous forces this number comprehensively represents the size of the water flow channel and linear velocity of the flow in soil the re of the subsurface flow in soil was calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2 re u d v 3 u a s t where u m s is the water flow linear velocity in soil ν m2 s is the viscosity coefficient of water at a certain temperature in this study the value is 0 8 10 6 m2 s at an actual air temperature of 30 c d m is the diameter of the soil pore equivalent to the suction s m is the length of the water flow infiltration path the product of the distance between the different soil layers t s is the separated time when rainwater infiltrated into the different soil layers a is the curvature of the soil water infiltration channel the ratio of the actual length of the path through which the water flows and the distance between the soil layers according to the brooks corey equation in this study we adopted the value of 2 brooks 1964 in this study soil pores that exhibit a diameter greater than 1 mm were considered as macropores the matrix suction of the corresponding macropores is less than 3 cm h2o according to the definition of macropores given by luxmoore 1981 the diameter of soil pores 1 mm are macropores 1 mm also is the minimum diameter of macropores in this study during the two rainfall events the pore diameter was selected as 1 mm when the re of macropore pf was actually calculated the pore diameter in calculating the re of df was the equivalent pore size represented by the matrix suction determined by the water content in the simulation curve during the soil wetting process the key parameters in the calculation process were the infiltration time and the infiltration rate the time difference of rainwater reached to different soil layers was used to calculate the infiltration rate the starting time point selected when calculating the re of the pf was the node at which the pf began to occur between the two soil layers during the infiltration process the starting time point selected when calculating the re of the df was the node at which rainwater began to maintain a stable uniform infiltration between the two soil layers the determination of pf and df was operated through the coordination of soil water content and soil temperature that was proposed by tao et al 2017 2 5 statistics from 20160101 to 20171231 we measured the soil water content for 288 times at each site per day the daily average of precipitation was used for further analysis in order to reflect the influence of macropores distribution on the dynamic change of soil water content the coefficient of variation cv of the daily average soil water content at different sites was calculated the one way anova analysis of the re when df was the dominating form during the two rainfalls events used to determine whether there is a significant difference in the re of darcy flow at different sites and depths at the same time the spatial heterogeneity of re was determined by calculating the standard deviation sd throughout the whole study a 5 significance level was considered all statistical analyses were performed with the software origin 8 0 origin lab corporation northampton massachusetts usa 3 results 3 1 the spatial distribution of soil pores on a benggang slope the distribution of soil pores on the slope was calculated by swcc the swccs obtained via the two methods are compared in fig 3 the slope of swccs of two different processes varied with slope positions when closer to the benggang wall the soil matrix suction increased slowly with a decrease in soil water content for example in most soil layers of the l3 and r3 sites the soil water content was 0 37 m3 m3 when the corresponding soil matrix suction was 3 cm h2o during the soil wetting process however at the l1 and r1 sites on the upper part of the slope the soil water content was 0 40 m3 m3 when the soil matrix suction was 3 cm h2o the slope of the swcc of the deeper soil layer was smaller and the soil matrix suction increased more slowly with a decrease in soil water content for example the surface soil water content was 0 40 m3 m3 when the soil matrix suction of the surface soil layer was 3 cm h2o during the soil wetting process except for the l3 and r3 sites however in the deep soil layer the corresponding soil water content was 0 38 m3 m3 when the soil matrix suction was 3 cm h2o the swcc directly reflected the distribution of soil pores the soil pore distributions at different sites and different soil layers are shown in fig 4 the law of the soil pore distribution was similar to that of the swcc in this study the t method is more likely to reflect the existence of macropores because the disc infiltrometer has a larger diameter than soil cores used for u method there were more macropores in the lower part of the slope and in deeper soil layers in addition the soil macropores on the right side of the slope i e r1 r2 and r3 were also much larger than the left side i e l1 l2 and l3 these patterns of soil pore distribution remained very similar regardless of the wetting or drying processes however at the same site the number of macropores calculated in the soil wetting process was greater than the drying process the difference in the number of macropores between two methods amplified with the increasing number of macropores the difference of macropore proportion reached the maximum of 4 48 at the 60 80 cm depth at the r3 site fig 4 in the lower part of the slope the average proportion of macropores measured during the wetting process was 4 61 while the value was 2 58 for the upper part of the slope the average proportion of macropores in two slope positions was 2 83 and 1 79 respectively measured during the soil drying process the proportion of macropores in the lower part of the slope was almost twice that in the upper part of the slope the largest proportion of macropores 9 72 or 5 44 by two methods was detected at the 60 80 cm depth at the r3 site there were more macropores in deeper soil layers the average proportion of the macropores at the 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm depth at the six sites was 1 46 2 73 3 56 and 4 38 respectively during the soil wetting process however during the soil drying process the corresponding values changed to 1 89 2 02 1 98 and 2 64 respectively the difference in the number of macropores along the soil depth was more noticeable during the soil wetting process 3 2 the influence of soil pore distribution on soil water movement and soil water distribution on 20160602 the precipitation was 92 6 mm the rainwater on the right side of the slope with more macropores reached soil depths of 40 60 and 80 cm almost within 3 h especially at the r3 site the soil water content in 60 80 cm soil layer and 40 60 cm layer increased simultaneously after infiltration there are several sudden increases and decreases in the soil water content fig 5 all these variations indicated the occurrence of pf in r3 however the increase in the soil water content on the left and upper part of the slope was relatively gentle for example at the l1 site there was no sudden change in the soil water content in another example at the l3 site there was no rapid movement of soil water the rainwater reached depths of 20 40 60 and 80 cm in sequence after 2 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h of rainfall respectively on 20170624 the precipitation was 112 2 mm the change in the soil water content was similar to that of 20160602 however the phenomenon of macropores accelerating water movement was even more pronounced this acceleration was true even on the left side of the slope with relatively few of macropores at the r2 and r3 sites the soil water content in 60 80 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers began to increase simultaneously fig 6 in addition the soil water content in the 60 80 cm soil layer quickly exceeded the upper layer 40 60 cm in a short period of time at the r1 site the rainwater also reached soil depths of 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm at the same time however the difference from the rainfall on 20160602 is that the soil water content in different soil layers also increased at the same time at the l2 and l3 sites specifically the rapid increase and decrease in soil water content also appeared at a depth of 80 cm at the l3 site where there was no pf during the last precipitation these results show that there was pf at all five sites except l1 the existence of macropores is the main reason for the pf the distributions of the soil water content differed with slope positions and soil layers in precipitation dates fig 7 as the number of macropores increases the average soil water content decreases but the cv of the soil water content increases the daily average soil water content in the upper part of the slope was higher than that in the lower part of the slope but the cv of soil water content in different slope positions was opposite the average soil water content at the l1 and r1 sites maintained a high level and the average soil water content was 0 38 m3 m3 and 0 29 m3 m3 at l1 and r1 respectively the water content in the lower part of the slope was much lower than that in the upper part of the slope the average water contents at l3 and r3 were 0 29 m3 m3 and 0 26 m3 m3 respectively in general the average soil water content on the upper part of the slope was higher than that on the lower slope with a trend of θl1 θl2 θl3 and θr1 θr2 θr3 the level of soil water content variations was the smallest on the upper part of the slope indicated by a low cv ranging from 2 91 to 9 88 and the soil water content variation on the lower part of the slope was the largest with a high cv ranging from 5 65 to 13 56 the difference in soil water content at different depths was small and the interannual distribution was less affected by rainfall the cv of the soil water content in the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm soil layers at the six sites were 6 04 6 77 6 29 and 7 49 respectively the cv in the 60 80 cm soil layer was slightly larger the existence of macropores greatly accelerated the movement of soil water and exacerbated the spatial variability of the water distribution along the entire slope 3 3 the reynolds number of subsurface flows during two torrential rainfall events the re and the related calculation parameters when the rainwater infiltrated during the two rainfall events that caused the collapse of benggang are shown in table 2 when df was the dominating form of the subsurface flow regime the re was very small the re values at different locations and depths on the slope were positively related to the number of macropores at almost all sites the re increased from the surface soil to the deep subsoil table 2 the maximum value of re 0 61 was observed in the 60 80 cm soil layer at r3 when df was the dominating form the re of df was more discrete and greater when the soil near the benggang wall the average re at the upper middle and lower slopes were 0 1128 0 2140 and 0 1969 and 0 2561 0 3094 and 0 4729 during the two rainfall events respectively the standard deviations sds of the re were 0 1203 and 0 4703 at the upper slope and lower slope during the second rainfall which had a greater total amount and longer duration than the first rainfall event the sd of the re of the lower slope was four times that of the upper slope additionally in the deeper soil the re of df was more discrete and greater the average re values of the 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm soil layers were 0 0510 0 1790 and 0 2944 and 0 1889 0 3306 and 0 5202 during the two rainfall events respectively especially during the second rainfall the sd of the re in the 20 40 cm soil layer at different slope positions was 0 0907 while it was 0 4662 in the 60 80 cm soil layer from fig 8 there are significant differences p 0 05 in the re of the different slopes and different soil layers during the two precipitations the re was also calculated when macropore pf occurred in table 2 most of the pf occurred in the deeper soil layers at the lower part of the slope the re of pf was ten times that of df and was generally greater than 3 the calculation was executed according to the state at which the macropores were filled with water and the diameter of the macropores was selected to be a minimum value of 1 mm the velocity of the vertical down flow was approximately 0 3 cm s in general there was no smaller value than 0 3 cm s which was a limit therefore 3 was a critical value a re greater than 3 was a sign for the occurrence of pf the maximum re when pf occurred was in the 60 80 cm soil layer at r3 where the re was 9 however limited by the depth of the monitored soil layer and the monitoring frequency of soil water the value may not be the maximum when the span of the water flow infiltration path was 60 cm equal to the maximum monitored soil depth the water flow movement time was equal to the minimum monitoring time interval of 2 min and the maximum re was 9 4 discussions 4 1 the spatial heterogeneity of soil macropores on the benggang slope the distribution of macropores on the benggang slope varied with slope position and soil depth in this paper the number of macropores was large when the soil was close to the benggang wall or the soil was located in a deeper layer the number of macropores in the lower part of the slope was almost twice that in the upper part of the slope the formation of soil macropores is mainly affected by water erosion geological activities and soil texture watanabe kugisaki 2017 the rapid and dramatic changes in soil water are one of the reasons for the abundant macropores near the benggang wall the rapid infiltration flow can not only increase the total amount of water entering the soil but also allow water to infiltrate deeper soil the fast moving water stream can carry a large number of fine particles with the long term erosion of the water stream soil voids are formed and macropores are developed koestel larsbo 2014 simultaneously as the soil water content increases or decreases the soil body can also expand or shrink to produce macropores in addition when benggang erosion occurs a large quantity of soil collapses under hydraulic and gravitational forces the collapse of the benggang wall pulls the soil near the benggang wall to form a large number of vertical fractures and weak structural planes these highly correlated soil fractures can easily become channels for rapid water movement menichino et al 2014 the weak structural planes further accelerate the movement of water flow which then promotes macropore formation tsuboyama et al 1994 the pull of the collapse of the benggang wall is another reason for the abundant macropores near the benggang wall on the benggang slope there were more macropores in the deep soil layer the topsoil in the benggang slope is clay loam soil and the lower layer is sand soil under the same conditions sand soil with a lighter texture can always easily form macropores pierret pankhurst 1999 in highly permeable non adhesive sand soil when there is a head gradient and the force acting on the soil particles exceeds the bearing capacity of the soil structure it is easy to produce natural soil piping jones 2010 because of the good permeability of sand rainfall infiltrates rapidly in sand and can easily reach deeper layers of soil additionally due to the weak structural properties of sand the soil structure is easily destroyed as a large number of fine soil particles are washed away a large number of voids between the soil particles form macropores yassar et al 2000 the sand layer at a deep depth on the benggang slope is a natural hotbed for the formation of macropores 4 2 the influence of soil macropore on soil water movement and benggang erosion the existing research results show that the macropore structural plane formed by various joints and fissures in the loose and deeply weathered granite shell can be easily fractured shi et al 2012 in this paper as the soil approaches to the benggang wall the number of macropores increases significantly these macropores cut through each other and are extremely conducive to the infiltration of rainwater and surface runoff flow the existence of macropores increases the infiltration rate of the rainwater and become a rapidly moving path of soil water buttle mcdonald 2015 the rapid water conduction of macropores is an important precipitating factor for the collapse of benggang this process accelerates the development of a collapse by accelerating rainfall infiltration increasing the weight of the soil body when the gravity of a soil body rich in water exceeds the stress that the soil can carry the soil body will collapse along the macropore structural plane ollobarren et al 2016 larsen et al 2010 have studied the effect of the pore water pressure on landslide occurrences and determined that the rapid change in macropore water pressure is an important factor for facilitating landslide occurrences similarly in this paper when the soil was close to the benggang wall area the soil water content varied greatly and the water movement was more vigorous during the two rainfalls this infiltrating water accumulates rapidly in the macropores and forms a positive pore water pressure so that the cohesion and shear strength between the soils disappear furthermore the rapidly changing pore water pressure can expand the fracture increase the number of macropores and promote the development of benggang erosion in addition the presence of macropores reduces the shear strength of the soil a decrease in the shear strength of the soil tends to cause a collapse of the benggang wall the infiltrating water through macropores can also wash away the fine soil particles in the soil which destroys the structure of the soil layer fine soil particles can enhance the cohesion between soil particles and soil shear strength hatami 2010 as the fine particles are washed away the shear strength of the soil decreases suo et al 2018 also believed that the degree of cementation of a weathered crust positively correlates with the content of fine particles in the soil abundant of fine particles in the weathered soil can improve the erosion resistance of the soil body mouri et al 2014 in this paper there are abundant of macropores in the lower layer of the benggang slope which will make a large number of fine particles in the soil easily washed away this effect results in a reduction in the cohesion of the benggang soil a decrease in the impact resistance and the easy collapse of the benggang wall under the dual action of rapid infiltration of macropores and the gravity of the benggang wall soil new macropores will be gradually generated by this cycle the collapse will be increasingly more serious 4 3 using the re to determine the effect of subsurface flow on benggang erosion in this study for df or pf the value of re was relatively large when the soil was close to the benggang wall or the soil was located in a deeper soil layer the larger pore size and the high flow velocity of water are the main reasons for the larger value of re hultmark et al 2012 when the darcy flow occurs the infiltration of rainwater follows darcy s law i e the water flow is uniformly infiltrated along the decreasing direction of the soil water potential under the effect of the hydraulic gradient at this time because the soil pore diameter for transporting rainwater is small and the flow velocity is slow the re of the darcy flow is small however more macropores can still promote the movement of water flow so the re of df that occurs in the soil with more macropores will also increase when pf occurred the re was much greater than when df was the dominating form the movement of the pf does not follow darcy s law at this point the pf migrates quickly disorderly and non uniformly downward through the macropores bypassing part of the soil matrix gerke et al 2015 miyazaki 2006 believed that when df is the dominating flow form in sand soil the re ranges from 0 01 to 0 1 and the re of pf is 1 10 in this paper when pf occurs and the water flows in a macropore channel with a diameter equal to 1 mm the minimum re is 3 when the diameter of the macropores is larger than 1 mm the re must be greater than this value in addition when the re is 3 the minimum velocity of the sediment flow is 0 3 cm s 1 considering that sand will increase the viscosity coefficient of the water flow when the sediment concentration in the water increases the speed of the water flow must be greater than this value to generate pf in this case the re is also necessarily greater than 3 a re of subsurface flow more than 3 is a criterion for determining the occurrence of pf we consider another extreme case when there is no cohesion between the soil particles for example the velocity of vertical down flow in coarse glass particles with an average diameter of 1 mm is approximately 1 cm s 1 and the re for this flow is estimated to be 10 miyazaki 2006 since the re depends on the physical condition of the flow in soils when the diameter of macropores is 1 mm the re of pf in soils is estimated to be less than 10 but is close to this value the re is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the ratio of the momentum an important indicator reflecting the flow shear force τ and viscous forces f of water flow mark et al 2007 have shown that a hydraulic factor such as the re the ability of water flow to destroy the soil and strip the soil particles in this study the relationship between subsurface flow and benggang erosion was determined by using the re variation during the rainfall infiltration process on slopes with different macropore distributions the re reached its maximum value in the deep soil layer on the lower part of the slope where the macropores were abundant for both the df and pf the larger re represents a greater τ of the subsurface flow and will also enhance the scouring of soil particles mazzuoli et al 2016 the finer the soil particles are the less shearing force is required for washing chen et al 2016 foster meyer 1972 proposed that when the τ is greater than the critical shear stress of the soil the soil particles are denuded the washing of the fine particles by the τ of subsurface flow is an important cause of the development of benggang erosion wang et al 2014 the re can also be used to characterize the degree of turbulence and the flow pattern in soil sahu et al 2009 the flow pattern is a basic parameter for characterizing the flow dynamics in soil and is directly related to runoff and sediment transport calculations in the soil the flow pattern is divided into the laminar flow and turbulent flow jonsson sparrow 1965 when the re is small the effect of f on the flow field is greater than that of τ at this time the disturbance of the flow velocity in the flow field is damped by f and the flow is laminar flow in contrast if the re is large the effect of τ on the flow field is greater than that of f sposito 1980 under the influence of τ it is easy to develop a disordered and irregular turbulent flow when the re is greater than a certain value the laminar flow becomes the turbulent flow in open channel flow and pipeline flow this value is generally considered to be equal to 150 300 eguchi et al 1983 in subsurface flow this value is much smaller because of the extremely small diameter of soil pores but no clear value is currently given in the case of subsurface flow when the minimum diameter of macropores is used as the characteristic length laminar flow is predominant when the re is less than 10 miyazaki 2006 due to the limitation of characteristic length the maximum value of the re of pf under an extreme condition that without viscous is 10 under a condition of non viscous the pattern of pf is very close or even turns into the turbulent flow studies have shown that when the flow changes to turbulent flow both the flow characteristics and the erosion power will undergo an essential change and the sediment production and sediment transport capacity will increase several times or by several orders of magnitude fattahi et al 2016 when pf occurs the re of the subsurface flow is several dozen times that of the df the presence of pf greatly accelerates the scouring and migration of soil particles and promotes the development of benggang erosion 5 conclusions the distribution of macropores on a benggang erosion slope was measured in the field in subtropical china on the benggang erosion slope the closer to the benggang wall the deeper the soil and the greater the number of macropores the number of macropores in the lower part of the slope is almost twice that in the upper part of the slope the distribution of macropores causes different water flow patterns and an uneven distribution of soil water content more macropores lead to a faster water infiltration rate and a greater variation in soil water content a large number of macropores and rapidly changing soil water content are key triggering factors for the occurrence of benggang erosion on a benggang slope the rich macropores increase the re of the subsurface flow the re when pf occurs is ten times higher than the re when df occurs when pf occurs the re is greater than 3 and this value is a threshold for generating pf moreover a larger re means a larger flow shear force which accelerates the scouring and migration of fine soil particles destroys the structure of the soil layer and promotes the development of benggang erosion in addition the calculation and comparison of re under different flow patterns can be widely used in future studies to establish the hydraulic model of subsurface flow and predict
