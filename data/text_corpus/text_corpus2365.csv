11825,the rapid development of dye using industries textile paper plastic leather printing cosmetic food and pharmaceuticals etc poor effluent management and disposal techniques have led to excess amounts of wastewater polluted with toxic dyes and heavy metal ions the discharge of large volumes of toxic wastewater into the environment particularly from small scale industries causes extensive damage to natural ecosystems and human health therefore the removal of these hazardous pollutants from effluents is of interest prior to release into natural water bodies micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf shows a great potential as an effective environmentally friendly and sustainable operation in treatment of dye wastewater particularly for diluted stream for water reclamation and resource recovery meuf has been successfully investigated for removal organic dyes and heavy metal ions from aqueous solution in single or binary system in this review we aim to provide an overview of the recent development state of the art and future perspectives of meuf for treatment of dye wastewater this article critically reviews the performance and capability of meuf process in the treatment of dye wastewater with the consideration of the basic principles transport modelling membrane fouling technical viability and parameters affecting micellization optimization of feed process throughput and removal efficiency the effects of type of surfactants membranes initial feed concentrations operating conditions etc on the process performance are reviewed this review presents the evidence of simultaneous removal of co existing pollutants dyes and heavy metal ions in dye wastewater using meuf and also explores the feasibility and efficiency of biosurfactant instead of chemical surfactant besides several ways to improve process efficiency are discussed along with the technical challenges and future opportunities for treating dye wastewater long term performance of the meuf system membrane fouling transport modelling cost analysis and application on real wastewater should be paid more attention in the future studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords micellar enhanced ultrafiltration surfactant critical micelle concentration dye wastewater membrane fouling permeate flux 1 introduction the application of organic dyes and dyestuffs is appearing in many process industries such as textile paper plastic leather printing cosmetic food and pharmaceuticals etc they are cationic anionic and non ionic in nature gupta and suhas 2009 huang et 2018 for instances methylene blue dye is widely used for coloring paper dyeing cottons silk and wools coating for paper stock and as a temporary hair colorant huang et al 2010 crystal violet dye is frequently used for dyeing cotton silk paper bamboo straw and leather etc various metal containing chemicals and metal containing complex phthalocyanine dyes are commonly used in dyeing printing and finishing steps of textile processing for example fixing agents potassium sodium dichromate etc oxidizing reducing agent copper acetate copper nitrate lead acetate potassium sodium dichromate etc cross linking agent nickel compound dye auxiliary mordant copper sulfate copper ii chloride copper ii oxide acid dye chromium vi compound and catalyst zinc chloride zinc nitrate etc are used in textile processing velusamy et al 2021 also different cadmium salts such as cadmium sulphide cadmium selenite and cadmium chloride etc are used in dyeing and printing textiles swarup et al 2007 metal based reactive dyes being economical are extensively used for dyeing and printing for cellulose fibres these reactive dyes are bound with heavy metals such as copper chromium zinc lead and nickel etc the typical concentration of heavy metals such as 33 110 mg l of copper and 3 83 mg l of chromium in vat dyes 3 32 mg l of zinc in basic dyes 6 52 mg l of lead in reactive dyes and about 1 mg l of cadmium in all types of dyes velusamy et al 2021 dyeing industries consume large volume of water in their unit operations approximately 15 20 of the dyes are lost during processing and discharged in the effluent from dying operations unit chakraborty et al 2011 the wastewater generated particularly from industrial operations of textile and dyes contains both dissolved organics dyes and heavy metal ions beyond their acceptable concentration limit the use of metal containing chemicals and metal containing complex dyes are the major source of heavy metal ions pb ii cd ii cu ii zn ii cr vi etc in dye wastewater these effluents are varying in colour composition and ph bielska and prochaska 2007 the two pollutants namely dyes and heavy metal ions are toxic carcinogenic and non biodegradable in nature among the different pollutants released to the environment these pollutants are regarded as the most dangerous contaminant due to high operating cost small scale industries usually discharge the hazardous waste directly to the aquatic environment in addition the rapid industrial development poor disposal techniques and effluent management particularly in developing countries are the reason of mixing of dye wastes of different sources these lead to the presence of both the toxic pollutants in wastewaters huang et al 2014 the release of the untreated effluent containing dyes and or heavy metal ions from the industrial sewage into the surface water poses harmful effects to human health even at low concentration besides these pollutants can modify the physico chemical properties of water affecting the aquatic life resulting in a significant ecological impact on ecosystem proper treatment of wastewater containing such pollutants is becoming increasingly important because of more stringent discharge regulations therefore the removal of these hazardous pollutants from waste effluents is of interest prior to release into natural water bodies in both developed and developing countries gupta and suhas 2009 zaghbani et al 2009a during the past few decades various techniques have been employed for the treatment of dye wastewater worth mentioning the conventional techniques are biodegradation coagulation flocculation oxidation and adsorption rajasimman et al 2017 gilpavas et al 2017 luo et al 2015 etc literature review reveals that each technique has advantages as well as limitations such as high operating cost time consuming operation equilibrium governed generation of secondary pollutants difficulty in regeneration and inappropriate for large scale application etc thus developing a high efficiency separation method was essential for advanced treatment of dye wastewater in this regard membrane separation processes particularly in the range of nanofiltration nf and ultrafiltration uf are increasingly investigated for the treatment of dye wastewater nf membrane 200 1000 da rejects effectively most of the dyes but needs high operating pressure i e high energy requirement for desired throughput ahmad et al 2006 nataraj et al 2009 askari et al 2015 the high selectivity in nanofiltration is attributed to the combination of size exclusion donnan exclusion and solution diffusion mechanisms abdullah et al 2019 however nf membrane faces serious problems related to concentration polarization and membrane fouling caused by dye adsorption precipitation of inorganics colloid deposition and biological growth etc bielska and prochaska 2007 compared to nf uf processes operate at low pressure and give higher process throughput however uf membrane 10 100 nm with molecular weight cut off mwco of 1 100 kda cannot remove smaller size dye molecules having molecular weights in the range from a few hundred to over a thousand daltons da the removal mechanism in ultrafiltration is governed by size exclusion effect abdullah et al 2019 an ideal membrane for dye wastewater treatment should have dual advantages such as high process throughput and high solute rejection efficiency in this regard adsorptive dynamic membrane having dual pollutant removal capability adsorption and membrane separation exhibited good removal efficiency at low pollutant concentration and operated at low operating pressure of ultrafiltration range for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater xu et al 2018 however absorption saturation restricted the long term stability and practicability of adsorptive dynamic membrane recently biomimetic dynamic membrane fabricated by physical absorption and filtration of carbon nanotubes and laccases enzyme on the surface of 150 kda pes ultrafiltration membrane exhibited excellent cv dye removal efficiency at low dye concentration with satisfying permeate flux high anti fouling capacity and long term stability chen et al 2019 in another effort to developing sustainable technologies for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater meuf has been shown to be promising and economical in removing traces of dissolved organic pollutants and or heavy metal ions from single multi pollutant aqueous diluted streams and has been studied for more than 35 years dunn et al 1985 meuf process operated at low pressure gives satisfactory process efficiency high throughput and high rejection efficiency with much less energy consumption and hence can be effectively utilized for separating dyes and heavy metal ions zaghbani et al 2009a ke et al 2007 huang et al 2010 yenphan et al 2010 in meuf micelles containing solubilized solute are large enough to be filtered by the uf membrane via the size exclusion mechanism different types of dyes have been used as model dyes for lab scale meuf process table 1 purkait et al 2006 bielska nad szymanowski 2006 majewska nowak et al 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 zaghbani et al 2009a 2009b samal et al 2017a parakala et al 2019 the concurrent removal of dyes and heavy metal ions using meuf are also reported in literature zeng et al 2011 huang et al 2014 verma and sarkar 2019 2020 in meuf process the surfactant is added to the polluted aqueous stream at concentration levels equal to or higher than its critical micelle concentration cmc the surfactant monomers will self associate to form aggregates micelles which can bind the heavy metal ions at their surface according to their surface charge and solubilize the organic pollutants in the micelle interior the micelle solution is then filtered through an uf membrane with an appropriate pore size smaller than aggregates sizes during ultrafiltration the surfactant aggregates with adsorbed solubilized pollutants can be retained by the membrane whereas the free surfactant monomers and very low concentration of untrapped pollutants pass through the uf membrane with the permeate stream thus almost clean water is obtained which can be recycled in process or discarded dunn et al 1985 christian and scamehorn 1989 scamehorn et al 1989 it is worthy to mention here that the presence of monovalent divalent inorganic salts nacl and na2so4 etc in wastewater is typical in a dye house effluent as they are commonly used in dyeing process zaghbani et al 2009a during meuf treatment of dye wastewater these inorganic salts also freely pass through the uf membrane and thus appearing in the permeate side this fundamental concept of meuf was first investigated for ionic surfactants sodium oleate and potassium laurate by j mcbain and w jenkins in 1922 and for non ionic surfactant polyoxyethylated 1 dodecanol by h schott in 1964 the effectiveness of any meuf depends on the properties and concentrations of the surfactants and pollutants solution ph and compositions ionic strength membrane pore size and hydrodynamic conditions such as transmembrane pressure difference δp stirrer speed ω feed flow rate u and temperature t etc since its introduction there are a lot of experimental investigations carried out on the applications of meuf in the wastewater treatment data from scopus reveal that meuf has gained tremendous interest in the treatment of wastewater particularly for diluted stream over the past decade due to process simplicity and low operation cost many research articles on meuf have been published over the past few years and this number is expected to rise in the upcoming years fig 1 presently numerous laboratory scale research studies have been documented on the practicability of meuf process for the removal of dyes and heavy metal ions from dye wastewater in a single system or in binary system with high rejection coefficient tables 2 and 3 juang et al 2003 purkait et al 2006 bielska and szymanowski 2006 majewska nowak et al 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 samal et al 2017b the removal of heavy metal ions which are commonly found in dye wastewater are reported in this review the possibility of removing of dyes and heavy metal ions by meuf has also been reported when the pollutants co exist in wastewater zeng et al 2011 huang et al 2014 verma and sarkar 2019 2020 moreover a few meuf studies have been reported in literature for treating real wastewaters including olive mill wastewater el abbassi et al 2011 raisin processing wastewater afifia et al 2014 soft drink processing wastewater hamed azizi namaghi and seyed mahmoud mousavi 2014 phosphorous rich wastewater of fertilizer plant häyrynen et al 2012 and plastic plating wastewater chang et al 2014 however to the best of our knowledge the application of meuf on industrial dye wastewater has not been reported so far the major drawback of any meuf process is the transient decline in permeation rate due to development of concentration polarization and membrane fouling concentration polarization refers to the reversible build up of solutes in liquid phase near the membrane surface in meuf it describes the variation of surfactant concentration in the thin boundary layer neighbouring the membrane surface kamble and marathe 2005 ke et al 2007 fang et al 2008 zaghbani et al 2009a on the other hand membrane fouling occurs due to several possible reasons such as adsorption of solutes unsolubilized pollutants smaller micelles etc on the membrane pores and by blockage partial blockage of these pores and formation of deposited layer at the membrane surface by the rejected pollutant micelles complexes yenphan et al 2010 acero et al 2017 during the process of concentration polarization surfactant micelles block the membrane pores and cause a resistance against the solvent flow resulting in quick decline in permeate flux at the early stage of filtration ke et al 2007 zaghbani et al 2009a huang et al 2010 during meuf the rejected pollutant surfactant aggregates may also form highly viscous boundary layer adjacent to the membranes surface which is well known as a gel layer actually when the micelle concentration on the membrane surface reaches an adequately high value the gel layer forms in addition to the hydrodynamic membrane resistance the gel layer offers extra resistance to flow through the membranes resulting in the flux decline purkait et al 2004a el zeftawy and mulligan 2011 acero et al 2017 nature and size of foulant also play an important role in determining the potential of membrane fouling zhang and jiang 2018 have reported the existence of maximum fouling caused by cake layer formation pore blocking and irreversible fouling etc at a critical size of foulant during the investigation of membrane fouling in aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor membrane fouling caused by gel forming solutes such as transparent exopolymer particles has been reported in literature meng et al 2020 have recently reviewed the transparent exopolymer particles associated membrane fouling with regard to its formation detection and properties during water and wastewater treatment schwarze 2017 has provided a comprehensive review on the state of the art of meuf and explaining the nitty gritty of the process however to the best of our knowledge there is no critical review available in literature that can provide an in depth analysis on the performance of meuf for the treatment of dye wastewater particularly identification of fouling mechanism the factors influencing membrane fouling transport modelling and application of mixed surfactant and biosurfactant have been scarcely reviewed and elaborately discussed accordingly this article aims to provide a comprehensive review on the recent development in meuf for the treatment of wastewater containing dye the process of micellization solubilization of micelles selection of suitable surfactant and membrane and meuf performances are summarized and discussed in detail special attentions are paid to the analysis of membrane fouling flux decline and transport modelling this review also shed light on potential application of biosurfactant in meuf 2 micellization and critical micelle concentration surfactants are molecules having both lipophilic or hydrophobic tail group and hydrophilic head group in the same molecule in aqueous solution at or above cmc value these amphiphilic molecules form self aggregates with the hydrophobic portion directed towards the center of the micelles hydrophobic interior and the hydrophilic portions located at the micelles surface hydrophilic exterior directing towards the solvent molecules aqueous phase fig 2 ahmad et al 2006 lee and lee 2016 beyond cmc value all the added surfactant molecules form aggregates which are in equilibrium with the surfactant monomers consequently concentration of free monomer in the solution remains constant at its cmc value lee and lee 2016 the aggregates are formed spontaneously due to intermolecular forces such as electrostatic hydrophobic hydrophilic hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces etc younis et al 2020 the electrostatic repulsion between charged polar head groups of surfactant monomers prevents the aggregation therefore for self aggregation the energy released as a result of association of hydrophobic tail group of the monomer should overcome the electrostatic repulsion and thus aggregation process becomes endothermic in nature alam et al 2014 micellization process leads to decrease in entropy because of free movement of surfactant monomers before micellization while their mobility is restricted after micellization the aggregates are with different sizes and morphologies depending on the surfactant concentration solvent properties ph presence of salt in the solution and temperature etc dynamic light scattering measurement is used to determine the average size and size distribution of surfactant aggregates hydrodynamic diameter the surfactant aggregates are also classified as micelles 10 nm small vesicle 10 50 nm medium vesicle 50 250 nm and large vesicle 250 nm champion et al 1995 for ionic surfactants the solution ph presence of electrolyte and surfactant concentration are found to be important factors affecting the size shape and aggregation number of surfactant aggregates the aggregate size was found to decrease with an increase in solution ph this can be attributed to the fact that increasing solution ph results to an increase the negative charge of the anionic surfactant with more negative zeta potential so the electrostatic repulsion between the adjacent hydrophilic heads of surfactants increases this leads to a large hydrophilic head diameter and restricts the formation of large aggregates at higher surfactant concentration both aggregation number and mean aggregate size decrease tanhaei et al 2014 the cmc is a fundamental property of any surfactant which gives a measure of the stability of its micellar form relative to its monomeric form it depends on nature and structure of the surfactant for determination of cmc the measured values of equilibrium surface tension of the aqueous surfactant solution at different surfactant concentrations were plotted against the corresponding logarithmic of bulk concentration surface tension isotherm the value of cmc was determined from the point of inflection of the isotherm fig 3 verma and sarkar 2019 the cmc value of surfactant depends on the nature of the hydrophilic hydrophobic groups presence of salt non ionic surfactant and organic additives in the solution ph and temperature etc alam et al 2014 the estimated value of cmc can be then be used to calculate the gibbs free energy of micellization lee and lee 2016 2 1 effects of parameters on critical micelle concentration 2 1 1 effect of feed concentration feed surfactant concentration has positive impact on mean micelle size micelle aggregation number and cmc value higher surfactant concentration leads to decrease in both aggregation number and mean micelle size as a result the large micelles turn to the small and compact micelles fang et al 2008 the mean size sds micelle was found to decrease from 3 nm to 1 5 nm with increasing sds concentration from 12 mm to 60 mm tanhaei et al 2014 an increase in rhl concentration from 1 mm to 3 mm resulted to decrease in the rhl vesicle size from 33 47 to 23 04 nm verma and sarkar 2019 the micelle size of the surfactant was also found to increases in presence of organic compound or heavy metal ions in the solution organic molecules occupied a certain volume inside of micelle core and heavy metal ions adsorbed onto the surfactant micelle surface resulting in increase in micelle size as reported sds micelle size increased from 3 nm to 3 6 nm in presence of aniline and ni ii in solution tanhaei et al 2014 a similar trend was also observed in the cv rhl system the mean vesicle size of rhl biosurfactant increased from 9 4 nm to 53 5 nm in presence of 0 08 mm crystal violet dye verma et al 2020 the feed concentration of dyes and heavy metal ions also showed significant effect on the cmc value the cmc values of sds surfactant in water in 0 5 mm cu ii solution and in 0 5 mm cd ii solution were reported as 5 9 mm 1 8 mm and 2 2 mm respectively şahin and taşcıoğlu 2016 heavy metal ions with net positive charges favor the formation of micelles by decreasing the repulsions between the negatively charged head groups of surfactants resulting decrease in cmc value in another study the cmc value of rhl decreased from 40 to 28 mg l with increase in zeta potential from 20 to 16 3 mv in presence of 0 08 mm cv in the solution verma et al 2020 huang et al 2014 also reported similar observation for cd ii sds system huang et al 2010 reported that the zeta potential of sds micelles decreased from 41 1 mv to 63 5 mv in presence of 6 mg l of mb in the solution this could be due to slight decrease of cmc value and increase in micelle aggregation number with increase in feed mb concentration resulting in the increase of surface charge density of micelles in another study two opposite trends were observed the cmc value of ctab decreased from 1 087 mm to 0 710 mm in presence of reactive dye 195 which was explained by the fact that dye molecules could easily adjust themselves within micelles which caused to decrease in repulsions between ionic heads thus making micellization easier however in presence of reactive dye 225 the cmc value of ctab slightly increased from 1 087 mm to 1 14 mm this observation might be due to complex structure of reactive dye 225 which might change their orientation for accommodating within micelles such orientation caused micellization to be less favourable resulting in increase in cmc value younis et al 2020 2 1 2 effect of salt the addition of an electrolyte significantly decreases the cmc value of ionic surfactants fig 3 the effect of salt is quantified according the following expressions corrin and harkins 1947 alam et al 2014 1 log cmc m log c t n where m and n are the constants for a specific ionic head group and ct denotes the total counterion concentration contributed by the surfactant and by the salt lee and lee 2016 the decrease in the cmc values of ionic surfactants such as sds sdbs cpc and rhl is documented the addition of electrolytes to the solution of ionic surfactants increases the concentration of free counter ions around micelles thus reducing the repulsion between the surfactant heads resulting in lowering of cmc value with increase in size and aggregation number of micelles in presence of 58 5 kg m 3 nacl the aggregation number of cpc micelles was found to increase from 104 to 229 varade et al 2005 the surface charge neutralization of the micelle caused by the increase in the counter ion condensation was found to be more effective for smaller size of hydrated counter ion compared to nacl the effect of nabr on cpc micelles was found to be more effective for increasing aggregation number and decreasing cmc value as the chloride ion became more hydrated than the bromide ion varade et al 2005 it was also reported that the size of the biosurfactant aggregates decreased after the addition of sodium salt nacl nabr this was explained by the fact in the presence of sodium salt sodium ions soft acid in the solution could easily bind with the anionic surfactant resulting in the induction of the solvated groups the number of solvated groups increased with increase of salt concentration thereby improving the water solubility of the surfactant pornsunthorntawee et al 2009 the presence of electrolyte showed much smaller effect in case of non ionic surfactant 2 1 3 effect of non ionic surfactants in the presence of non ionic surfactants the cmc value of ionic surfactant decreased as compared to that of a single surfactant solution lee and lee 2016 the presence of non ionic surfactant in the mixed micellar solution caused to decrease in the electrostatic repulsion between the hydrophilic charged head groups in the stern layer of the ionic micelles thus facilitating micelle formation this led to decrease in cmc value in the presence of non ionic surfactants such as brij35 omc 10 and tx 100 the cmc value of sds ionic surfactant was significantly lowered as compared with the single sds system fang et al 2008 tanhaei et al 2014 bielska and szymanowski 2006 huang et al 2014 in presence of 0 1 mol fraction of tx 100 in mixed solution the cmc value of sds decreased from 7 8 mm for pure sds to 2 04 mm because of synergistic of anionic nonionic surfactant in mixed system this was explained assuming that the ethylene oxide chains of the tx 100 in the mixed micelle coiled around the charged head groups of the sds surfactant screening the electrostatic repulsions thus favoring micelle formation and resulting in low cmc value compared to individual surfactants fang et al 2008 the estimated cmc value was used to calculate the interaction coefficient which gave the information about interaction between different building units in the mixed micellar solution compared to the single surfactant solution clint 1975 rubingh and mittal 1979 the negative interaction coefficient value implied the synergistic attractive interactions behavior of mixed micelle and real mixed micelles were more stable thermodynamically compared to ideal mixed micelles the positive interaction coefficient value showed the antagonism repulsive interactions and the interaction coefficient value equal to zero indicated the ideal mixed micelle formation 2 1 4 effect of temperature temperature showed a significant effect on the cmc of surfactant the variation of cmc of ionic surfactant with temperature could be linear or non linear in nature different surfactants behaved differently for sdbs and cpc surfactants a linear increase in cmc value was observed with the rise in temperature varade et al 2005 chauhan and sharma 2014 surfactants such as dtab ads and otac ctpabr and ctpacl displayed a u shaped behavior in a cmc temperature plot with increase in temperature the cmc value decreased to a certain minimum point and then rose with temperature kang et al 2001 michele et al 2011 the effect of temperature on cmc was explained in terms of hydrophobic hydration and hydrophilic hydration both types of hydrations were possible in monomeric form of surfactant whereas only hydrophilic hydration was possible for surfactant monomers in micellar state the hydrophilic hydration was caused by the interaction of hydrogen and oxygen atoms with the ionic group and takes place around the head group of the micelle the hydrophobic hydration occurred because water molecules were strongly associated around the hydrophobe with the rise in temperature both hydrophobic hydration and hydrophilic hydration decreased sadeghi and shahabi 2011 the decrease of hydrophobic hydration facilitated micellization while the decrease of hydrophilic hydration disfavoured micellization the increase or decrease of cmc value for a particular temperature range depended on the relative magnitude of these two types of hydrations on increasing temperature the partial dehydration of hydrophilic heads caused an increase in electrostatic repulsion between the hydrophilic heads of surfactant monomers as well as between the hydrophilic heads present at the surface of surfactant micelle at low temperature range with increase of temperature the decrease of hydrophobic hydration was predominant over the decrease of hydrophilic hydration resulting in decrease of cmc value at higher temperature dehydration of hydrophilic heads was predominant over the dehydration of hydrophobic chains resulting an increase of cmc value furthermore increasing temperature enhanced the thermal motions of surfactant and solvent molecules to make the formation of ordered micelle structures difficult also at higher temperature the ordered micellar structure could be destroyed due to increased kinetic energy resulting in decrease in micelle aggregation number and increase in cmc value 2 2 thermodynamics of micellization for understanding the micellization process knowledge of thermodynamic parameters such as molar standard gibbs free energy δ g mic 0 enthalpy δ h mic 0 entropy δ s mic 0 of micellization is important for their desirable applications these parameters are calculated according to mass action and pseudo phase model the molar standard gibbs free energy of micellization expressed per mol of monomer unit represents the free energy change resulting from the transfer of 1 mol of surfactant from the aqueous phase to the micellar pseudo phase at a given temperature and pressure actually δ g mic 0 is the difference between the standard chemical potential of a surfactant monomer in solution and that of a surfactant in a micelle according to pseudo phase model δ g mic 0 for the ionic surfactants of the type xy electrolyte 1 1 can be calculated using following expressions 2 δ g mic 0 2 α r t ln x cmc where the α r t and xcmc are the degree of counterion association binding of the micelle universal gas constant temperature and cmc in mole fraction unit respectively α a n is the ratio of the number of counterions a bound to the micelle to the number of surfactant ions n forming a micelle now α 1 β where β is degree of ionization dissociation that can be estimated by taking the ratio of post micellar and pre micellar slope obtained from the plot of specific conductance verses surfactant concentration manko et al 2014 rodr ıguez et al 2002 in case of cmc value expressed in molality unit it should be divided by 55 5 the molar enthalpy of micellization δ h mic 0 is defined as the enthalpy change for transferring 1 mol of surfactant from the aqueous phase to the micellar pseudo phase can be obtained from the gibbs helmholtz relationship 3 δ h mic 0 d dt δ g mic 0 t d dt 1 t p 4 δ h mic 0 2 α r t 2 d ln x cmc dt p for estimation of δ h mic 0 it is necessary to know the temperature dependence of xcmc the slope of the linear plot of ln xcmc vs t gives the value of d ln x cmc dt knowing the value of δ h mic 0 and δ g mic 0 the molar standard entropy of micellization δ s mic 0 can be obtained from gibbs helmholtz equation as 5 δ s mic 0 δ h mic 0 δ g mic 0 t the gibbs free energy is the sum of the enthalpic δ h mic 0 and entropic tδ s mic 0 contributions both the terms δ h mic 0 and δ s mic 0 are quite sensitive to temperature with increase in temperature the contribution of enthalpy to the free energy increases while the contribution of entropy decreases for ionic surfactants the values of δ g mic 0 are reported to be in the range of 23 to 42 kj mol 1 at 25 c during the process of micellization a negative entropy change is expected because of formation of ordered structure from monomeric molecules before micellization surfactant monomers are free to move in aqueous solution while their mobility is restricted after micellization the positive values of δ s mic 0 indicate an entropically favored micellization one can observe that the δ h mic 0 is zero at the minimum value of cmc on the lower temperature side δ h mic 0 is positive and endothermic however δ h mic 0 is negative and exothermic on the higher temperature side the negative values of δ h mic 0 and δ g mic 0 indicate that the process of micellization is exothermic and spontaneous in nature and also enthalpy driven for most of the ionic surfactants it has been observed that at low temperatures micellization process is entropy controlled while and at high temperature it is enthalpy controlled at low temperatures the destruction of organized water molecules around a hydrophobic chain causes to an increase in randomness in the micellar core with increase in value of δ s mic 0 however with increase in temperature the structure and size of water molecule aggregates decreases due to melting and thus energy required to break up the three dimensional water cluster is less making the δ h mic 0 value negative or exothermic with more significant of its contribution to the free energy 3 micellar enhance ultrafiltration 3 1 selection of surfactant the selection of surfactant is very crucial for any meuf process depending on the nature of the pollutants to be removed kandori and schechter 1990 various surfactants have been used for meuf process table 4 this includes anionic surfactants sds cationic surfactants cpc ctab non ionic surfactants tx 100 np12 and ionic non ionic mixed surfactants tx 100 sds np12 sds purkait et al 2004a ahmad et al 2006 bielska nad szymanowski 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 zaghbani et al 2009a yenphan et al 2010 huang et al 2014 generally anionic surfactant is selected for cationic solute and vice verse for instance methylene blue being cationic character can be easily solubilized within the anionic sds micelles due to electrostatic interactions bielska nad szymanowski 2006 in addition some important attributes of surfactant make it suitable and effective for meuf operation i low cmc value ii high affinity towards target metal ions iii larger aggregate size iv biodegradability low toxicity and renewable production sources v low cost vi desired thermal and physico chemical stabilities vii fast solubilization rate between surfactant aggregates and dyes heavy metal ions viii good water solubility and ix possibility of regeneration schwarze 2017 so far most of the meuf studies have been successfully carried out using synthetic surfactant for separation dissolved solutes ions dyes organic molecules from aqueous solution to achieve desired separation large amount of synthetic surfactant is required because of its high cmc value and also the excessive loss of surfactant with the permeate causes to a long term risk of secondary pollution therefore further treatment of permeate stream is necessary for recovery or removal of residual surfactants giving additional cost of the process furthermore high surfactant concentration in feed results in severe concentration polarization and membrane fouling this leads to low permeation rate and thus large membrane area is required to treat a given volume of wastewater in a fixed operating time thereby increasing processing cost to overcome this issue the surfactants having low cmc value such as carboxylate surfactant and biosurfactant have been used in meuf process for separation of toxic heavy metal ions and organic compounds el zeftawy and mulligan 2011 schwarze et al 2018 verma and sarkar 2019 biosurfactants are the natural surfactants available in plants and animals which are produced by microorganisms including bacteria yeast and fungi biosurfactants are classified into five categories based on their chemical structure surfactant properties and microbial origin that include glycolipids phospholipids lipopeptides fatty acids and polymeric biosurfactants henkel et al 2012 li et al 2015 among biosurfactants rhamnolipid rhl shows much more promising in the application of meuf of wastewaters compared to the synthetic surfactants sds etc because of their higher biodegradability and lower toxicity low cmc value excellent interfacial activity effectiveness under extreme conditions of temperature ph and salinity and ability to be produced from renewable and cheaper feedstocks etc thus making the process cost effective and environmentally friendly el zeftawy and mulligan 2011 abbasi garravand and mulligan 2014 rhamnolipids anionic biosurfactants with glycolipid structure are mostly synthesized by pseudomonas aeruginosa strains gram negative bacteria from various carbon sources glucose glycerol hydrocarbons plant oil and ethanol etc as well as nitrogen sources nitrate ammonium urea etc müller et al 2012 rhamnolipids are amphiphilic compounds comprising of hydrophilic head formed by one or two rhamnose molecules and a hydrophobic tail composed of one or two molecules of fatty acid chains β hydroxyalkanoic acid units the two major types of rhamnolipids are mono rhamnolipid l rhamnosyl 3 hydroxydecanoyl 3 hydroxydecanoate and di rhamnolipid l rhamnosyl l rhamnosyl 3 hydroxydecanoyl 3 hydroxydecanoate henkel et al 2012 müller et al 2012 rhamnolipids can reduce the surface tension of pure water from 72 to below 30 mn m with a cmc value in the range of 5 200 mg l due to presence of carboxylic acid moiety rhamnolipid shows weak acidity and anionic character at concentrations above the cmc value rhamnolipid tends to form aggregates micelles vesicles or lamella in aqueous solution depending on the solution ph the concentration and the presence of electrolytes pornsunthorntawee et al 2009 nitschke and costacontiero 2011 rhamnolipids aggregates can effectively bind the heavy metal ions solubilize organic molecules the enhanced solubilization binding capacity of rhamnolipids aggregates for organic compounds and heavy metal ions make it suitable in the remediation of wastewaters soils contaminated by heavy metal ions and hydrophobic toxic organic compounds wang and mulligan 2009 li et al 2015 the rhl surfactants having large aggregate size allow to use high mwco membrane in meuf for high throughput with desired separation verma and sarkar 2019 apart from using biosurfactant the introduction of non ionic surfactant to ionic surfactant reduces the cmc value of mixed micelles which therefore reduces the required surfactant in feed and leakage of surfactant in the permeate stream one good example was reported by huang et al 2014 where small amounts of non ionic tx 100 surfactants was mixed with an anionic sds surfactant in their study the best rejections for mb and cd ii were achieved as 99 40 and 98 06 respectively at the tx 100 to sds molar ratio of 0 3 for mb and 0 5 for cd ii 3 2 membrane module and mode of operation both operational modes namely cross flow and dead end filtration have been investigated in meuf studies fig 4 in dead end filtration feed flows perpendicular towards the membrane surface while in cross flow meuf feed flows tangentially over the membrane surface in case of dead end filtration the rate of flux decline is more in the gradual stage compared to that in case of cross flow filtration because in the later high cross flow reduces membrane fouling and controls the build up of the cake gel type layer formed over the membrane surface meuf has been carried out in both flat sheet as well as hollow fibre membrane configuration ahmad et al 2006 ke et al 2007 zaghbani et al 2009a huang et al 2010 however most of the meuf studies were performed with flat sheet membrane the flat sheet membranes are excellent for laboratory testing because of defined fluid flow path and module can accept variety of membrane of different mwco with high pressure rating the membrane can be cleaned physically for heavy fouling if required on site replacement of flat sheet membrane is relatively easy on the other hand the hollow fiber membrane having the highest surface area to volume ratio offers higher permeate flux and can be operated in both continuous and cross flow mode the backflushing capability of hollow fibre membrane improves its cleanability the combination of low pressure drops and high flow rates makes hollow fibres more economical in terms of energy consumption although few meuf experiments were carried with using hollow fiber membrane it offers several disadvantages such as hollow fibres have low pressure ratings with maximum transmembrane pressure less than 0 15 mpa which limits the cross flow rate of the feed the small diameter makes the fiber susceptible to plugging at the cartridge inlet the entire cartridge needs to be replaced if a single fiber in the bundle bursts thus making membrane replacement cost high cheryan 2016 howell et al 1993 3 3 estimation of various parameters for evaluation of meuf process the efficiency of meuf process in removing the dye from the aqueous solution is evaluated by several important parameters including permeate flux vw rejection coefficient r fouling resistances rf distribution coefficient d equilibrium binding constant kb micelle phase aqueous phase partition coefficient kp activity coefficient γ and micelle loading capacity lm etc are determined ultrafiltration of micellar solution enables to determine these parameters the permeate flux can be calculated using the following equation cheryan 2016 6 v w 1 a δv δt the membrane permeability lp

the pure water flux data using eq 7 7 v w 0 l p δ p δp μ p r m the pure water membrane permeability coefficient is obtained from the slope of the straight line v w 0 versus δp the value of the intrinsic membrane resistance rm is then calculated from the value of lp according to eq 7 the permeate flux under constant pressure meuf process can be used to evaluate various membrane fouling according to resistance in series model huang et al 2010 using eq 8 8 v w δp μ p r m r f where rf is the additional fouling resistance comprising of reversible fouling resistance and irreversible fouling resistance the problem of membrane fouling is particularly significant in meuf of dye containing wastewater in this model it is assumed that the membrane is fouled due to dye adsorption followed by cake gel type layer deposition of surfactant aggregates in most of the meuf process solutes such as surfactant monomer and or unsolubilized dye freely pass through the membrane with the permeate while dye micelle complexes are retained by the membrane the observed rejection r o s of solute surfactant dye and the observed rejection of surfactant micelles r 0 m can be defined as sabate et al 1999 9 r o s 1 c p s c r s 10 r 0 m 1 c p m c r m retentate stream consists of a micellar phase and an aqueous phase three solutes exist in retentate such as surfactant monomers surfactant micelles carrying dye molecules and unsolubilised dye molecules r o m depends on the operating conditions and its value less than unity indicates the presence of micelles in the permeate stream another important parameter is the intrinsic micelle rejection r i m which is defined as 11 r i m 1 c p m c m m r i m does not depend on the operating conditions but depends only on the membrane and solutes characteristics both observed micelle rejection and intrinsic rejection are corelated by eq 12 sabate et al 1999 12 r o m 1 1 r i m c m m c r m it has been observed that at higher operating pressure some micelle dye aggregates passed through the membrane i e membrane leaks some micelles thus in case of meuf process with partial rejection of surfactant dye aggregates the concentration of solute surfactant dye in the permeate can be obtained by eq 13 sabate et al 1999 13 c p s c p a s c p m s c p a s 1 r o m c r s c p a s it is to be noted that aqueous phase contains surfactant in its monomeric form and dyes in its unsolubilsed form which freely pass through the membrane distribution coefficient d is the ratio of concentration of solubilizate in the retentate and permeate bielska and prochaska 2007 khosa et al 2011 and is defined as 14 d c r s c p s higher value of d implies better micelle solubilization capacity during meuf the retention of mb dye was well correlated with that of distribution coefficient for three surfactants such as sds ctab and tx 100 bielska nad szymanowski 2006 a similar relationship was obtained for other dyes such as mordant black 11 and mordant black 17 regardless of the type of membrane and the surfactant bielska and prochaska 2007 it was suggested that to achieve high efficiency of separation the distribution coefficient should be more than 15 bielska and szymanowski 2006 the values of d were reported to be 49 183 190 210 and 147 6 for sds mb sds cv rhl cv ctab mb 11 and ctab mb 17 respectively bielska and szymanowski 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 verma et al 2020 the extent of solubilization expressed by molar solubilization ratio msr is defined as moles of solubilized pollutant per mole of micellized surfactant hanna et al 2005 15 msr s s s w c r sur cmc where ss is the solubility of the solubilizate in surfactant solution and sw is the solubility of the solubilizate in pure water msr shows the effectiveness of a given surfactant in solubilizing a particular pollutant the molar solubilization power of sap surfactant for mb and ey dyes were reported as 8 02 and 6 76 respectively samal et al 2017a the micellar solubilization of a solubilizate can be characterized by i equilibrium micelle binding constant or equilibrium solubilization constant of solute k b x m c p and ii micelle phase aqueous phase partition coefficient of solute k p x m x w in an aqueous vesicular or micellar solution cp is the molar concentration of monomeric solute xm and xw are the mole fraction of the solute in the micellar pseudo phase and aqueous pseudo phase respectively at their solubility limit neglecting i the solute concentration compared to that of surfactant in micellar phase and ii the amount of solute present in aqueous phase compared to the total amount of water they are expressed by eq 16 and eq 17 respectively kondo et al 1993 bielska and prochaska 2007 hanna et al 2005 mohamed and mahfoodh 2006 16 x m s s s w s s s w c r sur cmc s s s w c r sur cmc 17 x w s w s w c w s w c w thus kp can be expressed as 18 k p x m x w s s s w c r sur cmc s w c w k b c w where cw is number of moles of water per liter

micelle binding constant indicates the relative affinity of dyes pollutants for surfactant micelles high kp value of sds surfactant i e log kp 3 62 indicates the strong attractive electrostatic and weak hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between mb dye and sds micelles khosa et al 2011 however strong electrostatic repulsion and weak hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between similar charged mb dye and ctab surfactant is accountable for low micellar binding constant i e log kp 1 05 khosa et al 2011 the values of log kp were reported as 2 7 2 72 5 58 4 45 4 29 and 1 05 for sds mb sds cv rhl cv ctab mb11 ctab mb17 and ctab mb respectively bielska and szymanowski 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 verma et al 2020 from the knowledge of binding constant the values of activity coefficient of solute γs and activity coefficient of surfactant γsur can be estimated using eqs 22 and 23 kondo et al 1993 22 γ s 1 k b c p 0 s 23 γ sur 2 1 b b ln 1 x m ln 1 bx m for detailed estimation of activity

a s c r s 1 k b c r sur cmc it is worthy to mention here that the kb values estimated from batch meuf experiments can be used to predict pollutant permeate concentrations in a continuous meuf process sabate et al 1999 and the solutes having strong tendency to bind within surfactant micelles are characterized by large values of binding constant and smaller values of activity coefficient another important parameter is the loading of the surfactant micelles vesicles lm which stands for the unit binding capacity of micelles vesicles is defined as khosa et al 2011 25 l m c m s c m sur c r s c p s c r sur cmc micelle loading varies widely depending on the type and concentration of surfactant and dye used table 5 the addition of non ionic surfactant to the solution of ionic surfactant shows a significant effect on distribution coefficient loading capacity and binding constant during meuf two opposite factors attribute to this phenomenon mixed surfactant system possesses more micelles because of lowering cmc value thus increasing solubilization of dyes on the other hand mixed surfactant system also possesses lower micelle charge density compared to same mole amount of pure ionic surfactant thus reducing the affinity of dye molecules for the micelles therefore the increasing amount of micelle and the decreasing micelle charge density as the results of the addition non ionic surfactant to the ionic surfactant jointly contributed to the final values of distribution coefficient micelle loading and binding constant the addition of non ionic surfactant omc 10 to ionic surfactants sds ctab caused to increase in micelle loading and binding constant and decrease in distribution coefficient for mb mb11 and mb17 dyes bielska and prochaska 2007 however in another meuf studies for removal of mb the addition of non ionic surfactant tx 100 caused to decrease in loading capacity and binding constant and increase in distribution coefficient huang et al 2014 for removal of pb ii the addition of non ionic surfactant with 0 1 mol fraction to 8 2 mm sds distribution coefficient increased from 7 83 to 40 22 and from 7 83 to 49 73 for sds tx 100 and sds np12 systems respectively also the binding constant increased from 1 57 to 4 08 mm 1 and 1 57 to 6 28 mm 1 for sds tx 100 and sds np12 systems respectively yenphan et al 2010 the loading capacity and binding constant of rhl vesicles were found more than the sds micelles under identical feed conditions and removal efficiencies compared to sds micelles the loading capacity and binding constant of rhl vesicles were found six fold and four fold larger respectively under the similar conditions of feed and cd ii cv removal efficiency verma and sarkar 2019 literature values of r log kp lm and d for different dyes used in meuf are shown in table 5 3 4 membrane selection selection of suitable membrane is the key to successful separation by meuf various polymeric ultrafiltration uf membranes with varying in mwco of 1 100 kda made of ca rc pes ps pvdf pa and activated carbon loaded pes etc were used in meuf study for the treatment of dye effluent most of the meuf studies were carried out using 10 kda membrane huang et al 2010 2014 ahmad et al 2006 zaghbani et al 2009b however few meuf studies were conducted using lower cut off uf membrane purkait et al 2004a 2004b majewska nowak et al 2006 and higher cut off uf membrane schwarze et al 2018 verma and sarkar 2019 bielska and szymanowski 2006 samal et al 2017a 2017b meuf with the smaller surfactant aggregates required a lower mwco of the membrane to achieve a high pollutant removal efficiency however lower mwco membrane resulted in low permeate flux and accordingly the less efficient for practical applications the cost the membrane could be reduced if high flux could be achieved with desired removal efficiency thus for larger size of surfactant aggregate one could take the advantages of using higher mwco membrane in meuf process for selection of appropriate membrane technical performance of the membrane was investigated in terms of permeation rate and solute removal efficiency in several meuf studies verma and sarkar 2019 carried out meuf experiments with different flat sheet polymeric uf membranes 5 30 kda for the treatment of wastewater containing both cv and cd ii fig 5 they observed that the 30 kda membrane showed the highest permeation rate but gave the lowest rejections of both cv 96 and cd ii 95 while 5 kda and 10 kda membranes showed maximum rejection 99 for both the pollutants but with low permeate flux based on the experimental data they preferred 20 kda membrane as the most suitable membrane for further studies in another meuf studies with carboxylate surfactants and four different cellulose membranes 5 10 30 and 100 kda for removal of mb authors reported that considering both the mb removal 95 and the flux the 30 kda membrane was the most suitable schwarze et al 2018 in another meuf studies with saponin surfactants and different flat sheet pes membranes 10 50 kda for removal of methyl violet 10 kda membrane was found to be most appropriate on the basis of solvent permeation rate and maximum retention of mv 99 and sap 70 8 samal et al 2017b 3 5 optimization of meuf feed conditions feed condition shows a significant effect on the process performance of meuf and hence the optimization of feed composition is essential in order to improve the pollutant removal efficiency after obtaining the optimal feed condition further meuf experiments are usually conducted with the optimal feed under various hydrodynamic parameters to observe their effects on permeation rate and removal efficiency and thus to obtain the most suitable operating conditions of meuf process there have been few attempts to model and optimize the feed conditions using response surface methodology rsm particularly in the application of meuf xiarchos et al 2008 landaburu aguirrea et al 2010 landaburu aguirre et al 2011 verma and sarkar 2019 the rsm enables the evaluation of the effects of different process variables and their interactions on desirable dependent variables responses the statistical significance of the proposed model is determined by anova based on fisher test and the coefficients of each model are statistically analysed with p values several statistical parameters of the proposed model such as regression coefficients the determination coefficient and the coefficient of variance are evaluated the desirability function approach is generally employed in the optimization process and eigenvalue analysis evaluates the nature of optimal condition in the meuf studies verma and sarkar 2019 applied rsm with full factorial central composite design for experimental design with four independent variables and three responses to obtain the optimal meuf feed conditions ph feed concentrations of surfactant cv and cd ii in order to ensure a maximum value of solvent flux and rejection coefficient of both the pollutants simultaneously the authors reported that the optimal meuf feed conditions were successfully validated experimentally and predicted the values of solvent flux and rejection of both pollutants using the developed second order polynomial models with high overall desirability function of 0 94 verma and sarkar 2019 in another meuf studies for removing cu ii from aqueous stream the maximum removal efficiency of 98 4 was achieved at the optimal feed conditions of ph 7 36 sds cu ii molar ratio 7 85 sds concentration 6 82 kg m 3 xiarchos et al 2008 rsm with face centred composite design was successfully applied to understand the effect of concentration polarization phenomenon as well as the effects of the process parameters on solvent flux and removal efficiency of zn ii and cd ii during meuf the maximum retentions achieved were 98 0 0 4 for zn ii and 99 0 0 4 for cd ii under the optimal surfactant to metal molar ratio of 27 8 and 28 4 for removal of zn ii of 0 5 mm and cd ii of 0 5 mm respectively landaburu aguirrea et al 2010 3 6 effects of various parameters on solvent flux and rejection 3 6 1 effect of mixed surfactant the use of mixed surfactants of ionic and nonionic surfactants was investigated in meuf with the aim of improving process performance by lowering the cmc value reducing the surfactant leakage with the permeate stream and to get maximum economic and environmental benefits bielska nad szymanowski 2006 studied the application of non ionic surfactant omc 10 in micellar media of an anionic sds surfactant for the removal of mb from aqueous solution the addition of omc 10 surfactant to sds solution led to a 4 fold decrease in cmc value of mixed micelles from 2 3 to 0 57 kg m 3 for the surfactant mixture of omc 10 sds 1 4 the authors revealed that the tailored surfactant mixture was able to remove 93 94 of mb using a hydrophilic cellulose membrane 15 30 kda with initial feed dye concentration of 0 0005 0 005 kg m 3 and total surfactant concentration equal to 5 cmc similar result was also reported by huang et al 2014 where binary mixture of sds and non ionic tx 100 surfactant was used in meuf for concurrent removal of mb and cd ii from aqueous stream with the fixed feed concentration of mb cd ii and sds and varying the surfactant molar ratios of tx 100 to sds from 0 1 to 0 8 meuf experiments were performed in a hollow fiber module using 10 kda polysulfone membrane it was reported that 99 40 and 98 06 removal efficiency can be achieved for mb and cd ii respectively with the best molar ratio tx 100 to sds of 0 3 for mb and 0 5 for cd ii in another study the use of mixed surfactants of anionic sds and nonionic tx 100 and np12 surfactants effectively enhanced the rejection of pb ii ions and surfactants yenphan et al 2010 the rejection of pb ii ions when using anionic sds surfactant was found quite high about 92 compared to non ionic surfactants such as tx 100 about 9 18 and np12 about 30 37 at the optimal mole fraction 1 37 mm of tx 100 and np12 with 12 3 mm of sds the rejections of pb ii were obtained as 98 4 and 98 7 respectively with high rejections of sds 80 tx 100 and np12 99 permeate flux values of sds np12 system were slightly higher than those of sds tx 100 system in another study the cmc of sds npe was found to decrease from 8 mm pure sds to less than 1 mm upon addition of npe the rejection of cr iii was 98 5 for the pure sds micelles however in mixed micelle sds npe systems rejection of cr iii remained high and practically constant at 99 5 with the npe mole fraction of 0 2 aoudia et al 2003 3 6 2 effect of surfactant concentration the surfactant concentration in feed showed significant influence on permeation rate and solute removal efficiency meuf experiments were usually conducted with feed surfactant concentration at cmc below cmc and above cmc value according to zaghbani et al 2007 during cross flow meuf of mb from aqueous solution using 10 kda regenerated cellulose membrane the retention of mb was found to be 97 at sds concentrations below its cmc value at which theoretically no micelles were present the unanticipated high retention of mb was explained by i the adsorption of mb molecules onto membrane surface and in the membrane pores ii the adsorption of precipitates mb sds onto the membrane surface resulting from reaction between cationic mb and anionic sds surfactant iii the build up of surfactant molecules near the membrane surface caused to exceed the cmc value of surfactant thus forming surfactant aggregates in that region which would probably solubilize some mb molecules yenphan et al 2010 due to convective transport the mb sds precipitates and micelles accumulated near the membrane surface and tended to form a layer which offered an additional resistance to solvent flow leading to decrease in solvent permeation rate as reported by authors that the retention of mb increased to 97 8 with decrease in solvent permeation from 200 to 160 l m 2 h 1 when feed sds concentration increased to 5 2 kg m 3 zaghbani et al 2007 the flux reduction was explained by the reason that by adding surfactants above the cmc value the surfactant micelles formed a deposited layer onto the membrane surface and consequently increased the resistance towards transport similar result was also reported by huang et al 2010 they observed that about 99 mb removal efficiency was achieved when the feed sds concentration was less than its cmc value of 2 3 kg m 3 however mb removal efficiency decreased from 99 34 to 95 19 on increasing feed sds concentration from 2 3 to 20 8 kg m 3 the significant drop in the mb removal efficiency was attributed to i the leakage of some mb solubilized sds aggregates through the membrane because of the wide pore size distribution of ultrafiltration membrane ii change in micellar shape at high surfactant concentration that allowed some of the micelles to easily pass through the membrane pores in another meuf studies ahmad et al 2006 investigated the application of cationic cpc surfactant for removal of reactive dyes rb5 and ro16 from an aqueous solution using 10 kda polymeric membrane and reported that 99 7 and 99 6 of dye rejections for rb5 and ro16 dye respectively could be achieved using cpc surfactant the flux values were observed as a decreasing function of the surfactant concentration the solvent flux decreased from 23 8 to 23 2 l m 2 h 1 and 26 6 to 23 4 l m 2 h 1 for rb5 and for ro16 respectively with the rise in cpc concentration from 0 5 to 1 0 kg m 3 ahmad et al 2006 in another meuf study the effect of molar concentration ratio of surfactant to metal s m on cu ii rejection was observed removal of cu ii could be achieved more than 90 at s m ratio of 12 7 and ph 5 with 20 mm sds juang et al 2010 3 6 3 effect of electrolyte in most of the dye industries inorganic salts are commonly used with varying concentration thus in reality dye wastewater always contains ionic salt in various amounts zaghbani et al 2008 therefore the effect of ionic salt nacl na2so4 na2hpo4 etc concentration on extent of solubilization as well as removal of dye has been investigated with increase in electrolyte more micelles are formed with increase in aggregation number and micelle volume resulting from decrease in the cmc value this is known as salt effect the presence of electrolyte in the ionic surfactant solutions decreases the extent of solubilization of polar solutes but increases that of non polar solutes polar solutes are generally solubilized in the outer periphery of the palisade layer while non polar solutes are solubilized in the inner core of the micelle zaghbani et al 2008 the h bonding or dipole dipole attraction is the possible interaction between the polar groups of solubilizate and surfactant huang et al 2010 on increasing the nacl concentrations from 0 6 to 29 2 kg m 3 a slight decrease in retention of st cationic dye was observed during meuf with sds surfactant this was explained by the low solubilization of st within the micelle zaghbani et al 2008 also a slight increase in solubilization and then retention of mb upon increasing the nacl concentrations from 0 to 5 8 kg m 3 was reported in another meuf studies zaghbani et al 2009a similar trend was also observed in case of db71 with increasing nacl concentration from 0 to 29 2 kg m 3 zaghbani et al 2009b huang et al 2014 reported that the rejection of mb remained almost independent on the increase of nacl concentration similar trend was also reported by zaghbani et al 2009a during removal of ebbr from wastewater using meuf they suggested that the solubilization of ebbr might occur in the region between the core and the surface of n alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromide micelles the effect of addition of electrolyte on the solvent permeation was also reported in most of the meuf studies for dye removal solvent permeation rate was found to decrease with increase in electrolyte concentration the flux decline was attributed to the formation and deposition of large fraction of surfactant aggregates at higher electrolyte concentration and increasing subsequent membrane fouling this caused to an increase in resistance to solvent flow resulting a decline in solvent permeation rate ahmad et al 2006 zaghbani et al 2009a 2009b 3 6 4 effect of ph the solution ph showed an important role in the process performance the variation of solution ph did not show any noticeable change in the retention of mb during meuf conducted at fixed sds and mb dye concentration of 32 10 3 kg m 3 and 14 4 kg m 3 respectively for a ph range of 2 11 the retention of mb remained almost constant close to 99 for the whole range of operating ph zaghbani et al 2007 similar observation was reported by zaghbani et al 2009a for the cpc ebbr system for a ph range of 2 13 the retention of ebbr remained almost constant near 99 for meuf study conducted at fixed cpc and ebbr dye concentrations of 416 10 3 kg m 3 and 0 73 kg m 3 respectively in case of separation db71 by c16tab the dye retention was near 98 with enhancement in solvent permeation rate from 50 to 110 l m 2 h 1 with rise of ph 1 8 to 12 4 zaghbani et al 2009b the flux enhancement with increase in ph was explained by the more hydrophilic nature of rc membrane resulting from deprotonation of carboxylic group present in its active layer zaghbani et al 2009a however other researchers reported the different trend in the meuf of cv from aqueous solution variation of solution ph showed substantial effect on the retention of cv as well as permeate flux verma et al 2020 the authors observed that with increasing ph from 6 5 to 10 5 the rejection efficiency of cv increased linearly reached a maximum a value of about 99 at ph 8 5 and then slightly dropped to 98 at ph 10 5 at low ph values the linear increase of cv rejection was attributed to increase in surface charge and cmc value of rhl thus favouring the cv adsorption at higher ph values 8 5 the decrease in cv rejection was attributed to decrease in average size of rhl vesicle resulting in decrease in vesicle solubilization capability similar effect of ph was observed on cd ii rejection efficiency ke et al 2007 reported that during meuf with sds as surfactant the cd ii rejection efficiency increased sharply with the increase of ph 9 after that up to ph 13 no significant change was observed another study demonstrated the effect of ph on the solubilization of cationic mb and anionic ey dyes into the saponin micelles samal et al 2017a authors observed a slight decrease in solubilization of ey dye with increasing ph they explained the observation by the hypothesis that at the lower ph the surface of saponin micelles might have protonated which increased the adsorption of anionic ey dye resulting in higher solubilization of ey dye the acidic nature of saponin caused to decrease in dye solubilization with the rise in solution ph the solubilization of mb was found to increase with ph up to ph 7 then started decreasing at lower ph there was a strong competition between h ions and positively charged mb dye molecules to get adsorbed at the micelle surface at higher ph the decrease in concentration of h ions in solution possibly increased the adsorption of mb on saponin micelles 3 6 5 effect of transmembrane pressure another important operating aspect that significantly influenced the solvent flux and solute removal efficiency is the transmembrane pressure it was generally observed in meuf studies that with rise in operating pressure the permeation of both solute and solvent through the membrane increased in the region of low operating pressure pressure controlled region a linear flux pressure relationship was observed with increase in pressure because of less effect of solute concentration boundary layer and membrane fouling the enhanced driving force due to increase in pressure overcame the developed osmotic pressure and the fouling resistance thus permeating more solvent through the membrane resulting in higher solvent flux at higher pressure flux enhancement became gradual and flux reached an asymptotic value ke et al 2007 the asymptotic flux pressure relationship was due to severe concentration polarization caused by convective transport of more micelles towards the membrane surface followed by viscous and gel type layer formation in this region mass transfer controlled flux was controlled by the rate of solute transfer from the gel layer solution interface into the bulk liquid moreover at high pressure the fouling layer got compacted and becomes less permeable the decreasing dye rejection was thought to occur due to the following two reasons micelles got compacted at higher operating pressure thereby decreasing solubilization capacity of micelle increase in permeation of unsolubilized dye through the ultrafiltration membrane led to higher permeate dye concentration thus lowering the dye rejection evidence for this explanation was demonstrated elsewhere huang et al 2010 ke et al 2007 the research reported that with increase in δp from 10 to 90 kpa solvent flux improved by 2 3 fold and the rejection of mb and sds decreased from 99 62 to 98 96 and 62 5 to 57 84 respectively during meuf of mb from aqueous solution using a hollow fiber ps membrane carried out at fixed mb and sds concentrations of 6 10 3 kg m 3 and 2 3 kg m 3 respectively huang et al 2010 similar finding has been reported in another meuf study where reactive dyes rb5 and ro16 were removed by meuf using cationic cpc surfactant and 10 kda membrane ahmad et al 2006 the experimental results showed that an increase in δp from 300 to 400 kpa resulted to drop in dye rejection efficiency from 97 to 91 1 and 98 8 to 97 4 for rb5 and ro16 dye respectively with about 23 improvement in solvent flux during meuf of mv from aqueous stream using sap biosurfactant with increase in δp from 150 to 350 kpa about 19 of improvement of solvent flux was observed samal et al 2017b however in their study retention of both mv and sap remained almost invariant with applied pressure suggesting that the retention of dye in the separation process was governed by the solubilization mechanism further for removal of cd ii using meuf with sds surfactant ke et al 2007 reported that permeation flux increased linearly with the increase of the transmembrane pressure below 0 08 mpa beyond 0 08 mpa the flux reached an asymptotic value as the transmembrane pressure increased however transmembrane pressure had no significant effect on the cd ii rejection as the ultrafiltration membrane could not reject free ions under the transmembrane pressure studied in another meuf study for removal of cr vi with cpc as surfactant a linear permeate flux pressure relationship was observed for the range of pressure studied from 376 to 716 kpa with 99 8 retention of cr vi ions ghosh and bhattacharya 2006 3 6 6 effect of cross flow velocity effect of feed cross flow velocity on dye rejection and solvent permeation rate was observed in meuf studies samal et al 2017b verma et al 2020 increasing feed cross flow velocity caused to decrease in concentration polarization due to enhanced forced convection this led to an enhancement in mass transfer coefficient and thereby increasing solvent permeation rate the removal of dye remained unchanged by the rise in cross flow velocity the retention mv and sap were observed almost unaffected 99 on increasing feed flow rate 0 5 1 2 lpm suggesting that the extent of micellar solubilization is independent of increasing feed flow rate the solvent flux increased slightly from 3 7 to 4 25 l m 2 h 1 with the same increment of feed flow rate because of reduction in consolidated gel layer resistance samal et al 2017b similar trends were observed in another meuf investigation for removal of cv using rhl biosurfactant verma et al 2020 where the solvent flux augmented from 20 to 26 l m 2 h 1 at end of 40 min filtration however there was no significant change in cv rejection 99 5 in the range of feed velocity from 75 to 150 l h 1 3 6 7 effect of temperature in general increasing temperature led to higher solvent permeation flux in both the mass transfer governed region and in the pressure governed region the enhancement of solvent permeation rate with the rise in temperature in pressure governed region was attributed to its effect on fluid viscosity μ density ρ and solute diffusivity d together all these effects lead to an enhancement in mass transfer coefficient k as k α d 0 67 μ ρ n where n 0 47 for turbulent flow and zero for laminar flow cheryan 2016 thus backward diffusion of micelle dye aggregates increased because of increasing diffusivity moreover at higher temperature the reduction in solution viscosity increased the solute forced convection verma et al 2020 reported that with the rise in temperature from 26 to 40 c solvent flux increased by about 15 at the end of filtration keeping other operating conditions unchanged also cv rejection was not significantly influenced by the feed temperature therefore meuf was best to operate at the maximum possible feed temperature consistent with the permissible limit of the membrane cheryan 2016 3 7 assessment of membrane fouling and transport modelling in meuf the major disadvantage of any meuf process is the membrane fouling indeed membrane fouling results in increased operating costs due to higher energy consumption additional labor for maintenance cleaning chemical costs shorter membrane self life and frequent membrane replacement several techniques have been proposed in literature to reduce membrane fouling during meuf such as i using optimal dosage of surfactant for obtaining desired removal efficiency verma and sarkar 2019 ii increasing turbulence shearing force in the flow channel cheryan 2016 iii applying external electric field across the membrane akay and wakeman 1996 sarkar et al 2009 iv using fouling resistant uf membranes with minimum surfactant pollutant adsorption and v developing efficient cleaning protocol chen et al 2020 etc however membrane fouling cannot be completely prevented according to literature membrane fouling mechanisms can be divided in several types such as i adsorptive fouling ii pore blocking iii formation of cake gel type layer over the membrane surface the most important consequence of membrane fouling is the decline in permeate flux with filtration time fig 6 therefore for any meuf process understanding of membrane fouling identification of appropriate fouling mechanism and development of model for prediction of permeate flux seem to be very important and complex research topic various models have been developed to explain the flux reduction during meuf huang et al 2010 zaghbani et al 2007 purkait et al 2004a parakala et al 2019 verma and sarkar 2020 verma et al 2020 model equations associated with various parameters along with assumptions are shown in table 6 during meuf of mb from dye wastewater using sds surfactant huang et al 2010 applied the classical resistance model eq 29 to estimate the additional fouling resistance at sds concentrations below the cmc value membrane fouling was assumed to be caused by the combination of three reasons a adsorption of mb dye on the surface and or in pores of membrane b reaction between mb and sds to form precipitates on the membrane surface c effect of severe concentration polarization resulted in the deposition of mb sds surfactant aggregates on the membrane surface at sds concentrations above cmc value the deposited layer of sds mb aggregates offered more resistance against solvent flux through the membrane in their study the calculated osmotic pressure was not high enough compared to operating transmembrane pressure to justify the flux decline and hence neglected similarly for removal of mb from aqueous solution by sds based meuf zaghbani et al 2007 used classical resistance in series model eq 30 where total resistance to solvent flow accounted for membrane resistance adsorption fouling resistance concentration polarization resistance and cake layer resistance due to accumulation of dye surfactant aggregates on the membrane surface in another meuf study for removal of mb from aqueous stream parakala et al 2019 used a modified resistance in series model eq 31 to predict permeate flux the authors considered the concentration polarization resistance rp as an additional resistance to solvent flow which included the effects of mean solute concentration within the thin concentration boundary layer and the transmembrane pressure knowing the experimental average permeate flux value feed concentration and operating pressure they estimated and reported three model parameters namely intrinsic membrane resistance rm mass transfer coefficient k and specific resistance coefficient αo for various feed dye concentrations it is worthy to mention here that in most of the meuf studies for the treatment of dye containing wastewater it is observed that there is a rapid drop in permeation rate at the beginning of filtration 3 6 min followed by gradual decline in permeate flux purkait et al 2004a verma and sarkar 2019 verma et al 2020 identification of appropriate fouling mechanism and modelling of permeate flux decline during meuf process is essential and meaningful for the design selection of membrane appropriate operating conditions membrane module configuration etc and scale up purposes usually no individual fouling mechanisms are capable of explaining the flux decline behaviour with time prevailing throughout the filtration being necessary to apply more than one fouling mechanism in this regard combined model was developed and successfully applied to analyse flux decline behaviour during both dead end or cross flow meuf involved in the application of dye wastewater purkait et al 2004a performed an unstirred batch meuf study for the treatment of eosin dye contaminated aqueous solution with aim to explain the flux decline behaviour under various operation conditions based on their investigated experimental flux profiles fig 7 they divided the filtration experiment into two time regions the fouling mechanisms consisted of two consecutive steps were proposed for analysing flux decline during the entire course of operation the transition time t1 of shifting fouling mechanism was obtained from the observation of experimental flux profiles resistance in series model in conjunction with classical filtration theory was used for analysis of flux reduction they developed a two step flux decline model based on resistance series theory considering for simultaneous reversible pore blockage and gel type formation all the developed model equations eqs 28 31 and model parameters were shown in table 5 the effects of pore blocking were included in the fouling resistance rpb of the equation of permeate flux eq 28 by an empirical equation eq 30 in terms of two model parameters b and c the value of permeate flux or the magnitude of the pore blocking resistance after completion of pore blocking was indicated by the model parameter b while the rate of flux decline or the rate of the growth of the magnitude of the pore blocking resistance was indicated by model parameter c both the model parameters were found to be dependent of transmembrane pressure and feed concentration the long term flux decline was expressed by eq 29 in terms of dimensionless gel layer resistance r g as expressed by eq 31 the specific gel layer resistance α was defined as the resistance to flow per unit thickness of gel layer and found to be dependent of transmembrane pressure and feed concentration juang et al 2010 after evaluation of all the model parameter the proposed model successfully predicted both short term and long term flux decline profiles for various operating parameters the results showed that rpb and rg were strong function of transmembrane pressure and feed surfactant concentration both the values of rpb and rg were found more at higher pressure and at surfactant feed concentration this was attributed to the increasing rate of transport of smaller micelles toward the membranes surface by forced convection and block the membrane pores to a great extent also the specific gel resistance showed an increasing function of pressure giving to more resistance to the solvent flow the values of rpb and rg were 10 30 and 30 50 of the total resistance respectively for various transmembrane pressure and feed cpc concentration under investigation in another studies meuf was applied for i removal of cv dye and ii concurrent removal of cv dye and cd ii ions from aqueous stream using pes membrane and rhamnolipid as the biosurfactant verma and sarkar 2019 verma et al 2020 in both the investigations authors observed similar flux decline behaviour figs 8 and 9 the initial flux reduction in the first 3 6 min of filtration due to adsorption pore blocking was about 70 80 of the total flux reduction resistance in series theory in conjunction with hermia s cake filtration model was used to explain flux decline profiles verma and sarkar 2019 verma et al 2020 the hydrophobic interactions between the ionic aggregates and charged polymer led to solute adsorption on the membrane surface the gradual decline in solvent flux was assumed to be due to developing cake gel type layer of the surfactant dye aggregates on the membrane surface based on the nature of flux profiles they divided the duration of meuf filtration experiment into two stages t t 1 and t t 1 all the developed model equations eqs 32 38 associated with model parameters were shown in table 5 hermia s model applied to dead end filtration and cross flow filtration were represented by eq 34 and eq 35 respectively where kc was the cake layer fouling coefficient they also developed the expression of transition time t1 of onset of cake formation for both the filtration mode as represented by eq 37 38 shown in table 5 knowing the value of intrinsic membrane resistance rm from pure water flux v w 0 the three model parameters rfm kf and kc in the model eqs 32 38 were estimated predicted values of permeate flux showed good agreement with the experimental permeate flux to confirm the solute adsorption on the membrane surface balance value bv was generally calculated by eq 39 schwarze et al 2018 and accordingly adsorption fouling was incorporated into the transport modelling high value of bp indicated for stronger adsorption of solute on the membrane surface during operation model parameters and transition time of fouling mechanism for various operating conditions were estimated for dead end filtration verma and sarkar 2020 as well as for cross flow meuf verma et al 2020 their study demonstrated that the value of kf increased with increase of pressure and feed surfactant concentration while it decreased with feed temperature and stirrer speed verma and sarkar 2020 an increase of δp from 276 to 690 kpa and feed rhl concentration from 584 10 3 to 2920 10 3 kg m 3 resulted in an increase of kf value from 1 08 10 2 s 1 to 2 4 10 2 s 1 and 1 2 10 2 to 1 8 10 2 s 1 respectively the value of kf decreased from 1 3 10 2 s to 0 9 10 2 s 1 and 1 75 10 2 to 1 3 10 2 s 1 when temperature and stirrer speed increased from 26 to 40 c and 200 600 rpm respectively the value of kc showed an increasing function of feed surfactant concentration and salt concentration while showed a decreasing function of pressure temperature and stirrer speed verma and sarkar 2020 an increase in operating δp from 276 to 690 kpa temperature from 26 to 40 c and stirrer speed from 200 to 600 rpm resulted to decrease in kc value from 2 105 s m 2 to 1 34 105 s m 2 from 1 6 105 s m 2 to 1 0 105 s m 2 and from 2 6 105 s m 2 to 1 6 105 s m 2 respectively on the other hand increasing feed rhl concentration from 584 10 3 to 2920 10 3 kg m 3 and nacl concentration from 5 to 30 kg m 3 the value of kc increased from 1 4 105 s m 2 to 1 98 105 s m 2 from 1 56 105 s m 2 to 2 1 105 s m 2 respectively the onset of cake formation was found to be operating condition dependent with increase in transmembrane pressure and feed surfactant concentration transition time decreased while on increasing stirrer speed transition time increased the authors also noticed that the initial adsorptive fouling resistance rf contributed 11 5 35 9 of the total resistance while cake layer resistance rc contributed 10 8 21 6 of total resistance for further detailed information see ref verma and sarkar 2020 huang et al 2010 also used the resistance model eq 26 to analyse permeate flux and fouling resistances during meuf studies on mb contaminated aqueous solution using a hollow fibre membrane in their analysis contribution of osmotic pressure was neglected they reported an increase in fouling resistance from 0 48 1012 to 40 1012 m 1 with feed sds concentration increasing from 0 to 23 kg m 3 3 8 simultaneous removal of heavy metal ions and dyes in reality dye wastewaters do not contain a single pollutant instead a mixture of pollutants particularly heavy metal ions and dyes thus the co existence of pollutants in dye effluent worldwide is a frequent occurrence the simultaneous removal of multiple co existing pollutants using meuf process has already become the focus of recent studies only a few studies were reported for concurrent treatment of pollutants from dye wastewater using meuf zeng et al 2011 huang et al 2014 verma and sarkar 2019 2020 simultaneous removal of typically co existing pollutants such as cadmium ion and mb from wastewater was investigated using meuf by single sds surfactant zeng et al 2011 and by a binary mixture of sds and tx 100 huang et al 2014 zeng et al 2011 demonstrated that in the presence of mb the maximum 98 4 removal efficiency of cd ii was achieved with 2 3 kg m 3 1 cmc of sds which was slightly more compared to single cd ii removal efficiency on the other hand in presence of cd ii the removal efficiencies of mb were more than 96 5 which was about 3 4 less than the maximum removal efficiency achieved in the single mb removal process thus experimental results revealed the absence of competition between cd ii and mb for solubilizing and or adsorbing into the sds micelles suggesting that simultaneous removal mb and cd ii was feasible with no interference zeng et al 2011 in another meuf studies it was observed that the coexistence of mb and cd ii would help the rejection of each other huang et al 2014 the presence of cd ii in the solution increased the d value of mb by decreasing the cmc value of surfactants but lm and kb values of mb for sds micelles remained unchanged the presence of mb increased the d value of cd ii with little influence on lm value of sds micelles the best removal efficiency for mb and cd ii was achieved as 99 40 and 98 06 respectively huang et al 2014 in another meuf study using rhl biosurfactant verma and sarkar 2020 reported that for the treatment of binary system of cd ii and cv the maximum rejection efficiencies of the pollutants were found to be 98 4 and 98 7 respectively thus meuf showed promising for simultaneous removal of co existing pollutants from dye wastewater 3 9 recovery of surfactant the retentate stream of meuf contains high concentrated surfactant and pollutants dyes and or heavy metal ions rejected by the membrane will cause secondary pollution thus the recovery and reuse the surfactant from the concentrate retentate stream is very important to make the meuf process cost effective and to reduce the secondary pollution there are several methods are reported in literature such as precipitation by addition of counter ion acidification method alkaline treatment foam fractionation technique decreasing temperature less than kriff point electrochemical treatment solvent extraction and two step chemical treatment etc the surfactant was precipitated using mono multivalent counterions having opposite charge of the surfactant the addition of cacl2 in greater than its stoichiometric value caused precipitation of significant amount of anionic sds surfactant as calcium dodecyl sulfate cds however cds being less soluble in water could not be directly reused to the process thus cds was converted to its sodium salt by adding na2co3 and re dissolved in water for reuse brant et al 1989 in another method 6n naoh was added into the retentate stream containing metal ions except for sr ii to precipitate sds which was removed by centrifuge and then recovered sds was reused in meuf juang et al 2003 in this method about 45 55 of sds was precipitated and the efficiency of removing metal ions with the recycled sds was within 50 58 implying a certain degree of the feasibility of repeatedly use of sds the acidification method was the simplest and most efficient method for surfactant recovery from the retentate stream and showed good results in many studies in this method about 58 1 of sds was recovered from the retentate stream using sulphuric acid ph 1 0 the removal efficiency of cd ii was found to be 88 1 with the reclaimed sds besides sds could also be recovered by lowering the temperature of the sds solution to 4 c below the reported kriff point of sds 16 c the foam fractionation method was applied to recover sds and cd 2 from the permeate stream qu et al 2008 in another study two step pre treatment methods such as 1 chelation followed by ultrafiltration and 2 acidification followed by ultrafiltration were used for removal of cd ii zn ii ions from sds micelles li et al 2009 in this method edta was reported to be the best chelating agent and h2so4 was the best acid agent the optimum ph value was 4 4 for the recovery of sds cd ii 66 5 and zn ii 68 5 further meuf treatment with the reclaimed sds resulted in removing 90 3 of cd ii and 89 6 of zn ii authors also reported that the reclaimed sds by the two step method performed better than the reclaimed sds by acidification in another recovery method the cationic cpc surfactant was recovered from the permeate stream using a two stage chemical treatment purkait et al 2004b in the first step potassium iodide ki was added to the cpc containing permeate stream with ki to cpc molar ratio of 1 1 resulting in the precipitation of cetyl pyridinium iodide cpi in the second step the water insoluble cpi was converted into a water soluble chloride by adding cupric chloride cucl2 to the precipitate cpi with 1 5 m ratio of cpi to cucl2 thus about 90 of cpc surfactant was recovered using this two stage method verma and sarkar 2019 developed a method of rhl recovery from meuf retentate solution based on alkaline treatment followed by acid precipitation and centrifugation alkaline treatment of meuf retentate rhl cv cd ii and salt at ph 9 0 using aqueous naoh solution resulted to about 99 5 recovery of cadmium ion as cadmium hydroxide acid precipitation and then centrifugation was carried out to recover rhl from the almost cadmium free supernatant under the optimum recovery conditions centrifugation speed 4755 rpm time 16 8 min ph 2 4 the maximum rhl recovery was found to be 84 1 with desirability value of 1 0 authors also reported that the rejection of cv remained almost unaffected 97 6 even after three times reuse of rhl but with slight decline in rejection of cd ii 92 the saponin surfactant was recovered from the permeate stream of meuf after removal of mv from wastewater by solvent extraction method using two solvents n butanol and n heptan samal et al 2017b their experimental results revealed that n butanol performed better than n heptane for the saponin recovery authors reported that 85 saponin recovery was achieved using 1 1 vol ratio of n butanol to aqueous reetha solution for a fixed saponin concentration of 350 10 3 kg m 3 4 conclusions and recommendations in recent decades the rapid development in industries such as dying textile printing leather paper and plastics etc have placed immense strain on water resources as these industries consume substantial volumes of water besides water shortage the contamination of water due to synthetic dyes and heavy metal ions released from these industries causes damage to the public health and has adverse effects on environment dye effluent pollution is one of the serious issues faced by several countries worldwide and has become the focus of many researchers mainly because of the voluminous polluted discharge into the environment recovery and reuse of dye wastewater show the potential to reduce water pollution significantly and thus partly solving the water resource crisis therefore a cost effective and eco friendly separation techniques are in great demand for the treatment of wastewater containing dyes over the past decade extensive efforts have been made to remove or reduce the toxic pollutants from dye wastewater based on numerous researches carried out so far meuf has been proven to be one of the most efficient and sustainable separation processes for the treatment of dye containing waste stream but exhibits a lack of systematic literature review on the current topic this review has discussed in detail about meuf process applied to dye wastewater including current state of the art micellization membrane fouling transport modelling various factors affecting the process performance and the limitations in the literature meuf processes have the several advantages including easy to operate under continuous mode low energy requirement cost effective high process throughput reduction of secondary pollution and meeting more and more stringent environmental regulations thus improved efficiency reduced processing costs and easy handling of large volume can be of immediate benefits of employing meuf in the treatment of dye effluent presently most of the published works are still at laboratory or pilot scale level and consequently further improvements in process efficiency are still required to make meuf process a leading commercialized dye wastewater treatment system for a large scale industrial operation to the best of our knowledge the application of meuf on industrial scale water treatment plant has not been reported so far to achieve this several important issues need to be considered in the future research generally dye effluent contains a varied mixture of dyes and electrolytes application of meuf in the dye effluent containing multiple dyes and their subsequent removal are not investigated so far however meuf studies mainly have been focused on the removal of single dye from the aqueous solution the co existence of multiple dyes or dyes in presence of heavy metal ions strongly influence the micelle pollutant interaction and hence removal efficiency of both the pollutants resulting in significant batch to batch variations hence for multicomponent system containing more than one dye more meuf studies are needed for better understanding the underlying mechanisms governing competitive interactions with the micelles during simultaneous removal the appropriate selection of surfactant is crucial to achieve good removal efficiency of dyes heavy metal ions as well as to ensure the minimization of the processing cost and secondary pollution generally the isoelectric ph surface charge size and aggregation number of surfactants play important roles in removal efficiency the use of rhamnolipid biosurfactant in meuf has been applauded however rhamnolipid has not been fully exploited for different dye systems further investigation is required on various types of biosurfactant synthesized from diverse feedstock to actually know the best biosurfactant that can effectively treat dye wastewater the use of some chemically synthesized surfactant having low cmc value and large micelle size in meuf has also been appreciated identification of more such surfactants and their applications in meuf are needed so far most of the meuf studies have been carried out on the short term feasibility of improvement methods for the duration of maximum 120 min operation but rarely investigated how the process performs over longer time periods which is necessary to verify the findings obtained in short term experiments for large scale industrial operation a long term performance of the meuf system needs to be systematically carried out for the purpose of minimizing membrane fouling prediction of flux decline and prolonging the membrane shelf life as well as increasing the overall process efficiency also economic competitiveness of meuf process need to be emphasized the complex nature of real dye effluent urges for a technologically sound and economically feasible separation technique comprehensive review of the current research revealed that most of the meuf studies for treatment of dye wastewater were carried out on synthetic wastewater however there is no meuf study reported on real dye wastewater thus scientific demonstration membrane fouling transport modelling and cost analysis studies using real dye wastewater samples are required very few scientific reports are available on the integration of meuf process with other technologies there are still more rooms for integration of meuf processes with other established separation techniques as an integrated separation process to produce high water throughput for industrial reuse declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

11825,the rapid development of dye using industries textile paper plastic leather printing cosmetic food and pharmaceuticals etc poor effluent management and disposal techniques have led to excess amounts of wastewater polluted with toxic dyes and heavy metal ions the discharge of large volumes of toxic wastewater into the environment particularly from small scale industries causes extensive damage to natural ecosystems and human health therefore the removal of these hazardous pollutants from effluents is of interest prior to release into natural water bodies micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf shows a great potential as an effective environmentally friendly and sustainable operation in treatment of dye wastewater particularly for diluted stream for water reclamation and resource recovery meuf has been successfully investigated for removal organic dyes and heavy metal ions from aqueous solution in single or binary system in this review we aim to provide an overview of the recent development state of the art and future perspectives of meuf for treatment of dye wastewater this article critically reviews the performance and capability of meuf process in the treatment of dye wastewater with the consideration of the basic principles transport modelling membrane fouling technical viability and parameters affecting micellization optimization of feed process throughput and removal efficiency the effects of type of surfactants membranes initial feed concentrations operating conditions etc on the process performance are reviewed this review presents the evidence of simultaneous removal of co existing pollutants dyes and heavy metal ions in dye wastewater using meuf and also explores the feasibility and efficiency of biosurfactant instead of chemical surfactant besides several ways to improve process efficiency are discussed along with the technical challenges and future opportunities for treating dye wastewater long term performance of the meuf system membrane fouling transport modelling cost analysis and application on real wastewater should be paid more attention in the future studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords micellar enhanced ultrafiltration surfactant critical micelle concentration dye wastewater membrane fouling permeate flux 1 introduction the application of organic dyes and dyestuffs is appearing in many process industries such as textile paper plastic leather printing cosmetic food and pharmaceuticals etc they are cationic anionic and non ionic in nature gupta and suhas 2009 huang et 2018 for instances methylene blue dye is widely used for coloring paper dyeing cottons silk and wools coating for paper stock and as a temporary hair colorant huang et al 2010 crystal violet dye is frequently used for dyeing cotton silk paper bamboo straw and leather etc various metal containing chemicals and metal containing complex phthalocyanine dyes are commonly used in dyeing printing and finishing steps of textile processing for example fixing agents potassium sodium dichromate etc oxidizing reducing agent copper acetate copper nitrate lead acetate potassium sodium dichromate etc cross linking agent nickel compound dye auxiliary mordant copper sulfate copper ii chloride copper ii oxide acid dye chromium vi compound and catalyst zinc chloride zinc nitrate etc are used in textile processing velusamy et al 2021 also different cadmium salts such as cadmium sulphide cadmium selenite and cadmium chloride etc are used in dyeing and printing textiles swarup et al 2007 metal based reactive dyes being economical are extensively used for dyeing and printing for cellulose fibres these reactive dyes are bound with heavy metals such as copper chromium zinc lead and nickel etc the typical concentration of heavy metals such as 33 110 mg l of copper and 3 83 mg l of chromium in vat dyes 3 32 mg l of zinc in basic dyes 6 52 mg l of lead in reactive dyes and about 1 mg l of cadmium in all types of dyes velusamy et al 2021 dyeing industries consume large volume of water in their unit operations approximately 15 20 of the dyes are lost during processing and discharged in the effluent from dying operations unit chakraborty et al 2011 the wastewater generated particularly from industrial operations of textile and dyes contains both dissolved organics dyes and heavy metal ions beyond their acceptable concentration limit the use of metal containing chemicals and metal containing complex dyes are the major source of heavy metal ions pb ii cd ii cu ii zn ii cr vi etc in dye wastewater these effluents are varying in colour composition and ph bielska and prochaska 2007 the two pollutants namely dyes and heavy metal ions are toxic carcinogenic and non biodegradable in nature among the different pollutants released to the environment these pollutants are regarded as the most dangerous contaminant due to high operating cost small scale industries usually discharge the hazardous waste directly to the aquatic environment in addition the rapid industrial development poor disposal techniques and effluent management particularly in developing countries are the reason of mixing of dye wastes of different sources these lead to the presence of both the toxic pollutants in wastewaters huang et al 2014 the release of the untreated effluent containing dyes and or heavy metal ions from the industrial sewage into the surface water poses harmful effects to human health even at low concentration besides these pollutants can modify the physico chemical properties of water affecting the aquatic life resulting in a significant ecological impact on ecosystem proper treatment of wastewater containing such pollutants is becoming increasingly important because of more stringent discharge regulations therefore the removal of these hazardous pollutants from waste effluents is of interest prior to release into natural water bodies in both developed and developing countries gupta and suhas 2009 zaghbani et al 2009a during the past few decades various techniques have been employed for the treatment of dye wastewater worth mentioning the conventional techniques are biodegradation coagulation flocculation oxidation and adsorption rajasimman et al 2017 gilpavas et al 2017 luo et al 2015 etc literature review reveals that each technique has advantages as well as limitations such as high operating cost time consuming operation equilibrium governed generation of secondary pollutants difficulty in regeneration and inappropriate for large scale application etc thus developing a high efficiency separation method was essential for advanced treatment of dye wastewater in this regard membrane separation processes particularly in the range of nanofiltration nf and ultrafiltration uf are increasingly investigated for the treatment of dye wastewater nf membrane 200 1000 da rejects effectively most of the dyes but needs high operating pressure i e high energy requirement for desired throughput ahmad et al 2006 nataraj et al 2009 askari et al 2015 the high selectivity in nanofiltration is attributed to the combination of size exclusion donnan exclusion and solution diffusion mechanisms abdullah et al 2019 however nf membrane faces serious problems related to concentration polarization and membrane fouling caused by dye adsorption precipitation of inorganics colloid deposition and biological growth etc bielska and prochaska 2007 compared to nf uf processes operate at low pressure and give higher process throughput however uf membrane 10 100 nm with molecular weight cut off mwco of 1 100 kda cannot remove smaller size dye molecules having molecular weights in the range from a few hundred to over a thousand daltons da the removal mechanism in ultrafiltration is governed by size exclusion effect abdullah et al 2019 an ideal membrane for dye wastewater treatment should have dual advantages such as high process throughput and high solute rejection efficiency in this regard adsorptive dynamic membrane having dual pollutant removal capability adsorption and membrane separation exhibited good removal efficiency at low pollutant concentration and operated at low operating pressure of ultrafiltration range for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater xu et al 2018 however absorption saturation restricted the long term stability and practicability of adsorptive dynamic membrane recently biomimetic dynamic membrane fabricated by physical absorption and filtration of carbon nanotubes and laccases enzyme on the surface of 150 kda pes ultrafiltration membrane exhibited excellent cv dye removal efficiency at low dye concentration with satisfying permeate flux high anti fouling capacity and long term stability chen et al 2019 in another effort to developing sustainable technologies for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater meuf has been shown to be promising and economical in removing traces of dissolved organic pollutants and or heavy metal ions from single multi pollutant aqueous diluted streams and has been studied for more than 35 years dunn et al 1985 meuf process operated at low pressure gives satisfactory process efficiency high throughput and high rejection efficiency with much less energy consumption and hence can be effectively utilized for separating dyes and heavy metal ions zaghbani et al 2009a ke et al 2007 huang et al 2010 yenphan et al 2010 in meuf micelles containing solubilized solute are large enough to be filtered by the uf membrane via the size exclusion mechanism different types of dyes have been used as model dyes for lab scale meuf process table 1 purkait et al 2006 bielska nad szymanowski 2006 majewska nowak et al 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 zaghbani et al 2009a 2009b samal et al 2017a parakala et al 2019 the concurrent removal of dyes and heavy metal ions using meuf are also reported in literature zeng et al 2011 huang et al 2014 verma and sarkar 2019 2020 in meuf process the surfactant is added to the polluted aqueous stream at concentration levels equal to or higher than its critical micelle concentration cmc the surfactant monomers will self associate to form aggregates micelles which can bind the heavy metal ions at their surface according to their surface charge and solubilize the organic pollutants in the micelle interior the micelle solution is then filtered through an uf membrane with an appropriate pore size smaller than aggregates sizes during ultrafiltration the surfactant aggregates with adsorbed solubilized pollutants can be retained by the membrane whereas the free surfactant monomers and very low concentration of untrapped pollutants pass through the uf membrane with the permeate stream thus almost clean water is obtained which can be recycled in process or discarded dunn et al 1985 christian and scamehorn 1989 scamehorn et al 1989 it is worthy to mention here that the presence of monovalent divalent inorganic salts nacl and na2so4 etc in wastewater is typical in a dye house effluent as they are commonly used in dyeing process zaghbani et al 2009a during meuf treatment of dye wastewater these inorganic salts also freely pass through the uf membrane and thus appearing in the permeate side this fundamental concept of meuf was first investigated for ionic surfactants sodium oleate and potassium laurate by j mcbain and w jenkins in 1922 and for non ionic surfactant polyoxyethylated 1 dodecanol by h schott in 1964 the effectiveness of any meuf depends on the properties and concentrations of the surfactants and pollutants solution ph and compositions ionic strength membrane pore size and hydrodynamic conditions such as transmembrane pressure difference δp stirrer speed ω feed flow rate u and temperature t etc since its introduction there are a lot of experimental investigations carried out on the applications of meuf in the wastewater treatment data from scopus reveal that meuf has gained tremendous interest in the treatment of wastewater particularly for diluted stream over the past decade due to process simplicity and low operation cost many research articles on meuf have been published over the past few years and this number is expected to rise in the upcoming years fig 1 presently numerous laboratory scale research studies have been documented on the practicability of meuf process for the removal of dyes and heavy metal ions from dye wastewater in a single system or in binary system with high rejection coefficient tables 2 and 3 juang et al 2003 purkait et al 2006 bielska and szymanowski 2006 majewska nowak et al 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 samal et al 2017b the removal of heavy metal ions which are commonly found in dye wastewater are reported in this review the possibility of removing of dyes and heavy metal ions by meuf has also been reported when the pollutants co exist in wastewater zeng et al 2011 huang et al 2014 verma and sarkar 2019 2020 moreover a few meuf studies have been reported in literature for treating real wastewaters including olive mill wastewater el abbassi et al 2011 raisin processing wastewater afifia et al 2014 soft drink processing wastewater hamed azizi namaghi and seyed mahmoud mousavi 2014 phosphorous rich wastewater of fertilizer plant häyrynen et al 2012 and plastic plating wastewater chang et al 2014 however to the best of our knowledge the application of meuf on industrial dye wastewater has not been reported so far the major drawback of any meuf process is the transient decline in permeation rate due to development of concentration polarization and membrane fouling concentration polarization refers to the reversible build up of solutes in liquid phase near the membrane surface in meuf it describes the variation of surfactant concentration in the thin boundary layer neighbouring the membrane surface kamble and marathe 2005 ke et al 2007 fang et al 2008 zaghbani et al 2009a on the other hand membrane fouling occurs due to several possible reasons such as adsorption of solutes unsolubilized pollutants smaller micelles etc on the membrane pores and by blockage partial blockage of these pores and formation of deposited layer at the membrane surface by the rejected pollutant micelles complexes yenphan et al 2010 acero et al 2017 during the process of concentration polarization surfactant micelles block the membrane pores and cause a resistance against the solvent flow resulting in quick decline in permeate flux at the early stage of filtration ke et al 2007 zaghbani et al 2009a huang et al 2010 during meuf the rejected pollutant surfactant aggregates may also form highly viscous boundary layer adjacent to the membranes surface which is well known as a gel layer actually when the micelle concentration on the membrane surface reaches an adequately high value the gel layer forms in addition to the hydrodynamic membrane resistance the gel layer offers extra resistance to flow through the membranes resulting in the flux decline purkait et al 2004a el zeftawy and mulligan 2011 acero et al 2017 nature and size of foulant also play an important role in determining the potential of membrane fouling zhang and jiang 2018 have reported the existence of maximum fouling caused by cake layer formation pore blocking and irreversible fouling etc at a critical size of foulant during the investigation of membrane fouling in aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor membrane fouling caused by gel forming solutes such as transparent exopolymer particles has been reported in literature meng et al 2020 have recently reviewed the transparent exopolymer particles associated membrane fouling with regard to its formation detection and properties during water and wastewater treatment schwarze 2017 has provided a comprehensive review on the state of the art of meuf and explaining the nitty gritty of the process however to the best of our knowledge there is no critical review available in literature that can provide an in depth analysis on the performance of meuf for the treatment of dye wastewater particularly identification of fouling mechanism the factors influencing membrane fouling transport modelling and application of mixed surfactant and biosurfactant have been scarcely reviewed and elaborately discussed accordingly this article aims to provide a comprehensive review on the recent development in meuf for the treatment of wastewater containing dye the process of micellization solubilization of micelles selection of suitable surfactant and membrane and meuf performances are summarized and discussed in detail special attentions are paid to the analysis of membrane fouling flux decline and transport modelling this review also shed light on potential application of biosurfactant in meuf 2 micellization and critical micelle concentration surfactants are molecules having both lipophilic or hydrophobic tail group and hydrophilic head group in the same molecule in aqueous solution at or above cmc value these amphiphilic molecules form self aggregates with the hydrophobic portion directed towards the center of the micelles hydrophobic interior and the hydrophilic portions located at the micelles surface hydrophilic exterior directing towards the solvent molecules aqueous phase fig 2 ahmad et al 2006 lee and lee 2016 beyond cmc value all the added surfactant molecules form aggregates which are in equilibrium with the surfactant monomers consequently concentration of free monomer in the solution remains constant at its cmc value lee and lee 2016 the aggregates are formed spontaneously due to intermolecular forces such as electrostatic hydrophobic hydrophilic hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces etc younis et al 2020 the electrostatic repulsion between charged polar head groups of surfactant monomers prevents the aggregation therefore for self aggregation the energy released as a result of association of hydrophobic tail group of the monomer should overcome the electrostatic repulsion and thus aggregation process becomes endothermic in nature alam et al 2014 micellization process leads to decrease in entropy because of free movement of surfactant monomers before micellization while their mobility is restricted after micellization the aggregates are with different sizes and morphologies depending on the surfactant concentration solvent properties ph presence of salt in the solution and temperature etc dynamic light scattering measurement is used to determine the average size and size distribution of surfactant aggregates hydrodynamic diameter the surfactant aggregates are also classified as micelles 10 nm small vesicle 10 50 nm medium vesicle 50 250 nm and large vesicle 250 nm champion et al 1995 for ionic surfactants the solution ph presence of electrolyte and surfactant concentration are found to be important factors affecting the size shape and aggregation number of surfactant aggregates the aggregate size was found to decrease with an increase in solution ph this can be attributed to the fact that increasing solution ph results to an increase the negative charge of the anionic surfactant with more negative zeta potential so the electrostatic repulsion between the adjacent hydrophilic heads of surfactants increases this leads to a large hydrophilic head diameter and restricts the formation of large aggregates at higher surfactant concentration both aggregation number and mean aggregate size decrease tanhaei et al 2014 the cmc is a fundamental property of any surfactant which gives a measure of the stability of its micellar form relative to its monomeric form it depends on nature and structure of the surfactant for determination of cmc the measured values of equilibrium surface tension of the aqueous surfactant solution at different surfactant concentrations were plotted against the corresponding logarithmic of bulk concentration surface tension isotherm the value of cmc was determined from the point of inflection of the isotherm fig 3 verma and sarkar 2019 the cmc value of surfactant depends on the nature of the hydrophilic hydrophobic groups presence of salt non ionic surfactant and organic additives in the solution ph and temperature etc alam et al 2014 the estimated value of cmc can be then be used to calculate the gibbs free energy of micellization lee and lee 2016 2 1 effects of parameters on critical micelle concentration 2 1 1 effect of feed concentration feed surfactant concentration has positive impact on mean micelle size micelle aggregation number and cmc value higher surfactant concentration leads to decrease in both aggregation number and mean micelle size as a result the large micelles turn to the small and compact micelles fang et al 2008 the mean size sds micelle was found to decrease from 3 nm to 1 5 nm with increasing sds concentration from 12 mm to 60 mm tanhaei et al 2014 an increase in rhl concentration from 1 mm to 3 mm resulted to decrease in the rhl vesicle size from 33 47 to 23 04 nm verma and sarkar 2019 the micelle size of the surfactant was also found to increases in presence of organic compound or heavy metal ions in the solution organic molecules occupied a certain volume inside of micelle core and heavy metal ions adsorbed onto the surfactant micelle surface resulting in increase in micelle size as reported sds micelle size increased from 3 nm to 3 6 nm in presence of aniline and ni ii in solution tanhaei et al 2014 a similar trend was also observed in the cv rhl system the mean vesicle size of rhl biosurfactant increased from 9 4 nm to 53 5 nm in presence of 0 08 mm crystal violet dye verma et al 2020 the feed concentration of dyes and heavy metal ions also showed significant effect on the cmc value the cmc values of sds surfactant in water in 0 5 mm cu ii solution and in 0 5 mm cd ii solution were reported as 5 9 mm 1 8 mm and 2 2 mm respectively şahin and taşcıoğlu 2016 heavy metal ions with net positive charges favor the formation of micelles by decreasing the repulsions between the negatively charged head groups of surfactants resulting decrease in cmc value in another study the cmc value of rhl decreased from 40 to 28 mg l with increase in zeta potential from 20 to 16 3 mv in presence of 0 08 mm cv in the solution verma et al 2020 huang et al 2014 also reported similar observation for cd ii sds system huang et al 2010 reported that the zeta potential of sds micelles decreased from 41 1 mv to 63 5 mv in presence of 6 mg l of mb in the solution this could be due to slight decrease of cmc value and increase in micelle aggregation number with increase in feed mb concentration resulting in the increase of surface charge density of micelles in another study two opposite trends were observed the cmc value of ctab decreased from 1 087 mm to 0 710 mm in presence of reactive dye 195 which was explained by the fact that dye molecules could easily adjust themselves within micelles which caused to decrease in repulsions between ionic heads thus making micellization easier however in presence of reactive dye 225 the cmc value of ctab slightly increased from 1 087 mm to 1 14 mm this observation might be due to complex structure of reactive dye 225 which might change their orientation for accommodating within micelles such orientation caused micellization to be less favourable resulting in increase in cmc value younis et al 2020 2 1 2 effect of salt the addition of an electrolyte significantly decreases the cmc value of ionic surfactants fig 3 the effect of salt is quantified according the following expressions corrin and harkins 1947 alam et al 2014 1 log cmc m log c t n where m and n are the constants for a specific ionic head group and ct denotes the total counterion concentration contributed by the surfactant and by the salt lee and lee 2016 the decrease in the cmc values of ionic surfactants such as sds sdbs cpc and rhl is documented the addition of electrolytes to the solution of ionic surfactants increases the concentration of free counter ions around micelles thus reducing the repulsion between the surfactant heads resulting in lowering of cmc value with increase in size and aggregation number of micelles in presence of 58 5 kg m 3 nacl the aggregation number of cpc micelles was found to increase from 104 to 229 varade et al 2005 the surface charge neutralization of the micelle caused by the increase in the counter ion condensation was found to be more effective for smaller size of hydrated counter ion compared to nacl the effect of nabr on cpc micelles was found to be more effective for increasing aggregation number and decreasing cmc value as the chloride ion became more hydrated than the bromide ion varade et al 2005 it was also reported that the size of the biosurfactant aggregates decreased after the addition of sodium salt nacl nabr this was explained by the fact in the presence of sodium salt sodium ions soft acid in the solution could easily bind with the anionic surfactant resulting in the induction of the solvated groups the number of solvated groups increased with increase of salt concentration thereby improving the water solubility of the surfactant pornsunthorntawee et al 2009 the presence of electrolyte showed much smaller effect in case of non ionic surfactant 2 1 3 effect of non ionic surfactants in the presence of non ionic surfactants the cmc value of ionic surfactant decreased as compared to that of a single surfactant solution lee and lee 2016 the presence of non ionic surfactant in the mixed micellar solution caused to decrease in the electrostatic repulsion between the hydrophilic charged head groups in the stern layer of the ionic micelles thus facilitating micelle formation this led to decrease in cmc value in the presence of non ionic surfactants such as brij35 omc 10 and tx 100 the cmc value of sds ionic surfactant was significantly lowered as compared with the single sds system fang et al 2008 tanhaei et al 2014 bielska and szymanowski 2006 huang et al 2014 in presence of 0 1 mol fraction of tx 100 in mixed solution the cmc value of sds decreased from 7 8 mm for pure sds to 2 04 mm because of synergistic of anionic nonionic surfactant in mixed system this was explained assuming that the ethylene oxide chains of the tx 100 in the mixed micelle coiled around the charged head groups of the sds surfactant screening the electrostatic repulsions thus favoring micelle formation and resulting in low cmc value compared to individual surfactants fang et al 2008 the estimated cmc value was used to calculate the interaction coefficient which gave the information about interaction between different building units in the mixed micellar solution compared to the single surfactant solution clint 1975 rubingh and mittal 1979 the negative interaction coefficient value implied the synergistic attractive interactions behavior of mixed micelle and real mixed micelles were more stable thermodynamically compared to ideal mixed micelles the positive interaction coefficient value showed the antagonism repulsive interactions and the interaction coefficient value equal to zero indicated the ideal mixed micelle formation 2 1 4 effect of temperature temperature showed a significant effect on the cmc of surfactant the variation of cmc of ionic surfactant with temperature could be linear or non linear in nature different surfactants behaved differently for sdbs and cpc surfactants a linear increase in cmc value was observed with the rise in temperature varade et al 2005 chauhan and sharma 2014 surfactants such as dtab ads and otac ctpabr and ctpacl displayed a u shaped behavior in a cmc temperature plot with increase in temperature the cmc value decreased to a certain minimum point and then rose with temperature kang et al 2001 michele et al 2011 the effect of temperature on cmc was explained in terms of hydrophobic hydration and hydrophilic hydration both types of hydrations were possible in monomeric form of surfactant whereas only hydrophilic hydration was possible for surfactant monomers in micellar state the hydrophilic hydration was caused by the interaction of hydrogen and oxygen atoms with the ionic group and takes place around the head group of the micelle the hydrophobic hydration occurred because water molecules were strongly associated around the hydrophobe with the rise in temperature both hydrophobic hydration and hydrophilic hydration decreased sadeghi and shahabi 2011 the decrease of hydrophobic hydration facilitated micellization while the decrease of hydrophilic hydration disfavoured micellization the increase or decrease of cmc value for a particular temperature range depended on the relative magnitude of these two types of hydrations on increasing temperature the partial dehydration of hydrophilic heads caused an increase in electrostatic repulsion between the hydrophilic heads of surfactant monomers as well as between the hydrophilic heads present at the surface of surfactant micelle at low temperature range with increase of temperature the decrease of hydrophobic hydration was predominant over the decrease of hydrophilic hydration resulting in decrease of cmc value at higher temperature dehydration of hydrophilic heads was predominant over the dehydration of hydrophobic chains resulting an increase of cmc value furthermore increasing temperature enhanced the thermal motions of surfactant and solvent molecules to make the formation of ordered micelle structures difficult also at higher temperature the ordered micellar structure could be destroyed due to increased kinetic energy resulting in decrease in micelle aggregation number and increase in cmc value 2 2 thermodynamics of micellization for understanding the micellization process knowledge of thermodynamic parameters such as molar standard gibbs free energy δ g mic 0 enthalpy δ h mic 0 entropy δ s mic 0 of micellization is important for their desirable applications these parameters are calculated according to mass action and pseudo phase model the molar standard gibbs free energy of micellization expressed per mol of monomer unit represents the free energy change resulting from the transfer of 1 mol of surfactant from the aqueous phase to the micellar pseudo phase at a given temperature and pressure actually δ g mic 0 is the difference between the standard chemical potential of a surfactant monomer in solution and that of a surfactant in a micelle according to pseudo phase model δ g mic 0 for the ionic surfactants of the type xy electrolyte 1 1 can be calculated using following expressions 2 δ g mic 0 2 α r t ln x cmc where the α r t and xcmc are the degree of counterion association binding of the micelle universal gas constant temperature and cmc in mole fraction unit respectively α a n is the ratio of the number of counterions a bound to the micelle to the number of surfactant ions n forming a micelle now α 1 β where β is degree of ionization dissociation that can be estimated by taking the ratio of post micellar and pre micellar slope obtained from the plot of specific conductance verses surfactant concentration manko et al 2014 rodr ıguez et al 2002 in case of cmc value expressed in molality unit it should be divided by 55 5 the molar enthalpy of micellization δ h mic 0 is defined as the enthalpy change for transferring 1 mol of surfactant from the aqueous phase to the micellar pseudo phase can be obtained from the gibbs helmholtz relationship 3 δ h mic 0 d dt δ g mic 0 t d dt 1 t p 4 δ h mic 0 2 α r t 2 d ln x cmc dt p for estimation of δ h mic 0 it is necessary to know the temperature dependence of xcmc the slope of the linear plot of ln xcmc vs t gives the value of d ln x cmc dt knowing the value of δ h mic 0 and δ g mic 0 the molar standard entropy of micellization δ s mic 0 can be obtained from gibbs helmholtz equation as 5 δ s mic 0 δ h mic 0 δ g mic 0 t the gibbs free energy is the sum of the enthalpic δ h mic 0 and entropic tδ s mic 0 contributions both the terms δ h mic 0 and δ s mic 0 are quite sensitive to temperature with increase in temperature the contribution of enthalpy to the free energy increases while the contribution of entropy decreases for ionic surfactants the values of δ g mic 0 are reported to be in the range of 23 to 42 kj mol 1 at 25 c during the process of micellization a negative entropy change is expected because of formation of ordered structure from monomeric molecules before micellization surfactant monomers are free to move in aqueous solution while their mobility is restricted after micellization the positive values of δ s mic 0 indicate an entropically favored micellization one can observe that the δ h mic 0 is zero at the minimum value of cmc on the lower temperature side δ h mic 0 is positive and endothermic however δ h mic 0 is negative and exothermic on the higher temperature side the negative values of δ h mic 0 and δ g mic 0 indicate that the process of micellization is exothermic and spontaneous in nature and also enthalpy driven for most of the ionic surfactants it has been observed that at low temperatures micellization process is entropy controlled while and at high temperature it is enthalpy controlled at low temperatures the destruction of organized water molecules around a hydrophobic chain causes to an increase in randomness in the micellar core with increase in value of δ s mic 0 however with increase in temperature the structure and size of water molecule aggregates decreases due to melting and thus energy required to break up the three dimensional water cluster is less making the δ h mic 0 value negative or exothermic with more significant of its contribution to the free energy 3 micellar enhance ultrafiltration 3 1 selection of surfactant the selection of surfactant is very crucial for any meuf process depending on the nature of the pollutants to be removed kandori and schechter 1990 various surfactants have been used for meuf process table 4 this includes anionic surfactants sds cationic surfactants cpc ctab non ionic surfactants tx 100 np12 and ionic non ionic mixed surfactants tx 100 sds np12 sds purkait et al 2004a ahmad et al 2006 bielska nad szymanowski 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 zaghbani et al 2009a yenphan et al 2010 huang et al 2014 generally anionic surfactant is selected for cationic solute and vice verse for instance methylene blue being cationic character can be easily solubilized within the anionic sds micelles due to electrostatic interactions bielska nad szymanowski 2006 in addition some important attributes of surfactant make it suitable and effective for meuf operation i low cmc value ii high affinity towards target metal ions iii larger aggregate size iv biodegradability low toxicity and renewable production sources v low cost vi desired thermal and physico chemical stabilities vii fast solubilization rate between surfactant aggregates and dyes heavy metal ions viii good water solubility and ix possibility of regeneration schwarze 2017 so far most of the meuf studies have been successfully carried out using synthetic surfactant for separation dissolved solutes ions dyes organic molecules from aqueous solution to achieve desired separation large amount of synthetic surfactant is required because of its high cmc value and also the excessive loss of surfactant with the permeate causes to a long term risk of secondary pollution therefore further treatment of permeate stream is necessary for recovery or removal of residual surfactants giving additional cost of the process furthermore high surfactant concentration in feed results in severe concentration polarization and membrane fouling this leads to low permeation rate and thus large membrane area is required to treat a given volume of wastewater in a fixed operating time thereby increasing processing cost to overcome this issue the surfactants having low cmc value such as carboxylate surfactant and biosurfactant have been used in meuf process for separation of toxic heavy metal ions and organic compounds el zeftawy and mulligan 2011 schwarze et al 2018 verma and sarkar 2019 biosurfactants are the natural surfactants available in plants and animals which are produced by microorganisms including bacteria yeast and fungi biosurfactants are classified into five categories based on their chemical structure surfactant properties and microbial origin that include glycolipids phospholipids lipopeptides fatty acids and polymeric biosurfactants henkel et al 2012 li et al 2015 among biosurfactants rhamnolipid rhl shows much more promising in the application of meuf of wastewaters compared to the synthetic surfactants sds etc because of their higher biodegradability and lower toxicity low cmc value excellent interfacial activity effectiveness under extreme conditions of temperature ph and salinity and ability to be produced from renewable and cheaper feedstocks etc thus making the process cost effective and environmentally friendly el zeftawy and mulligan 2011 abbasi garravand and mulligan 2014 rhamnolipids anionic biosurfactants with glycolipid structure are mostly synthesized by pseudomonas aeruginosa strains gram negative bacteria from various carbon sources glucose glycerol hydrocarbons plant oil and ethanol etc as well as nitrogen sources nitrate ammonium urea etc müller et al 2012 rhamnolipids are amphiphilic compounds comprising of hydrophilic head formed by one or two rhamnose molecules and a hydrophobic tail composed of one or two molecules of fatty acid chains β hydroxyalkanoic acid units the two major types of rhamnolipids are mono rhamnolipid l rhamnosyl 3 hydroxydecanoyl 3 hydroxydecanoate and di rhamnolipid l rhamnosyl l rhamnosyl 3 hydroxydecanoyl 3 hydroxydecanoate henkel et al 2012 müller et al 2012 rhamnolipids can reduce the surface tension of pure water from 72 to below 30 mn m with a cmc value in the range of 5 200 mg l due to presence of carboxylic acid moiety rhamnolipid shows weak acidity and anionic character at concentrations above the cmc value rhamnolipid tends to form aggregates micelles vesicles or lamella in aqueous solution depending on the solution ph the concentration and the presence of electrolytes pornsunthorntawee et al 2009 nitschke and costacontiero 2011 rhamnolipids aggregates can effectively bind the heavy metal ions solubilize organic molecules the enhanced solubilization binding capacity of rhamnolipids aggregates for organic compounds and heavy metal ions make it suitable in the remediation of wastewaters soils contaminated by heavy metal ions and hydrophobic toxic organic compounds wang and mulligan 2009 li et al 2015 the rhl surfactants having large aggregate size allow to use high mwco membrane in meuf for high throughput with desired separation verma and sarkar 2019 apart from using biosurfactant the introduction of non ionic surfactant to ionic surfactant reduces the cmc value of mixed micelles which therefore reduces the required surfactant in feed and leakage of surfactant in the permeate stream one good example was reported by huang et al 2014 where small amounts of non ionic tx 100 surfactants was mixed with an anionic sds surfactant in their study the best rejections for mb and cd ii were achieved as 99 40 and 98 06 respectively at the tx 100 to sds molar ratio of 0 3 for mb and 0 5 for cd ii 3 2 membrane module and mode of operation both operational modes namely cross flow and dead end filtration have been investigated in meuf studies fig 4 in dead end filtration feed flows perpendicular towards the membrane surface while in cross flow meuf feed flows tangentially over the membrane surface in case of dead end filtration the rate of flux decline is more in the gradual stage compared to that in case of cross flow filtration because in the later high cross flow reduces membrane fouling and controls the build up of the cake gel type layer formed over the membrane surface meuf has been carried out in both flat sheet as well as hollow fibre membrane configuration ahmad et al 2006 ke et al 2007 zaghbani et al 2009a huang et al 2010 however most of the meuf studies were performed with flat sheet membrane the flat sheet membranes are excellent for laboratory testing because of defined fluid flow path and module can accept variety of membrane of different mwco with high pressure rating the membrane can be cleaned physically for heavy fouling if required on site replacement of flat sheet membrane is relatively easy on the other hand the hollow fiber membrane having the highest surface area to volume ratio offers higher permeate flux and can be operated in both continuous and cross flow mode the backflushing capability of hollow fibre membrane improves its cleanability the combination of low pressure drops and high flow rates makes hollow fibres more economical in terms of energy consumption although few meuf experiments were carried with using hollow fiber membrane it offers several disadvantages such as hollow fibres have low pressure ratings with maximum transmembrane pressure less than 0 15 mpa which limits the cross flow rate of the feed the small diameter makes the fiber susceptible to plugging at the cartridge inlet the entire cartridge needs to be replaced if a single fiber in the bundle bursts thus making membrane replacement cost high cheryan 2016 howell et al 1993 3 3 estimation of various parameters for evaluation of meuf process the efficiency of meuf process in removing the dye from the aqueous solution is evaluated by several important parameters including permeate flux vw rejection coefficient r fouling resistances rf distribution coefficient d equilibrium binding constant kb micelle phase aqueous phase partition coefficient kp activity coefficient γ and micelle loading capacity lm etc are determined ultrafiltration of micellar solution enables to determine these parameters the permeate flux can be calculated using the following equation cheryan 2016 6 v w 1 a δv δt the membrane permeability lp can be determined from the measurement of pure water flux v w 0 data obtained from filtration with distilled water at different operating transmembrane pressures δp the darcy s law can be used to fit the pure water flux data using eq 7 7 v w 0 l p δ p δp μ p r m the pure water membrane permeability coefficient is obtained from the slope of the straight line v w 0 versus δp the value of the intrinsic membrane resistance rm is then calculated from the value of lp according to eq 7 the permeate flux under constant pressure meuf process can be used to evaluate various membrane fouling according to resistance in series model huang et al 2010 using eq 8 8 v w δp μ p r m r f where rf is the additional fouling resistance comprising of reversible fouling resistance and irreversible fouling resistance the problem of membrane fouling is particularly significant in meuf of dye containing wastewater in this model it is assumed that the membrane is fouled due to dye adsorption followed by cake gel type layer deposition of surfactant aggregates in most of the meuf process solutes such as surfactant monomer and or unsolubilized dye freely pass through the membrane with the permeate while dye micelle complexes are retained by the membrane the observed rejection r o s of solute surfactant dye and the observed rejection of surfactant micelles r 0 m can be defined as sabate et al 1999 9 r o s 1 c p s c r s 10 r 0 m 1 c p m c r m retentate stream consists of a micellar phase and an aqueous phase three solutes exist in retentate such as surfactant monomers surfactant micelles carrying dye molecules and unsolubilised dye molecules r o m depends on the operating conditions and its value less than unity indicates the presence of micelles in the permeate stream another important parameter is the intrinsic micelle rejection r i m which is defined as 11 r i m 1 c p m c m m r i m does not depend on the operating conditions but depends only on the membrane and solutes characteristics both observed micelle rejection and intrinsic rejection are corelated by eq 12 sabate et al 1999 12 r o m 1 1 r i m c m m c r m it has been observed that at higher operating pressure some micelle dye aggregates passed through the membrane i e membrane leaks some micelles thus in case of meuf process with partial rejection of surfactant dye aggregates the concentration of solute surfactant dye in the permeate can be obtained by eq 13 sabate et al 1999 13 c p s c p a s c p m s c p a s 1 r o m c r s c p a s it is to be noted that aqueous phase contains surfactant in its monomeric form and dyes in its unsolubilsed form which freely pass through the membrane distribution coefficient d is the ratio of concentration of solubilizate in the retentate and permeate bielska and prochaska 2007 khosa et al 2011 and is defined as 14 d c r s c p s higher value of d implies better micelle solubilization capacity during meuf the retention of mb dye was well correlated with that of distribution coefficient for three surfactants such as sds ctab and tx 100 bielska nad szymanowski 2006 a similar relationship was obtained for other dyes such as mordant black 11 and mordant black 17 regardless of the type of membrane and the surfactant bielska and prochaska 2007 it was suggested that to achieve high efficiency of separation the distribution coefficient should be more than 15 bielska and szymanowski 2006 the values of d were reported to be 49 183 190 210 and 147 6 for sds mb sds cv rhl cv ctab mb 11 and ctab mb 17 respectively bielska and szymanowski 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 verma et al 2020 the extent of solubilization expressed by molar solubilization ratio msr is defined as moles of solubilized pollutant per mole of micellized surfactant hanna et al 2005 15 msr s s s w c r sur cmc where ss is the solubility of the solubilizate in surfactant solution and sw is the solubility of the solubilizate in pure water msr shows the effectiveness of a given surfactant in solubilizing a particular pollutant the molar solubilization power of sap surfactant for mb and ey dyes were reported as 8 02 and 6 76 respectively samal et al 2017a the micellar solubilization of a solubilizate can be characterized by i equilibrium micelle binding constant or equilibrium solubilization constant of solute k b x m c p and ii micelle phase aqueous phase partition coefficient of solute k p x m x w in an aqueous vesicular or micellar solution cp is the molar concentration of monomeric solute xm and xw are the mole fraction of the solute in the micellar

in aqueous phase compared to the total amount of water they are expressed by eq 16 and eq 17 respectively kondo et al 1993 bielska and prochaska 2007 hanna et al 2005 mohamed and mahfoodh 2006 16 x m

micelle binding constant indicates the relative affinity of dyes pollutants for surfactant micelles high kp value of sds surfactant i e log kp 3 62 indicates the strong attractive electrostatic and weak hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between mb dye and sds micelles khosa et al 2011 however strong electrostatic repulsion and weak hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between similar charged mb dye and ctab surfactant is accountable for low micellar binding constant i e log kp 1 05 khosa et al 2011 the values of log kp were reported as 2 7 2 72 5 58 4 45 4 29 and 1 05 for sds mb sds cv rhl cv ctab mb11 ctab mb17 and ctab mb respectively bielska and szymanowski 2006 bielska and prochaska 2007 verma et al 2020 from the knowledge of binding constant the values of activity coefficient of solute γs and activity coefficient of surfactant γsur can be estimated using eqs 22 and 23 kondo et al 1993 22 γ s 1 k b c p 0 s 23 γ sur 2 1 b b ln 1 x m ln 1 bx m for detailed estimation of activity

a s c r s 1 k b c r sur cmc it is worthy to mention here that the kb values estimated from batch meuf experiments can be used to predict pollutant permeate concentrations in a continuous meuf process sabate et al 1999 and the solutes having strong tendency to bind within surfactant micelles are characterized by large values of binding constant and smaller values of activity coefficient another important parameter is the loading of the surfactant micelles vesicles lm which stands for the unit binding capacity of micelles vesicles is defined as khosa et al 2011 25 l m c m s c m sur c r s c p s c r sur cmc micelle loading varies widely depending on the type and concentration of surfactant and dye used table 5 the addition of non ionic surfactant to the solution of ionic surfactant shows a significant effect on distribution coefficient loading capacity and binding constant during meuf two opposite factors attribute to this phenomenon mixed surfactant system possesses more micelles because of lowering cmc value thus increasing solubilization of dyes on the other hand mixed surfactant system also possesses lower micelle charge density compared to same mole amount of pure ionic surfactant thus reducing the affinity of dye molecules for the micelles therefore the increasing amount of micelle and the decreasing micelle charge density as the results of the addition non ionic surfactant to the ionic surfactant jointly contributed to the final values of distribution coefficient micelle loading and binding constant the addition of non ionic surfactant omc 10 to ionic surfactants sds ctab caused to increase in micelle loading and binding constant and decrease in distribution coefficient for mb mb11 and mb17 dyes bielska and prochaska 2007 however in another meuf studies for removal of mb the addition of non ionic surfactant tx 100 caused to decrease in loading capacity and binding constant and increase in distribution coefficient huang et al 2014 for removal of pb ii the addition of non ionic surfactant with 0 1 mol fraction to 8 2 mm sds distribution coefficient increased from 7 83 to 40 22 and from 7 83 to 49 73 for sds tx 100 and sds np12 systems respectively also the binding constant increased from 1 57 to 4 08 mm 1 and 1 57 to 6 28 mm 1 for sds tx 100 and sds np12 systems respectively yenphan et al 2010 the loading capacity and binding constant of rhl vesicles were found more than the sds micelles under identical feed conditions and removal efficiencies compared to sds micelles the loading capacity and binding constant of rhl vesicles were found six fold and four fold larger respectively under the similar conditions of feed and cd ii cv removal efficiency verma and sarkar 2019 literature values of r log kp lm and d for different dyes used in meuf are shown in table 5 3 4 membrane selection selection of suitable membrane is the key to successful separation by meuf various polymeric ultrafiltration uf membranes with varying in mwco of 1 100 kda made of ca rc pes ps pvdf pa and activated carbon loaded pes etc were used in meuf study for the treatment of dye effluent most of the meuf studies were carried out using 10 kda membrane huang et al 2010 2014 ahmad et al 2006 zaghbani et al 2009b however few meuf studies were conducted using lower cut off uf membrane purkait et al 2004a 2004b majewska nowak et al 2006 and higher cut off uf membrane schwarze et al 2018 verma and sarkar 2019 bielska and szymanowski 2006 samal et al 2017a 2017b meuf with the smaller surfactant aggregates required a lower mwco of the membrane to achieve a high pollutant removal efficiency however lower mwco membrane resulted in low permeate flux and accordingly the less efficient for practical applications the cost the membrane could be reduced if high flux could be achieved with desired removal efficiency thus for larger size of surfactant aggregate one could take the advantages of using higher mwco membrane in meuf process for selection of appropriate membrane technical performance of the membrane was investigated in terms of permeation rate and solute removal efficiency in several meuf studies verma and sarkar 2019 carried out meuf experiments with different flat sheet polymeric uf membranes 5 30 kda for the treatment of wastewater containing both cv and cd ii fig 5 they observed that the 30 kda membrane showed the highest permeation rate but gave the lowest rejections of both cv 96 and cd ii 95 while 5 kda and 10 kda membranes showed maximum rejection 99 for both the pollutants but with low permeate flux based on the experimental data they preferred 20 kda membrane as the most suitable membrane for further studies in another meuf studies with carboxylate surfactants and four different cellulose membranes 5 10 30 and 100 kda for removal of mb authors reported that considering both the mb removal 95 and the flux the 30 kda membrane was the most suitable schwarze et al 2018 in another meuf studies with saponin surfactants and different flat sheet pes membranes 10 50 kda for removal of methyl violet 10 kda membrane was found to be most appropriate on the basis of solvent permeation rate and maximum retention of mv 99 and sap 70 8 samal et al 2017b 3 5 optimization of meuf feed conditions feed condition shows a significant effect on the process performance of meuf and hence the optimization of feed composition is essential in order to improve the pollutant removal efficiency after obtaining the optimal feed condition further meuf experiments are usually conducted with the optimal feed under various hydrodynamic parameters to observe their effects on permeation rate and removal efficiency and thus to obtain the most suitable operating conditions of meuf process there have been few attempts to model and optimize the feed conditions using response surface methodology rsm particularly in the application of meuf xiarchos et al 2008 landaburu aguirrea et al 2010 landaburu aguirre et al 2011 verma and sarkar 2019 the rsm enables the evaluation of the effects of different process variables and their interactions on desirable dependent variables responses the statistical significance of the proposed model is determined by anova based on fisher test and the coefficients of each model are statistically analysed with p values several statistical parameters of the proposed model such as regression coefficients the determination coefficient and the coefficient of variance are evaluated the desirability function approach is generally employed in the optimization process and eigenvalue analysis evaluates the nature of optimal condition in the meuf studies verma and sarkar 2019 applied rsm with full factorial central composite design for experimental design with four independent variables and three responses to obtain the optimal meuf feed conditions ph feed concentrations of surfactant cv and cd ii in order to ensure a maximum value of solvent flux and rejection coefficient of both the pollutants simultaneously the authors reported that the optimal meuf feed conditions were successfully validated experimentally and predicted the values of solvent flux and rejection of both pollutants using the developed second order polynomial models with high overall desirability function of 0 94 verma and sarkar 2019 in another meuf studies for removing cu ii from aqueous stream the maximum removal efficiency of 98 4 was achieved at the optimal feed conditions of ph 7 36 sds cu ii molar ratio 7 85 sds concentration 6 82 kg m 3 xiarchos et al 2008 rsm with face centred composite design was successfully applied to understand the effect of concentration polarization phenomenon as well as the effects of the process parameters on solvent flux and removal efficiency of zn ii and cd ii during meuf the maximum retentions achieved were 98 0 0 4 for zn ii and 99 0 0 4 for cd ii under the optimal surfactant to metal molar ratio of 27 8 and 28 4 for removal of zn ii of 0 5 mm and cd ii of 0 5 mm respectively landaburu aguirrea et al 2010 3 6 effects of various parameters on solvent flux and rejection 3 6 1 effect of mixed surfactant the use of mixed surfactants of ionic and nonionic surfactants was investigated in meuf with the aim of improving process performance by lowering the cmc value reducing the surfactant leakage with the permeate stream and to get maximum economic and environmental benefits bielska nad szymanowski 2006 studied the application of non ionic surfactant omc 10 in micellar media of an anionic sds surfactant for the removal of mb from aqueous solution the addition of omc 10 surfactant to sds solution led to a 4 fold decrease in cmc value of mixed micelles from 2 3 to 0 57 kg m 3 for the surfactant mixture of omc 10 sds 1 4 the authors revealed that the tailored surfactant mixture was able to remove 93 94 of mb using a hydrophilic cellulose membrane 15 30 kda with initial feed dye concentration of 0 0005 0 005 kg m 3 and total surfactant concentration equal to 5 cmc similar result was also reported by huang et al 2014 where binary mixture of sds and non ionic tx 100 surfactant was used in meuf for concurrent removal of mb and cd ii from aqueous stream with the fixed feed concentration of mb cd ii and sds and varying the surfactant molar ratios of tx 100 to sds from 0 1 to 0 8 meuf experiments were performed in a hollow fiber module using 10 kda polysulfone membrane it was reported that 99 40 and 98 06 removal efficiency can be achieved for mb and cd ii respectively with the best molar ratio tx 100 to sds of 0 3 for mb and 0 5 for cd ii in another study the use of mixed surfactants of anionic sds and nonionic tx 100 and np12 surfactants effectively enhanced the rejection of pb ii ions and surfactants yenphan et al 2010 the rejection of pb ii ions when using anionic sds surfactant was found quite high about 92 compared to non ionic surfactants such as tx 100 about 9 18 and np12 about 30 37 at the optimal mole fraction 1 37 mm of tx 100 and np12 with 12 3 mm of sds the rejections of pb ii were obtained as 98 4 and 98 7 respectively with high rejections of sds 80 tx 100 and np12 99 permeate flux values of sds np12 system were slightly higher than those of sds tx 100 system in another study the cmc of sds npe was found to decrease from 8 mm pure sds to less than 1 mm upon addition of npe the rejection of cr iii was 98 5 for the pure sds micelles however in mixed micelle sds npe systems rejection of cr iii remained high and practically constant at 99 5 with the npe mole fraction of 0 2 aoudia et al 2003 3 6 2 effect of surfactant concentration the surfactant concentration in feed showed significant influence on permeation rate and solute removal efficiency meuf experiments were usually conducted with feed surfactant concentration at cmc below cmc and above cmc value according to zaghbani et al 2007 during cross flow meuf of mb from aqueous solution using 10 kda regenerated cellulose membrane the retention of mb was found to be 97 at sds concentrations below its cmc value at which theoretically no micelles were present the unanticipated high retention of mb was explained by i the adsorption of mb molecules onto membrane surface and in the membrane pores ii the adsorption of precipitates mb sds onto the membrane surface resulting from reaction between cationic mb and anionic sds surfactant iii the build up of surfactant molecules near the membrane surface caused to exceed the cmc value of surfactant thus forming surfactant aggregates in that region which would probably solubilize some mb molecules yenphan et al 2010 due to convective transport the mb sds precipitates and micelles accumulated near the membrane surface and tended to form a layer which offered an additional resistance to solvent flow leading to decrease in solvent permeation rate as reported by authors that the retention of mb increased to 97 8 with decrease in solvent permeation from 200 to 160 l m 2 h 1 when feed sds concentration increased to 5 2 kg m 3 zaghbani et al 2007 the flux reduction was explained by the reason that by adding surfactants above the cmc value the surfactant micelles formed a deposited layer onto the membrane surface and consequently increased the resistance towards transport similar result was also reported by huang et al 2010 they observed that about 99 mb removal efficiency was achieved when the feed sds concentration was less than its cmc value of 2 3 kg m 3 however mb removal efficiency decreased from 99 34 to 95 19 on increasing feed sds concentration from 2 3 to 20 8 kg m 3 the significant drop in the mb removal efficiency was attributed to i the leakage of some mb solubilized sds aggregates through the membrane because of the wide pore size distribution of ultrafiltration membrane ii change in micellar shape at high surfactant concentration that allowed some of the micelles to easily pass through the membrane pores in another meuf studies ahmad et al 2006 investigated the application of cationic cpc surfactant for removal of reactive dyes rb5 and ro16 from an aqueous solution using 10 kda polymeric membrane and reported that 99 7 and 99 6 of dye rejections for rb5 and ro16 dye respectively could be achieved using cpc surfactant the flux values were observed as a decreasing function of the surfactant concentration the solvent flux decreased from 23 8 to 23 2 l m 2 h 1 and 26 6 to 23 4 l m 2 h 1 for rb5 and for ro16 respectively with the rise in cpc concentration from 0 5 to 1 0 kg m 3 ahmad et al 2006 in another meuf study the effect of molar concentration ratio of surfactant to metal s m on cu ii rejection was observed removal of cu ii could be achieved more than 90 at s m ratio of 12 7 and ph 5 with 20 mm sds juang et al 2010 3 6 3 effect of electrolyte in most of the dye industries inorganic salts are commonly used with varying concentration thus in reality dye wastewater always contains ionic salt in various amounts zaghbani et al 2008 therefore the effect of ionic salt nacl na2so4 na2hpo4 etc concentration on extent of solubilization as well as removal of dye has been investigated with increase in electrolyte more micelles are formed with increase in aggregation number and micelle volume resulting from decrease in the cmc value this is known as salt effect the presence of electrolyte in the ionic surfactant solutions decreases the extent of solubilization of polar solutes but increases that of non polar solutes polar solutes are generally solubilized in the outer periphery of the palisade layer while non polar solutes are solubilized in the inner core of the micelle zaghbani et al 2008 the h bonding or dipole dipole attraction is the possible interaction between the polar groups of solubilizate and surfactant huang et al 2010 on increasing the nacl concentrations from 0 6 to 29 2 kg m 3 a slight decrease in retention of st cationic dye was observed during meuf with sds surfactant this was explained by the low solubilization of st within the micelle zaghbani et al 2008 also a slight increase in solubilization and then retention of mb upon increasing the nacl concentrations from 0 to 5 8 kg m 3 was reported in another meuf studies zaghbani et al 2009a similar trend was also observed in case of db71 with increasing nacl concentration from 0 to 29 2 kg m 3 zaghbani et al 2009b huang et al 2014 reported that the rejection of mb remained almost independent on the increase of nacl concentration similar trend was also reported by zaghbani et al 2009a during removal of ebbr from wastewater using meuf they suggested that the solubilization of ebbr might occur in the region between the core and the surface of n alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromide micelles the effect of addition of electrolyte on the solvent permeation was also reported in most of the meuf studies for dye removal solvent permeation rate was found to decrease with increase in electrolyte concentration the flux decline was attributed to the formation and deposition of large fraction of surfactant aggregates at higher electrolyte concentration and increasing subsequent membrane fouling this caused to an increase in resistance to solvent flow resulting a decline in solvent permeation rate ahmad et al 2006 zaghbani et al 2009a 2009b 3 6 4 effect of ph the solution ph showed an important role in the process performance the variation of solution ph did not show any noticeable change in the retention of mb during meuf conducted at fixed sds and mb dye concentration of 32 10 3 kg m 3 and 14 4 kg m 3 respectively for a ph range of 2 11 the retention of mb remained almost constant close to 99 for the whole range of operating ph zaghbani et al 2007 similar observation was reported by zaghbani et al 2009a for the cpc ebbr system for a ph range of 2 13 the retention of ebbr remained almost constant near 99 for meuf study conducted at fixed cpc and ebbr dye concentrations of 416 10 3 kg m 3 and 0 73 kg m 3 respectively in case of separation db71 by c16tab the dye retention was near 98 with enhancement in solvent permeation rate from 50 to 110 l m 2 h 1 with rise of ph 1 8 to 12 4 zaghbani et al 2009b the flux enhancement with increase in ph was explained by the more hydrophilic nature of rc membrane resulting from deprotonation of carboxylic group present in its active layer zaghbani et al 2009a however other researchers reported the different trend in the meuf of cv from aqueous solution variation of solution ph showed substantial effect on the retention of cv as well as permeate flux verma et al 2020 the authors observed that with increasing ph from 6 5 to 10 5 the rejection efficiency of cv increased linearly reached a maximum a value of about 99 at ph 8 5 and then slightly dropped to 98 at ph 10 5 at low ph values the linear increase of cv rejection was attributed to increase in surface charge and cmc value of rhl thus favouring the cv adsorption at higher ph values 8 5 the decrease in cv rejection was attributed to decrease in average size of rhl vesicle resulting in decrease in vesicle solubilization capability similar effect of ph was observed on cd ii rejection efficiency ke et al 2007 reported that during meuf with sds as surfactant the cd ii rejection efficiency increased sharply with the increase of ph 9 after that up to ph 13 no significant change was observed another study demonstrated the effect of ph on the solubilization of cationic mb and anionic ey dyes into the saponin micelles samal et al 2017a authors observed a slight decrease in solubilization of ey dye with increasing ph they explained the observation by the hypothesis that at the lower ph the surface of saponin micelles might have protonated which increased the adsorption of anionic ey dye resulting in higher solubilization of ey dye the acidic nature of saponin caused to decrease in dye solubilization with the rise in solution ph the solubilization of mb was found to increase with ph up to ph 7 then started decreasing at lower ph there was a strong competition between h ions and positively charged mb dye molecules to get adsorbed at the micelle surface at higher ph the decrease in concentration of h ions in solution possibly increased the adsorption of mb on saponin micelles 3 6 5 effect of transmembrane pressure another important operating aspect that significantly influenced the solvent flux and solute removal efficiency is the transmembrane pressure it was generally observed in meuf studies that with rise in operating pressure the permeation of both solute and solvent through the membrane increased in the region of low operating pressure pressure controlled region a linear flux pressure relationship was observed with increase in pressure because of less effect of solute concentration boundary layer and membrane fouling the enhanced driving force due to increase in pressure overcame the developed osmotic pressure and the fouling resistance thus permeating more solvent through the membrane resulting in higher solvent flux at higher pressure flux enhancement became gradual and flux reached an asymptotic value ke et al 2007 the asymptotic flux pressure relationship was due to severe concentration polarization caused by convective transport of more micelles towards the membrane surface followed by viscous and gel type layer formation in this region mass transfer controlled flux was controlled by the rate of solute transfer from the gel layer solution interface into the bulk liquid moreover at high pressure the fouling layer got compacted and becomes less permeable the decreasing dye rejection was thought to occur due to the following two reasons micelles got compacted at higher operating pressure thereby decreasing solubilization capacity of micelle increase in permeation of unsolubilized dye through the ultrafiltration membrane led to higher permeate dye concentration thus lowering the dye rejection evidence for this explanation was demonstrated elsewhere huang et al 2010 ke et al 2007 the research reported that with increase in δp from 10 to 90 kpa solvent flux improved by 2 3 fold and the rejection of mb and sds decreased from 99 62 to 98 96 and 62 5 to 57 84 respectively during meuf of mb from aqueous solution using a hollow fiber ps membrane carried out at fixed mb and sds concentrations of 6 10 3 kg m 3 and 2 3 kg m 3 respectively huang et al 2010 similar finding has been reported in another meuf study where reactive dyes rb5 and ro16 were removed by meuf using cationic cpc surfactant and 10 kda membrane ahmad et al 2006 the experimental results showed that an increase in δp from 300 to 400 kpa resulted to drop in dye rejection efficiency from 97 to 91 1 and 98 8 to 97 4 for rb5 and ro16 dye respectively with about 23 improvement in solvent flux during meuf of mv from aqueous stream using sap biosurfactant with increase in δp from 150 to 350 kpa about 19 of improvement of solvent flux was observed samal et al 2017b however in their study retention of both mv and sap remained almost invariant with applied pressure suggesting that the retention of dye in the separation process was governed by the solubilization mechanism further for removal of cd ii using meuf with sds surfactant ke et al 2007 reported that permeation flux increased linearly with the increase of the transmembrane pressure below 0 08 mpa beyond 0 08 mpa the flux reached an asymptotic value as the transmembrane pressure increased however transmembrane pressure had no significant effect on the cd ii rejection as the ultrafiltration membrane could not reject free ions under the transmembrane pressure studied in another meuf study for removal of cr vi with cpc as surfactant a linear permeate flux pressure relationship was observed for the range of pressure studied from 376 to 716 kpa with 99 8 retention of cr vi ions ghosh and bhattacharya 2006 3 6 6 effect of cross flow velocity effect of feed cross flow velocity on dye rejection and solvent permeation rate was observed in meuf studies samal et al 2017b verma et al 2020 increasing feed cross flow velocity caused to decrease in concentration polarization due to enhanced forced convection this led to an enhancement in mass transfer coefficient and thereby increasing solvent permeation rate the removal of dye remained unchanged by the rise in cross flow velocity the retention mv and sap were observed almost unaffected 99 on increasing feed flow rate 0 5 1 2 lpm suggesting that the extent of micellar solubilization is independent of increasing feed flow rate the solvent flux increased slightly from 3 7 to 4 25 l m 2 h 1 with the same increment of feed flow rate because of reduction in consolidated gel layer resistance samal et al 2017b similar trends were observed in another meuf investigation for removal of cv using rhl biosurfactant verma et al 2020 where the solvent flux augmented from 20 to 26 l m 2 h 1 at end of 40 min filtration however there was no significant change in cv rejection 99 5 in the range of feed velocity from 75 to 150 l h 1 3 6 7 effect of temperature in general increasing temperature led to higher solvent permeation flux in both the mass transfer governed region and in the pressure governed region the enhancement of solvent permeation rate with the rise in temperature in pressure governed region was attributed to its effect on fluid viscosity μ density ρ and solute diffusivity d together all these effects lead to an enhancement in mass transfer coefficient k as k α d 0 67 μ ρ n where n 0 47 for turbulent flow and zero for laminar flow cheryan 2016 thus backward diffusion of micelle dye aggregates increased because of increasing diffusivity moreover at higher temperature the reduction in solution viscosity increased the solute forced convection verma et al 2020 reported that with the rise in temperature from 26 to 40 c solvent flux increased by about 15 at the end of filtration keeping other operating conditions unchanged also cv rejection was not significantly influenced by the feed temperature therefore meuf was best to operate at the maximum possible feed temperature consistent with the permissible limit of the membrane cheryan 2016 3 7 assessment of membrane fouling and transport modelling in meuf the major disadvantage of any meuf process is the membrane fouling indeed membrane fouling results in increased operating costs due to higher energy consumption additional labor for maintenance cleaning chemical costs shorter membrane self life and frequent membrane replacement several techniques have been proposed in literature to reduce membrane fouling during meuf such as i using optimal dosage of surfactant for obtaining desired removal efficiency verma and sarkar 2019 ii increasing turbulence shearing force in the flow channel cheryan 2016 iii applying external electric field across the membrane akay and wakeman 1996 sarkar et al 2009 iv using fouling resistant uf membranes with minimum surfactant pollutant adsorption and v developing efficient cleaning protocol chen et al 2020 etc however membrane fouling cannot be completely prevented according to literature membrane fouling mechanisms can be divided in several types such as i adsorptive fouling ii pore blocking iii formation of cake gel type layer over the membrane surface the most important consequence of membrane fouling is the decline in permeate flux with filtration time fig 6 therefore for any meuf process understanding of membrane fouling identification of appropriate fouling mechanism and development of model for prediction of permeate flux seem to be very important and complex research topic various models have been developed to explain the flux reduction during meuf huang et al 2010 zaghbani et al 2007 purkait et al 2004a parakala et al 2019 verma and sarkar 2020 verma et al 2020 model equations associated with various parameters along with assumptions are shown in table 6 during meuf of mb from dye wastewater using sds surfactant huang et al 2010 applied the classical resistance model eq 29 to estimate the additional fouling resistance at sds concentrations below the cmc value membrane fouling was assumed to be caused by the combination of three reasons a adsorption of mb dye on the surface and or in pores of membrane b reaction between mb and sds to form precipitates on the membrane surface c effect of severe concentration polarization resulted in the deposition of mb sds surfactant aggregates on the membrane surface at sds concentrations above cmc value the deposited layer of sds mb aggregates offered more resistance against solvent flux through the membrane in their study the calculated osmotic pressure was not high enough compared to operating transmembrane pressure to justify the flux decline and hence neglected similarly for removal of mb from aqueous solution by sds based meuf zaghbani et al 2007 used classical resistance in series model eq 30 where total resistance to solvent flow accounted for membrane resistance adsorption fouling resistance concentration polarization resistance and cake layer resistance due to accumulation of dye surfactant aggregates on the membrane surface in another meuf study for removal of mb from aqueous stream parakala et al 2019 used a modified resistance in series model eq 31 to predict permeate flux the authors considered the concentration polarization resistance rp as an additional resistance to solvent flow which included the effects of mean solute concentration within the thin concentration boundary layer and the transmembrane pressure knowing the experimental average permeate flux value feed concentration and operating pressure they estimated and reported three model parameters namely intrinsic membrane resistance rm mass transfer coefficient k and specific resistance coefficient αo for various feed dye concentrations it is worthy to mention here that in most of the meuf studies for the treatment of dye containing wastewater it is observed that there is a rapid drop in permeation rate at the beginning of filtration 3 6 min followed by gradual decline in permeate flux purkait et al 2004a verma and sarkar 2019 verma et al 2020 identification of appropriate fouling mechanism and modelling of permeate flux decline during meuf process is essential and meaningful for the design selection of membrane appropriate operating conditions membrane module configuration etc and scale up purposes usually no individual fouling mechanisms are capable of explaining the flux decline behaviour with time prevailing throughout the filtration being necessary to apply more than one fouling mechanism in this regard combined model was developed and successfully applied to analyse flux decline behaviour during both dead end or cross flow meuf involved in the application of dye wastewater purkait et al 2004a performed an unstirred batch meuf study for the treatment of eosin dye contaminated aqueous solution with aim to explain the flux decline behaviour under various operation conditions based on their investigated experimental flux profiles fig 7 they divided the filtration experiment into two time regions the fouling mechanisms consisted of two consecutive steps were proposed for analysing flux decline during the entire course of operation the transition time t1 of shifting fouling mechanism was obtained from the observation of experimental flux profiles resistance in series model in conjunction with classical filtration theory was used for analysis of flux reduction they developed a two step flux decline model based on resistance series theory considering for simultaneous reversible pore blockage and gel type formation all the developed model equations eqs 28 31 and model parameters were shown in table 5 the effects of pore blocking were included in the fouling resistance rpb of the equation of permeate flux eq 28 by an empirical equation eq 30 in terms of two model parameters b and c the value of permeate flux or the magnitude of the pore blocking resistance after completion of pore blocking was indicated by the model parameter b while the rate of flux decline or the rate of the growth of the magnitude of the pore blocking resistance was indicated by model parameter c both the model parameters were found to be dependent of transmembrane pressure and feed concentration the long term flux decline was expressed by eq 29 in terms of dimensionless gel layer resistance r g as expressed by eq 31 the specific gel layer resistance α was defined as the resistance to flow per unit thickness of gel layer and found to be dependent of transmembrane pressure and feed concentration juang et al 2010 after evaluation of all the model parameter the proposed model successfully predicted both short term and long term flux decline profiles for various operating parameters the results showed that rpb and rg were strong function of transmembrane pressure and feed surfactant concentration both the values of rpb and rg were found more at higher pressure and at surfactant feed concentration this was attributed to the increasing rate of transport of smaller micelles toward the membranes surface by forced convection and block the membrane pores to a great extent also the specific gel resistance showed an increasing function of pressure giving to more resistance to the solvent flow the values of rpb and rg were 10 30 and 30 50 of the total resistance respectively for various transmembrane pressure and feed cpc concentration under investigation in another studies meuf was applied for i removal of cv dye and ii concurrent removal of cv dye and cd ii ions from aqueous stream using pes membrane and rhamnolipid as the biosurfactant verma and sarkar 2019 verma et al 2020 in both the investigations authors observed similar flux decline behaviour figs 8 and 9 the initial flux reduction in the first 3 6 min of filtration due to adsorption pore blocking was about 70 80 of the total flux reduction resistance in series theory in conjunction with hermia s cake filtration model was used to explain flux decline profiles verma and sarkar 2019 verma et al 2020 the hydrophobic interactions between the ionic aggregates and charged polymer led to solute adsorption on the membrane surface the gradual decline in solvent flux was assumed to be due to developing cake gel type layer of the surfactant dye aggregates on the membrane surface based on the nature of flux profiles they divided the duration of meuf filtration experiment into two stages t t 1 and t t 1 all the developed model equations eqs 32 38 associated with model parameters were shown in table 5 hermia s model applied to dead end filtration and cross flow filtration were represented by eq 34 and eq 35 respectively where kc was the cake layer fouling coefficient they also developed the expression of transition time t1 of onset of cake formation for both the filtration mode as represented by eq 37 38 shown in table 5 knowing the value of intrinsic membrane resistance rm from pure water flux v w 0 the three model parameters rfm kf and kc in the model eqs 32 38 were estimated predicted values of permeate flux showed good agreement with the experimental permeate flux to confirm the solute adsorption on the membrane surface balance value bv was generally calculated by eq 39 schwarze et al 2018 and accordingly adsorption fouling was incorporated into the transport modelling high value of bp indicated for stronger adsorption of solute on the membrane surface during operation model parameters and transition time of fouling mechanism for various operating conditions were estimated for dead end filtration verma and sarkar 2020 as well as for cross flow meuf verma et al 2020 their study demonstrated that the value of kf increased with increase of pressure and feed surfactant concentration while it decreased with feed temperature and stirrer speed verma and sarkar 2020 an increase of δp from 276 to 690 kpa and feed rhl concentration from 584 10 3 to 2920 10 3 kg m 3 resulted in an increase of kf value from 1 08 10 2 s 1 to 2 4 10 2 s 1 and 1 2 10 2 to 1 8 10 2 s 1 respectively the value of kf decreased from 1 3 10 2 s to 0 9 10 2 s 1 and 1 75 10 2 to 1 3 10 2 s 1 when temperature and stirrer speed increased from 26 to 40 c and 200 600 rpm respectively the value of kc showed an increasing function of feed surfactant concentration and salt concentration while showed a decreasing function of pressure temperature and stirrer speed verma and sarkar 2020 an increase in operating δp from 276 to 690 kpa temperature from 26 to 40 c and stirrer speed from 200 to 600 rpm resulted to decrease in kc value from 2 105 s m 2 to 1 34 105 s m 2 from 1 6 105 s m 2 to 1 0 105 s m 2 and from 2 6 105 s m 2 to 1 6 105 s m 2 respectively on the other hand increasing feed rhl concentration from 584 10 3 to 2920 10 3 kg m 3 and nacl concentration from 5 to 30 kg m 3 the value of kc increased from 1 4 105 s m 2 to 1 98 105 s m 2 from 1 56 105 s m 2 to 2 1 105 s m 2 respectively the onset of cake formation was found to be operating condition dependent with increase in transmembrane pressure and feed surfactant concentration transition time decreased while on increasing stirrer speed transition time increased the authors also noticed that the initial adsorptive fouling resistance rf contributed 11 5 35 9 of the total resistance while cake layer resistance rc contributed 10 8 21 6 of total resistance for further detailed information see ref verma and sarkar 2020 huang et al 2010 also used the resistance model eq 26 to analyse permeate flux and fouling resistances during meuf studies on mb contaminated aqueous solution using a hollow fibre membrane in their analysis contribution of osmotic pressure was neglected they reported an increase in fouling resistance from 0 48 1012 to 40 1012 m 1 with feed sds concentration increasing from 0 to 23 kg m 3 3 8 simultaneous removal of heavy metal ions and dyes in reality dye wastewaters do not contain a single pollutant instead a mixture of pollutants particularly heavy metal ions and dyes thus the co existence of pollutants in dye effluent worldwide is a frequent occurrence the simultaneous removal of multiple co existing pollutants using meuf process has already become the focus of recent studies only a few studies were reported for concurrent treatment of pollutants from dye wastewater using meuf zeng et al 2011 huang et al 2014 verma and sarkar 2019 2020 simultaneous removal of typically co existing pollutants such as cadmium ion and mb from wastewater was investigated using meuf by single sds surfactant zeng et al 2011 and by a binary mixture of sds and tx 100 huang et al 2014 zeng et al 2011 demonstrated that in the presence of mb the maximum 98 4 removal efficiency of cd ii was achieved with 2 3 kg m 3 1 cmc of sds which was slightly more compared to single cd ii removal efficiency on the other hand in presence of cd ii the removal efficiencies of mb were more than 96 5 which was about 3 4 less than the maximum removal efficiency achieved in the single mb removal process thus experimental results revealed the absence of competition between cd ii and mb for solubilizing and or adsorbing into the sds micelles suggesting that simultaneous removal mb and cd ii was feasible with no interference zeng et al 2011 in another meuf studies it was observed that the coexistence of mb and cd ii would help the rejection of each other huang et al 2014 the presence of cd ii in the solution increased the d value of mb by decreasing the cmc value of surfactants but lm and kb values of mb for sds micelles remained unchanged the presence of mb increased the d value of cd ii with little influence on lm value of sds micelles the best removal efficiency for mb and cd ii was achieved as 99 40 and 98 06 respectively huang et al 2014 in another meuf study using rhl biosurfactant verma and sarkar 2020 reported that for the treatment of binary system of cd ii and cv the maximum rejection efficiencies of the pollutants were found to be 98 4 and 98 7 respectively thus meuf showed promising for simultaneous removal of co existing pollutants from dye wastewater 3 9 recovery of surfactant the retentate stream of meuf contains high concentrated surfactant and pollutants dyes and or heavy metal ions rejected by the membrane will cause secondary pollution thus the recovery and reuse the surfactant from the concentrate retentate stream is very important to make the meuf process cost effective and to reduce the secondary pollution there are several methods are reported in literature such as precipitation by addition of counter ion acidification method alkaline treatment foam fractionation technique decreasing temperature less than kriff point electrochemical treatment solvent extraction and two step chemical treatment etc the surfactant was precipitated using mono multivalent counterions having opposite charge of the surfactant the addition of cacl2 in greater than its stoichiometric value caused precipitation of significant amount of anionic sds surfactant as calcium dodecyl sulfate cds however cds being less soluble in water could not be directly reused to the process thus cds was converted to its sodium salt by adding na2co3 and re dissolved in water for reuse brant et al 1989 in another method 6n naoh was added into the retentate stream containing metal ions except for sr ii to precipitate sds which was removed by centrifuge and then recovered sds was reused in meuf juang et al 2003 in this method about 45 55 of sds was precipitated and the efficiency of removing metal ions with the recycled sds was within 50 58 implying a certain degree of the feasibility of repeatedly use of sds the acidification method was the simplest and most efficient method for surfactant recovery from the retentate stream and showed good results in many studies in this method about 58 1 of sds was recovered from the retentate stream using sulphuric acid ph 1 0 the removal efficiency of cd ii was found to be 88 1 with the reclaimed sds besides sds could also be recovered by lowering the temperature of the sds solution to 4 c below the reported kriff point of sds 16 c the foam fractionation method was applied to recover sds and cd 2 from the permeate stream qu et al 2008 in another study two step pre treatment methods such as 1 chelation followed by ultrafiltration and 2 acidification followed by ultrafiltration were used for removal of cd ii zn ii ions from sds micelles li et al 2009 in this method edta was reported to be the best chelating agent and h2so4 was the best acid agent the optimum ph value was 4 4 for the recovery of sds cd ii 66 5 and zn ii 68 5 further meuf treatment with the reclaimed sds resulted in removing 90 3 of cd ii and 89 6 of zn ii authors also reported that the reclaimed sds by the two step method performed better than the reclaimed sds by acidification in another recovery method the cationic cpc surfactant was recovered from the permeate stream using a two stage chemical treatment purkait et al 2004b in the first step potassium iodide ki was added to the cpc containing permeate stream with ki to cpc molar ratio of 1 1 resulting in the precipitation of cetyl pyridinium iodide cpi in the second step the water insoluble cpi was converted into a water soluble chloride by adding cupric chloride cucl2 to the precipitate cpi with 1 5 m ratio of cpi to cucl2 thus about 90 of cpc surfactant was recovered using this two stage method verma and sarkar 2019 developed a method of rhl recovery from meuf retentate solution based on alkaline treatment followed by acid precipitation and centrifugation alkaline treatment of meuf retentate rhl cv cd ii and salt at ph 9 0 using aqueous naoh solution resulted to about 99 5 recovery of cadmium ion as cadmium hydroxide acid precipitation and then centrifugation was carried out to recover rhl from the almost cadmium free supernatant under the optimum recovery conditions centrifugation speed 4755 rpm time 16 8 min ph 2 4 the maximum rhl recovery was found to be 84 1 with desirability value of 1 0 authors also reported that the rejection of cv remained almost unaffected 97 6 even after three times reuse of rhl but with slight decline in rejection of cd ii 92 the saponin surfactant was recovered from the permeate stream of meuf after removal of mv from wastewater by solvent extraction method using two solvents n butanol and n heptan samal et al 2017b their experimental results revealed that n butanol performed better than n heptane for the saponin recovery authors reported that 85 saponin recovery was achieved using 1 1 vol ratio of n butanol to aqueous reetha solution for a fixed saponin concentration of 350 10 3 kg m 3 4 conclusions and recommendations in recent decades the rapid development in industries such as dying textile printing leather paper and plastics etc have placed immense strain on water resources as these industries consume substantial volumes of water besides water shortage the contamination of water due to synthetic dyes and heavy metal ions released from these industries causes damage to the public health and has adverse effects on environment dye effluent pollution is one of the serious issues faced by several countries worldwide and has become the focus of many researchers mainly because of the voluminous polluted discharge into the environment recovery and reuse of dye wastewater show the potential to reduce water pollution significantly and thus partly solving the water resource crisis therefore a cost effective and eco friendly separation techniques are in great demand for the treatment of wastewater containing dyes over the past decade extensive efforts have been made to remove or reduce the toxic pollutants from dye wastewater based on numerous researches carried out so far meuf has been proven to be one of the most efficient and sustainable separation processes for the treatment of dye containing waste stream but exhibits a lack of systematic literature review on the current topic this review has discussed in detail about meuf process applied to dye wastewater including current state of the art micellization membrane fouling transport modelling various factors affecting the process performance and the limitations in the literature meuf processes have the several advantages including easy to operate under continuous mode low energy requirement cost effective high process throughput reduction of secondary pollution and meeting more and more stringent environmental regulations thus improved efficiency reduced processing costs and easy handling of large volume can be of immediate benefits of employing meuf in the treatment of dye effluent presently most of the published works are still at laboratory or pilot scale level and consequently further improvements in process efficiency are still required to make meuf process a leading commercialized dye wastewater treatment system for a large scale industrial operation to the best of our knowledge the application of meuf on industrial scale water treatment plant has not been reported so far to achieve this several important issues need to be considered in the future research generally dye effluent contains a varied mixture of dyes and electrolytes application of meuf in the dye effluent containing multiple dyes and their subsequent removal are not investigated so far however meuf studies mainly have been focused on the removal of single dye from the aqueous solution the co existence of multiple dyes or dyes in presence of heavy metal ions strongly influence the micelle pollutant interaction and hence removal efficiency of both the pollutants resulting in significant batch to batch variations hence for multicomponent system containing more than one dye more meuf studies are needed for better understanding the underlying mechanisms governing competitive interactions with the micelles during simultaneous removal the appropriate selection of surfactant is crucial to achieve good removal efficiency of dyes heavy metal ions as well as to ensure the minimization of the processing cost and secondary pollution generally the isoelectric ph surface charge size and aggregation number of surfactants play important roles in removal efficiency the use of rhamnolipid biosurfactant in meuf has been applauded however rhamnolipid has not been fully exploited for different dye systems further investigation is required on various types of biosurfactant synthesized from diverse feedstock to actually know the best biosurfactant that can effectively treat dye wastewater the use of some chemically synthesized surfactant having low cmc value and large micelle size in meuf has also been appreciated identification of more such surfactants and their applications in meuf are needed so far most of the meuf studies have been carried out on the short term feasibility of improvement methods for the duration of maximum 120 min operation but rarely investigated how the process performs over longer time periods which is necessary to verify the findings obtained in short term experiments for large scale industrial operation a long term performance of the meuf system needs to be systematically carried out for the purpose of minimizing membrane fouling prediction of flux decline and prolonging the membrane shelf life as well as increasing the overall process efficiency also economic competitiveness of meuf process need to be emphasized the complex nature of real dye effluent urges for a technologically sound and economically feasible separation technique comprehensive review of the current research revealed that most of the meuf studies for treatment of dye wastewater were carried out on synthetic wastewater however there is no meuf study reported on real dye wastewater thus scientific demonstration membrane fouling transport modelling and cost analysis studies using real dye wastewater samples are required very few scientific reports are available on the integration of meuf process with other technologies there are still more rooms for integration of meuf processes with other established separation techniques as an integrated separation process to produce high water throughput for industrial reuse declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

11826,arsenic as is a ubiquitous carcinogen element occurring due to geogenic and anthropogenic actions and posing major global public health concerns this review work significantly summarized the current state of knowledge for arsenic contaminated water treatment firstly this paper insight a brief understanding of arsenic speciation toxicity and accumulation in the food chain and secondly explains the adsorption techniques for as remediation from the contaminated water arsenic adsorption using biochar based sorbents is summarized as an efficient and economically feasible approach biochars renewable carbonaceous and sustainable materials synthesized through pre post pyrolysis treatment of biomass under limited oxygen supply conditions resulting in high surface area dual porosity surface charge and enhanced functional groups thirdly this review discusses various factors such as acidic ph initial concentration biochar dose co existing ions and temperature including regeneration and reusability of biochar based sorbents arsenic adsorption increases at 2 6 ph and decreases until ph 10 in aqueous solution ph influenced as species as h2aso4 and haso4 2 dominate in the range of 3 6 ph and aso4 3 are primarily present in alkaline solution thus electrostatic interactions and surface complexation are dominating mechanisms occurring at arsenic biochar interfaces in aqueous solutions lastly mechanistic understanding for arsenic adsorption onto biochar materials has been discussed considering equilibrium adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis in conclusion this review also highlighted major challenges and future scope relevant for implications of biochar sorbents in continuous flow systems to scale up for commercial and industrial purposes

exceeds above allowable limit because of their toxicity behaviour persistence and accumulation in the environment chiban et al 2016 gashkina et al 2020 xie et al 2020 arsenic as being metalloid has atomic number 33 belongs to the nitrogen family arsenic is 12th 14th and 20th most abundant in human seawater and earth s crust respectively mandal and suzuki 2002 munoz and palmero 2005 liu et al 2006 according to the agency for toxic substance and disease registry arsenic is the first among 20 highly hazardous carcinogen substances choubisa 1997 as occurs in four oxidation states like 3 as

generally soils are contaminated with arsenic due to fertilizer pesticides mining and smelting burning of fossil fuel incineration of wastes and use of sludge geogenically soils are significantly contaminated due to weathering of parent rock and minerals containing arsenic nriagu et al 2007 around 150 million people worldwide are affected severely due to high doses of arsenic consumption mainly through as enriched groundwater or foods in developing countries like india bangladesh and pakistan the permissible limit for arsenic is 50 μg l due to treatment performance and analytical

altundoğan et al 2002 imran et al 2021 wen et al 2021 among them adsorption is the most efficient and promising technique for as remediation and other toxic contaminants from polluted soil and water ecosystems in the adsorption method various adsorbents such as activated charcoal carbon activated alumina zeolites clay materials metal oxides carbon nanotubes graphene based materials biochar etc have shown significant removal of as species samsuri et al 2013 yao et al 2014 alam et al 2018 biochar being a renewable carbon material has been extensively applied to remove as species with excellent adsorption capacities at low costs with the advancement in material science and technology biochar based materials are being modified with various metal salts like fecl3 mncl4 alcl3 and feso4 tian et al 2011 zhang and gao 2013 zhou et al 2014 and acids like h2so4 hcl and hno3 liu et al 2010 abid et al 2016 ding et al 2018 red mud wu et al 2017 for further enhancement in adsorption efficiencies of as species significant research gaps have been observed in previously published reviews of arsenic removal using biochar in previously published work the application of different biochar based materials including their isotherms kinetics thermodynamics reusability and sustainability and factors affecting the adsorption have not been discussed for the arsenic removal vithanage et al 2017 siddiq et al 2021 srivastav et al 2021 thus a comprehensive literature review on arsenic removal from past decades is required to highlight the current state of knowledge using biochar based materials present review work summarizes as speciation toxicity and their accumulation in the environment along with implications of different remediation techniques and adsorbent uses for as ions removal from contaminated water prioritizing the adsorption of arsenic ions using pristine biochar and modified biochar this review work aims to highlight the a synthes and characterization of biochar based materials b adsorption mechanisms and factors affecting the arsenic adsorption such as solution chemistry biochar dose arsenic concentration temperature and co existing ions c equilibrium isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis lastly we have also summarized the regeneration and reusability of biochar based materials for better understanding and applicability of renewable and economically viable materials for wastewater treatment processes in addition this review indicates the perspectives worth researching the arsenic remediation in the current scenario 2 advanced techniques for arsenic remediation removal of as from water is the utmost concern to provide safe drinking water for people residing in as contaminated areas visoottiviseth and ahmed 2008 on account of the above discussion various studies have been introduced for as remediation from contaminated water namely adsorption reverse osmosis oxidation precipitation coagulation ion exchange membrane filtration etc babel and kurniawan 2003 daus et al 2004 feng et al 2011 banerjee et al 2012 interestingly most of these technologies encourage efficient removal of arsenate as 5 as compared with arsenite as 3 which mainly acts as neutral at ph below 9 2 and therefore as iii is less accessible for adsorption ion exchange and precipitation johnston et al 2001 apart from removing as these methods can also remove other compounds elements such as colour bacteria phosphate hardness fluoride manganese turbidity odour etc johnston et al 2001 singh 2007 however these techniques have limitations for example high cost of resin high tech operation and maintenance sludge disposal and production of toxic wastes mohan and pittman 2007a b large plant area high operational and maintenance costs high energy and capital investment are limitations for conventional technologies bora and dutta 2014 new technology with high efficiency multi functionality high flexibility and regenerative capacity is needed qu et al 2013b nanotechnology offers the potential to develop alternative novel materials for the wastewater treatment qu et al 2013b therefore nanomaterials like carbon materials nanocomposites inorganic nanoparticles etc have potential to remediate heavy metals from contaminated water fuertes et al 2007 domínguez domínguez et al 2008 carabineiro et al 2013 kango et al 2013 these particles possess improved properties such as activated catalytic electrical optical and magnetic characteristics along with high surface area porosity electro potential charges functional groups etc as compared to bulk material of similar composition sarkar et al 2012 qu et al 2013a van tran et al 2020 several nanomaterials based adsorbents performed well for as removal such as activated charcoal carbon zhang et al 2007 oliveira et al 2008 asadullah et al 2014 yao et al 2014 activated alumina lin and wu 2001 han et al 2013 shi et al 2015 zeolites li et al 2007 baskan and

fu et al 2017 ali 2018 ma et al 2018 duoc et al 2020 graphene based materials chandra et al 2010 mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 wen et al 2013 fu et al 2017 biochar bakshi et al 2018 wei et al 2019 amen et al 2020 wan et al 2020 etc thus for as removal the adsorption process uses solid surface as a medium on which mass transfer occurs from one phase to another due to its wide range of applications high efficiency low cost sludge free and ease of operation adsorption is considered a reclamation and comprehensive technique for water defluoridation and purification singh et al 2015 3 adsorbents for removal of arsenic various other types of adsorbents including iron hydroxide coated rice straw iron modified activated carbon rice polish solid waste from the leather industry micro fibrillated cellulose modified with magnetic iron oxide for the inorganic as removal the adsorption capacity of materials is dependent on several factors such as ph temperature contact time initial concentration adsorbent dose and functional groups associated with the adsorbents mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 gallios et al 2017 bhakta and ali 2020 acidic ph favors the adsorption of as v and neutral to basic ph favors the adsorption of as iii ranjan et al 2009 hokkanen et al 2015 ouédraogo et al 2015 it is observed that as v removal is more efficient than as iii at ph lower than 7 hsu et al 2008 oh et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 gallios et al 2017 experimental conditions and adsorption efficiency of as using various absorbent materials are summarized in table 1 activated carbon possesses high ash content found to be proficient for as v removal lorenzen et al 1995 kalaruban et al 2019 non modified activated carbon namely coconut shell carbon coal based carbon and peat based extruded carbon were accessed for as v adsorption therefore at slightly acidic ph peat based extruded carbon showed maximum adsorption of 4 91 mg g compared to 2 40 and 4 01 mg g for coconut shell and coal based carbon respectively batch and column adsorption experiments were analyzed using non modified and iron incorporated granular activated carbon fe gac for as adsorption modified fe gac had an adsorption capacity of 1 43 mg g compared to non modified activated carbon with 1 03 mg g observed at ph 6 kalaruban et al 2019 besides iron oxide activated carbon magnetic composites showed enhanced adsorption characteristics and had a removal efficiency of 95 for as v ions yao et al 2014 gallios et al 2017 for example gallios et al 2017 performed as v removal using modified commercially available activated carbon with iron and manganese oxide in an aqueous solution the adsorption capacity increases up to five times for modified activated carbon from 4 to 19 35 mg g at ph 3 besides this arcibar orozco et al 2014 have found that the adsorption capacity of activated carbon depends on the morphology and textural properties of adsorbent along with point zero charges and iron content of modified activated carbon thus ligand interchange and electrostatic attraction are major mechanisms behind as v removal both bituminous iron modified activated carbon cf mp and wood based activated carbon cw mp adsorbents possess high adsorption capacities of as v for lower initial as concentration 4 mg l at ph 7 novel fe3o4 loaded activated carbon composite possessed a maximum adsorption capacity of 204 2 mg g at ph 8 with a contact time of 6 h liu et al 2010 however iron impregnated granular activated carbon showed intra particle diffusion of as v in meso micropores followed by heterogeneous adsorption having less adsorption capacity 1 01 mg g than granular activated carbon 1 43 mg g at ph 6 kalaruban et al 2019 while in the case of lanthanum impregnation jais et al 2016 synthesized bimetallic activated carbon via palm shell waste impregnated with iron followed by lanthanum arsenate adsorption increases using lanthanum impregnation over activated carbon at ph 8 due to precipitation and surface complexation at ph 8 hassan et al 2014 had synthesized three adsorbents calcium alginate activated carbon beads potassium hydroxide activated carbon based apricot stone and calcium alginate beads for as removal functional groups involved in the adsorption process are aldehyde phenol aliphatic carbon and ether calcium alginate activated carbon composite beads exhibit maximum adsorption of 66 7 mg g at ph 7 for as v ions whereas calcium alginate activated carbon beads have an adsorption capacity of 42 4 mg g hydrous iron iii oxide containing calcium ions was found with 90 arsenite removal capacity from an aqueous solution due to chelation ghosh et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 fabricated zirconium nanoparticle doped activated carbon with a maximum adsorption capacity of 21 7 mg g at ph 3 due to the ion exchange mechanism between as and modified activated carbon similarly composites of zirconium oxide on alginate beads were synthesized which showed as adsorption as the electrostatic attraction was 32 3 and 28 5 mg g for as iii and as v respectively at neutral ph kwon et al 2016 however microwave synthesized composite of iron oxide on activated charcoal showed 99 90 uptake of as within 5 min of starting the experiment due to the porous nature of the iron oxide yürüm et al 2014 in other studies deng et al 2016 synthesized hyper branched polyethyleneimine hpei modified cellulose fibers using microwave irradiation therefore adsorption capacities were 54 13 and 99 35 mg g for as iii and as v respectively at ph 8 electrostatic attraction and surface complexation are the dominating force involved in as v adsorption arsenic complexation with iron ions on the surface of zeolite is likely to be attributed adsorption process li et al 2011 had found that the iron got exchanged using natural zeolite as adsorbent during as removal from acid mine drainage water bibi et al 2015 used industrial waste namely hydrated cement marble powder and brick powder to remove as from wastewater hydrated cement showed maximum removal efficiency of 97 at ph 7 with an adsorption capacity of 1 92 mg g some of the solid wastes were considered an adsorbent for the remediation of as for example maximum removal was achieved in alkaline ph via precipitation mechanism using solid concrete waste for the removal of as v ions sasaki et al 2014 arsenic removal was also conducted using solid waste vegetable oil modified with fenton reagent jaafarzadeh et al 2012 the maximum removal efficiency up to 81 of as iii was observed at ph 2 and subsequently 75 for as v at ph 5 through an artificial neural network approach to predict as removal from an aqueous solution under various conditions besides kim et al 2020 synthesized composites of alum sludge and melamine having the capacity to oxidize as iii to as v and adsorb as v under light conditions via chemisorption red mud sorbent was also studied for as removal therefore as iii sorption was observed in favorable alkaline mediums whereas as v in acidic ph altundoğan et al 2002 wu et al 2017 numerous treated sands were utilized and experimented for as removal vaishya and gupta 2003 ramakrishna et al 2006 devi et al 2014 sand coated with iron oxide was performed to be highly effective in as adsorption sand coated with iron oxide further modified with sulfate adsorb as v at acidic ph whereas as iii is being absorbed in either neutral or slightly alkaline ph environment vaishya and gupta 2003 devi et al 2014 vaishya and gupta 2003 synthesized sulfate modified sand coated with iron oxide for as iii adsorption the maximum adsorption of 0 09 mg g was attained at ph in the range of 7 5 9 5 due to electrostatic and van der waals s force of attraction in other experiments using modified sand ramakrishna et al 2006 observed maximum removal efficiency of about 98 2 for as v and 73 2 for as iii at ph 5 similarly sand coated with iron oxide and limestone was prepared for as iii removal from water and showed maximum removal efficiency of 98 6 at ph 7 12 devi et al 2014 renewable biomass materials like yeast biomass fungal tea biomass polished rice etc have also been analyzed for adsorption of as guo and chen 2005 murugesan et al 2006 ranjan et al 2009 for example fungal tea biomass treated with fecl3 has been found effective for 100 as iii and 77 as v remediation from groundwater within less than 2 h murugesan et al 2006 similarly amino modified nano cellulose impregnated with iron oxide showed adsorption capacities of 26 and 23 6 mg g for as v and as iii respectively as surface complexation occurred in the presence of oh oh2 and o functional groups taleb et al 2016 water treatment residues entrapped in alginate beads showed ph of 3 4 and 2 9 for as iii and as v respectively under a slightly acidic ph condition ociński et al 2016 various metal oxides were observed as effective adsorbents for removal of both as iii and as v such as manganese dioxide mno2 ouvrard et al 2005 lafferty et al 2011 mishra and mahato 2016 titanium dioxide tio2 alfarawati et al 2020 du et al 2020 navarrete magaña et al 2021 iron oxides lingamdinne et al 2020 liu et al 2020 otero gonzález et al 2020 torasso et al 2021 and graphene oxides mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 chimezie et al 2017 sherlala et al 2019 rice straw modified with a coating of iron oxy hydroxide showed removal efficiency up to 95 in the ph range of 2 4 ouvrard et al 2005 the adsorption of as v on ceria incorporated manganese oxide occurs via chemisorption in a ph range of 3 7 with up to 98 removal of as v gupta et al 2011 lafferty et al 2011 applied crystalline phallomanganate for oxidation of as iii and sorption of as v in an experiment with mno2 as adsorbent for removal of coexisting as iii and as v maximum adsorption of 71 2 mno2 had occurred using the ratio of 90 μm as iii 10 μm as v ions hou et al 2017 titanium nanocomposites have high efficiency for as v removal even under acidic ph conditions and in the presence of coexisting anions like so4 cl etc du et al 2020 titanium tungsten composite for photocatalytic oxidation of as iii was made to have 99 efficiency within less than 1 h navarrete magaña et al 2021 due to functional groups like cc co c o c present on gadolinium oxide immobilized on graphene oxide adsorbent 99 removal efficiency for as v was obtained via surface complexation and electrostatic mechanism lingamdinne et al 2020 a multifunctional adsorbent resin based hydrated iron oxide showed removal capacities of 71 5 mg g for as v and 41 6 mg g for arsanilic acid at a near neutral ph liu et al 2010 cryogels of iron oxide nanocomposites have good mechanical and absorption properties for as iii by the sol gel method this cryogel can become a good candidate for making nanocomposite adsorption devices otero gonzález et al 2020 a newly synthesized membrane of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in electrospun polyvinyl alcohol pva nanofibers has shown an adsorption capacity of 52 mg g for as v torasso et al 2021 graphene oxide go was reported to be a significant material for as removal due to active sites available for adsorption on its surface zhang et al 2010 mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 chimezie et al 2017 sherlala et al 2019 magnetic graphene oxide mgo encourages the adsorption of as iii instead of as v because of oh ions surface complexes with fe3 ions sherlala et al 2019 kumar et al 2021 magnetite reduced graphene oxide fe3o4 rgo superparamagnetic material at room temperature can remove 99 of as chandra et al 2010 go impregnated with ferric oxide fe2o3 are homogeneous and amorphous composites which can remove as 95 between ph 4 to 9 the study observed over 95 as removal at various ph and residence times zhang et al 2010 maximum sorption capacities for as v and as iii observed were 142 and 139 mg g respectively at ph in the range of 6 7 using functionalized graphene sheets mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 due to functional groups graphene oxide manganese ferrite go mnfe2o4 has hydrophilic groups such as go coo and go o ions adsorption of as v on nano hybrid encourages because of the presence of oh2 functional group at ph less than 4 3 whereas at ph more than 6 5 the competition occurred because of the presence of o ions which favoured the electrostatic interactions for as iii removal kumar et al 2014 reduced graphene oxide magnetic nanocomposite rgo fe3o4 possesses electroactive surfaces with enhanced conductivity and sensitivity for high adsorption of as iii ions chimezie et al 2017 the sorption capacity of magnetic graphene materials for removal of as v was reported to be dominated by ph solution an increase in ph encourages the availability of negatively charged active sites and reduces adsorption capacity due to hindering competition of oh ions with as v huang et al 2019 4 biochar an adsorbent for arsenic removal biochar is stable and solid carbonaceous black biomass derived from biological feedstock as pyrolyzed under limited oxygen conditions tang et al 2013a zhang et al 2013 amen et al 2020 biochar helps to increase nutrient availability organic matter water retention and microbial activity increase crop yield and reduce greenhouse gas emissions woolf et al 2010 sohi 2012 weber and quicker 2018 various types of feedstocks such as distiller grain bioenergy crops grasses and willow wood chips and pellets tree bark and bagasse from the sugarcane industry dairy manure sewage sludge chicken litter olive mill waste and paper sludge have been used for the synthesis of biochar janzen 2004 johnson et al 2007 biochar is a carbon rich material that possesses high surface areas diverse functional groups and dual porosity tang et al 2015 therefore this section discusses the synthesis of biochar based materials for pristine and pre post treatment approaches regarding as removal based on previously available literature inherent properties of biochar i e surface area functional groups porosity etc are recalcitrant due to the presence of aromatic groups and consist of the ability to remediate heavy metals and toxic chemicals functional groups available on biochar surfaces play an essential role in many applications like heavy metals adsorption jia et al 2002 energy storage yaumi et al 2017 carbon sequestration zhang et al 2017 so2 adsorption shao et al 2018 metallurgical application weber and quicker 2018 catalyst guo et al 2016 and building material weber and quicker 2018 4 1 synthesis of biochar based materials biochar is a solid carbonaceous renewable compound synthesized from biomass under low oxygen or anoxic environment commonly through slow pyrolysis having temperature in the range of 300 700 c for prolonged durations leng et al 2020 biomass feedstock and various other parameters like ph temperature types of biomasses pyrolyzing conditions adsorbent dose etc possess significant impacts on the physical and chemical properties which may ultimately influence its application biomass used for biochar production consists mainly of three organic components like cellulose hemicellulose and lignin due to these components the yield and properties of biochar vary as these components behave differently during the synthesis of the biochar zhu et al 2016 hemicellulose consists of polysaccharides with branched chains the most reactive among three decomposing at a temperature between 220 and 315 c yang et al 2007 cellulose also having a polysaccharide structure is unbranched and hence more stable to decompose at a temperature range between 200 and 400 c richardson et al 2009 lignin has a wide decomposition temperature range starting with 200 900 c due to complex macromolecular structures having different types of bonds yang et al 2007 fig 1 depicts various processes performed in biochar modification either during pre or post pyrolysis for adsorption enhancement of heavy metals these modifications likely improve the physio chemical properties and surface morphology of the biochar and thus making them more efficient for adsorption processes some commonly used metal salts are fecl3 zhou et al 2014 he et al 2018 wu et al 2018 mncl4 zhou et al 2014 alcl3 zhang and gao 2013 feso4 tian et al 2011 and acids like h2so4 hcl and hno3 liu et al 2010 abid et al 2016 ding et al 2018 and red mud wu et al 2017 being applied during pre treatment of biomass for getting modified biochar produced synthesis of biochar performed under devolatilizing gases like n2 creates the porous structure on biochar and those dual porosity directly influence the water holding capacity cation exchange capacity mechanical stability the density of the biochar chesworth 2008 the synthesis process and feedstock types significantly influence the surface area porosity biochar yield ash content carbon hydrogen nitrogen sulphur and oxygen contents of the biochar for example an increase in pyrolyzing temperature 600 c enhances the surface area wang et al 2017 zama et al 2017 niazi et al 2018a and carbon percentage van vinh et al 2015 yu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 but the low temperature 300 400 c generally increases the quantity of produced biochar qian et al 2013 niazi et al 2018b 4 2 characteristics of biochar based materials fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir characterization identifies various functional groups present onto biochar surfaces ghimire et al 2003 samsuri et al 2013 wongrod et al 2018 nham et al 2019 for example iron impregnated biochar showed various functional groups onto the surface like oh cc cn co nco fe o nh ch2 samsuri et al 2013 pan et al 2015 wei et al 2019 whereas acid treated biomass showed availability of different functional groups such as cooh oh c o and hcch ghimire et al 2003 abid et al 2016 hussain et al 2020 while base treated biomass depicted functional groups like co nh hcch and co jin et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 wongrod et al 2018 hussain et al 2020 abid et al 2016 observed a shift in characteristic peak positions from 3405 1711 1406 and 1623 cm 1 to 3395 1715 1616 and 1367 cm 1 respectively after adsorption as v ions onto biochar surfaces similarly niazi et al 2018 observed a shift in adsorption peaks from the region 3303 3690 to 1015 1025 cm 1 while using japanese oak wood biochar x ray diffractometer xrd analysis determines the crystallographic structure and identifies the dominant minerals including the amorphous nature of the powered biochar based materials baig et al 2014 duan et al 2017 bakshi et al 2018 alchouron et al 2020 for example cho et al 2017 have found different mineral phases of the biochar synthesized under different conditions like n2 and co2 gases under n2 conditions fe3c at 37 8 43 9 45 46 49 2 and 54 5 2θ degree was the dominant mineral phase found for iron treated biochar whereas fe3o4 at 30 2 35 5 43 1 and 57 2θ degree showed the mineral phases under the co2 environment in addition x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis presents the relative abundance of different species of elements including information related to chemical bonds and chemical structure until 10 nm of biochar size yao et al 2010 lin et al 2013 zhang and gao 2013 for instance in the case of biochar based materials xps determines functional groups onto surface and changes in the elemental composition with the aging of biochar cheng et al 2006 nguyen et al 2009 lin et al 2012 zama et al 2017 the binding energies for as iii and as v onto biochar materials were 44 5 and 45 3 ev respectively lin et al 2017 wen et al 2017 lata et al 2019 therefore using xps analysis sattar et al 2019 determine that biochar materials can adsorb more as iii than the raw biomass scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray edx eds are analytical techniques that analyze the morphological characteristics of biochar surface and elemental mapping of biochar based materials for example shaikh et al 2020 performed sem edx analysis to investigate the pore arrangement and structure of small pores like micropore and mesopore including the presence of iron 18 calcium 11 4 oxygen 63 9 and potassium 6 6 onto biochar surfaces which confirm the formation of zero valent iron this analysis also helps to identify uptake of as by biochar via corresponding peaks of as wu et al 2017 alam et al 2018 liu et al 2019 shaikh et al 2020 for example wu et al 2017 found calcium aluminum iron and titanium peaks and showed red mud biochar modification this elemental analysis of biochar helps to determine the efficiency of biochar igalavithana et al 2017 the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analytical technique is being used to determine the magnetic properties of biochar materials biochar based materials contain iron oxides like goethite magnetite hematite etc which impart magnetic property to biochars zhou et al 2017 he et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 magnetic biochar can be easily recollected by external magnetic fields for example he et al 2018 used ferric chloride fecl3 modified biochar and showed the ferromagnetic behavior which could get attracted or repelled by an external magnetic field 5 adsorption mechanisms of arsenic onto biochar based materials several biochar varieties are being obtained from different biomasses like rice husk norazlina abu et al 2014 sewage sludge solid waste agrafioti et al 2014 norazlina abu et al 2014 oakwood and pinewood mohan et al 2007 empty fruit brunch biochar norazlina abu et al 2014 tectona and lagerstroemia leaves biochar verma and singh 2019 perilla leaves and japanese oak wood biochar niazi et al 2018a 2018b paper mill sludge derived biochar yoon et al 2017b tea waste cheraghi et al 2014 almond shell biochar ali et al 2020 wheat straw derived biochar tabassum et al 2019 potato peel and rice husk ash bibi et al 2017 and bagasse fly ash ali et al 2014 for possible as removal in aqueous solutions table 2 on the surface of biochar based materials various functional groups like oh cooh co and nh groups can be present for effectively removing metalloids from the aqueous media jiménez cedillo et al 2013 cheraghi et al 2014 norazlina abu et al 2014 tabassum et al 2019 fig 2 illustrates the sorption mechanisms for as iii and as v onto biochar in aqueous solutions possible adsorption mechanisms for as species are electrostatic attraction surface complexation ion exchange and precipitation niazi et al 2018b sattar et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2021 as stated above biochar possesses higher oxygen based functional groups which shows surface complexation with as and shifts in spectral bands after adsorption like from co to ester oh and cooh groups in which precipitation of as were observed using xrd and sem due to change in spectroscopic spectral bands of associated various functional groups after sorption of as onto biochar based materials abdel fattah et al 2015 wang et al 2015b at ph phpzc the higher content of functional groups onto biochar surfaces could be present on biochar surface which protonated them and favours the removal of anionic as species due to electrostatic force of attraction wang et al 2015b alkurdi et al 2019 in summary electrostatic interactions and surface complexation were prominent adsorption mechanisms for as species using biochar or modified biochar bakshi et al 2018 lata et al 2019 ahmad et al 2020 6 factors affecting adsorption of arsenic in the aqueous solution 6 1 effect of ph on arsenic adsorption aqueous solution chemistry is one of the crucial parameters in the sorption of as species which significantly influences the biochar surface behavior i e electro potential charges of biochar at varying ph and as speciation shaikh et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021 for example niazi et al 2018b observed substantial influence on the adsorption of as iii and as v using oak wood biochar which showed an increase in removal efficiencies of as iii i e from 75 to 81 by increasing the ph 3 to 7 for as v 84 maximum removal efficiency was observed at ph 6 for alkaline solution i e ph from 7 to 10 removal efficiencies decreased for as iii and as v in contrast alam et al 2018 observed the influence of ph on the sorption of as iii as well as v using c fistula biochar and found maximum removal of 85 at ph 2 for as v and 78 at ph 6 for as iii zhou et al 2017b have found that as v adsorption increases from ph 2 to 4 then decreases sharply after ph 5 using magnetic gelatin modified biochar adsorption capacities decreased from 45 8 to 13 9 mg g as ph shifts from acidic to neutral similarly he et al 2018 reported that iron modified biochar has a high adsorption capacity of 86 12 at ph 6 as v adsorption increases for ph from 2 to 6 which then decreases until ph 10 the difference in ph had influenced as species in an aqueous solution as h2aso4 and haso4 2 dominate in between ph 3 to 6 and aso4 3 are mostly present at an alkaline solution deng et al 2008 wei et al 2016 in addition to electrostatic attraction co precipitation with hydroxyapatite ion exchange of as v and oh anions onto commercial bone char was observed at ph 10 resulting in maximum adsorption of 99 chen et al 2008 point of zero charges pzc influences the interaction between biochar and as types as phpzc is more than solution ph it favors the adsorption of cation via electrostatic interaction whereas anion adsorption favors in the solution when ph is more than phpzc of biochar qian et al 2013 samsuri et al 2013 wu et al 2017 luo et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019b synthesized iron modified biochar which had phpzc of 6 8 and they observed that as v removal increases when ph 6 8 and eventually decreases when ph 6 8 the variation in ph causes protonation and deprotonation of functional groups onto biochar surfaces at low ph the functional groups present on the biochar surface are protonated favoring the removal of anionic as species as ph is high deprotonation of functional groups occurs which favors the removal of cationic as species mukherjee et al 2021 6 2 influence of biochar doses on arsenic adsorption it is necessary to optimize the adsorbent biochar or modified biochar dose for maximum remediation of as by keeping the initial as concentration and ph constant yadav et al 2014 shaikh et al 2020 imran et al 2021 with an increase in biochar dose the removal efficiency increases up to the optimum level all active sites on the biochar surface area are occupied and saturated sanyang et al 2016 for example ali et al 2014 found that removal efficiency increases from 84 to 95 for as v and from 79 9 to 95 for as iii at biochar dosage of 1 5 3 g l similarly fan et al 2018 observed that sorption efficiency for as v enhanced from 2 2 to 96 with an increase in biochar dosage in the range of 0 4 5 g l whereas further increase in biochar doses had a negligible influence on the removal efficiencies a similar study by verma and singh 2019 identified the optimum biochar doses of 4 g l for as removal ranging from 1 to 5 g l at constant ph and temperature basically the sorption efficiency of as depends upon biochar doses which increases up to the saturation level of active sites thereafter negligible changes were observed 6 3 influence of arsenic concentration on adsorption the adsorption capacity of biochar based materials is significantly dependent and governed via the availability of initial as concentration in the aqueous solution with fixed biochar dose and low initial as concentration as ions can have active sites available onto the biochar surfaces whereas with an increase in as concentration without increasing the biochar doses adsorption decreases due to less availability of active sites for as ions and intra competition within as ions yadav et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019b verma and singh 2019 initial as concentrations decrease resistance during mass transfer between adsorbate and adsorbent lata et al 2019 for instance nham et al 2019 observed that the removal efficiency of as decreased from 92 8 to 78 6 with an increase in initial as concentration from 4 to 30 mg l using iron modified biochar to determine the influence of sorbate sanyang et al 2016 analyzed the as concentrations of 1 150 mg l while keeping other parameters like ph adsorbent dose and contact time constant adsorption rapidly increased from 0 423 to 27 56 mg g for 1 100 mg l as concentration likely due to the availability of huge active sites for sorption of as however further increase in as concentration from 100 to 150 mg l had no such increase in adsorption of as ions which indicates that biochar had attained an equilibrium state in which the active site would have exhausted and competition between as ions would have increased a similar concentration dependent trend is found by nguyen et al 2019b in which the amount of as adsorption increases up to 30 mg l by iron modified biochar initially more active sites can be available with low adsorbate concentrations however as the adsorbate concentration increases the progressive saturation of the active site occurs and eventually leads to a stage when no further increase in adsorption is observed alam et al 2018 6 4 effect of co existing interfering ions on arsenic adsorption many ions such as bicarbonate carbonate sulfate phosphate chloride etc are commonly present in the groundwater due to geochemical processes or anthropogenic activities baig et al 2014 hu et al 2015 shaikh et al 2020 these ions are reported to influence the adsorption process by competing with as ions for interaction with active sites present on the biochar surfaces a decrease in adsorption efficiency has been observed in the presence of these anions for example shaikh et al 2020 had observed a significant decrease in adsorption rate due to the presence of phosphate and other anions the structural and chemical similarity surface charge and particle size of biochar based materials are the factors responsible for reducing the adsorption efficiency due to phosphate ions shaikh et al 2020 a similar result was observed by alam et al 2018 where a sharp decrease in as adsorption was observed in the presence of phosphate ions phosphate and silicates are the main competitors for as adsorption in water due to the similarity between oxyanions of as silicate and phosphate which resulted in suppressed uptake of as ions lata et al 2019 besides carbonate and sulfate ions have much less effect on as uptake hu et al 2015 therefore the knowledge of existing ions present in natural groundwater via different sources is critical in designing the as removal experiments 7 effect of adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics on arsenic adsorption 7 1 adsorption isotherms langmuir freundlich temkin and dubininin redushkevich isotherms are standard adsorption isotherms being performed to investigate interactions between as biochar interfaces and adsorption behaviors van vinh et al 2015 duan et al 2017 ahmad et al 2020 langmuir isotherm describes the non linear monolayer adsorption on homogenous surfaces without interfering among the adsorbed particles via correlating the amount of solute sorbed onto the sorbent and the concentration of the initial contaminant table 3 freundlich isotherm enlightens non linear monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces having interaction among adsorbed molecules the correlation coefficient r2 obtained from the langmuir isotherm shows higher adsorptive r2 values for as biochar material interactions by indicating monolayer non linear and homogeneous adsorption of both as iii and as v than the freundlich isotherm zhang et al 2013 van vinh et al 2015 duan et al 2017 wei et al 2019 for example iron oxide nanoneedles biochar fibers fe nn bfs showed fast adsorption of both as iii and as v which possesses monolayer non linear and homogeneous adsorption r2 0 93 of as over heterogeneous sorption wei et al 2019 similarly biochar with fe3o4 modification like biochar γ fe2o3 composite showed monolayer adsorption of as v onto the homogeneous biochar γ fe2o3 surfaces with no interactions among adsorbed molecules zhang et al 2013 in contrast biochar alooh nanocomposite reported monolayer non linear and heterogeneous adsorption which freundlich can better correlate than langmuir isotherm zhang and gao 2013 temkin isotherm explains that heat of sorption of a solute in a layer decreases linearly with surface coverage due to sorbent solute interactions where the solute sorption is defined by a uniform distribution of binding sites ahmad et al 2020 reported that langmuir redlich peterson and freundlich isotherms were best fitted for investigating the adsorption affinity of raw biochar zero valent iron biochar composite and silica biochar composite using date palm waste biomass indicating mono and multi layer adsorption of as v recently imran et al 2021 also performed different adsorption isotherms like langmuir freundlich temkin and dubininin redushkevich isotherms analyzing the adsorption capacity of mno and cuo modified biochar composites and equilibrium concentration of as v therein mno and cuo modified biochar composites showed monolayer non linear and heterogeneous adsorption process for as v i e freundlich isotherm was the best fitted r2 0 95 among the four selected isotherms in another study yoon et al 2017a also performed redlich peterson isotherm including langmuir and freundlich isotherms to investigate the adsorption capacities of engineered biochar with respect to as v equilibrium concentrations resulting in a high affinity of the binding sites as redlich peterson isotherm r2 0 9989 was best fitted for the adsorption of as v compared to langmuir and freundlich isotherms 7 2 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics describes the adsorption capacity of biochar for contaminants with respect to time the pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and elovich kinetics are standard kinetics being performed for analyzing the adsorption of both as iii and as v onto biochar based materials as summarized in table 3 zhang and gao 2013 zhang et al 2013 duan et al 2017 wei et al 2019 in an aqueous solution the sorption rate of as describes the diffusion state and accessibility of active sites onto the adsorbents zhang et al 2013 wei et al 2019 the pseudo first order kinetics refers to sorption kinetics as a function of residence time also known as the lagergren model whereas the pseudo second order kinetics explains the rate of chemical reaction having a direct relationship to the available active sites on the adsorbents engineered biochar has shown adsorption of as v due to the chemisorption process as pseudo second order kinetic r2 0 999 fits better than pseudo first order kinetic r2 0 897 yoon et al 2017a similarly fe nn bfs showed fast sorption of both as iii and as v than pristine biochar wei et al 2019 wei et al 2019 also reported that the pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 99 describes that the adsorption process occurred properly due to chemisorption of as as compared to the pseudo first order kinetics fe nn bfs possess phpzc of 3 7 therefore the chemisorption process dominates for as v due to electrostatic interactions between negatively charged biochar composites and as v ions however as iii adsorbed onto fe nn bfs due to surface complexation as iii ions of h3aso3 dominate in the range of ph 4 9 2 were as iii and feooh surface form as o fe bond wei et al 2019 besides this ahmad et al 2020 investigated pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich power function and intra particle diffusion kinetics which stated that the chemisorption adsorption process dominates the sorption of as v onto the raw biochar zero valent iron biochar composite and silica biochar composite obtained from date palm waste biomass it was observed that pseudo second order kinetics was the best fit r2 0 99 for all selected adsorbents for as v adsorption for biochar composites with fe3o4 modification pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich kinetics reported r2 higher than 0 90 for adsorption of as v using biochar γ fe2o3 composite the pseudo first order showed a higher r2 value of 0 97 than pseudo second order r2 0 96 and elovich r2 0 94 kinetics indicating mononuclear adsorption of as v onto biochar γ fe2o3 composite due to dispersion of γ fe2o3 zhang et al 2013 in contrast elovich kinetics r2 0 96 dominates on the removal of as v using biochar alooh nanocomposites as compared to pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics which recommended that heterogeneous sorption of as v onto biochar alooh composites had happened due to chemisorption kinetic process zhang and gao 2013 similarly other than iron loaded biochar van vinh et al 2015 stated that adsorption of as iii using zn loaded biochar is governed by the intra particle diffusion model r2 0 99 intra particle diffusion kinetic states the diffusion mechanism by understanding the sorption rate and degree of boundary layers in the adsorption process using metallic oxides imran et al 2021 used biochar composites via impregnating cuo and mno and performed intra particle diffusion and elovich kinetics including pseudo first order as well as pseudo second order kinetics mno and cuo modified biochar showed pseudo second order kinetics to be best fitted for adsorption of as v as compared with the other three kinetics 7 3 thermodynamics of arsenic adsorption onto biochar based materials several studies have reported that pyrolysis temperature affects the physio chemical properties of biochar based materials for both as iii and as v adsorption qian et al 2013 van vinh et al 2015 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 increase decrease in water environmental temperature can also influence the adsorption of as iii and as v onto biochar materials therefore various pristine and modified biochars showed endothermic as well as exothermic adsorption mechanisms depending upon gibbs free energy δg standard entropy δs and enthalpy δh at biochar as interaction in the aqueous phase several investigations have shown that both as iii and as v adsorption onto biochar materials is an endothermic and spontaneous process in nature as summarized in table 3 for the spontaneous nature of both as iii and as v adsorption δg showed negative values resulting in chemisorption and physisorption during the adsorption process at biochar based materials zhu et al 2016 navarathna et al 2019 alchouron et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 for example rahman et al 2021 reported negative values of δg for pristine zirconium modified and zirconium iron modified biochars in the range of 288 313 k temperature besides this the positive δs presented degree of freedom for adsorption of as iii and as v onto biochar based materials at solid liquid interfaces liu et al 2017 verma and singh 2019 rahman et al 2021 moreover alam et al 2018 also observed that the adsorption capacities of iron manganese modified biochar for as v enhanced with an increase in temperature from 288 to 308 k in addition tectona biochar have shown endothermic adsorption for as iii whereas exothermic process for as v in the temperature range of 298 328 k verma and singh 2019 van vinh et al 2015 reported an exothermic adsorption process for as iii using raw and zinc loaded pine cone biochar because positive values of δh and δs showed high randomness at sorbent solute interfaces detailed adsorption equilibrium isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis for different adsorbent materials as types and adsorption capacities are shown in table 3 8 sustainability and reusability of biochar based adsorbents the stability regeneration and reusability of novel biochar based sorbents are significant for evaluating sorbents from social environmental and economic perspectives pristine and modified biochars are novel adsorbents having high adsorption capacities for remediation of heavy metals resulting in low investment costs and potential applicability for wastewater treatment stability and regeneration of biochar based materials had been determined using zeta potential analysis of biochar materials and ph of aqueous solutions for example mnfe2o4 supported magnetic biochar possesses phpzc of 7 4 below which high adsorption 99 of as v was observed in the range of ph 3 7 due to the electrostatic attractions among positively charged magnetic biochar and negatively charged h2aso3r haso3r2 h2aso4 and haso4 2 anions wen et al 2021 the feasibility and cost effectiveness of biochar based materials mainly depend upon regeneration and reusability for specific sorption desorption cycles water hyacinth magnetic biochar has shown 100 adsorption of as v followed by 80 in the second cycle and reduced to 65 5 in the fourth cycle zhang et al 2016 consequently wen et al 2021 also reported that the desorption was performed using naoh at ph 10 to determine the desorption percentage reduced from 95 23 to 87 33 in fifth cycles for 20 mg l as v onto mnfe2o4 supported magnetic biochar however fe mn modified biochar and co precipitated mnfe2o4 modified biochar showed poor adsorption capacities for as v 47 and 60 respectively wang et al 2015b rahman et al 2021 applied nh4 2so4 hno3 and naoh as desorbing agents and observed that hno3 and naoh were more significant as compared with nh4 2so4 onto zirconium iron modified biochar than pristine zirconium modified biochars similarly he et al 2018 also performed the regeneration analysis using alkaline naoh nahco3 and nah2po4 solutions thus regeneration efficiencies were decreased from the first to third cycles besides this naoh and nacl have also been used for regeneration purposes of fe cu biochar composites resulting in the reduction of as removal efficiency from 95 to 89 and 87 respectively priyadarshni et al 2020 the reusability of biochar adsorbents is more suitable in column experiments for theoretical applications than batch sorption experiments thus naoh solution at ph 13 was used to regenerate fe nn bfs therein as iii and as v were decreased by 22 8 and 10 4 respectively using fe nn bfs after four cycles of regenerations wei et al 2019 amen et al 2020 assessed the removal efficiency of as iii using goethite modified biochar for 98 in the first cycle and 86 in the fourth cycle in the naoh solution regeneration process regeneration and reusability of modified biochars are significantly enhanced by the desorption calcination process in comparison with desorption only for example magnesium oxide modified biochar showed a reduction in as iii adsorption after fifth cycles due to desorption only whereas adsorption capacity remain same for as iii for the desorption calcination regeneration process chen et al 2021 generally regenerated biochar based materials lose either their functional groups or impregnated modified properties or effective porosity or available active sites onto biosorbents reducing removal efficiencies it is clear from the above discussion that modified biochars have achieved much high adsorption capacities of both as iii and as v than pristine biochars potential desorption and reusability of biochars in as contaminated water treatment for few cycles can be applied for wastewater treatment still the application of biochar based materials in fixed bed column experiments is yet to be investigated besides practical applicability is being investigated through continuous column experiments using saturated sand media wang et al 2021 tran et al 2022 therefore the implications of biochar based materials will significantly reduce arsenic contamination to groundwater systems mandoreba et al 2021 cuong et al 2022 recently cuong et al 2022 applied biochar filters to remediate arsenic contaminated real groundwater which possesses a low adsorption capacity of 2 88 mg g from the above analysis as modified biochars have higher adsorption capacity than raw biochar via batch experiments we recommended implications of modified biochars to analyze arsenic remediation from contaminated real groundwater 9 conclusions future scopes and recommendations biochar has significant potential for soil health management carbon sequestration sustainable source of energy treatment of contaminated wastewater and global warming mitigation and acts as a catalyst for achieving sustainable development goals in the 21st century adsorption of as ions using biochar based materials depends on solution chemistry i e ph and ionic strength biochar dosage initial concentration residence time co existing ions etc modified biochar i e modifications with different metal oxides hydroxides alkali acid activation metallic salts etc have reported high adsorption capacity than pristine biochar in aqueous solutions therefore this review summarized the potential scope of biochar based materials for removing as species i e as iii and as v ions along with challenges and future scope of biochar synthesis and characterization of pristine and modified biochar have been discussed in detail including pre post treatment approach and physiochemical analysis of biochar based materials biochar sorbents synthesized at high temperature showed higher adsorption capacities for as ions than low temperature synthesized biochars adsorption mechanisms of as ions onto biochar based sorbents have been supported with isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis adsorption mechanisms for both as iii and as v were discussed in which isotherms depicted non linear monolayer adsorption on either homogenous or heterogeneous surfaces whereas chemisorption and physisorption kinetics and endothermic sorption were observed optimally overall this review work summarizes the sustainable application of biochar based materials and discusses the key issues involved in removing as from contaminated water resources however a better understanding of modified and raw biochar based on biomass and feedstocks can vary physical and chemical characteristics impacting the sorption efficiency of as needed to be focused on optimizing biochar sorption capacities singh et al 2021 significant research has been conducted for as contaminated water treatment mainly using batch sorption flow systems therefore significant challenges and scope related to implications of biochar sorbents in continuous flow systems exist to scale them up for commercial and industrial purposes adsorption of as onto biochar occurred mainly due to chemisorption mechanism in which as anions strongly bonded with biochar surfaces that reduced the regeneration capability and functionality for reuse overall resulting in reduced as sorption efficiencies despite numerous investigations on the sorption of as iii and as v onto biochar sorbents there are still significant gaps in the current state of knowledge that need to be addressed therefore several concerns are highlighted and recommended for future studies chen et al 2021 reported that regenerated magnesium of oxide modified biochar via desorption calcination showed consistency in adsorption capacity of as iii than regeneration with desorption only therefore it is recommended to perform desorption calcination for regeneration and reusability of modified biochars the idea to synthesize mixed feedstock s biochar including their modification to optimize the removal of several contaminants in a continuous flow manner aims to enhance the discharge water quality and reduce the cost of wastewater treatment for wastewater treatment including pristine biochar modified biochars have shown significant adsorption of as iii and as v however very few research has been done to mitigate as from paddy fields using modified biochars via decreasing mobility and bioavailability of as in paddy field soils therefore mitigation of as contaminated dietary is essential for global food safety and security ftir spectroscopy has been extensively applied before and after as adsorption for spectral information besides more systematic research is needed in the future on the use of integrated spectroscopic techniques like xafs μ raman spectroscopy μ xrf etc for a better understanding of redox transformation and adsorption mechanisms for as adsorption onto biochar surfaces safe disposal discard of pollutants loaded biochars after adsorption is quite challenging thus roy et al 2022 had attempted to assess the recycling of as loaded biochars via vermitechnology as an eco friendly recycling approach therefore microbial activities have the potential for further recycling and reusability promoting micro and macro level entrepreneurship for utilizing agricultural wastes as biochar energy production etc can gain attention via policy intervention and help to mitigate global warming and generate employment attention needs to be given to community based as removal systems and public awareness especially to women and children belonging to rural areas several countries are struggling for clean drinking water therefore biochar can play a significant role in providing clean water via as contaminated water treatment there should be action calls for on site and low cost as removal techniques for monitoring and desalination in as affected regions pilot scale research should be encouraged for life cycle assessment of modified biochars and avoid economic losses due to as contaminated water on human and animal health considering interdisciplinary and technological advancement biochar based sorbents are considered environmentally sound technologies and can contribute to achieving sustainable development goals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

current state of knowledge for arsenic contaminated water treatment firstly this paper insight a brief understanding of arsenic speciation toxicity and accumulation in the food chain and secondly explains the adsorption techniques for as remediation from the contaminated water arsenic adsorption using biochar based sorbents is summarized as an efficient and economically feasible approach biochars renewable carbonaceous and sustainable materials synthesized through pre post pyrolysis treatment of biomass under limited oxygen supply conditions resulting in high surface area dual porosity surface charge and enhanced functional groups thirdly this review discusses various factors such as acidic ph initial concentration biochar dose co existing ions and temperature including regeneration and reusability of biochar based sorbents arsenic adsorption increases at 2 6 ph and decreases until ph 10 in aqueous solution ph influenced as species as h2aso4 and haso4 2 dominate in the range of 3 6 ph and aso4 3 are primarily present in alkaline solution thus electrostatic interactions and surface complexation are dominating mechanisms occurring at arsenic biochar interfaces in aqueous solutions lastly mechanistic understanding for arsenic adsorption onto biochar materials has been discussed considering equilibrium adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis in conclusion this review also highlighted major challenges and future scope relevant for implications of biochar sorbents in continuous flow systems to scale up for commercial and industrial purposes

immediate and concerted action shaw and thaitakoo 2010 with the growing population demand for clean water is also increasing therefore dependency on groundwater resources increases nordstrom 2002 increasing population global warming and declining water quality are factors that increase the demand for potable water nemerow and dasgupta 1991 tchobanoglous et al 1991 ali and aboul enein 2004 khan

living in areas without adequate water supply supply and programme 2014 heavy metals such as arsenic cadmium fluoride nickel mercury etc can cause numerous health abnormalities after ingestion of carcinogenic contaminants even in minute quantity for a prolonged period muhammad et al 2010 2011 xie et al 2020 heavy metals are hazardous substances that cause serious health issues as contamination exceeds above allowable limit because of their toxicity behaviour persistence and accumulation in the environment chiban et al 2016 gashkina et al 2020 xie et al 2020 arsenic as being metalloid has atomic number 33 belongs to the nitrogen family arsenic is 12th 14th and 20th most abundant in human seawater and earth s crust respectively mandal and suzuki 2002 munoz and palmero 2005 liu et al 2006 according to the agency for toxic substance and disease registry arsenic is the first among 20 highly hazardous carcinogen substances choubisa 1997 as occurs in four oxidation states like 3 as oxidation state 0 elemental as 3 arsenite and 5 arsenate smedley and kinniburgh 2002 in an aqueous system inorganic as exists in the ionic from having two oxidation states i e trivalent as iii and pentavalent as v elizalde gonzález et al 2001 chutia et al 2009 in oxygenic conditions pentavalent as is stable and exists as monovalent h 2 aso 4 or divalent haso 4 anions whereas in anoxygenic condition trivalent as is also stable and exists as uncharged h 3 aso 3 0 or anionic species h 3 aso 3 0 grossl et al 1997 arsenic can be released into the environment due to the erosion and weathering of arsenic containing rock and minerals volcanic activities forest fires etc nordstrom 2002 sharma et al 2014 during the biogeochemical process as is released from rock into the water due to interaction between water and as containing rocks mukherjee et al 2014 the oxidation process also releases as from sulfide minerals and iron oxide via reductive dissolution or desorption camargo and alonso 2006 as mobilization in groundwater can occur naturally through physical and chemical weathering or volcanism and biogeochemical activities mondal et al 2010 guo et al 2014 2017 and released into the environment via anthropogenic activities such as from wood preservatives chen and olsen 2016 acid mine drainage paikaray 2015 fertilizers or herbicides jayasumana et al 2015 generally soils are contaminated with arsenic due to fertilizer pesticides mining and smelting burning of fossil fuel incineration of wastes and use of sludge geogenically soils are significantly contaminated due to weathering of parent rock and minerals containing arsenic nriagu et al 2007 around 150 million people worldwide are affected severely due to high doses of arsenic consumption mainly through as enriched groundwater or foods in developing countries like india bangladesh and pakistan the permissible limit for arsenic is 50 μg l due to treatment performance and analytical achievability organization 1993 high level of as 50 μg l occurs in groundwater in many countries for example chile mexico usa hungary argentina india bangladesh romania and vietnam smedley and kinniburgh 2002 naidu et al 2006 bhattacharya et al 2007 podgorski and berg 2020 for drinking water the permissible limit for as was reduced from 50 μg l to 10 μg l organization 1993 who 2011 consumption of drinking water contaminated with as results in skin lesions hyperkeratosis melanosis hypertension etc thundiyil et al 2007 fatmi et al 2009 rahman et al 2009 and also increases the risk for kidney and lung cancer richts et al 2011 several studies have reported that groundwater has as concentrations in the range of 0 5 μg l 5 mg l smedley et al 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 whereas it goes maximum up to 531 μg l in the groundwater system of west bengal india desbarats et al 2014 rivers are also considered as possible drinking water sources across the globe having maximum as concentration up to 263 μg l in france barats et al 2014 720 μg l in the usa ritchie et al 2013 and 0 5 7900 μg l in spain sánchez rodas et al 2005 besides rivers lakes are also considered a freshwater source for consumption purposes reported as concentrations of 1 157 μg l in various lakes worldwide arain et al 2009 barringer et al 2011 several investigations have reported different methodologies for as removal from contaminated water namely oxidation kim and nriagu 2000 ravenscroft et al 2011 nicomel et al 2016 ion exchange mohan and pittman 2007a b litter et al 2010 chiban et al 2012 precipitation and coagulation newcombe and möller 2006 ravenscroft et al 2011 nicomel et al 2016 membrane filtration mohan and pittman jr 2007 reverse osmosis verma et al 2021 and adsorption altundoğan et al 2002 imran et al 2021 wen et al 2021 among them adsorption is the most efficient and promising technique for as remediation and other toxic contaminants from polluted soil and water ecosystems in the adsorption method various adsorbents such as activated charcoal carbon activated alumina zeolites clay materials metal oxides carbon nanotubes graphene based materials biochar etc have shown significant removal of as species samsuri et al 2013 yao et al 2014 alam et al 2018 biochar being a renewable carbon material has been extensively applied to remove as species with excellent adsorption capacities at low costs with the advancement in material science and technology biochar based materials are being modified with various metal salts like fecl3 mncl4 alcl3 and feso4 tian et al 2011 zhang and gao 2013 zhou et al 2014 and acids like h2so4 hcl and hno3 liu et al 2010 abid et al 2016 ding et al 2018 red mud wu et al 2017 for further enhancement in adsorption efficiencies of as species significant research gaps have been observed in previously published reviews of arsenic removal using biochar in previously published work the application of different biochar based materials including their isotherms kinetics thermodynamics reusability and sustainability and factors affecting the adsorption have not been discussed for the arsenic removal vithanage et al 2017 siddiq et al 2021 srivastav et al 2021 thus a comprehensive literature review on arsenic removal from past decades is required to highlight the current state of knowledge using biochar based materials present review work summarizes as speciation toxicity and their accumulation in the environment along with implications of different remediation techniques and adsorbent uses for as ions removal from contaminated water prioritizing the adsorption of arsenic ions using pristine biochar and modified biochar this review work aims to highlight the a synthes and characterization of biochar based materials b adsorption mechanisms and factors affecting the arsenic adsorption such as solution chemistry biochar dose arsenic concentration temperature and co existing ions c equilibrium isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis lastly we have also summarized the regeneration and reusability of biochar based materials for better understanding and applicability of renewable and economically viable materials for wastewater treatment processes in addition this review indicates the perspectives worth researching the arsenic remediation in the current scenario 2 advanced techniques for arsenic remediation removal of as from water is the utmost concern to provide safe drinking water for people residing in as contaminated areas visoottiviseth and ahmed 2008 on account of the above discussion various studies have been introduced for as remediation from contaminated water namely adsorption reverse osmosis oxidation precipitation coagulation ion exchange membrane filtration etc babel and kurniawan 2003 daus et al 2004 feng et al 2011 banerjee et al 2012 interestingly most of these technologies encourage efficient removal of arsenate as 5 as compared with arsenite as 3 which mainly acts as neutral at ph below 9 2 and therefore as iii is less accessible for adsorption ion exchange and precipitation johnston et al 2001 apart from removing as these methods can also remove other compounds elements such as colour bacteria phosphate hardness fluoride manganese turbidity odour etc johnston et al 2001 singh 2007 however these techniques have limitations for example high cost of resin high tech operation and maintenance sludge disposal and production of toxic wastes mohan and pittman 2007a b large plant area high operational and maintenance costs high energy and capital investment are limitations for conventional technologies bora and dutta 2014 new technology with high efficiency multi functionality high flexibility and regenerative capacity is needed qu et al 2013b nanotechnology offers the potential to develop alternative novel materials for the wastewater treatment qu et al 2013b therefore nanomaterials like carbon materials nanocomposites inorganic nanoparticles etc have potential to remediate heavy metals from contaminated water fuertes et al 2007 domínguez domínguez et al 2008 carabineiro et al 2013 kango et al 2013 these particles possess improved properties such as activated catalytic electrical optical and magnetic characteristics along with high surface area porosity electro potential charges functional groups etc as compared to bulk material of similar composition sarkar et al 2012 qu et al 2013a van tran et al 2020 several nanomaterials based adsorbents performed well for as removal such as activated charcoal carbon zhang et al 2007 oliveira et al 2008 asadullah et al 2014 yao et al 2014 activated alumina lin and wu 2001 han et al 2013 shi et al 2015 zeolites li et al 2007 baskan and pala 2011 swarnkar and tomar 2012 clay materials anjum et al 2011 foroutan et al 2019 mihajlov et al 2020 metal oxides liu et al 2010 luo et al 2018 pincus et al 2018 wen et al 2020 carbon nanotubes fu et al 2017 ali 2018 ma et al 2018 duoc et al 2020 graphene based materials chandra et al 2010 mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 wen et al 2013 fu et al 2017 biochar bakshi et al 2018 wei et al 2019 amen et al 2020 wan et al 2020 etc thus for as removal the adsorption process uses solid surface as a medium on which mass transfer occurs from one phase to another due to its wide range of applications high efficiency low cost sludge free and ease of operation adsorption is considered a reclamation and comprehensive technique for water defluoridation and purification singh et al 2015 3 adsorbents for removal of arsenic various other types of adsorbents including iron hydroxide coated rice straw iron modified activated carbon rice polish solid waste from the leather industry micro fibrillated cellulose modified with magnetic iron oxide for the inorganic as removal the adsorption capacity of materials is dependent on several factors such as ph temperature contact time initial concentration adsorbent dose and functional groups associated with the adsorbents mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 gallios et al 2017 bhakta and ali 2020 acidic ph favors the adsorption of as v and neutral to basic ph favors the adsorption of as iii ranjan et al 2009 hokkanen et al 2015 ouédraogo et al 2015 it is observed that as v removal is more efficient than as iii at ph lower than 7 hsu et al 2008 oh et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 gallios et al 2017 experimental conditions and adsorption efficiency of as using various absorbent materials are summarized in table 1 activated carbon possesses high ash content found to be proficient for as v removal lorenzen et al 1995 kalaruban et al 2019 non modified activated carbon namely coconut shell carbon coal based carbon and peat based extruded carbon were accessed for as v adsorption therefore at slightly acidic ph peat based extruded carbon showed maximum adsorption of 4 91 mg g compared to 2 40 and 4 01 mg g for coconut shell and coal based carbon respectively batch and column adsorption experiments were analyzed using non modified and iron incorporated granular activated carbon fe gac for as adsorption modified fe gac had an adsorption capacity of 1 43 mg g compared to non modified activated carbon with 1 03 mg g observed at ph 6 kalaruban et al 2019 besides iron oxide activated carbon magnetic composites showed enhanced adsorption characteristics and had a removal efficiency of 95 for as v ions yao et al 2014 gallios et al 2017 for example gallios et al 2017 performed as v removal using modified commercially available activated carbon with iron and manganese oxide in an aqueous solution the adsorption capacity increases up to five times for modified activated carbon from 4 to 19 35 mg g at ph 3 besides this arcibar orozco et al 2014 have found that the adsorption capacity of activated carbon depends on the morphology and textural properties of adsorbent along with point zero charges and iron content of modified activated carbon thus ligand interchange and electrostatic attraction are major mechanisms behind as v removal both bituminous iron modified activated carbon cf mp and wood based activated carbon cw mp adsorbents possess high adsorption capacities of as v for lower initial as concentration 4 mg l at ph 7 novel fe3o4 loaded activated carbon composite possessed a maximum adsorption capacity of 204 2 mg g at ph 8 with a contact time of 6 h liu et al 2010 however iron impregnated granular activated carbon showed intra particle diffusion of as v in meso micropores followed by heterogeneous adsorption having less adsorption capacity 1 01 mg g than granular activated carbon 1 43 mg g at ph 6 kalaruban et al 2019 while in the case of lanthanum impregnation jais et al 2016 synthesized bimetallic activated carbon via palm shell waste impregnated with iron followed by lanthanum arsenate adsorption increases using lanthanum impregnation over activated carbon at ph 8 due to precipitation and surface complexation at ph 8 hassan et al 2014 had synthesized three adsorbents calcium alginate activated carbon beads potassium hydroxide activated carbon based apricot stone and calcium alginate beads for as removal functional groups involved in the adsorption process are aldehyde phenol aliphatic carbon and ether calcium alginate activated carbon composite beads exhibit maximum adsorption of 66 7 mg g at ph 7 for as v ions whereas calcium alginate activated carbon beads have an adsorption capacity of 42 4 mg g hydrous iron iii oxide containing calcium ions was found with 90 arsenite removal capacity from an aqueous solution due to chelation ghosh et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 fabricated zirconium nanoparticle doped activated carbon with a maximum adsorption capacity of 21 7 mg g at ph 3 due to the ion exchange mechanism between as and modified activated carbon similarly composites of zirconium oxide on alginate beads were synthesized which showed as adsorption as the electrostatic attraction was 32 3 and 28 5 mg g for as iii and as v respectively at neutral ph kwon et al 2016 however microwave synthesized composite of iron oxide on activated charcoal showed 99 90 uptake of as within 5 min of starting the experiment due to the porous nature of the iron oxide yürüm et al 2014 in other studies deng et al 2016 synthesized hyper branched polyethyleneimine hpei modified cellulose fibers using microwave irradiation therefore adsorption capacities were 54 13 and 99 35 mg g for as iii and as v respectively at ph 8 electrostatic attraction and surface complexation are the dominating force involved in as v adsorption arsenic complexation with iron ions on the surface of zeolite is likely to be attributed adsorption process li et al 2011 had found that the iron got exchanged using natural zeolite as adsorbent during as removal from acid mine drainage water bibi et al 2015 used industrial waste namely hydrated cement marble powder and brick powder to remove as from wastewater hydrated cement showed maximum removal efficiency of 97 at ph 7 with an adsorption capacity of 1 92 mg g some of the solid wastes were considered an adsorbent for the remediation of as for example maximum removal was achieved in alkaline ph via precipitation mechanism using solid concrete waste for the removal of as v ions sasaki et al 2014 arsenic removal was also conducted using solid waste vegetable oil modified with fenton reagent jaafarzadeh et al 2012 the maximum removal efficiency up to 81 of as iii was observed at ph 2 and subsequently 75 for as v at ph 5 through an artificial neural network approach to predict as removal from an aqueous solution under various conditions besides kim et al 2020 synthesized composites of alum sludge and melamine having the capacity to oxidize as iii to as v and adsorb as v under light conditions via chemisorption red mud sorbent was also studied for as removal therefore as iii sorption was observed in favorable alkaline mediums whereas as v in acidic ph altundoğan et al 2002 wu et al 2017 numerous treated sands were utilized and experimented for as removal vaishya and gupta 2003 ramakrishna et al 2006 devi et al 2014 sand coated with iron oxide was performed to be highly effective in as adsorption sand coated with iron oxide further modified with sulfate adsorb as v at acidic ph whereas as iii is being absorbed in either neutral or slightly alkaline ph environment vaishya and gupta 2003 devi et al 2014 vaishya and gupta 2003 synthesized sulfate modified sand coated with iron oxide for as iii adsorption the maximum adsorption of 0 09 mg g was attained at ph in the range of 7 5 9 5 due to electrostatic and van der waals s force of attraction in other experiments using modified sand ramakrishna et al 2006 observed maximum removal efficiency of about 98 2 for as v and 73 2 for as iii at ph 5 similarly sand coated with iron oxide and limestone was prepared for as iii removal from water and showed maximum removal efficiency of 98 6 at ph 7 12 devi et al 2014 renewable biomass materials like yeast biomass fungal tea biomass polished rice etc have also been analyzed for adsorption of as guo and chen 2005 murugesan et al 2006 ranjan et al 2009 for example fungal tea biomass treated with fecl3 has been found effective for 100 as iii and 77 as v remediation from groundwater within less than 2 h murugesan et al 2006 similarly amino modified nano cellulose impregnated with iron oxide showed adsorption capacities of 26 and 23 6 mg g for as v and as iii respectively as surface complexation occurred in the presence of oh oh2 and o functional groups taleb et al 2016 water treatment residues entrapped in alginate beads showed ph of 3 4 and 2 9 for as iii and as v respectively under a slightly acidic ph condition ociński et al 2016 various metal oxides were observed as effective adsorbents for removal of both as iii and as v such as manganese dioxide mno2 ouvrard et al 2005 lafferty et al 2011 mishra and mahato 2016 titanium dioxide tio2 alfarawati et al 2020 du et al 2020 navarrete magaña et al 2021 iron oxides lingamdinne et al 2020 liu et al 2020 otero gonzález et al 2020 torasso et al 2021 and graphene oxides mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 chimezie et al 2017 sherlala et al 2019 rice straw modified with a coating of iron oxy hydroxide showed removal efficiency up to 95 in the ph range of 2 4 ouvrard et al 2005 the adsorption of as v on ceria incorporated manganese oxide occurs via chemisorption in a ph range of 3 7 with up to 98 removal of as v gupta et al 2011 lafferty et al 2011 applied crystalline phallomanganate for oxidation of as iii and sorption of as v in an experiment with mno2 as adsorbent for removal of coexisting as iii and as v maximum adsorption of 71 2 mno2 had occurred using the ratio of 90 μm as iii 10 μm as v ions hou et al 2017 titanium nanocomposites have high efficiency for as v removal even under acidic ph conditions and in the presence of coexisting anions like so4 cl etc du et al 2020 titanium tungsten composite for photocatalytic oxidation of as iii was made to have 99 efficiency within less than 1 h navarrete magaña et al 2021 due to functional groups like cc co c o c present on gadolinium oxide immobilized on graphene oxide adsorbent 99 removal efficiency for as v was obtained via surface complexation and electrostatic mechanism lingamdinne et al 2020 a multifunctional adsorbent resin based hydrated iron oxide showed removal capacities of 71 5 mg g for as v and 41 6 mg g for arsanilic acid at a near neutral ph liu et al 2010 cryogels of iron oxide nanocomposites have good mechanical and absorption properties for as iii by the sol gel method this cryogel can become a good candidate for making nanocomposite adsorption devices otero gonzález et al 2020 a newly synthesized membrane of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in electrospun polyvinyl alcohol pva nanofibers has shown an adsorption capacity of 52 mg g for as v torasso et al 2021 graphene oxide go was reported to be a significant material for as removal due to active sites available for adsorption on its surface zhang et al 2010 mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 chimezie et al 2017 sherlala et al 2019 magnetic graphene oxide mgo encourages the adsorption of as iii instead of as v because of oh ions surface complexes with fe3 ions sherlala et al 2019 kumar et al 2021 magnetite reduced graphene oxide fe3o4 rgo superparamagnetic material at room temperature can remove 99 of as chandra et al 2010 go impregnated with ferric oxide fe2o3 are homogeneous and amorphous composites which can remove as 95 between ph 4 to 9 the study observed over 95 as removal at various ph and residence times zhang et al 2010 maximum sorption capacities for as v and as iii observed were 142 and 139 mg g respectively at ph in the range of 6 7 using functionalized graphene sheets mishra and ramaprabhu 2011 due to functional groups graphene oxide manganese ferrite go mnfe2o4 has hydrophilic groups such as go coo and go o ions adsorption of as v on nano hybrid encourages because of the presence of oh2 functional group at ph less than 4 3 whereas at ph more than 6 5 the competition occurred because of the presence of o ions which favoured the electrostatic interactions for as iii removal kumar et al 2014 reduced graphene oxide magnetic nanocomposite rgo fe3o4 possesses electroactive surfaces with enhanced conductivity and sensitivity for high adsorption of as iii ions chimezie et al 2017 the sorption capacity of magnetic graphene materials for removal of as v was reported to be dominated by ph solution an increase in ph encourages the availability of negatively charged active sites and reduces adsorption capacity due to hindering competition of oh ions with as v huang et al 2019 4 biochar an adsorbent for arsenic removal biochar is stable and solid carbonaceous black biomass derived from biological feedstock as pyrolyzed under limited oxygen conditions tang et al 2013a zhang et al 2013 amen et al 2020 biochar helps to increase nutrient availability organic matter water retention and microbial activity increase crop yield and reduce greenhouse gas emissions woolf et al 2010 sohi 2012 weber and quicker 2018 various types of feedstocks such as distiller grain bioenergy crops grasses and willow wood chips and pellets tree bark and bagasse from the sugarcane industry dairy manure sewage sludge chicken litter olive mill waste and paper sludge have been used for the synthesis of biochar janzen 2004 johnson et al 2007 biochar is a carbon rich material that possesses high surface areas diverse functional groups and dual porosity tang et al 2015 therefore this section discusses the synthesis of biochar based materials for pristine and pre post treatment approaches regarding as removal based on previously available literature inherent properties of biochar i e surface area functional groups porosity etc are recalcitrant due to the presence of aromatic groups and consist of the ability to remediate heavy metals and toxic chemicals functional groups available on biochar surfaces play an essential role in many applications like heavy metals adsorption jia et al 2002 energy storage yaumi et al 2017 carbon sequestration zhang et al 2017 so2 adsorption shao et al 2018 metallurgical application weber and quicker 2018 catalyst guo et al 2016 and building material weber and quicker 2018 4 1 synthesis of biochar based materials biochar is a solid carbonaceous renewable compound synthesized from biomass under low oxygen or anoxic environment commonly through slow pyrolysis having temperature in the range of 300 700 c for prolonged durations leng et al 2020 biomass feedstock and various other parameters like ph temperature types of biomasses pyrolyzing conditions adsorbent dose etc possess significant impacts on the physical and chemical properties which may ultimately influence its application biomass used for biochar production consists mainly of three organic components like cellulose hemicellulose and lignin due to these components the yield and properties of biochar vary as these components behave differently during the synthesis of the biochar zhu et al 2016 hemicellulose consists of polysaccharides with branched chains the most reactive among three decomposing at a temperature between 220 and 315 c yang et al 2007 cellulose also having a polysaccharide structure is unbranched and hence more stable to decompose at a temperature range between 200 and 400 c richardson et al 2009 lignin has a wide decomposition temperature range starting with 200 900 c due to complex macromolecular structures having different types of bonds yang et al 2007 fig 1 depicts various processes performed in biochar modification either during pre or post pyrolysis for adsorption enhancement of heavy metals these modifications likely improve the physio chemical properties and surface morphology of the biochar and thus making them more efficient for adsorption processes some commonly used metal salts are fecl3 zhou et al 2014 he et al 2018 wu et al 2018 mncl4 zhou et al 2014 alcl3 zhang and gao 2013 feso4 tian et al 2011 and acids like h2so4 hcl and hno3 liu et al 2010 abid et al 2016 ding et al 2018 and red mud wu et al 2017 being applied during pre treatment of biomass for getting modified biochar produced synthesis of biochar performed under devolatilizing gases like n2 creates the porous structure on biochar and those dual porosity directly influence the water holding capacity cation exchange capacity mechanical stability the density of the biochar chesworth 2008 the synthesis process and feedstock types significantly influence the surface area porosity biochar yield ash content carbon hydrogen nitrogen sulphur and oxygen contents of the biochar for example an increase in pyrolyzing temperature 600 c enhances the surface area wang et al 2017 zama et al 2017 niazi et al 2018a and carbon percentage van vinh et al 2015 yu et al 2015 wang et al 2017 but the low temperature 300 400 c generally increases the quantity of produced biochar qian et al 2013 niazi et al 2018b 4 2 characteristics of biochar based materials fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir characterization identifies various functional groups present onto biochar surfaces ghimire et al 2003 samsuri et al 2013 wongrod et al 2018 nham et al 2019 for example iron impregnated biochar showed various functional groups onto the surface like oh cc cn co nco fe o nh ch2 samsuri et al 2013 pan et al 2015 wei et al 2019 whereas acid treated biomass showed availability of different functional groups such as cooh oh c o and hcch ghimire et al 2003 abid et al 2016 hussain et al 2020 while base treated biomass depicted functional groups like co nh hcch and co jin et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 wongrod et al 2018 hussain et al 2020 abid et al 2016 observed a shift in characteristic peak positions from 3405 1711 1406 and 1623 cm 1 to 3395 1715 1616 and 1367 cm 1 respectively after adsorption as v ions onto biochar surfaces similarly niazi et al 2018 observed a shift in adsorption peaks from the region 3303 3690 to 1015 1025 cm 1 while using japanese oak wood biochar x ray diffractometer xrd analysis determines the crystallographic structure and identifies the dominant minerals including the amorphous nature of the powered biochar based materials baig et al 2014 duan et al 2017 bakshi et al 2018 alchouron et al 2020 for example cho et al 2017 have found different mineral phases of the biochar synthesized under different conditions like n2 and co2 gases under n2 conditions fe3c at 37 8 43 9 45 46 49 2 and 54 5 2θ degree was the dominant mineral phase found for iron treated biochar whereas fe3o4 at 30 2 35 5 43 1 and 57 2θ degree showed the mineral phases under the co2 environment in addition x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis presents the relative abundance of different species of elements including information related to chemical bonds and chemical structure until 10 nm of biochar size yao et al 2010 lin et al 2013 zhang and gao 2013 for instance in the case of biochar based materials xps determines functional groups onto surface and changes in the elemental composition with the aging of biochar cheng et al 2006 nguyen et al 2009 lin et al 2012 zama et al 2017 the binding energies for as iii and as v onto biochar materials were 44 5 and 45 3 ev respectively lin et al 2017 wen et al 2017 lata et al 2019 therefore using xps analysis sattar et al 2019 determine that biochar materials can adsorb more as iii than the raw biomass scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray edx eds are analytical techniques that analyze the morphological characteristics of biochar surface and elemental mapping of biochar based materials for example shaikh et al 2020 performed sem edx analysis to investigate the pore arrangement and structure of small pores like micropore and mesopore including the presence of iron 18 calcium 11 4 oxygen 63 9 and potassium 6 6 onto biochar surfaces which confirm the formation of zero valent iron this analysis also helps to identify uptake of as by biochar via corresponding peaks of as wu et al 2017 alam et al 2018 liu et al 2019 shaikh et al 2020 for example wu et al 2017 found calcium aluminum iron and titanium peaks and showed red mud biochar modification this elemental analysis of biochar helps to determine the efficiency of biochar igalavithana et al 2017 the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analytical technique is being used to determine the magnetic properties of biochar materials biochar based materials contain iron oxides like goethite magnetite hematite etc which impart magnetic property to biochars zhou et al 2017 he et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 magnetic biochar can be easily recollected by external magnetic fields for example he et al 2018 used ferric chloride fecl3 modified biochar and showed the ferromagnetic behavior which could get attracted or repelled by an external magnetic field 5 adsorption mechanisms of arsenic onto biochar based materials several biochar varieties are being obtained from different biomasses like rice husk norazlina abu et al 2014 sewage sludge solid waste agrafioti et al 2014 norazlina abu et al 2014 oakwood and pinewood mohan et al 2007 empty fruit brunch biochar norazlina abu et al 2014 tectona and lagerstroemia leaves biochar verma and singh 2019 perilla leaves and japanese oak wood biochar niazi et al 2018a 2018b paper mill sludge derived biochar yoon et al 2017b tea waste cheraghi et al 2014 almond shell biochar ali et al 2020 wheat straw derived biochar tabassum et al 2019 potato peel and rice husk ash bibi et al 2017 and bagasse fly ash ali et al 2014 for possible as removal in aqueous solutions table 2 on the surface of biochar based materials various functional groups like oh cooh co and nh groups can be present for effectively removing metalloids from the aqueous media jiménez cedillo et al 2013 cheraghi et al 2014 norazlina abu et al 2014 tabassum et al 2019 fig 2 illustrates the sorption mechanisms for as iii and as v onto biochar in aqueous solutions possible adsorption mechanisms for as species are electrostatic attraction surface complexation ion exchange and precipitation niazi et al 2018b sattar et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2021 as stated above biochar possesses higher oxygen based functional groups which shows surface complexation with as and shifts in spectral bands after adsorption like from co to ester oh and cooh groups in which precipitation of as were observed using xrd and sem due to change in spectroscopic spectral bands of associated various functional groups after sorption of as onto biochar based materials abdel fattah et al 2015 wang et al 2015b at ph phpzc the higher content of functional groups onto biochar surfaces could be present on biochar surface which protonated them and favours the removal of anionic as species due to electrostatic force of attraction wang et al 2015b alkurdi et al 2019 in summary electrostatic interactions and surface complexation were prominent adsorption mechanisms for as species using biochar or modified biochar bakshi et al 2018 lata et al 2019 ahmad et al 2020 6 factors affecting adsorption of arsenic in the aqueous solution 6 1 effect of ph on arsenic adsorption aqueous solution chemistry is one of the crucial parameters in the sorption of as species which significantly influences the biochar surface behavior i e electro potential charges of biochar at varying ph and as speciation shaikh et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2021 for example niazi et al 2018b observed substantial influence on the adsorption of as iii and as v using oak wood biochar which showed an increase in removal efficiencies of as iii i e from 75 to 81 by increasing the ph 3 to 7 for as v 84 maximum removal efficiency was observed at ph 6 for alkaline solution i e ph from 7 to 10 removal efficiencies decreased for as iii and as v in contrast alam et al 2018 observed the influence of ph on the sorption of as iii as well as v using c fistula biochar and found maximum removal of 85 at ph 2 for as v and 78 at ph 6 for as iii zhou et al 2017b have found that as v adsorption increases from ph 2 to 4 then decreases sharply after ph 5 using magnetic gelatin modified biochar adsorption capacities decreased from 45 8 to 13 9 mg g as ph shifts from acidic to neutral similarly he et al 2018 reported that iron modified biochar has a high adsorption capacity of 86 12 at ph 6 as v adsorption increases for ph from 2 to 6 which then decreases until ph 10 the difference in ph had influenced as species in an aqueous solution as h2aso4 and haso4 2 dominate in between ph 3 to 6 and aso4 3 are mostly present at an alkaline solution deng et al 2008 wei et al 2016 in addition to electrostatic attraction co precipitation with hydroxyapatite ion exchange of as v and oh anions onto commercial bone char was observed at ph 10 resulting in maximum adsorption of 99 chen et al 2008 point of zero charges pzc influences the interaction between biochar and as types as phpzc is more than solution ph it favors the adsorption of cation via electrostatic interaction whereas anion adsorption favors in the solution when ph is more than phpzc of biochar qian et al 2013 samsuri et al 2013 wu et al 2017 luo et al 2019 nguyen et al 2019b synthesized iron modified biochar which had phpzc of 6 8 and they observed that as v removal increases when ph 6 8 and eventually decreases when ph 6 8 the variation in ph causes protonation and deprotonation of functional groups onto biochar surfaces at low ph the functional groups present on the biochar surface are protonated favoring the removal of anionic as species as ph is high deprotonation of functional groups occurs which favors the removal of cationic as species mukherjee et al 2021 6 2 influence of biochar doses on arsenic adsorption it is necessary to optimize the adsorbent biochar or modified biochar dose for maximum remediation of as by keeping the initial as concentration and ph constant yadav et al 2014 shaikh et al 2020 imran et al 2021 with an increase in biochar dose the removal efficiency increases up to the optimum level all active sites on the biochar surface area are occupied and saturated sanyang et al 2016 for example ali et al 2014 found that removal efficiency increases from 84 to 95 for as v and from 79 9 to 95 for as iii at biochar dosage of 1 5 3 g l similarly fan et al 2018 observed that sorption efficiency for as v enhanced from 2 2 to 96 with an increase in biochar dosage in the range of 0 4 5 g l whereas further increase in biochar doses had a negligible influence on the removal efficiencies a similar study by verma and singh 2019 identified the optimum biochar doses of 4 g l for as removal ranging from 1 to 5 g l at constant ph and temperature basically the sorption efficiency of as depends upon biochar doses which increases up to the saturation level of active sites thereafter negligible changes were observed 6 3 influence of arsenic concentration on adsorption the adsorption capacity of biochar based materials is significantly dependent and governed via the availability of initial as concentration in the aqueous solution with fixed biochar dose and low initial as concentration as ions can have active sites available onto the biochar surfaces whereas with an increase in as concentration without increasing the biochar doses adsorption decreases due to less availability of active sites for as ions and intra competition within as ions yadav et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019b verma and singh 2019 initial as concentrations decrease resistance during mass transfer between adsorbate and adsorbent lata et al 2019 for instance nham et al 2019 observed that the removal efficiency of as decreased from 92 8 to 78 6 with an increase in initial as concentration from 4 to 30 mg l using iron modified biochar to determine the influence of sorbate sanyang et al 2016 analyzed the as concentrations of 1 150 mg l while keeping other parameters like ph adsorbent dose and contact time constant adsorption rapidly increased from 0 423 to 27 56 mg g for 1 100 mg l as concentration likely due to the availability of huge active sites for sorption of as however further increase in as concentration from 100 to 150 mg l had no such increase in adsorption of as ions which indicates that biochar had attained an equilibrium state in which the active site would have exhausted and competition between as ions would have increased a similar concentration dependent trend is found by nguyen et al 2019b in which the amount of as adsorption increases up to 30 mg l by iron modified biochar initially more active sites can be available with low adsorbate concentrations however as the adsorbate concentration increases the progressive saturation of the active site occurs and eventually leads to a stage when no further increase in adsorption is observed alam et al 2018 6 4 effect of co existing interfering ions on arsenic adsorption many ions such as bicarbonate carbonate sulfate phosphate chloride etc are commonly present in the groundwater due to geochemical processes or anthropogenic activities baig et al 2014 hu et al 2015 shaikh et al 2020 these ions are reported to influence the adsorption process by competing with as ions for interaction with active sites present on the biochar surfaces a decrease in adsorption efficiency has been observed in the presence of these anions for example shaikh et al 2020 had observed a significant decrease in adsorption rate due to the presence of phosphate and other anions the structural and chemical similarity surface charge and particle size of biochar based materials are the factors responsible for reducing the adsorption efficiency due to phosphate ions shaikh et al 2020 a similar result was observed by alam et al 2018 where a sharp decrease in as adsorption was observed in the presence of phosphate ions phosphate and silicates are the main competitors for as adsorption in water due to the similarity between oxyanions of as silicate and phosphate which resulted in suppressed uptake of as ions lata et al 2019 besides carbonate and sulfate ions have much less effect on as uptake hu et al 2015 therefore the knowledge of existing ions present in natural groundwater via different sources is critical in designing the as removal experiments 7 effect of adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics on arsenic adsorption 7 1 adsorption isotherms langmuir freundlich temkin and dubininin redushkevich isotherms are standard adsorption isotherms being performed to investigate interactions between as biochar interfaces and adsorption behaviors van vinh et al 2015 duan et al 2017 ahmad et al 2020 langmuir isotherm describes the non linear monolayer adsorption on homogenous surfaces without interfering among the adsorbed particles via correlating the amount of solute sorbed onto the sorbent and the concentration of the initial contaminant table 3 freundlich isotherm enlightens non linear monolayer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces having interaction among adsorbed molecules the correlation coefficient r2 obtained from the langmuir isotherm shows higher adsorptive r2 values for as biochar material interactions by indicating monolayer non linear and homogeneous adsorption of both as iii and as v than the freundlich isotherm zhang et al 2013 van vinh et al 2015 duan et al 2017 wei et al 2019 for example iron oxide nanoneedles biochar fibers fe nn bfs showed fast adsorption of both as iii and as v which possesses monolayer non linear and homogeneous adsorption r2 0 93 of as over heterogeneous sorption wei et al 2019 similarly biochar with fe3o4 modification like biochar γ fe2o3 composite showed monolayer adsorption of as v onto the homogeneous biochar γ fe2o3 surfaces with no interactions among adsorbed molecules zhang et al 2013 in contrast biochar alooh nanocomposite reported monolayer non linear and heterogeneous adsorption which freundlich can better correlate than langmuir isotherm zhang and gao 2013 temkin isotherm explains that heat of sorption of a solute in a layer decreases linearly with surface coverage due to sorbent solute interactions where the solute sorption is defined by a uniform distribution of binding sites ahmad et al 2020 reported that langmuir redlich peterson and freundlich isotherms were best fitted for investigating the adsorption affinity of raw biochar zero valent iron biochar composite and silica biochar composite using date palm waste biomass indicating mono and multi layer adsorption of as v recently imran et al 2021 also performed different adsorption isotherms like langmuir freundlich temkin and dubininin redushkevich isotherms analyzing the adsorption capacity of mno and cuo modified biochar composites and equilibrium concentration of as v therein mno and cuo modified biochar composites showed monolayer non linear and heterogeneous adsorption process for as v i e freundlich isotherm was the best fitted r2 0 95 among the four selected isotherms in another study yoon et al 2017a also performed redlich peterson isotherm including langmuir and freundlich isotherms to investigate the adsorption capacities of engineered biochar with respect to as v equilibrium concentrations resulting in a high affinity of the binding sites as redlich peterson isotherm r2 0 9989 was best fitted for the adsorption of as v compared to langmuir and freundlich isotherms 7 2 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics describes the adsorption capacity of biochar for contaminants with respect to time the pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and elovich kinetics are standard kinetics being performed for analyzing the adsorption of both as iii and as v onto biochar based materials as summarized in table 3 zhang and gao 2013 zhang et al 2013 duan et al 2017 wei et al 2019 in an aqueous solution the sorption rate of as describes the diffusion state and accessibility of active sites onto the adsorbents zhang et al 2013 wei et al 2019 the pseudo first order kinetics refers to sorption kinetics as a function of residence time also known as the lagergren model whereas the pseudo second order kinetics explains the rate of chemical reaction having a direct relationship to the available active sites on the adsorbents engineered biochar has shown adsorption of as v due to the chemisorption process as pseudo second order kinetic r2 0 999 fits better than pseudo first order kinetic r2 0 897 yoon et al 2017a similarly fe nn bfs showed fast sorption of both as iii and as v than pristine biochar wei et al 2019 wei et al 2019 also reported that the pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 99 describes that the adsorption process occurred properly due to chemisorption of as as compared to the pseudo first order kinetics fe nn bfs possess phpzc of 3 7 therefore the chemisorption process dominates for as v due to electrostatic interactions between negatively charged biochar composites and as v ions however as iii adsorbed onto fe nn bfs due to surface complexation as iii ions of h3aso3 dominate in the range of ph 4 9 2 were as iii and feooh surface form as o fe bond wei et al 2019 besides this ahmad et al 2020 investigated pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich power function and intra particle diffusion kinetics which stated that the chemisorption adsorption process dominates the sorption of as v onto the raw biochar zero valent iron biochar composite and silica biochar composite obtained from date palm waste biomass it was observed that pseudo second order kinetics was the best fit r2 0 99 for all selected adsorbents for as v adsorption for biochar composites with fe3o4 modification pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich kinetics reported r2 higher than 0 90 for adsorption of as v using biochar γ fe2o3 composite the pseudo first order showed a higher r2 value of 0 97 than pseudo second order r2 0 96 and elovich r2 0 94 kinetics indicating mononuclear adsorption of as v onto biochar γ fe2o3 composite due to dispersion of γ fe2o3 zhang et al 2013 in contrast elovich kinetics r2 0 96 dominates on the removal of as v using biochar alooh nanocomposites as compared to pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics which recommended that heterogeneous sorption of as v onto biochar alooh composites had happened due to chemisorption kinetic process zhang and gao 2013 similarly other than iron loaded biochar van vinh et al 2015 stated that adsorption of as iii using zn loaded biochar is governed by the intra particle diffusion model r2 0 99 intra particle diffusion kinetic states the diffusion mechanism by understanding the sorption rate and degree of boundary layers in the adsorption process using metallic oxides imran et al 2021 used biochar composites via impregnating cuo and mno and performed intra particle diffusion and elovich kinetics including pseudo first order as well as pseudo second order kinetics mno and cuo modified biochar showed pseudo second order kinetics to be best fitted for adsorption of as v as compared with the other three kinetics 7 3 thermodynamics of arsenic adsorption onto biochar based materials several studies have reported that pyrolysis temperature affects the physio chemical properties of biochar based materials for both as iii and as v adsorption qian et al 2013 van vinh et al 2015 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 increase decrease in water environmental temperature can also influence the adsorption of as iii and as v onto biochar materials therefore various pristine and modified biochars showed endothermic as well as exothermic adsorption mechanisms depending upon gibbs free energy δg standard entropy δs and enthalpy δh at biochar as interaction in the aqueous phase several investigations have shown that both as iii and as v adsorption onto biochar materials is an endothermic and spontaneous process in nature as summarized in table 3 for the spontaneous nature of both as iii and as v adsorption δg showed negative values resulting in chemisorption and physisorption during the adsorption process at biochar based materials zhu et al 2016 navarathna et al 2019 alchouron et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 for example rahman et al 2021 reported negative values of δg for pristine zirconium modified and zirconium iron modified biochars in the range of 288 313 k temperature besides this the positive δs presented degree of freedom for adsorption of as iii and as v onto biochar based materials at solid liquid interfaces liu et al 2017 verma and singh 2019 rahman et al 2021 moreover alam et al 2018 also observed that the adsorption capacities of iron manganese modified biochar for as v enhanced with an increase in temperature from 288 to 308 k in addition tectona biochar have shown endothermic adsorption for as iii whereas exothermic process for as v in the temperature range of 298 328 k verma and singh 2019 van vinh et al 2015 reported an exothermic adsorption process for as iii using raw and zinc loaded pine cone biochar because positive values of δh and δs showed high randomness at sorbent solute interfaces detailed adsorption equilibrium isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis for different adsorbent materials as types and adsorption capacities are shown in table 3 8 sustainability and reusability of biochar based adsorbents the stability regeneration and reusability of novel biochar based sorbents are significant for evaluating sorbents from social environmental and economic perspectives pristine and modified biochars are novel adsorbents having high adsorption capacities for remediation of heavy metals resulting in low investment costs and potential applicability for wastewater treatment stability and regeneration of biochar based materials had been determined using zeta potential analysis of biochar materials and ph of aqueous solutions for example mnfe2o4 supported magnetic biochar possesses phpzc of 7 4 below which high adsorption 99 of as v was observed in the range of ph 3 7 due to the electrostatic attractions among positively charged magnetic biochar and negatively charged h2aso3r haso3r2 h2aso4 and haso4 2 anions wen et al 2021 the feasibility and cost effectiveness of biochar based materials mainly depend upon regeneration and reusability for specific sorption desorption cycles water hyacinth magnetic biochar has shown 100 adsorption of as v followed by 80 in the second cycle and reduced to 65 5 in the fourth cycle zhang et al 2016 consequently wen et al 2021 also reported that the desorption was performed using naoh at ph 10 to determine the desorption percentage reduced from 95 23 to 87 33 in fifth cycles for 20 mg l as v onto mnfe2o4 supported magnetic biochar however fe mn modified biochar and co precipitated mnfe2o4 modified biochar showed poor adsorption capacities for as v 47 and 60 respectively wang et al 2015b rahman et al 2021 applied nh4 2so4 hno3 and naoh as desorbing agents and observed that hno3 and naoh were more significant as compared with nh4 2so4 onto zirconium iron modified biochar than pristine zirconium modified biochars similarly he et al 2018 also performed the regeneration analysis using alkaline naoh nahco3 and nah2po4 solutions thus regeneration efficiencies were decreased from the first to third cycles besides this naoh and nacl have also been used for regeneration purposes of fe cu biochar composites resulting in the reduction of as removal efficiency from 95 to 89 and 87 respectively priyadarshni et al 2020 the reusability of biochar adsorbents is more suitable in column experiments for theoretical applications than batch sorption experiments thus naoh solution at ph 13 was used to regenerate fe nn bfs therein as iii and as v were decreased by 22 8 and 10 4 respectively using fe nn bfs after four cycles of regenerations wei et al 2019 amen et al 2020 assessed the removal efficiency of as iii using goethite modified biochar for 98 in the first cycle and 86 in the fourth cycle in the naoh solution regeneration process regeneration and reusability of modified biochars are significantly enhanced by the desorption calcination process in comparison with desorption only for example magnesium oxide modified biochar showed a reduction in as iii adsorption after fifth cycles due to desorption only whereas adsorption capacity remain same for as iii for the desorption calcination regeneration process chen et al 2021 generally regenerated biochar based materials lose either their functional groups or impregnated modified properties or effective porosity or available active sites onto biosorbents reducing removal efficiencies it is clear from the above discussion that modified biochars have achieved much high adsorption capacities of both as iii and as v than pristine biochars potential desorption and reusability of biochars in as contaminated water treatment for few cycles can be applied for wastewater treatment still the application of biochar based materials in fixed bed column experiments is yet to be investigated besides practical applicability is being investigated through continuous column experiments using saturated sand media wang et al 2021 tran et al 2022 therefore the implications of biochar based materials will significantly reduce arsenic contamination to groundwater systems mandoreba et al 2021 cuong et al 2022 recently cuong et al 2022 applied biochar filters to remediate arsenic contaminated real groundwater which possesses a low adsorption capacity of 2 88 mg g from the above analysis as modified biochars have higher adsorption capacity than raw biochar via batch experiments we recommended implications of modified biochars to analyze arsenic remediation from contaminated real groundwater 9 conclusions future scopes and recommendations biochar has significant potential for soil health management carbon sequestration sustainable source of energy treatment of contaminated wastewater and global warming mitigation and acts as a catalyst for achieving sustainable development goals in the 21st century adsorption of as ions using biochar based materials depends on solution chemistry i e ph and ionic strength biochar dosage initial concentration residence time co existing ions etc modified biochar i e modifications with different metal oxides hydroxides alkali acid activation metallic salts etc have reported high adsorption capacity than pristine biochar in aqueous solutions therefore this review summarized the potential scope of biochar based materials for removing as species i e as iii and as v ions along with challenges and future scope of biochar synthesis and characterization of pristine and modified biochar have been discussed in detail including pre post treatment approach and physiochemical analysis of biochar based materials biochar sorbents synthesized at high temperature showed higher adsorption capacities for as ions than low temperature synthesized biochars adsorption mechanisms of as ions onto biochar based sorbents have been supported with isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics analysis adsorption mechanisms for both as iii and as v were discussed in which isotherms depicted non linear monolayer adsorption on either homogenous or heterogeneous surfaces whereas chemisorption and physisorption kinetics and endothermic sorption were observed optimally overall this review work summarizes the sustainable application of biochar based materials and discusses the key issues involved in removing as from contaminated water resources however a better understanding of modified and raw biochar based on biomass and feedstocks can vary physical and chemical characteristics impacting the sorption efficiency of as needed to be focused on optimizing biochar sorption capacities singh et al 2021 significant research has been conducted for as contaminated water treatment mainly using batch sorption flow systems therefore significant challenges and scope related to implications of biochar sorbents in continuous flow systems exist to scale them up for commercial and industrial purposes adsorption of as onto biochar occurred mainly due to chemisorption mechanism in which as anions strongly bonded with biochar surfaces that reduced the regeneration capability and functionality for reuse overall resulting in reduced as sorption efficiencies despite numerous investigations on the sorption of as iii and as v onto biochar sorbents there are still significant gaps in the current state of knowledge that need to be addressed therefore several concerns are highlighted and recommended for future studies chen et al 2021 reported that regenerated magnesium of oxide modified biochar via desorption calcination showed consistency in adsorption capacity of as iii than regeneration with desorption only therefore it is recommended to perform desorption calcination for regeneration and reusability of modified biochars the idea to synthesize mixed feedstock s biochar including their modification to optimize the removal of several contaminants in a continuous flow manner aims to enhance the discharge water quality and reduce the cost of wastewater treatment for wastewater treatment including pristine biochar modified biochars have shown significant adsorption of as iii and as v however very few research has been done to mitigate as from paddy fields using modified biochars via decreasing mobility and bioavailability of as in paddy field soils therefore mitigation of as contaminated dietary is essential for global food safety and security ftir spectroscopy has been extensively applied before and after as adsorption for spectral information besides more systematic research is needed in the future on the use of integrated spectroscopic techniques like xafs μ raman spectroscopy μ xrf etc for a better understanding of redox transformation and adsorption mechanisms for as adsorption onto biochar surfaces safe disposal discard of pollutants loaded biochars after adsorption is quite challenging thus roy et al 2022 had attempted to assess the recycling of as loaded biochars via vermitechnology as an eco friendly recycling approach therefore microbial activities have the potential for further recycling and reusability promoting micro and macro level entrepreneurship for utilizing agricultural wastes as biochar energy production etc can gain attention via policy intervention and help to mitigate global warming and generate employment attention needs to be given to community based as removal systems and public awareness especially to women and children belonging to rural areas several countries are struggling for clean drinking water therefore biochar can play a significant role in providing clean water via as contaminated water treatment there should be action calls for on site and low cost as removal techniques for monitoring and desalination in as affected regions pilot scale research should be encouraged for life cycle assessment of modified biochars and avoid economic losses due to as contaminated water on human and animal health considering interdisciplinary and technological advancement biochar based sorbents are considered environmentally sound technologies and can contribute to achieving sustainable development goals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

in water tomar et al 2013 2014 mohan et al 2012 lacson et al 2021 however countries like the usa china india canada srilanka pakistan mongolia argentina thailand norway turkey mexico kenya korea ethiopia estonia iran tanzania etc are most suffering from this ayenew 2008 ali et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2006 ijumulana et al 2020 the geochemistry related to fluoride contamination is also linked ayoob et al 2006 vithanage et al 2015 jacks et al 2005 nordstrom et al 2022 ijumulana et al have studied spatial variability of the distribution of fluoride in the drinking water sources in north eastern tanzania ijumulana et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2022 the groundwater chemistry of fluoride in the indian context has been reported jacks et al 2005 fluoride is widely distributed in different forms in nature viz air soils rocks and water fluoride is one of the top 15 most abundant elements on earth fluorine can not be found in the environment as it possesses higher reactivity it exists in two forms organic and inorganic ponikvar 2008 inorganic form is much more abundant than organic ones in the environment the fluoride is present in other minerals like sellaite fluorspar caf2 cryolite na3al f6 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3 f topaz al2 sio4 f2 ozsvath 2009 kimambo 2019 it is reported that 12 million tons of fluoride are available from the 85 million tons of total fluoride on earth

in medical geology i e health effects due to natural geological factors finkelman et al 2001 bundschuh 2017 water is considered a vehicle for fluoride in the living body jagtap et al 2012 most of the fluoride in water occurs in inorganic form making it more deleterious than organic fluoride fluoride in drinking water is known for both beneficial and ruinous effects on health it depends on concentration it is invisible poison similar to arsenic in groundwater the high concentration of fluoride 1 5 mg l may lead to chronic fluoride toxicity manifest as dental skeletal fluorosis that results in mottling of teeth and calcification of ligaments while lower concentration 0 8 mg l results in dental caries vithanage et al 2015 the maximum permissible limit for fluoride in drinking

intake of f more than permissible limit results in several problems e g growth retardation structural changes in dna and loss of mobility ijumulana 2021 who 2011 fawell et al 2006 mohanta and mohanty 2018 an increase in the risk of bone fractures occurs at a total intake of fluoride of 14 mg day whereas an intake of 6 mg day increases the risk of bone effects who 2004a 2004b as fluoride is a powerful oxidizing agent it affects cellular subcellular constituents of body tissues fluoride is considered an enzyme inhibitor hormone disruptor and neurotoxin the calcified tissues viz bone and tooth are damaged and dental and skeletal fluorosis are common susheela 2007 the fluorosis is somewhat different from other bone disorders viz ankylosing spondylitis osteoporosis idiopathic backache and osteoarthrosis susheela and toteja 2018 the muscle protein viz actin and myosin filaments metabolism is a disorder due to the inhibition of enzymes by fluoride kathpalia and susheela 1978 the disorder of neuronal functions results in disturb in muscle activities kaul et al 1974 higher fluoride content in the body results in anemia jain and susheela 1987 susheela and jain 1986 a pregnant

are also quite common jagtap et al 2012 the consumption above the optimal level results in dental and skeletal fluorosis it affects the dental surface and appears lustreless opaque the colouration is turned to be yellow to dark brown thus pitting and brittleness of teeth results the skeletal fluorosis including sporadic pain back stiffness picking and tingling in the limbs muscle weakness chronic fatigue abnormal calcium deposits in bones and ligaments meenakshi and maheshwari 2006 different approaches can minimize the fluoride problem in water 1 exploring alternate water sources in which fluoride content is minimum 2 safe disposal of fluoride containing wastes 3 improvement strategy of nutritional status of the population at risk 4 tackling of excess fluoride from water viz defluoridation there has been growing interest in water purification systems the interest relates to many techniques such as adsorption coagulation and precipitation membrane separations in the present review the advantages of membrane processes and different influencing factors viz nature of membranes the effect of ions ph feed concentration applied pressure are focussed the hybrid process related to the membranes and membrane linked other approaches is also emphasized the strategic approach to tackle fluoride reject water is also covered 2 techniques of defluoridation many experts researchers are involved in overcoming the problem of fluoride remediation in drinking water various conventional and non conventional techniques have been employed to alleviate human suffering however all available defluoridation approaches have limitations in techno feasibility ease of operation maintenance and socioeconomics aspects some of the defluoridation techniques fig 1 are mentioned with their features 2 1 coagulation and precipitation it is the process of increasing the particle size through aggregation coagulation succeeded by precipitation lessens the undesirable fluoride contents from the water coagulants may be natural or synthetic the common precipitants viz lime and ca salt are recognized for fluoride three types of coagulants are there inorganic organic and polyelectrolytes razbe and razbe 2013 one of the discussed techniques is the nalgonda technique developed by national environmental engineering research institute neeri nagpur 1961 in this defluoridation arena nawlakhe et al 1975 alum and lime are used for the chemical dosage in this technique coagulation showed better defluoridation efficiency compared to adsorption by aluminium hydroxide flocs in the ph range 6 9 gong et al 2012 the technique with its features is in the ensemble table 1 2 2 electrocoagulation ec the coagulation process initiated by electric charge is featured in this technique the different parameters viz current density fluoride concentration ph residence time control the efficiency of the process mills 2000 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 the technique with its features is in the ensemble table 1 2 3 dialysis the transport of solutes through the membrane is the key feature of dialysis the membranes pores are less prohibitive than the pressure driven membrane technique hichour et al 1999a 1999b garmes et al 2002 alkan et al 2008 the driving force involved in dialysis is the concentration difference the technique with its features is in the ensemble table 1 the process was based on a chemical po tential difference between two compartments separated by an ion exchange membrane however donnan dialysis is not ap plied in industry mainly because of its slow kinetics although it has some economical and energy efﬁcient advantages 2 4 electrodialysis the electrodialysis process is governed by electricity through ion exchange membranes adhikary et al 1989 amor et al 1998 kabay et al 2008 two membranes i e cation anion exchange are used in this process an anion exchange membrane removes fluoride the electrical field is applied through an electrical source the two electrode compartments are separated to prevent the alteration of the composition of the solution which electrode reactions could hamper polyethylene polystyrene pe pst based interpolymer based ion exchange membranes showed the defluoridation potential bhadja et al 2016 water circulation through the dilute concentrate and electrode rinse compartments sahli et al 2007 various parameters control the performance of defluoridation viz applied voltage tds of feed water the flow rate of water and temperature amor et al 1998 the technique with its features is in the ensemble table 1 2 5 ion exchange ion exchange is the process in which the charged ions are exchanged from the surrounding medium to solid support releasing the ions from their site of a similar charge the fluoride ion is replaced by the charged ions of the resin for defluoridation the resin s driving force for the substitution of charged ions i e cl is the stronger electronegativity of the fluoride ions thus ion exchange is a physical separation phenomenon of exchanging ions the exchange behavior of ions is dependent on the types of the functional group onto the solid support different ion exchangers viz fe2o3 al2o3 x h2o indion fr 10 ind ceralite ira 400 cer polyacrylamide modified with ce so4 2 4h2o al no3 3 9h2o and zrocl2 8h2o are reported chubar et al 2005 meenakshi et al 2007 sundaram et al 2009 table 1 depicts the features and limitations of the technique 2 6 adsorption the adsorption technique is straightforward with a broad assortment of adsorbents it is based on the strong physical attractive force attached to fluoride to adsorbents different adsorbents viz activated alumina activated carbon coated silica gel calcite carbon nanotube activated sawdust activated fly ash magnesia serpentine tri calcium phosphate bone charcoal etc are used maliyekkal et al 2006 chai et al 2013 uses of biosorbents rice husk tea ash activated coconut shell powder groundnut shell coffee husk wheat husk neem leaves pimple leaves neem and pimple leaves mix are also there chakrabarty and sarma 2012 mondal et al 2012 carbon nanotubes the promising adsorbent are capable of defluorinating water de luca and candamano 2021 ruan et al 2017 affonso et al 2020 tanaka et al 2002 experimented with the defluoridation behavior of zr iv complexes with the chelating resins cma carboxymethylamine and ida iminodiacetic acid it showed that fluoride ions reaction rate with zr cma is faster than zr ida resin the modified adsorbent by specific metal ions on conventional adsorbents such as zirconium iv impregnated collagen fiber chelating resin carbon al impregnated chitosan fe iii loaded ligand exchange cotton cellulose adsorbent alum impregnated activated alumina are reported liao et al 2005 sathish et al 2008 swain et al 2009 zhao et al 2008 membrane adsorbents viz amyloid fibril zro2 zirconia polysulfone zr mof s also showed promising defluoridation activities zhang et al 2019 he et al 2014 2016 mohamed et al 2021 the adsorbent characteristics such as selectivity reuse potential and physical and chemical stability are among the drawbacks of this technique that require improvement the defluoridation activities of y yttrium iii based nanoparticle polyethersulfone zr iv metalloporphyrin grafted fe3o4 nanoparticles mg doped nano ferrihydrite are quite promising cui et al 2019 poursaberi et al 2012 mohapatra et al 2012 novel hydroxyapatite nanoparticles prepared in bacteria bacillus subtilis mediated surfactin also showed their defluoridation capabilities maity et al 2018 table 1 depicts the features and limitations of the technique 2 7 membrane process researchers and technologists focussed on the membrane process considering the above techniques the membrane processes have their potential in a different arena giwa et al 2017 dasgupta et al 2015 liu et al 2013 sikder et al 2012 the movement of membrane science and technology in defluoridation activities is reflected in the research trend analysis of the sciencedirect database the data showed 20 40 of relevant peer reviewed studies damtiea et al 2019 nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are the best technologies to tackle defluoridation nf membranes require lower pressure and energy compared to ro membranes the transport mechanisms related to the separation of electrolytes are described in detail bhattacharya et al 2004 the membrane processes have advantages in terms of their versatilities it effectively prevents suspended solids inorganic toxins organic micro pollutants pesticides and microorganisms it can deal with the bulk volume resulting in high productivity thus it can be tagged with increasing efficiency and reduced cost it is simplified unlike other chemical processes the addition of chemicals is not needed unlike other methods it can be operated under a wide ph range depending on the nature of the membranes it has the option to couple with other chemical processes interference because of the presence of other ions is not critical like other processes 3 influencing factors elucidating the defluoridation performance through membranes is of paramount importance in guiding the water treatment process the defluoridation through membranes depends on several factors viz nature of the membrane other ions feed ph feed concentration applied pressure fig 2 depicts the influencing factors of membrane performances 3 1 nature of membranes the defluoridation performance is regulated by tuning the physicochemical properties of the membrane as discussed above a tiny amount of fluoride is needed for well being the requirements for partial defluoridation are appropriate by nanofiltration nf and low pressure ro membranes the separation scale is in between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis it would be advantageous to use nf membranes over ro membranes to increase water permeability with low operating pressure algieri et al 2021 thus they have relatively low operational maintenance costs and energy savings farsi et al 2014 diawara 2008 hu et al 2006 experimented with defluoridation through negatively charged commercial thin film composite tfc membranes ds 5 dl osmonics ds 51 hl osmonics and sr 1 koch fluid system the defluoridation performance followed ds 51 hl ds 5 dl sr 1 the performances depended on pore size and different surface potential table 1 the defluoridation through ntr 7250 polyvinyl alcohol based ntr 7450 polysulfone based nitto denko membranes were studied the separation performances were 70 4 and 72 respectively the surface potential explained this difference ntr 7450 10 mv ntr 7250 5 mv choi et al 2001 tahaikt et al 2007 found nf90 exhibited 99 1 separation compared to nf 400 which showed 77 26 separation for 10 mg l naf doped solution the defluoridation was done through nf90 nf400 polyamide spiral wound module nf ro pilot plant e 3039 supplied by tia company technologies industrielles appliquées france the defluoridation through nf70 polyamide mwco 200 desal 5dl polyamide mwco 150 300 mt08 pes based polyamide mwco 200 membranes showed the rejection 91 83 and 90 respectively diawara et al 2005 shen and schäfer et al found that the defluoridation through nf90 is higher 92 than nf270 67 because of the smaller pore sizes shen and schäfer 2014 a similar report was also there for the same membranes hoinkis et al 2011 on the other hand the nf90 membrane showed lower rejection than bw30 because of the larger pore size pontie et al 2013 the membrane charge densities could also affect the separation performances the study dealt with different membranes nf1 charge density 65 5 mol m3 nf2 charge density 16 5 mol m3 nf 20 charge density 36 9 mol m3 sepro membranes inc usa the order of rejection nf1 nf20 nf 2 followed the membrane charge density order chakrabortty et al 2013 in a different study tfc sr3 20mv showed better defluoridation efficiency compared to nf 270 14mv as the surface charge predominates though they have similar mwco 167da and 180da shen et al 2015 3 2 effect of ions the defluoridation performance through membranes has been substantially influenced by associated ions the influence of related cations is reported which showed that the fluoride ions are more retained when associated with monovalent cations than multivalent the order followed rnaf rkf rcaf2 and was explained in terms of convective transport contribution it was higher for fluoride ions associated with ca2 than fluoride ions related to other monovalent cations in addition to that transport parameters reflection co efficient σ solute permeability co efficient ps were also correlated the ps value was lower for reduced solvated cations na and k than more solvated ca2 the reflection coefficient σ i e proportional to the diffusion coefficient was higher for na k ions than ca2 bejaoui et al 2014 the defluoridation was greatly affected by the presence of nacl during the filtration through nf90 dow film tech and ro sg osmonics bejaoui et al 2014 the rejection decreased for nf90 from 97 to 85 and ro sg from 97 to 76 membranes in the presence of nacl the decrease depended on the nature of the membranes the higher ionic strength due to nacl resulted in high osmotic pressure and membrane charge screening bejaoui et al 2014 zaidi et al 2015 the screened layer reduced the electrostatic repulsions between the fluoride in solution and negatively charged membranes choi et al 2001 studied the influence of co existed ions on defluoridation through ntr 7250 and ntr 7450 nitto denko membranes the defluoridation performance of the membranes was 70 4 and 72 0 respectively for the sole major component in the matrix in contrast the performance deteriorated 55 2 and 63 6 respectively in the presence of mg ii cl and so4 ions fluoride ions permeate more to match the na ions in the permeate in the sulfate or it could be explained by donnan equilibrium however the defluoridation performances of ntr 7250 and ntr 7450 membranes are 38 7 41 4 and 10 15 2 in the mixture mg ii cl and so4 ions the behavior was explained by the mg ii permeation to maintain electric neutrality in the permeate the defluoridation performances containing nacl and na2so4 through nf70 desal5dl mt08 membranes showed exciting results diawara et al 2005 with the increase of na2so4 concentration from 50 to 200 mg l the defluoridation performance increased the size effect of sulphates might result in shielding occurrence along the membranes but in the absence of chloride ions in the mixture the defluoridation performance was not enhanced the screening effect increased with the na ion concentration and thus reduced membrane solute electrostatic repulsion resulting in easier permeating less hydrated anions the replacement of na2so4 by nitrate ions still resulted in screening along the membrane it showed different results as no3 ions with their lowest hydration energy passed preferentially to the chloride ions hoinkis et al 2011 observed no changes of fluoride rejection in the presence of bicarbonate in the feed matrix for the two membranes nf90 and nf 270 3 3 effect of ph the ph of the feed solution plays a role in defluoridation the ph influences the nature of the membranes and their profiles the ph affects the rejection of fluoride ions with the donnan and dielectric effects both rooted in electrostatic interactions the weak alkaline environment favored defluoridation performances through the negatively charged membrane qing and li 2009 fig 3 depicts the defluoridation profiles with ph variation it suggests the performance rejection and flux improvement for polyamide membranes chakrabortty et al 2013 richards et al 2010 chakrabortty et al 2013 demonstrated the variation in separation performances for three polyamide membranes nf1 nf2 and nf 20 from e merck germany the low value of pka 3 16 suggested that it existed as an ionic form above 3 16 the strong h bonding between the water and fluoride resulted in low rejection at acidic ph arora et al 2004 mohammadi et al 2003 there was the tendency to diffuse hf through membranes at ph 3 0 and thus the rejection was minimal simons 1993 the free fluoride ions increased as ph elevated and hence the separation attributed to the electrostatic effects particularly the donnan effect the flux enhancement was noticed as the elevated ph reduced the viscosity of the feed solution and thus concentration polarization chakrabortty et al 2013 the fluoride s charge density made it a large hydrated one i e 0 352 nm which operated the steric exclusion pathways richards et al 2010 the defluoridation through bw30 espa4 nf90 tfc s utc 60 and utc 80 membranes was conducted for single and mixed solutes the functionalities of bw 30 cooh amine nf90 cooh amine tfc s conh were unfolded the background electrolyte mixture of nacl and nahco3 was taken for the latter the separation was low in an acidic solution increasing as ph was elevated the trend was similar in mixed solutions for all the membranes mi et al 2006 boussu et al 2006 the nature of membranes impacted the variation of separation performances on ph bejaoui et al experimented with fluoride separation through ro sg and nf 90 membranes bejaoui et al 2014 the experiment was done through ro sg and nf 90 membranes the membranes functionalities cooh amine controlled the ph variation performances nf 90 showed a better variation from ph acidic to basic the flux variation is also influenced by their charge behaviour even their isoelectric point ph at 7 for nf90 and 7 5 for ro sg hurndall et al 1992 al amoudi et al 2008 there were some contrasting results where fluoride rejection decreased in strongly alkaline conditions it was due to the various influencing factors viz f and co3 2 interaction concentration polarization higher salt concentration and ph owusu agyeman et al 2017 3 4 effect of feed concentration though the insignificant effect of osmotic pressure in a low concentration range the feed concentration influences the separation abilities through the membrane the separation performance of f through the charged membrane was explained by donnan partitioning the donnan potential arises for the negatively charged membranes because of the higher cationic concentration the tendency of anions viz f was far away from the feed matrix membranes resulting in rejection the increase of feed salinity from 10 to 100 mg l for fluoride reduced donnan potential and thus separation resulted in the decreasing trend bartels et al 2005 saxena et al 2021 saxena et al 2021 experimented defluoridation through poly piperazine amide membranes derived from reusable polysulfone membranes all the membranes showed a decreasing trend the fluoride ion partition co efficient in the membrane solution interface increased as the feed concentration f increased hu and dickson 2006 it resulted in an increase in anion concentration at the membrane solution interface thus separation decreased at higher concentrations a similar observation was also reported by using alfa laval lab stak m20 plate frame membrane module moran et al 2018 the different trend in separation behaviour between nf 90 and ro sg membranes was reported bejaoui et al 2014 nf90 membrane showed the increased rejection behaviour as the concentration 2 10 4 to 2 10 2 mol l similar behaviour was also reflected in tahaikt et al 2007 study dielectric exclusion could explain the behaviour on the other hand the ro sg membrane showed different separation behaviour with the concentration the behaviour could be explained by increased osmotic pressure and charge screening mnif et al 2010 paugam et al 2003 shen et al 2014 narrated different experimental results tahaikt et al 2008 favre réguillon et al 2008 rossiter et al 2010 hoyer et al 2014 into ensemble fig 4 3 5 effect of pressure the separation of charged solutes especially fluoride ions is greatly influenced by the applied pressure during the filtration processes the reasoned rule is that the separation of fluoride ions increases with the applied pressure it indicates that convective transport operates over diffusion at high pressure whereas diffusive transport operates at low pressure in general fluoride separation is practically unaffected by pressure variation as the passage is mainly due to diffusion in a higher pressure regime convection has virtually shown no effect and thus the separation lhassani et al 2001 contrary to the above observation some results related to pressure variation were observed chakrabortty et al 2013 experimented with the separation behavior of three membranes nf1 nf2 nf 20 sepro membranes inc usa applying pressure 5 16 kgf cm2 chakrabortty et al 2013 the results suggested that nf2 is the loosest whereas nf20 is the tightest membrane the defluoridation performance increased with the pressure range mentioned this similar behavior was also reflected in different experimental studies pontié et al 2008 lhassani et al 2001 the uncoupled nature of solvent and solute flux follows the solution diffusion mechanistic pathway whereas electrostatic repulsion is another mechanism for controlled ion transport arora et al 2004 mnif et al 2010 demonstrated osmonics spiral module equipped with hl 2514 t membrane the performance variation was correlated using the model of kedem katchalsky the model is based on irreversible thermodynamics and both fluxes solvent and solute flux are coupled the effect of pressure could be correlated to the solvent flux j w lp δ p σ δ where jw is the flux of solute δ the difference in osmotic pressure σ reflection coefficient lp pure water permeability the fluoride separation increased with the pressure fig 5 depicts that the lower feed concentration had a minimal effect on the pressure variation ramdani et al also reported similar observations ramdani et al 2018 it corresponds to the limiting rejection of fluoride ions in the mentioned operating conditions 3 6 durability and cyclability of membranes membrane durability is one of the issues linked with performance nf membranes of membrane filtration unit pall corporation showed a decrease in rejection rate from 69 3 to 63 3 during the 250 h diawara et al 2011 in the beginning the membrane absorbed fluoride ions apart from the rejection this trend was followed during the first 10 h after that the membrane performance was not dependent on absorption the defluoridation rate was 97 initially and became stable 98 1 during filtration time for the lpro low pressure reverse osmosis membrane chakrabortty et al 2013 indicated the concentration polarization layer decreased the permeate flux during long time operation the time dependence flux variation was observed in three types of membranes nf1 nf2 nf 20 sepr membranes inc usa the flux decline was maximum for nf20 membranes i e 19 three membranes could reuse by rinsing 0 1 n naoh and 10 2 m hno3 the slight flux decline implied that the performance was reversible for these membranes evangeline et al 2019 experimented with iron oxide containing polyethersulfone cellulose acetate 18 2 wt blend membrane for that evangeline et al 2019 the durability depended on the iron oxide content of the system the membrane with fe2 o3 nanoparticles 0 5 wt the performance up to 8 cycles was convincing and without much loss 4 in the fluoride removal efficiency there was a severe decrease in the fluoride removal efficiency after eight cycles the study confirmed that the fe2o3 nanoparticles composite membranes resulted in better durability and convincing antifouling property the regeneration study was conducted through sodium hydroxide in the adsorptive membrane the rejection profile of ca fe al mn chitosan 92 8 wt membranes was 68 8 48 for feed with a fluoride concentration of 3 8 mg l during three successive cycles the higher concentration of naoh 0 01 m affected the membrane and could not be reused chaudhary et al 2020 the carbonized bone meal cbm impregnated uf grade hollow fiber mixed matrix membrane mmm showed an interesting result in the dynamic long term operation the permeate concentration almost remained the same during the initially filtered volume 600 800 ml 9 10 h of filtration it was due to the rapid adsorption of fluoride by impregnated cbm in hollow fiber mmm however after 900 ml of filtered volume concentration increased due to saturation of active sites in cbm in the matrix the membrane was regenerated by sodium hydroxide the filtered water in the first run was 1400 ml whereas in the second run it was 1200 ml in the breakthrough time 19 h chatterjee et al 2020 4 hybrid techniques the hybrid techniques cover the synergic approach of two or multiple techniques to counter the problem to improve the defluoridation technique emphasis is also given to hybrid techniques considering membrane technology is part of it it is well understood that microfiltration mf is unsuitable for defluoridation but it can be a

nunes et al 2018 used montmorillonite mmt and ca hydroxyapatite as adsorbents coupled with the poly vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp membranes nunes et al 2018 thaci et al 2015 achieved a high recovery of fluorides 99 by cellulose acetate membranes with fly ash pretreatment micellar enhanced filtration technique meuf is one of the energy saving techniques also applied for defluoridation the surfactants are added to the feed water in micellar concentration the micelle formed around fluoride moieties thus the effective size resulted higher and the ultrafiltration membrane separated the moieties klimonda et al 2017 used the meuf technique with two different membranes i e cellulose 5 kda and polyethersulfone 4 kda for the defluoridation 5 membrane linked other approaches apart from nanofiltration and reverse osmosis techniques different techniques are linked with defluoridation brião et al 2016 suggested a straightforward approach that uses a mixture of ro permeates water with the groundwater to economize the drinking water production to counter the limitations viz concentration polarization of ro nf regarding the permeate quality membrane distillation

management of fluoride contaminated water from the different defluoridation processes is one of the strategies to counter the rebirth of the same problem the use of fluoride loaded waste materials in concrete mixes is one of the novel approaches to counter it one of the friendly approaches to dispose of fluoride sludge in concrete enhances concrete properties ismail et al 2015 fluoride containing ro reject brackish water for the irrigation of halophytes could be a sustainable and eco friendly approach the halophytes are salt resistant or salt tolerant plants that can grow in moderate to high saline soil by utilizing salinity for their growth greenway et al 1980 reports are also there to cultivate salicornia brachiate using rejected water containing a high fluoride concentration in the different experimental conditions singh et al 2018 7 conclusion as water is a treated global resource the fluorine in the aquatic environment problem is considered a threat to human life the chaos associated with the redundant fluoride in drinking water is highly endemic the excess amount of fluoride ions in the human body negatively affects health different methods viz coagulation precipitation adsorption processes dialysis and membrane of removing fluoride from water have been practiced the development of defluoridation techniques is not static or stagnant it is a dynamic process and intertwined with the local economy membrane technologies have stepped ahead not only avoiding the addition of something in the water it is also clean and best suited for a bulk volume of water the performances of the low pressure driven membranes in the defluoridation of water are praiseworthy different influencing factors viz nature of the membrane water matrix control the defluoridation performance improving membrane technology optimum energy use and tackling the concentrate is the future scope of membrane applications the synergic combination of the two or multiple

in water tomar et al 2013 2014 mohan et al 2012 lacson et al 2021 however countries like the usa china india canada srilanka pakistan mongolia argentina thailand norway turkey mexico kenya korea ethiopia estonia iran tanzania etc are most suffering from this ayenew 2008 ali et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2006 ijumulana et al 2020 the geochemistry related to fluoride contamination is also linked ayoob et al 2006 vithanage et al 2015 jacks et al 2005 nordstrom et al 2022 ijumulana et al have studied spatial variability of the distribution of fluoride in the drinking water sources in north eastern tanzania ijumulana et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2022 the groundwater chemistry of fluoride in the indian context has been reported jacks et al 2005 fluoride is widely distributed in different forms in nature viz air soils rocks and water fluoride is one of the top 15 most abundant elements on earth fluorine can not be found in the environment as it possesses higher reactivity it

results in mottling of teeth and calcification of ligaments while lower concentration 0 8 mg l results in dental caries vithanage et al 2015 the maximum permissible limit for fluoride in drinking water set by who is 1 5 mg l over 300 million people worldwide use groundwater contaminated with fluoride as a source of drinking water two hundred million people suffer from fluoride related diseases like dental and skeletal fluorosis worldwide and out of these 66 million in india including 6 million children adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 haritash et al 2018 apart from the fluorosis long term intake of f more than permissible limit results in several problems e g growth retardation structural changes in dna and loss of mobility ijumulana 2021 who 2011 fawell et al 2006 mohanta and mohanty 2018 an increase in the risk of bone fractures occurs at a total intake of fluoride of 14 mg day whereas an intake of 6 mg day increases the risk of bone effects who 2004a 2004b as fluoride is a powerful oxidizing agent it affects cellular subcellular constituents of body tissues fluoride is considered an enzyme inhibitor hormone disruptor and neurotoxin the calcified tissues viz bone and tooth are damaged and dental and skeletal fluorosis are common susheela 2007 the fluorosis is somewhat different from other bone disorders viz ankylosing spondylitis osteoporosis idiopathic backache

woman who suffers from fluorosis could not absorb iron and other supplements thus infant and maternal mortality is an issue del 2020 fluorosis can also influence the hormonal imbalance resulting in the mentally disabled infant it affects neurological gastrointestinal urinary tract liver kidney digestive respiratory excretory function the associated problems of depression nausea abdominal pain are also quite common jagtap et al 2012 the consumption above the optimal level results in dental and skeletal fluorosis it affects the dental surface and appears lustreless opaque the colouration is turned to be yellow to dark brown thus pitting and brittleness of teeth results the skeletal fluorosis including sporadic pain back stiffness picking and tingling in the limbs muscle weakness chronic fatigue abnormal calcium deposits in bones and ligaments meenakshi and maheshwari 2006 different approaches can minimize the fluoride problem in water 1 exploring alternate water sources in which fluoride content is minimum 2 safe disposal of fluoride containing wastes 3 improvement strategy of nutritional status of the population at risk 4 tackling of excess fluoride from water viz defluoridation there has been growing interest in water purification systems the interest relates to many techniques such as adsorption coagulation and precipitation membrane separations in the present review the advantages of membrane processes and different influencing factors viz nature of membranes the effect of ions ph feed concentration applied pressure are focussed the hybrid process related to the membranes and membrane linked other approaches is also emphasized the strategic approach to tackle fluoride reject water is also covered 2 techniques of defluoridation many experts researchers are involved in overcoming the problem of fluoride remediation in drinking water various conventional and non conventional techniques have been employed to alleviate human suffering however all available defluoridation approaches have limitations in techno feasibility ease of operation maintenance and socioeconomics aspects some of the defluoridation techniques fig 1 are mentioned with their features 2 1 coagulation and precipitation it is the process of increasing the particle size through aggregation coagulation succeeded by precipitation lessens the undesirable fluoride contents from the water coagulants may be natural or synthetic the common precipitants viz lime and ca salt are recognized for fluoride three types of coagulants are there inorganic organic and polyelectrolytes razbe and razbe 2013 one of the discussed techniques is the nalgonda technique developed by national environmental engineering research institute neeri nagpur 1961 in this defluoridation arena nawlakhe et al 1975 alum and lime are used for the chemical dosage in this technique coagulation showed better defluoridation efficiency compared to adsorption by aluminium hydroxide flocs in the ph range 6 9 gong et al 2012 the technique with its features is in the ensemble table 1 2 2 electrocoagulation ec the coagulation process initiated by electric charge is featured in this technique the different parameters viz current density fluoride concentration ph residence time control the efficiency of the process mills 2000 emamjomeh and sivakumar 2009 the technique with its features is in the ensemble table 1 2 3 dialysis the transport of solutes through the membrane is the key feature of dialysis the membranes pores are less prohibitive than the pressure driven membrane technique hichour et al 1999a 1999b garmes et al 2002 alkan et al 2008 the driving force involved in dialysis is the concentration difference the technique with its features is in the ensemble table 1 the process was based on a chemical po tential difference between two compartments separated by an ion exchange membrane however donnan dialysis is not ap plied in industry mainly because of its slow kinetics although it has some economical and energy efﬁcient advantages 2 4 electrodialysis the electrodialysis process is governed by electricity through ion exchange membranes adhikary et al 1989 amor et al 1998 kabay et al 2008 two membranes i e cation anion exchange are used in this process an anion exchange membrane removes fluoride the electrical field is applied through an electrical source the two electrode compartments are separated to prevent the alteration of the composition of the solution which electrode reactions could hamper polyethylene polystyrene pe pst based interpolymer based ion exchange membranes showed the defluoridation potential bhadja et al 2016 water circulation through the dilute concentrate and electrode rinse compartments sahli et al 2007 various parameters control the performance of defluoridation viz applied voltage tds of feed water the flow rate of water and temperature amor et al 1998 the technique with its features is in the ensemble table 1 2 5 ion exchange ion exchange is the process in which the charged ions are exchanged from the surrounding medium to solid support releasing the ions from their site of a similar charge the fluoride ion is replaced by the charged ions of the resin for defluoridation the resin s driving force for the substitution of charged ions i e cl is the stronger electronegativity of the fluoride ions thus ion exchange is a physical separation phenomenon of exchanging ions the exchange behavior of ions is dependent on the types of the functional group onto the solid support different ion exchangers viz fe2o3 al2o3 x h2o indion fr 10 ind ceralite ira 400 cer polyacrylamide modified with ce so4 2 4h2o al no3 3 9h2o and zrocl2 8h2o are reported chubar et al 2005 meenakshi et al 2007 sundaram et al 2009 table 1 depicts the features and limitations of the technique 2 6 adsorption the adsorption technique is straightforward with a broad assortment of adsorbents it is based on the strong physical attractive force attached to fluoride to adsorbents different adsorbents viz activated alumina activated carbon coated silica gel calcite carbon nanotube activated sawdust activated fly ash magnesia serpentine tri calcium phosphate bone charcoal etc are used maliyekkal et al 2006 chai et al 2013 uses of biosorbents rice husk tea ash activated coconut shell powder groundnut shell coffee husk wheat husk neem leaves pimple leaves neem and pimple leaves mix are also there chakrabarty and sarma 2012 mondal et al 2012 carbon nanotubes the promising adsorbent are capable of defluorinating water de luca and candamano 2021 ruan et al 2017 affonso et al 2020 tanaka et al 2002 experimented with the defluoridation behavior of zr iv complexes with the chelating resins cma carboxymethylamine and ida iminodiacetic acid it showed that fluoride ions reaction rate with zr cma is faster than zr ida resin the modified adsorbent by specific metal ions on conventional adsorbents such as zirconium iv impregnated collagen fiber chelating resin carbon al impregnated chitosan fe iii loaded ligand exchange cotton cellulose adsorbent alum impregnated activated alumina are reported liao et al 2005 sathish et al 2008 swain et al 2009 zhao et al 2008 membrane adsorbents viz amyloid fibril zro2 zirconia polysulfone zr mof s also showed promising defluoridation activities zhang et al 2019 he et al 2014 2016 mohamed et al 2021 the adsorbent characteristics such as selectivity reuse potential and physical and chemical stability are among the drawbacks of this technique that require improvement the defluoridation activities of y yttrium iii based nanoparticle polyethersulfone zr iv metalloporphyrin grafted fe3o4 nanoparticles mg doped nano ferrihydrite are quite promising cui et al 2019 poursaberi et al 2012 mohapatra et al 2012 novel hydroxyapatite nanoparticles prepared in bacteria bacillus subtilis mediated surfactin also showed their defluoridation capabilities maity et al 2018 table 1 depicts the features and limitations of the technique 2 7 membrane process researchers and technologists focussed on the membrane process considering the above techniques the membrane processes have their potential in a different arena giwa et al 2017 dasgupta et al 2015 liu et al 2013 sikder et al 2012 the movement of membrane science and technology in defluoridation activities is reflected in the research trend analysis of the sciencedirect database the data showed 20 40 of relevant peer reviewed studies damtiea et al 2019 nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are the best technologies to tackle defluoridation nf membranes require lower pressure and energy compared to ro membranes the transport mechanisms related to the separation of electrolytes are described in detail bhattacharya et al 2004 the membrane processes have advantages in terms of their versatilities it effectively prevents suspended solids inorganic toxins organic micro pollutants pesticides and microorganisms it can deal with the bulk volume resulting in high productivity thus it can be tagged with increasing efficiency and reduced cost it is simplified unlike other chemical processes the addition of chemicals is not needed unlike other methods it can be operated under a wide ph range depending on the nature of the membranes it has the option to couple with other chemical processes interference because of the presence of other ions is not critical like other processes 3 influencing factors elucidating the defluoridation performance through membranes is of paramount importance in guiding the water treatment process the defluoridation through membranes depends on several factors viz nature of the membrane other ions feed ph feed concentration applied pressure fig 2 depicts the influencing factors of membrane performances 3 1 nature of membranes the defluoridation performance is regulated by tuning the physicochemical properties of the membrane as discussed above a tiny amount of fluoride is needed for well being the requirements for partial defluoridation are appropriate by nanofiltration nf and low pressure ro membranes the separation scale is in between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis it would be advantageous to use nf membranes over ro membranes to increase water permeability with low operating pressure algieri et al 2021 thus they have relatively low operational maintenance costs and energy savings farsi et al 2014 diawara 2008 hu et al 2006 experimented with defluoridation through negatively charged commercial thin film composite tfc membranes ds 5 dl osmonics ds 51 hl osmonics and sr 1 koch fluid system the defluoridation performance followed ds 51 hl ds 5 dl sr 1 the performances depended on pore size and different surface potential table 1 the defluoridation through ntr 7250 polyvinyl alcohol based ntr 7450 polysulfone based nitto denko membranes were studied the separation performances were 70 4 and 72 respectively the surface potential explained this difference ntr 7450 10 mv ntr 7250 5 mv choi et al 2001 tahaikt et al 2007 found nf90 exhibited 99 1 separation compared to nf 400 which showed 77 26 separation for 10 mg l naf doped solution the defluoridation was done through nf90 nf400 polyamide spiral wound module nf ro pilot plant e 3039 supplied by tia company technologies industrielles appliquées france the defluoridation through nf70 polyamide mwco 200 desal 5dl polyamide mwco 150 300 mt08 pes based polyamide mwco 200 membranes showed the rejection 91 83 and 90 respectively diawara et al 2005 shen and schäfer et al found that the defluoridation through nf90 is higher 92 than nf270 67 because of the smaller pore sizes shen and schäfer 2014 a similar report was also there for the same membranes hoinkis et al 2011 on the other hand the nf90 membrane showed lower rejection than bw30 because of the larger pore size pontie et al 2013 the membrane charge densities could also affect the separation performances the study dealt with different membranes nf1 charge density 65 5 mol m3 nf2 charge density 16 5 mol m3 nf 20 charge density 36 9 mol m3 sepro membranes inc usa the order of rejection nf1 nf20 nf 2 followed the membrane charge density order chakrabortty et al 2013 in a different study tfc sr3 20mv showed better defluoridation efficiency compared to nf 270 14mv as the surface charge predominates though they have similar mwco 167da and 180da shen et al 2015 3 2 effect of ions the defluoridation performance through membranes has been substantially influenced by associated ions the influence of related cations is reported which showed that the fluoride ions are more retained when associated with monovalent cations than multivalent the order followed rnaf rkf rcaf2 and was explained in terms of convective transport contribution it was higher for fluoride ions associated with ca2 than fluoride ions related to other monovalent cations in addition to that transport parameters reflection co efficient σ solute permeability co efficient ps were also correlated the ps value was lower for reduced solvated cations na and k than more solvated ca2 the reflection coefficient σ i e proportional to the diffusion coefficient was higher for na k ions than ca2 bejaoui et al 2014 the defluoridation was greatly affected by the presence of nacl during the filtration through nf90 dow film tech and ro sg osmonics bejaoui et al 2014 the rejection decreased for nf90 from 97 to 85 and ro sg from 97 to 76 membranes in the presence of nacl the decrease depended on the nature of the membranes the higher ionic strength due to nacl resulted in high osmotic pressure and membrane charge screening bejaoui et al 2014 zaidi et al 2015 the screened layer reduced the electrostatic repulsions between the fluoride in solution and negatively charged membranes choi et al 2001 studied the influence of co existed ions on defluoridation through ntr 7250 and ntr 7450 nitto denko membranes the defluoridation performance of the membranes was 70 4 and 72 0 respectively for the sole major component in the matrix in contrast the performance deteriorated 55 2 and 63 6 respectively in the presence of mg ii cl and so4 ions fluoride ions permeate more to match the na ions in the permeate in the sulfate or it could be explained by donnan equilibrium however the defluoridation performances of ntr 7250 and ntr 7450 membranes are 38 7 41 4 and 10 15 2 in the mixture mg ii cl and so4 ions the behavior was explained by the mg ii permeation to maintain electric neutrality in the permeate the defluoridation performances containing nacl and na2so4 through nf70 desal5dl mt08 membranes showed exciting results diawara et al 2005 with the increase of na2so4 concentration from 50 to 200 mg l the defluoridation performance increased the size effect of sulphates might result in shielding occurrence along the membranes but in the absence of chloride ions in the mixture the defluoridation performance was not enhanced the screening effect increased with the na ion concentration and thus reduced membrane solute electrostatic repulsion resulting in easier permeating less hydrated anions the replacement of na2so4 by nitrate ions still resulted in screening along the membrane it showed different results as no3 ions with their lowest hydration energy passed preferentially to the chloride ions hoinkis et al 2011 observed no changes of fluoride rejection in the presence of bicarbonate in the feed matrix for the two membranes nf90 and nf 270 3 3 effect of ph the ph of the feed solution plays a role in defluoridation the ph influences the nature of the membranes and their profiles the ph affects the rejection of fluoride ions with the donnan and dielectric effects both rooted in electrostatic interactions the weak alkaline environment favored defluoridation performances through the negatively charged membrane qing and li 2009 fig 3 depicts the defluoridation profiles with ph variation it suggests the performance rejection and flux improvement for polyamide membranes chakrabortty et al 2013 richards et al 2010 chakrabortty et al 2013 demonstrated the variation in separation performances for three polyamide membranes nf1 nf2 and nf 20 from e merck germany the low value of pka 3 16 suggested that it existed as an ionic form above 3 16 the strong h bonding between the water and fluoride resulted in low rejection at acidic ph arora et al 2004 mohammadi et al 2003 there was the tendency to diffuse hf through membranes at ph 3 0 and thus the rejection was minimal simons 1993 the free fluoride ions increased as ph elevated and hence the separation attributed to the electrostatic effects particularly the donnan effect the flux enhancement was noticed as the elevated ph reduced the viscosity of the feed solution and thus concentration polarization chakrabortty et al 2013 the fluoride s charge density made it a large hydrated one i e 0 352 nm which operated the steric exclusion pathways richards et al 2010 the defluoridation through bw30 espa4 nf90 tfc s utc 60 and utc 80 membranes was conducted for single and mixed solutes the functionalities of bw 30 cooh amine nf90 cooh amine tfc s conh were unfolded the background electrolyte mixture of nacl and nahco3 was taken for the latter the separation was low in an acidic solution increasing as ph was elevated the trend was similar in mixed solutions for all the membranes mi et al 2006 boussu et al 2006 the nature of membranes impacted the variation of separation performances on ph bejaoui et al experimented with fluoride separation through ro sg and nf 90 membranes bejaoui et al 2014 the experiment was done through ro sg and nf 90 membranes the membranes functionalities cooh amine controlled the ph variation performances nf 90 showed a better variation from ph acidic to basic the flux variation is also influenced by their charge behaviour even their isoelectric point ph at 7 for nf90 and 7 5 for ro sg hurndall et al 1992 al amoudi et al 2008 there were some contrasting results where fluoride rejection decreased in strongly alkaline conditions it was due to the various influencing factors viz f and co3 2 interaction concentration polarization higher salt concentration and ph owusu agyeman et al 2017 3 4 effect of feed concentration though the insignificant effect of osmotic pressure in a low concentration range the feed concentration influences the separation abilities through the membrane the separation performance of f through the charged membrane was explained by donnan partitioning the donnan potential arises for the negatively charged membranes because of the higher cationic concentration the tendency of anions viz f was far away from the feed matrix membranes resulting in rejection the increase of feed salinity from 10 to 100 mg l for fluoride reduced donnan potential and thus separation resulted in the decreasing trend bartels et al 2005 saxena et al 2021 saxena et al 2021 experimented defluoridation through poly piperazine amide membranes derived from reusable polysulfone membranes all the membranes showed a decreasing trend the fluoride ion partition co efficient in the membrane solution interface increased as the feed concentration f increased hu and dickson 2006 it resulted in an increase in anion concentration at the membrane solution interface thus separation decreased at higher concentrations a similar observation was also reported by using alfa laval lab stak m20 plate frame membrane module moran et al 2018 the different trend in separation behaviour between nf 90 and ro sg membranes was reported bejaoui et al 2014 nf90 membrane showed the increased rejection behaviour as the concentration 2 10 4 to 2 10 2 mol l similar behaviour was also reflected in tahaikt et al 2007 study dielectric exclusion could explain the behaviour on the other hand the ro sg membrane showed different separation behaviour with the concentration the behaviour could be explained by increased osmotic pressure and charge screening mnif et al 2010 paugam et al 2003 shen et al 2014 narrated different experimental results tahaikt et al 2008 favre réguillon et al 2008 rossiter et al 2010 hoyer et al 2014 into ensemble fig 4 3 5 effect of pressure the separation of charged solutes especially fluoride ions is greatly influenced by the applied pressure during the filtration processes the reasoned rule is that the separation of fluoride ions increases with the applied pressure it indicates that convective transport operates over diffusion at high pressure whereas diffusive transport operates at low pressure in general fluoride separation is practically unaffected by pressure variation as the passage is mainly due to diffusion in a higher pressure regime convection has virtually shown no effect and thus the separation lhassani et al 2001 contrary to the above observation some results related to pressure variation were observed chakrabortty et al 2013 experimented with the separation behavior of three membranes nf1 nf2 nf 20 sepro membranes inc usa applying pressure 5 16 kgf cm2 chakrabortty et al 2013 the results suggested that nf2 is the loosest whereas nf20 is the tightest membrane the defluoridation performance increased with the pressure range mentioned this similar behavior was also reflected in different experimental studies pontié et al 2008 lhassani et al 2001 the uncoupled nature of solvent and solute flux follows the solution diffusion mechanistic pathway whereas electrostatic repulsion is another mechanism for controlled ion transport arora et al 2004 mnif et al 2010 demonstrated osmonics spiral module equipped with hl 2514 t membrane the performance variation was correlated using the model of kedem katchalsky the model is based on irreversible thermodynamics and both fluxes solvent and solute flux are coupled the effect of pressure could be correlated to the solvent flux j w lp δ p σ δ where jw is the flux of solute δ the difference in osmotic pressure σ reflection coefficient lp pure water permeability the fluoride separation increased with the pressure fig 5 depicts that the lower feed concentration had a minimal effect on the pressure variation ramdani et al also reported similar observations ramdani et al 2018 it corresponds to the limiting rejection of fluoride ions in the mentioned operating conditions 3 6 durability and cyclability of membranes membrane durability is one of the issues linked with performance nf membranes of membrane filtration unit pall corporation showed a decrease in rejection rate from 69 3 to 63 3 during the 250 h diawara et al 2011 in the beginning the membrane absorbed fluoride ions apart from the rejection this trend was followed during the first 10 h after that the membrane performance was not dependent on absorption the defluoridation rate was 97 initially and became stable 98 1 during filtration time for the lpro low pressure reverse osmosis membrane chakrabortty et al 2013 indicated the concentration polarization layer decreased the permeate flux during long time operation the time dependence flux variation was observed in three types of membranes nf1 nf2 nf 20 sepr membranes inc usa the flux decline was maximum for nf20 membranes i e 19 three membranes could reuse by rinsing 0 1 n naoh and 10 2 m hno3 the slight flux decline implied that the performance was reversible for these membranes evangeline et al 2019 experimented with iron oxide containing polyethersulfone cellulose acetate 18 2 wt blend membrane for that evangeline et al 2019 the durability depended on the iron oxide content of the system the membrane with fe2 o3 nanoparticles 0 5 wt the performance up to 8 cycles was convincing and without much loss 4 in the fluoride removal efficiency there was a severe decrease in the fluoride removal efficiency after eight cycles the study confirmed that the fe2o3 nanoparticles composite membranes resulted in better durability and convincing antifouling property the regeneration study was conducted through sodium hydroxide in the adsorptive membrane the rejection profile of ca fe al mn chitosan 92 8 wt membranes was 68 8 48 for feed with a fluoride concentration of 3 8 mg l during three successive cycles the higher concentration of naoh 0 01 m affected the membrane and could not be reused chaudhary et al 2020 the carbonized bone meal cbm impregnated uf grade hollow fiber mixed matrix membrane mmm showed an interesting result in the dynamic long term operation the permeate concentration almost remained the same during the initially filtered volume 600 800 ml 9 10 h of filtration it was due to the rapid adsorption of fluoride by impregnated cbm in hollow fiber mmm however after 900 ml of filtered volume concentration increased due to saturation of active sites in cbm in the matrix the membrane was regenerated by sodium hydroxide the filtered water in the first run was 1400 ml whereas in the second run it was 1200 ml in the breakthrough time 19 h chatterjee et al 2020 4 hybrid techniques the hybrid techniques cover the synergic approach of two or multiple techniques to counter the problem to improve the defluoridation technique emphasis is also given to hybrid techniques considering membrane technology is part of it it is well understood that microfiltration mf is unsuitable for defluoridation but it can be a better approach when coupled with coagulation zhang et al 2005 reported the coagulation microfiltration hybrid approach the coagulation by al2 so4 3 features the fluoride binding mechanism in the respective complex the reaction detail is as follows 1 a l 3 3 o h a l o h 3 2 a l 3 3 x o h x f a l o h 3 x f x 3 a l o h 3 x f a l o h 3 x f x x o h as the al fluoro complex s solubility product is low 1 9 10 33 was not dissolved and could be separated by microfiltration x o h the coagulation and membrane filtration hybrid technique in a pilot plant using koch uf membranes were reported kowalchuk 2012 similar approaches with seed extract moringa oleifera followed by uf were explored dos et al 2012 it was programmed with adsorbent and microfiltration approaches for defluoridation nunes et al 2018 used montmorillonite mmt and ca hydroxyapatite as adsorbents coupled with the poly vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene pvdf hfp membranes nunes et al 2018 thaci et al 2015 achieved a high recovery of fluorides 99 by cellulose acetate membranes with fly ash pretreatment micellar enhanced filtration technique meuf is one of the energy saving techniques also applied for defluoridation the surfactants are added to the feed water in micellar concentration the micelle formed around fluoride moieties thus the effective size resulted higher and the ultrafiltration membrane separated the moieties klimonda et al 2017 used the meuf technique with two different membranes i e cellulose 5 kda and polyethersulfone 4 kda for the defluoridation 5 membrane linked other approaches apart from nanofiltration and reverse osmosis techniques different techniques are linked with defluoridation brião et al 2016 suggested a straightforward approach that uses a mixture of ro permeates water with the groundwater to economize the drinking water production to counter the limitations viz concentration polarization of ro nf regarding the permeate quality membrane distillation md is considered a potential technique it is a thermally driven process and water vapour transport occurs through the hydrophobic macroporous membrane the separation mechanism does not depend on size exclusion and charges interaction moran et al 2018 tian et al 2015 he et al 2017 have reported the high quality to permeate 96 99 fluoride rejection having an initial flux of 13 3 l m2 h to achieve 75 water recovery plattner et al 2017 anion exchange membrane is another possible technique to counter defluoridation the transport mechanism follows donnan dialysis various anion exchange membranes include dsv afx amx acs afn aha sb 6407 and neosepta acm hichour et al 1999a 1999b durmaz et al 2005 tor 2007 used in defluoridation activities the reverse osmosis treated water is mixed with water from the well to save energy and productivity brião et al 2016 the schematic presentation depicted in fig 6 the feasibility of a solar powered nanofiltration reverse osmosis nf ro system has also been experimented in defluoridation activities different nf ro membrane modules viz bw30 bw30 le nf90 and nf270 combine renewable energy and advanced water treatment the nf90 membrane exhibited the best overall performance among all it features 1582 l of safe drinking water with an average specific energy consumption of 1 6 kwh m3 over a solar day shen et al 2016 boussouga et al 2021 the recyclability approach of the reject water of household domestic ro units through ro membrane module to increase the recovery practiced gedam et al 2012 6 safe disposal of fluoride waste sustainable management of fluoride contaminated water from the different defluoridation processes is one of the strategies to counter the rebirth of the same problem the use of fluoride loaded waste materials in concrete mixes is one of the novel approaches to counter it one of the friendly approaches to dispose of fluoride sludge in concrete enhances concrete properties ismail et al 2015 fluoride containing ro reject brackish water for the irrigation of halophytes could be a sustainable and eco friendly approach the halophytes are salt resistant or salt tolerant plants that can grow in moderate to high saline soil by utilizing salinity for their growth greenway et al 1980 reports are also there to cultivate salicornia brachiate using rejected water containing a high fluoride concentration in the different experimental conditions singh et al 2018 7 conclusion as water is a treated global resource the fluorine in the aquatic environment problem is considered a threat to human life the chaos associated with the redundant fluoride in drinking water is highly endemic the excess amount of fluoride ions in the human body negatively affects health different methods viz coagulation precipitation adsorption processes dialysis and membrane of removing fluoride from water have been practiced the development of defluoridation techniques is not static or stagnant it is a dynamic process and intertwined with the local economy membrane technologies have stepped ahead not only avoiding the addition of something in the water it is also clean and best suited for a bulk volume of water the performances of the low pressure driven membranes in the defluoridation of water are praiseworthy different influencing factors viz nature of the membrane water matrix control the defluoridation performance improving membrane technology optimum energy use and tackling the concentrate is the future scope of membrane applications the synergic combination of the two or multiple techniques is a promising solution to treat fluoride contaminated water mixing membrane permeates with groundwater is one of the alternatives to make it more practicable the momentum of reforms

livelihood for thousands of living beings water bodies include rivers lakes groundwater oceans etc access to safe water and sanitation is essential for health livelihoods security and quality of life we all know water is h2o but what is water quality exactly water moves through many places and picks up many materials along the way both natural and anthropogenic human made world freshwater demand is increasing to fulfil global food consumption which is expected to climb by 70 by 2050 to feed a predicted global population of 9 3 billion people bhattacharya p and bundschuh j 2015 water quality includes all the physical chemical and biological characteristics of water as we can see every day millions of tons of inadequately treated sewage of industrial and agricultural wastes have been poured into water bodies as a result every year lakes rivers and deltas get polluted daily the bulk composition of a river pond or lake may differ greatly from that of the water body s limits particularly the top layer bottom and even along the river banks bhattacharya et al 2017 with that more and more people die from such unsafe and unhygienic water the increased demand for freshwater is causing global concern increased residential water usage as well as other developmental activities such as agricultural crop growing livestock farming and industry are all contributing to the increased demand ligate et al 2021 and such water contamination of natural ecosystems directly affects humans by destroying many fisheries or causing other impacts on biodiversity that affect the food production of our food chain system finally the polluted freshwater ends up in the oceans which cause severe damage to many coastal areas and fisheries and worsening our ocean and its coastal resource the value of water resources is finally being recognised in our daily lives this is due to increased demand decreasing availability and treatment costs incurred as a result of pollution from industrial and natural sources bhattacharya p and mukherjee a b 2017 in priyank et al 2020 paper during the covid 19 pandemic lockdown period it was reported that there was a reduction of turbidity it suspended particles matter in some areas of the yamuna river in delhi india it is due to improve in dependency on flow behavior and point pollution source the bod cod and faecal coliform levels reduce to 42 83 39 25 and 40 respectively during the lockdown compare to pre lockdown period but there was an increase in domestic sewage although there were no industrial effluents during the lockdown period however the water quality index status failed to meet the standard guidelines per india s central pollution control board in du et al 2019 asha et al 2016 kathri et al 2020 and sandhya et al 2020 paper it was observed that india needs a large amount of water to run the agriculture wheel as the indian economy is mainly focused on the agricultural sector but the excess use of fertilizers and their discharge of farm fields leading to run off into the water bodies is a grave concern it leads to environmental water pollution in das et al 2018 devi et al 2016 gogoi et al 2016 philip et al 2018 tenzin et al 2019 paper the river was observed teesta flows through the state sikkim eastern himalayan region of india there was no proper scientific evidence on water chemistry as other himalayan region rivers had the researcher s team found that river chemistry is primarily subject to natural phenomena largely upstream by carbonate weathering effects and downstream by silicate weathering effects ca2 mg2 and hco3 were mainly provided from carbonate weathering while na and k were created from silicate weathering across the watershed h2co3 and h2so4 make essential contributions to the weathering effects melnyk et al 2014 paper the physio chemical analysis and eco toxicological analyses of sampled water have been studied sample water from the stream flowing

total organic carbon toc the total quantity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pb cd cr vi cu zn and hg content in 2007 2012 the researchers obtained water samples from streams from two separate sampling sites 1st stream inlet to landfill and 2nd stream outlet to landfill the rate of conductivity and toc from the stream and toxicity outlet was much higher than the stream inlet from 2007 to 2010 a decline in the value of toc and conductivity was observed in 2010 2012 due to landfill modernization in sachin et al 2019 paper the region under research was located in the middle of the ganga valley in varanasi city the ramna msw landfill site has been chosen and there is no facility for leachate extraction the research area is adjacent to the drainage passage of the ganga river the leachate sample was obtained from the pond near ramna open landfill during the rainy season in october and november 2014 samples were analyzed according to globally agreed protocols and procedures

explains about environmental capacity of water and pollution load reduction this site is situated on the urban side of lake taihu in eastern china due to extensibility intensified social economic activities chinese urban lakeside with dense water experienced high surface water pollution in this study a feasible environmental model and some parameters were used to calculate the environmental capacity of water and pollution load reduction 36 samples were taken along the 13 rivers to collect the hydrological and water quality data hydrological data contains flow velocity flow direction and

from 3 different landfill sites in ghana tema mallam and oblogo duckweed and crustaceans toxicity test is performed the physicochemical properties of leachates are also determined oblogo landfill sites ols are located in accra leachates in this landfill are collected through the sump waste is collected in 2500 metric tons the second one is tema landfill sites tls in which leachates are managed through a maturation pond ph and conductivity are calculated in wtw multiline p4 germany laboratory cod is calculated through epa toc is calculated through a high temperature combustion method leachates are orange and dark brown and the smell is pungent due to organic acids presence the range of ph leachates is 7 8 and 9 0 the high conductivity of leachate represents a high concentration of ions which affects organisms in water bodies cod ranges between 110 and 541 mg l mls leachates show high cod and contained high organic matter toc ranges between 350 and 6920 mg l and offers a high concentration of carbon it is found that the younger landfill shows a low concentration of nh3 and increases as it becomes old heavy metals like ni pb fe mn cr and zn are found out of which cr ni and pb are metals exceeding permissible levels authors found that ghana landfill leachates have high toxicity due to high ph conductivity and heavy metals age of landfill affects the toxicity older landfill has more toxicity than the younger ones decommission and capping are needed which help reduce the percolation of water through the waste body to reduce toxicity the value of cod is below the permissible limit and toc exceeded the allowable limit assessing toxicity to aquatic organism leachates should be treated before discharge gaimei et al 2019 paper explain that water pollution and environmental pollution accidents occur continuously in the last years these accidents cause several harms this study s primary purpose is to make a model for simulating local temporal change of pollutants after water pollution accidents an accident in water pollution in china yuncheng city consumed as an example and noticed that pollution moves with rising pollution areas from upstream to downstream but decreasing concentration navier stoke equation and advection diffusion equations are used to develop a simulation system navier stoke equation accurately reflects the viscous flow of incompressible fluid which simulates water pollution accidents this research improved a simulation system of water pollution diffusion sswpd based on delft 3d flow geographic information system and hydrodynamic water quality model the most advanced hydrodynamic water quality numerical and the perfect combining are the advantage of sswpd over simulation software in the simulation process the simulation system of water pollution is only one value assigned to every parameter the disadvantages of sswpd and finally mean absolute deviation mad and mean deviation md are counted to measure model error the study of simulation local temporal changes of pollutants will give research a professional equipment s and operating the scope of pollution and analysis of model error in mario ancic et al 2020 paper groundwater and leachates samples were analyzed groundwater and leachates samples were taken from water entering before the landfill and after the landfill this sample is taken during the different years and different seasons on a registered non hazardous waste dump by examining physical chemical and biological factors authors determine the potential risk for the ecosystem pre oxidated likely cytotoxic and mutagenic effects water and leachates samples were reviewed on the human laryngeal cell line the leachate sample had a higher ph cod bod and a higher phosphorous chloride nitrogen compound and sulphates leachates sample at landfill sites generates genotoxic effects which are increased in warm and dry months according to physio chemical analysis the concentration of a different chemical in leachates increased due to the growing degradation process at high temperatures groundwater collecting before the stream and after the stream does not show a crucial genotoxic effect the study indicates that waste temperature season and rainfall play a vital role in leachate toxic compound formation the chemical composition differs significantly in groundwater and leachates chemical analysis shows that compounds present in groundwater were below the permitted value occurrences of multiple contaminants in water environment possess a global threat in countries like india sri lanka bangladesh etc bhattacharya et al 2021a 2021b in emily hepburn et al 2019 paper the restriction of per and poly fluoroalkyl material pfas in groundwater around the legacy landfill has been seen to be still badly undetected australian urban seventeen pfas were tested for groundwater around the legacy landfill of melbourne s central business district with several legacy landfills in a non rural planning area with historical industrial activities the groundwater pfas level concentration and the determined pfas concentration range are measured from 26 to 5200 mg l including elevated concentrations of dissolved methane 10 4 mg l and ammonia 106 mg l and bicarbonate 1740 mg l which showed evidence of leachate contamination at all sites between one and fourteen pfas as were found and in the entire sample pfoa pfhxs pfos and pfbs were spotted the pfas is observed which is different from starting locations previous research shows comparatively high pfoa pfaa in msw landfill leachates and many conventional pfcas during plan transport associated with pfsas one site to be affected by industrial point source pollution where landfill leachate indicators were missing with significantly elevated pfos and pfhxs concentrations typical environmental degradation processes are omnipresent in water air food wildlife and humans due to their resistance to pfas pfas may have a detrimental effect on the public health risk and future climate of exposed species including humans the united nations general assembly recognised that adequate drinking water and sanitation are necessary for the achievement of all human rights and declared water to be a human right bhattacharya et al 2021a 2021b in sangeeta sunar 2017 paper the research was undertaken to determine the water quality of the serlui b hydro plant of mizoram as local citizens directly use it in the vicinity for consumption and various domestic purposes even though most parameters in each season were within the defined limits set by different scientific bodies the phosphate p values observed were higher than the permitted maximum appropriate management measures are urgently required for long term management until being drained into the natural water stream the power plant outlet s effluent should be handled the sustainability of today s safe aquifer is jeopardised due to extensive ground water pumping for irrigation therefore developing water saving agricultural methods is critical the sustainability of today s safe aquifer is jeopardised due to extensive ground water pumping for irrigation and other practises chakraborty et al 2019 in lalparmawii and mishra 2012 paper as compared to the winter season the ph values during the rainy season were higher the higher ph levels during the rainy season may be attributed to rock content leaching the high rate of organic matter decomposition during the rainy season can explain the low do material on the other hand higher content during the winter may be attributed to slower decomposition and increased photosynthesis higher bod values during the rainy season and lower values during the winter season may be attributed to elevated metabolic activities of microbes in the water sources and a slower rate of organic matter decomposition while the tuirial river s water tends to be unpolluted frequent testing is necessary to ascertain the health of the river s water and decide the best course of action for water pollution management it is advised that river water not be drunk because toxins found in the water can have adverse effects on the human body as a result tuirial river water should be adequately treated before use the research s main objective is to study the hydro chemical analysis of spring water body at tuirial landfill ground of aizawl city mizoram india and provide potential technical solutions and remedial measures for any kind of contamination and pollution in surface water bodies figs 1 4 2 aim and objective of the manuscript aim the aim of this work was to determine the impact of water quality of the spring water stream connecting tuirial river in the vicinity of landfill ground sites of aizawl mizoram india 3 research outcome such research will provide a base or platform for any kind of water quality management prospect and further strengthen drinking water supply management and water quality monitoring in mizoram india 4 material and methodology 4 1 description of the sampling site 4 1 1 tuirial landfill ground of aizawl city the study area is located around 25 km from aizawl city longitude is 92 82290 e and the latitude 23 73980 n landfill ground receives the waste from aizawl city in huge quantities there is no proper arrangement to secure the stream which is just near the dumping ground due to which the stream is getting heavily affected by toxic substances these are some pictures of our sites 4 2 sample collection the water samples from the spring discharge were collected in glass bottles from three different sites each around 70 m distance from one another the bottles were correctly washed with spring water before collecting the samples ph the temperature was monitored at the sampling site for do analysis immediately after sample collection manganese sulphate and alkali iodide azide were added into it all the samples were analyzed as advised by mizoram state pollution control board mizoram india and department of chemistry national institute of technology mizoram india respectively the flow rate was calculated using speed distance formulae 4 3 analysis of water samples the samples were collected from three different sites to analyze various physico chemical and biological parameters like ph do turbidity etc 4 4 methodology test

inorganic salts such as calcium bicarbonate sulphate chloride etc which all are in dissolved states in water tds in natural form may be present in water due to mineral rich springs carbonation deposits salts deposition or seawater intrusions human made reasons for the increase in tds level in water might be from salts which are used to de icing the roads anti skidding materials chemicals used in drinking water treatment discharge from stormwater run off from agricultural fields where farmers use different fertilizers for crops growth or from point non point wastewater discharges into the springs system since the spring flowing near the tuirial dumping ground of aizawl city mizoram india strong possibilities might be there that the liquid waste is mixing with the spring system and raising the tds level 670 690 mg l as shown in table 1 in all the three mentioned spring sites making it unsuitable for drinking and domestic uses who guidelines for drinking water quality wqa org the dissolved oxygen do level in three sites is 2 5 2 mg l well below six mg l as per is 2296 1992 some of the potential general causes of low do in water are discharges from huge industrial manufacturing plants run off discharge with fertilizers used in agricultural fields and dumping wastes making water pollutants for drinking and domestic uses less oxygen in water results in a lower chance of survival of fish and other aquatic organisms the seeping of waste liquids from tuirial ground can potentially cause a lesser do level in spring water who guidelines for drinking water quality is 2296 1992 wqa org a higher concentration of chloride in spring water will affect the aquatic organisms by intervening with osmoregulation the biological mechanism by which they retain the proper concentration of salt and other solutes in their bodily fluids any disturbance with osmoregulation will lead to hampering survival growth and reproduction the natural cause of chloride s higher presence in water bodies is weathering effects that leach out from different types of rocks and water anthropogenic sources of chloride in water bodies can be run off from de icing roads inorganic fertilizers leaching from landfills effluents discharge from septic tanks or industries etc in tuirial dumping ground during run off it takes out all leaching substances and discharges into the spring which increases the chloride content in water water hardness s fundamental natural causes are dissolved polyvalent metallic ions from sedimentary rocks seepage and run off from the soil magnesium and calcium are the two primary ions are found in many sedimentary rocks with limestone and chalk being the most common the study area falls under mizoram foreland basin of north east india a large folded tertiary clastic sedimentary rocks of surma and barail groups hussain and bharali 2019 this might be the reason for increased hardness and calcium in the spring water system stream discharges can alter the conductivity due to chlorine phosphorus and nitrate a damaged drainage system would increase conductivity an oil leak would decrease conductivity streams flowing through areas with clay soils appear to be more conducive due to ionizing materials when washed into the water based on the bedrock they run over freshwater inflows may have the same consequences epa gov wqa org for commercial fertilizers and other industrial applications ammonia is manufactured ammonia s natural causes include breakdown or deterioration of agricultural waste material the interaction of gases with the environment wildfires animal and human wastes and nitrogen fixation processes ammonia can penetrate the freshwater system by direct means such as discharges of municipal effluents and excretion of nitrogenous waste from mammals and indirect means such as nitrogen fixation air deposition and run off from agricultural land the conductivity range from the three available sites is more than 1000 us cm against the acceptable limit of 200 800 moreover the electrical conductivity is directly proportional to total dissolved matter although it doesn t directly impact consumption by humans it is preferred to consume water within 800 us cm the alkalinity level is slightly higher in all three samples but it will not harm human health the ph is an essential parameter for the identification of acidity or alkalinity in water bodies the water analysis noticed higher hardness and alkalinity values indicating carbonates hydroxides phosphates bicarbonates etc in spring water alkalinity is the buffering capacity of the spring water this buffering capacity is vital to allow ph levels to remain constant even with the introduction of acids or bases from non point source pollution of tuirial dumping ground ph level is within the acceptable range as per drinking specification nitrogen nitrate of less than 45 mg l who guidelines has no significant nutrients essential for plants and animals nourishments such a source of water is not recommended for any agricultural activities a higher level of nitrate in water can cause severe illness in infants and animals the total phosphate level is lower in all three samples it is non toxic for humans and animals until it is in the higher level zone higher phosphate levels in water result in decreased do levels in water bodies and the blooming of algae although there are no specific sodium standards in drinking water a low sodium intake of less than 20 mg l who guidelines is advisable by health experts all three samples were high in sodium content which is not suitable for drinking water without proper treatment potassium is an essential element that is essential for our growth and development activities and is generally found in drinking water which does not pose any health threats although it is advisable to use a maximum of 10 mg l who guidelines all three samples are well below ten mg l which doesn t pose any adverse effect on human health from tables 2 4 the water quality index was 215 52 which signifies that the water is not suitable for drinking purposes 6 statistical analysis the statistical result concerning minimum maximum mean standard deviation sd and standard error se variance skewness values for spring water quality parameters of the region are shown in table 5 the statistical analysis w r t water quality parameters were shown in table 6 for correlation matrix respectively the reciprocal association between two variables is known as correlation as the value of one increases or declines there is a strong correlation when an increase in one parameter causes an increase in the other the correlation is positive when an increase in one parameter causes decreases in the other the correlation is said to be negative the coefficient of correlation r has a value of 1 to 1 the association between the parameters is defined as high when it is between 0 8 and 1 mild when it is between 0 5 and 0 8 and weak when between 0 0 and 0 5 the water temperature shows significant correlation with water parameters with positive correlation with tds r 0 9449 hardness r 0 1889 calcium r

which reveals that with the temperature difference do level differentiates which might be due to metabolic rate of microorganisms in the spring water tds shows significant positive correlation with do r 0 244899 alkalinity r 0 94491 hardness 0 5 calcium 0 8029 nitrogen nitrate r 0 6666 and sodium r 0 9998 which confirms that these parameters were accountable with the change in tds in spring water do has good correlation with hardness r 0 9621 calcium r 0 7745 magnesium 0 96166 nitrogen nitrate r 0 8859 and moderate correlation with sodium r 0 2597 and potassium r 0 24489 alkalinity shows significant correlation with sodium r 0 93978 and potassium r 0 94491 whereas moderate correlation with hardness 0 1889 calcium 0 5636 and nitrogen nitrite r 0 38591 chloride has a strong correlation with ammonia r 0 9873 and total phosphate r 0 9958 along moderate correlation with magnesium r 0 0303 hardness and calcium demonstrated significant correlation with magnesium r 0 85043 r 0 571377 nitrogen nitrate r 0 97884 r 0 97955 sodium r 0 5132 0 81199 and potassium r 0 5 r 0 8029 ammonia has good correlation with total phosphate r 0 9976 whereas nitrogen nitrate demonstrated significant correlation with sodium r 0 67797 and potassium r 0 6666 one way analysis of variance anova tests was shown to find any noteworthy differences between the physico chemical parameters and data produced in this study in the case of physico chemical parameters the anova test at p 3 48953e 56 shows that f 8226 764 fcrit 1 95156 suggesting that there is a major significant exist between the physico chemical parameters and data in the samples as shown in table 7 7 health risk assessments a in water moderate to high tds affects the taste of water and poses many health risks the taste of your drinking water is influenced by high levels of tds in the water depending on dissolved solids found in the water the water may taste bitter salty or sulfuric water with high tds is safe to drink however certain chemicals can lead to health hazards such as lead or copper while health is not impaired by high tds it can change the taste of your food high tds in water leaves the utensils with ugly spots the colour of clothes often disappears with this form of water leading to a build up in the sinks tubs and faucets b owing to the aerating action of winds oxygen dissolves in surface water the quantity of dissolved oxygen also influences the amount and types of species living in that water body dissolved oxygen concentration can be severely decreased by reducing organic material in water caused by either chemical processes or microbial activity on untreated sewage or dead vegetation this is the most common cause of fish killing particularly in the summer when there is less oxygen in warm water c while low level chlorides are harmless healthy water high in sodium chloride can damage plants and offer an unpleasant taste to drinking water if used for gardening or irrigation chloride is not dangerous in drinking water and most issues are due to the repeated correlation of high levels of chloride with high sodium levels chlorides are not typically hazardous to people however a sodium restricted diet may be required for the sodium component of table salt related to heart and kidney disease or liver cirrhosis individuals on a low sodium diet are often limited to water containing less than 20 mg per litre of sodium because of high blood pressure or other medical problems d the operation of soaps and detergents can be interfered with by hard water and can result in calcium carbonate calcium sulphate and magnesium hydroxide deposits taking a shower will leave your skin feeling dry due to the abundance of calcium and magnesium in the water and your hair feeling slimy right after you step out water does not nourish your hair or skin at all e nitrate is a form of indicator for the evaluation of organic matter water contamination the application of chemical fertilizers irrigation of the wastewater waste feces and nitrogen containing waste gas released from fuel burning under normal conditions from nitrate into rivers lakes and rainwater after washing down and decomposition by precipitation and quickly contribute to the growth of nitrate in water f from a medical and economic standpoint hardness higher than 200 mg l is undesirable hardness thus is the property of water that avoids lather forming with soap and enhances water boiling proper treatment should be adopted before using the spring water g ammonias can reach the freshwater system directly such as municipal effluent dumping and nitrogen waste excretion from mammals and by indirect means such as nitrogen fixation air deposition and agricultural land run off h alkalinity higher than 200 mg l is not desirable for drinking purposes however it does not significantly affect human health but intake for a long duration may lead to specific health effects i if calcium is ingested and over consumed most healthy individuals excrete the waste through the kidney although elevated calcium intakes can have acute impacts on iron absorption there is no sign of diminished iron status or long term supplementation of iron j excess fluoride in drinking water has a number of negative consequences on human health despite the fact that the potential risk of fluoride poisoning in drinking water has been known for almost a half century fluorosis remains a severe and widespread health concern particularly in rural populations that rely on untreated water supplies kimambo et al 2019 fluoride is a geo genic pollutant that is regularly found in groundwater based drinking water sources sadhu et al 2021 however deep fracture aquifers are probable cradles of safe fluoride water ijumulana et al 2021 8 potential contaminants due to landfills and impacts on water bodies landfill leachate is one of the most common pollutants produced by municipal solid waste msw landfills environmental quality suffers as a result of poor landfill management physical chemical hydrolytic and fermentative reactions can produce both soluble and insoluble organic and inorganic compounds in the leachate as a result leachate is very contaminated pollution of groundwater is one of the most serious environmental consequences of leachate daniel et al 2020 a the main worry with municipal landfills is the possibility for contamination owing to the movement of produced leachate through the subsurface into surface and groundwater water containing leachate from the dump site seeps into neighboring lowlands and surface water bodies during the rainy season polluting the local ecology as a result this hazardous aqueous effluent from the landfill site may represent a threat to surface and groundwater as well as aquatic biota plant life and public health parvin f et al 2021 the unmanaged management of trash via water and food contamination by toxic leachate have a significant impact on the urban and semi urban poor in those nations solid waste is frequently dumped in non engineered landfills in underdeveloped nations among the several downsides of this type of landfilling leachate a hazardous byproduct formed by the landfill that can percolate to the ground water and so travel in surface water is the most serious worry for public health municipal solid waste disposal is a global issue particularly in developing nations and as urbanisation progresses solid waste management in metropolitan areas becomes a public health and environmental problem parvin et al 2021 ololade 2019 many drinking water sources have excessive levels of geochemical contaminants posing a severe challenge to water providers and users across the country bhattacharya p et al 2016 surface water has long been utilised to transport sewage and industrial waste making it inadequate for drinking purpose bhattacharya p et al 2015 9 water quality improvement measures a to control the increasing volume of municipality waste degradable and biodegradable a proper efficient and adequate sanitation system such as engineering landfills should be used at tuirial ground b the spring water should not be consumed directly it is advisable to treat the water before drinking which will decrease the chance of spreading any waterborne disease at aizawl mizoram c any pollutants or contaminants mixing in spring water due to human activities should be immediately stopped control and legal action should be taken up for any violation under the environment protection act d public awareness activities should be conducted and encouraged by government and non government agencies 10 conclusion the present research work describes the initial water chemistry of spring water discharge surrounding the tuirial dumping ground of aizawl mizoram india some of the significant physicochemical parameters are well adverse with the drinking water parameters the influential factors which pose a considerable threat to the water quality are the dumping of domestic and non domestic waste at tuirial aizawl city of mizoram india water quality can be improved by controlling the pollutants mixing into the water system and through target tactics to pollution remediation schemes therefore research must be oriented towards improving the quality of chemical ecological or microbial water to optimize the usefulness of the available resources available for river development policymakers need to appreciate these discrepancies and obtain exact quantifiable data the suggested measures to improve the stream water quality include a total ban on the activities that causes pollution the impact of waste pollutants on groundwater quality in the vicinity of dumping ground should carefully monitor to assess the environmental side effects of such waste management by installing new and useful wastewater treatment plants waste dumping into water bodies can be minimized and an appropriate wastewater treatment system is introduced further analysis of water will result in water resource management facilities of aizawl city of mizoram india preserving nature s dynamic natural resources

livelihood for thousands of living beings water bodies include rivers lakes groundwater oceans etc access to safe water and sanitation is essential for health livelihoods security and quality of life we all know water is h2o but what is water quality exactly water moves through many places and picks up many materials along the way both natural and anthropogenic human made world freshwater demand is increasing to fulfil global food consumption which is expected to climb by 70 by 2050 to feed a predicted global population of 9 3 billion people bhattacharya p and bundschuh j 2015 water quality includes all the physical chemical and biological characteristics of water as we can see every day millions of tons of inadequately treated sewage of industrial and agricultural wastes have been poured into water bodies as a result every year lakes rivers and deltas get polluted daily the bulk composition of a river pond or lake may differ greatly from that of the water body s limits particularly the top layer bottom and even along the river banks bhattacharya et al 2017 with that more and more people die from such unsafe and unhygienic water the increased demand for freshwater is causing global concern increased residential water usage as well as other developmental activities such as agricultural crop growing livestock farming and industry are all contributing to the increased demand ligate et al 2021 and such water contamination of natural ecosystems directly affects humans by destroying many fisheries or causing other impacts on biodiversity that affect the food production of our food chain system finally the polluted freshwater ends up in the oceans which cause severe damage to many coastal areas and fisheries and worsening our ocean and its coastal resource the value of water resources is finally being recognised in our daily lives this is due to increased demand decreasing availability and treatment costs incurred as a result of pollution from industrial and natural sources bhattacharya p and mukherjee a b 2017 in priyank et al 2020 paper during the covid 19 pandemic lockdown period it was reported that there was a reduction of turbidity it suspended particles matter in some areas of the yamuna river in delhi india it is due to improve in dependency on flow behavior and point pollution source the bod cod and faecal coliform levels reduce to 42 83 39 25 and 40 respectively during the lockdown compare to pre lockdown period but there was an increase in domestic sewage although there were no industrial effluents during the lockdown period however the water quality index status failed to meet the standard guidelines per india s central pollution control board in du et al 2019 asha et al 2016 kathri et al 2020 and sandhya et al 2020 paper it was observed that india needs a large amount of water to run the agriculture wheel as the indian economy is mainly focused on the agricultural sector but the excess use of fertilizers and their discharge of farm fields leading to run off into the water bodies is a grave concern it leads to environmental water pollution in das et al 2018 devi et al 2016 gogoi et al 2016 philip et al

total organic carbon toc the total quantity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pb cd cr vi cu zn and hg content in 2007 2012 the researchers obtained water samples from streams from two separate sampling sites 1st stream inlet to landfill and 2nd stream outlet to landfill the rate of conductivity and toc from the stream and toxicity outlet was much higher than the stream inlet from 2007 to 2010 a decline in the value of toc and conductivity was observed in 2010 2012 due to landfill modernization in sachin et al 2019 paper the region under research was located in the middle of the ganga valley in varanasi city the ramna msw landfill site has been chosen and there is no facility for leachate extraction the research area is adjacent to the drainage passage of the ganga river the leachate sample was obtained from the pond near ramna open landfill during the rainy season in october and november 2014 samples were analyzed according to globally agreed protocols and procedures

from 3 different landfill sites in ghana tema mallam and oblogo duckweed and crustaceans toxicity test is performed the physicochemical properties of leachates are also determined oblogo landfill sites ols are located in accra leachates in this landfill are collected through the sump waste is collected in 2500 metric tons the second one is tema landfill sites tls in which leachates are managed through a maturation pond ph and conductivity are calculated in wtw multiline p4 germany laboratory cod is calculated through epa toc is calculated through a high temperature combustion method leachates are orange and dark brown and the smell is pungent due to organic acids presence the range of ph leachates is 7 8 and 9 0 the high conductivity of leachate represents a high concentration of ions which affects organisms in water bodies cod ranges between 110 and 541 mg l mls leachates show high cod and contained high organic matter toc ranges between 350 and 6920 mg l and offers a high concentration of carbon it is found that the younger landfill shows a low concentration of nh3 and increases as it becomes old heavy metals like ni pb fe mn cr and zn are found out of which cr ni and pb are metals exceeding permissible levels authors found that ghana landfill leachates have high toxicity due to high ph conductivity and heavy metals age of landfill affects the toxicity older landfill has more toxicity than the younger ones decommission and capping are needed which help reduce the percolation of water through the waste body to reduce toxicity the value of cod is below the permissible limit and toc exceeded the allowable limit assessing toxicity to aquatic organism leachates should be treated before discharge gaimei et al 2019 paper explain that water pollution and environmental pollution accidents occur continuously in the last years these accidents cause several harms this study s primary purpose is to make a model for simulating local temporal change of pollutants after water pollution accidents an accident in water pollution in china yuncheng city consumed as an example and noticed that pollution moves with rising pollution areas from upstream to downstream but decreasing concentration navier stoke equation and advection diffusion equations are used to develop a simulation system navier stoke equation accurately reflects the viscous flow of incompressible fluid which simulates water pollution accidents this research improved a simulation system of water pollution diffusion sswpd based on delft 3d flow geographic information system and hydrodynamic water quality model the most advanced hydrodynamic water quality numerical and the perfect combining are the advantage of sswpd over simulation software in the simulation process the simulation system of water pollution is only one value assigned to every parameter the disadvantages of sswpd and finally mean absolute deviation mad and mean deviation md are counted to measure model error the study of simulation local temporal changes of pollutants will give research a professional equipment s and operating the scope of pollution and analysis of model error in mario ancic et al 2020 paper groundwater and leachates samples were analyzed groundwater and leachates samples were taken from water entering before the landfill and after the landfill this sample is taken during the different years and different seasons on a registered non hazardous waste dump by examining physical chemical and biological factors authors determine the potential risk for the ecosystem pre oxidated likely cytotoxic and mutagenic effects water and leachates samples were reviewed on the human laryngeal cell line the leachate sample had a higher ph cod bod and a higher phosphorous chloride nitrogen compound and sulphates leachates sample at landfill sites generates genotoxic effects which are increased in warm and dry months according to physio chemical analysis the concentration of a different chemical in leachates increased due to the growing degradation process at high temperatures groundwater collecting before the stream and after the stream does not show a crucial genotoxic effect the study indicates that waste temperature season and rainfall play a vital role in leachate toxic compound formation the chemical composition differs significantly in groundwater and leachates chemical analysis shows that compounds present in groundwater were below the permitted value occurrences of multiple contaminants in water environment possess a global threat in countries like india sri lanka bangladesh etc bhattacharya et al 2021a 2021b in emily hepburn et al 2019 paper the restriction of per and poly fluoroalkyl material pfas in groundwater around the legacy landfill has been seen to be still badly undetected australian urban seventeen pfas were tested for groundwater around the legacy landfill of melbourne s central business district with several legacy landfills in a non rural planning area with historical industrial activities the groundwater pfas level concentration and the determined pfas concentration range are measured from 26 to 5200 mg l including elevated concentrations of dissolved methane 10 4 mg l and ammonia 106 mg l and bicarbonate 1740 mg l which showed evidence of leachate contamination at all sites between one and fourteen pfas as were found and in the entire sample pfoa pfhxs pfos and pfbs were spotted the pfas is observed which is different from starting locations previous research shows comparatively high pfoa pfaa in msw landfill leachates and many conventional pfcas during plan transport associated with pfsas one site to be affected by industrial point source pollution where landfill leachate indicators were missing with significantly elevated pfos and pfhxs concentrations typical environmental degradation processes are omnipresent in water air food wildlife and humans due to their resistance to pfas pfas may have a detrimental effect on the public health risk and future climate of exposed species including humans the united nations general assembly recognised that adequate drinking water and sanitation are necessary for the achievement of all human rights and declared water to be a human right bhattacharya et al 2021a 2021b in sangeeta sunar 2017 paper the research was undertaken to determine the water quality of the serlui b hydro plant of mizoram as local citizens directly use it in the vicinity for consumption and various domestic purposes even though most parameters in each season were within the defined limits set by different scientific bodies the phosphate p values observed were higher than the permitted maximum appropriate management measures are urgently required for long term management until being drained into the natural water stream the power plant outlet s effluent should be handled the sustainability of today s safe aquifer is jeopardised due to extensive ground water pumping for irrigation therefore developing water saving agricultural methods is critical the sustainability of today s safe aquifer is jeopardised due to extensive ground water pumping for irrigation and other practises chakraborty et al 2019 in lalparmawii and mishra 2012 paper as compared to the winter season the ph values during the rainy season were higher the higher ph levels during the rainy season may be attributed to rock content leaching the high rate of organic matter decomposition during the rainy season can explain the low do material on the other hand higher content during the winter may be attributed to slower decomposition and increased photosynthesis higher bod values during the rainy season and lower values during the winter season may be attributed to elevated metabolic activities of microbes in the water sources and a slower rate of organic matter decomposition while the tuirial river s water tends to be unpolluted frequent testing is necessary to ascertain the health of the river s water and decide the best course of action for water pollution management it is advised that river water not be drunk because toxins found in the water can have adverse effects on the human body as a result tuirial river water should be adequately treated before use the research s main objective is to study the hydro chemical analysis of spring water body at tuirial landfill ground of aizawl city mizoram india and provide potential technical solutions and remedial measures for any kind of contamination and pollution in surface water bodies figs 1 4 2 aim and objective of the manuscript aim the aim of this work was to determine the impact of water quality of the spring water stream connecting tuirial river in the vicinity of landfill ground sites of aizawl mizoram india 3 research outcome such research will provide a base or platform for any kind of water quality management prospect and further strengthen drinking water supply management and water quality monitoring in mizoram india 4 material and methodology 4 1 description of the sampling site 4 1 1 tuirial landfill ground of aizawl city the study area is located around 25 km from aizawl city longitude is 92 82290 e and the latitude 23 73980 n landfill ground receives the waste from aizawl city in huge quantities there is no proper arrangement to secure the stream which is just near the dumping ground due to which the stream is getting heavily affected by toxic substances these are some pictures of our sites 4 2 sample collection the water samples from the spring discharge were collected in glass bottles from three different sites each around 70 m distance from one another the bottles were correctly washed with spring water before collecting the samples ph the temperature was monitored at the sampling site for do analysis immediately after sample collection manganese sulphate and alkali iodide azide were added into it all the samples were analyzed as advised by mizoram state pollution control board mizoram india and department of chemistry national institute of technology mizoram india respectively the flow rate was calculated using speed distance formulae 4 3 analysis of water samples the samples were collected from three different sites to analyze various physico chemical and biological parameters like ph do turbidity etc 4 4 methodology test

magnesium conductivity nitrogen nitrate ammonia total phosphate sodium and potassium test conducted at national institute of technology mizoram india is colour odour temperature ph hardness do alkalinity chloride and conductivity respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 physical chemical analyses 5 2 interpreting test results total dissolved solids tds include organic matter and mainly inorganic salts such as calcium bicarbonate sulphate chloride etc which all are in dissolved states in water tds in natural form may be present in water due to mineral rich springs carbonation deposits salts deposition or seawater intrusions human made reasons for the increase in tds level in water might be from salts which are used to de icing the roads anti skidding materials chemicals used in drinking water treatment discharge from stormwater run off from agricultural fields where farmers use different fertilizers for crops growth or from point non point wastewater discharges into the springs system since the spring flowing near the tuirial dumping ground of aizawl city mizoram india strong possibilities might be there that the liquid waste is mixing with the spring system and raising the tds level 670 690 mg l as shown in table 1 in all the three mentioned spring sites making it unsuitable for drinking and domestic uses who guidelines for drinking water quality wqa org the dissolved oxygen do level in three sites is 2 5 2 mg l well below six mg l as per is 2296 1992 some of the potential general causes of low do in water are discharges from huge industrial manufacturing plants run off discharge with fertilizers used in agricultural fields and dumping wastes making water pollutants for drinking and domestic uses less oxygen in water results in a lower chance of survival of fish and other aquatic organisms the seeping of waste liquids from tuirial ground can potentially cause a lesser do level in spring water who guidelines for drinking water quality is 2296 1992 wqa org a higher concentration of chloride in spring water will affect the aquatic organisms by intervening with osmoregulation the biological mechanism by which they retain the proper concentration of salt and other solutes in their bodily fluids any disturbance with osmoregulation will lead to hampering survival growth and reproduction the natural cause of chloride s higher presence in water bodies is weathering effects that leach out from different types of rocks and water anthropogenic sources of chloride in water bodies can be run off from de icing roads inorganic fertilizers leaching from landfills effluents discharge from septic tanks or industries etc in tuirial dumping ground during run off it takes out all leaching substances and discharges into the spring which increases the chloride content in water water hardness s fundamental natural causes are dissolved polyvalent metallic ions from sedimentary rocks seepage and run off from the soil magnesium and calcium are the two primary ions are found in many sedimentary rocks with limestone and chalk being the most common the study area falls under mizoram foreland basin of north east india a large folded tertiary clastic sedimentary rocks of surma and barail groups hussain and bharali 2019 this might be the reason for increased hardness and calcium in the spring water system stream discharges can alter the conductivity due to chlorine phosphorus and nitrate a damaged drainage system would increase conductivity an oil leak would decrease conductivity streams flowing through areas with clay soils appear to be more conducive due to ionizing materials when washed into the water based on the bedrock they run over freshwater inflows may have the same consequences epa gov wqa org for commercial fertilizers and other industrial applications ammonia is manufactured ammonia s natural causes include breakdown or deterioration of agricultural waste material the interaction of gases with the environment wildfires animal and human wastes and nitrogen fixation processes ammonia can penetrate the freshwater system by direct means such as discharges of municipal effluents and excretion of nitrogenous waste from mammals and indirect means such as nitrogen fixation air deposition and run off from agricultural land the conductivity range from the three available sites is more than 1000 us cm against the acceptable limit of 200 800 moreover the electrical conductivity is directly proportional to total dissolved matter although it doesn t directly impact consumption by humans it is preferred to consume water within 800 us cm the alkalinity level is slightly higher in all three samples but it will not harm human health the ph is an essential parameter for the identification of acidity or alkalinity in water bodies the water analysis noticed higher hardness and alkalinity values indicating carbonates hydroxides phosphates bicarbonates etc in spring water alkalinity is the buffering capacity of the spring water this buffering capacity is vital to allow ph levels to remain constant even with the introduction of acids or bases from non point source pollution of tuirial dumping ground ph level is within the acceptable range as per drinking specification nitrogen nitrate of less than 45 mg l who guidelines has no significant nutrients essential for plants and animals nourishments such a source of water is not recommended for any agricultural activities a higher level of nitrate in water can cause severe illness in infants and animals the total phosphate level is lower in all three samples it is non toxic for humans and animals until it is in the higher level zone higher phosphate levels in water result in decreased do levels in water bodies and the blooming of algae although there are no specific sodium standards in drinking water a low sodium intake of less than 20 mg l who guidelines is advisable by health experts all three samples were high in sodium content which is not suitable for drinking water without proper treatment potassium is an essential element that is essential for our growth and development activities and is generally found in drinking water which does not pose any health threats although it is advisable to use a maximum of 10 mg l who guidelines all three samples are well below ten mg l which doesn t pose any adverse effect on human health from tables 2 4 the water quality index was 215 52 which signifies that the water is not suitable for drinking purposes 6 statistical analysis the statistical result concerning minimum maximum mean standard deviation sd and standard error se variance skewness values for spring water quality parameters of the region are shown in table 5 the statistical analysis w r t water quality parameters were shown in table 6 for correlation matrix respectively the reciprocal association between two variables is known as correlation as the value of one increases or declines there is a strong correlation when an increase in one parameter causes an increase in the other the correlation is positive when an increase in one parameter causes decreases in the other the correlation is said to be negative the coefficient of correlation r has a value of 1 to 1 the association between the parameters is defined as high when it is between 0 8 and 1 mild when it is between 0 5 and 0 8 and weak when between 0 0 and 0 5 the water temperature shows significant correlation with water parameters with positive correlation with tds r 0 9449 hardness r 0 1889 calcium r

in this study in the case of physico chemical parameters the anova test at p 3 48953e 56 shows that f 8226 764 fcrit 1 95156 suggesting that there is a major significant exist between the physico chemical parameters and data in the samples as shown in table 7 7 health risk assessments a in water moderate to high tds affects the taste of water and poses many health risks the taste of your drinking water is influenced by high levels of tds in the water depending on dissolved solids found in the water the water may taste bitter salty or sulfuric water with high tds is safe to drink however certain chemicals can lead to health hazards such as lead or copper while health is not impaired by high tds it can change the taste of your food high tds in water leaves the utensils with ugly spots the colour of clothes often disappears with this form of water leading to a build up in the sinks tubs and faucets b owing to the aerating action of winds oxygen dissolves in surface water the quantity of dissolved oxygen also influences the amount and types of species living in that water body dissolved oxygen concentration can be severely decreased by reducing organic material in water caused by either chemical processes or microbial activity on untreated sewage or dead vegetation this is the most common cause of fish killing particularly in the summer when there is less oxygen in warm water c while low level chlorides are harmless healthy water high in sodium chloride can damage plants and offer an unpleasant taste to drinking water if used for gardening or irrigation chloride is not dangerous in drinking water and most issues are due to the repeated correlation of high levels of chloride with high sodium levels chlorides are not typically hazardous to people however a sodium restricted diet may be required for the sodium component of table salt related to heart and kidney disease or liver cirrhosis individuals on a low sodium diet are often limited to water containing less than 20 mg per litre of sodium because of high blood pressure or other medical problems d the operation of soaps and detergents can be interfered with by hard water and can result in calcium carbonate calcium sulphate and magnesium hydroxide deposits taking a shower will leave your skin feeling dry due to the abundance of calcium and magnesium in the water and your hair feeling slimy right after you step out water does not nourish your hair or skin at all e nitrate is a form of indicator for the evaluation of organic matter water contamination the application of chemical fertilizers irrigation of the wastewater waste feces and nitrogen containing waste gas released from fuel burning under normal conditions from nitrate into rivers lakes and rainwater after washing down and decomposition by precipitation and quickly contribute to the growth of nitrate in water f from a medical and economic standpoint hardness higher than 200 mg l is undesirable hardness thus is the property of water that avoids lather forming with soap and enhances water boiling proper treatment should be adopted before using the spring water g ammonias can reach the freshwater system directly such as municipal effluent dumping and nitrogen waste excretion from mammals and by indirect means such as nitrogen fixation air deposition and agricultural land run off h alkalinity higher than 200 mg l is not desirable for drinking purposes however it does not significantly affect human health but intake for a long duration may lead to specific health effects i if calcium is ingested and over consumed most healthy individuals excrete the waste through the kidney although elevated calcium intakes can have acute impacts on iron absorption there is no sign of diminished iron status or long term supplementation of iron j excess fluoride in drinking water has a number of negative consequences on human health despite the fact that the potential risk of fluoride poisoning in drinking water has been known for almost a half century fluorosis remains a severe and widespread health concern particularly in rural populations that rely on untreated water supplies kimambo et al 2019 fluoride is a geo genic pollutant that is regularly found in groundwater based drinking water sources sadhu et al 2021 however deep fracture aquifers are probable cradles of safe fluoride water ijumulana et al 2021 8 potential contaminants due to landfills and impacts on water bodies landfill leachate is one of the most common pollutants produced by municipal solid waste msw landfills environmental quality suffers as a result of poor landfill management physical chemical hydrolytic and fermentative reactions can produce both soluble and insoluble organic and inorganic compounds in the leachate as a result leachate is very contaminated pollution of groundwater is one of the most serious environmental consequences of leachate daniel et al 2020 a the main worry with municipal landfills is the possibility for contamination owing to the movement of produced leachate through the subsurface into surface and groundwater water containing leachate from the dump site seeps into neighboring lowlands and surface water bodies during the rainy season polluting the local ecology as a result this hazardous aqueous effluent from the landfill site may represent a threat to surface and groundwater as well as aquatic biota plant life and public health parvin f et al 2021 the unmanaged management of trash via water and food contamination by toxic leachate have a significant impact on the urban and semi urban poor in those nations solid waste is frequently dumped in non engineered landfills in underdeveloped nations among the several downsides of this type of landfilling leachate a hazardous byproduct formed by the landfill that can percolate to the ground water and so travel in surface water is the most serious worry for public health municipal solid waste disposal is a global issue particularly in developing nations and as urbanisation progresses solid waste management in metropolitan areas becomes a public health and environmental problem parvin et al 2021 ololade 2019 many drinking water sources have excessive levels of geochemical contaminants posing a severe challenge to water providers and users across the country bhattacharya p et al 2016 surface water has long been utilised to transport sewage and industrial waste making it inadequate for drinking purpose bhattacharya p et al 2015 9 water quality improvement measures a to control the increasing volume of municipality waste degradable and biodegradable a proper efficient and adequate sanitation system such as engineering landfills should be used at tuirial ground b the spring water should not be consumed directly it is advisable to treat the water before drinking which will decrease the chance of spreading any waterborne disease at aizawl mizoram c any pollutants or contaminants mixing in spring water due to human activities should be immediately stopped control and legal action should be taken up for any violation under the environment protection act d public awareness activities should be conducted and encouraged by government and non government agencies 10 conclusion the present research work describes the initial water chemistry of spring water discharge surrounding the tuirial dumping ground of aizawl mizoram india some of the significant physicochemical parameters are well adverse with the drinking water parameters the influential factors which pose a considerable threat to the water quality are the dumping of domestic and non domestic waste at tuirial aizawl city of mizoram india water quality can be improved by controlling the pollutants mixing into the water system and through target tactics to pollution remediation schemes therefore research must be oriented towards improving the quality of chemical ecological or microbial water to optimize the usefulness of the available resources available for river development policymakers need to appreciate these discrepancies and obtain exact quantifiable data the suggested measures to improve the stream water quality include a total ban on the activities that causes pollution the impact of waste pollutants on groundwater quality in the vicinity of dumping ground should carefully monitor to assess the environmental side effects of such waste management by installing new and useful wastewater treatment plants waste dumping into water bodies can be minimized and an appropriate wastewater treatment system is introduced further analysis of water will result in water resource management facilities of aizawl city of mizoram india preserving nature s dynamic natural resources

11829,occurrence of uranium u in the groundwater of south west punjab is a matter of great concern due to the rise of contaminant levels at an alarming rate its spatial and vertical variability and poor understanding of uranium mobility with depth present study has been conducted to investigate the vertical extent of contamination and geochemical factors controlling u mobilization in the groundwater of semi arid punjab out of total 140 samples collected and analyzed 76 samples have uranium levels greater than the chemical toxicity limit of world health organization who 30 μg l 1 and 34 samples have concentration higher than the radiological toxicity limit given by atomic energy regulatory board aerb 60 μg l 1 water at shallow depth 60 m is found to be more contaminated than water at deeper depth 60 m and concentration lies in the range of 4 26 318 03 μg l 1 spatial distribution graphs are used to identify the hotspots of contamination and concentration is higher in the flow direction of groundwater towards south west in both the aquifers groundwater is alkaline and oxic in character with carbonate weathering as dominant hydrogeochemical process affecting chemical composition of water higher uranium concentration is seen in the oxidizing alkaline and carbonate rich water alkali earth metals na k are also strongly correlated with the uranium in groundwater at both the levels use of environmental stable isotopes δ18o δ2h shows the evaporation signature in both the aquifers health risk assessment is carried out and values higher than permissible limit give indication towards the health risk to the population exposed due to the consumption of uranium contaminated water from long time this study provides a strong base for better understanding the source

drinking water health hazard is brought to the notice after the provisional guideline given by world health organization who earlier u was not a part of water quality investigations at most of the places and thus the background information on distribution and range of concentration in the groundwater is limited from past few decades element concentration in groundwater exceeding the permissible limit of who i e 30 μg l 1 who 2011a has become a serious health concern globally countries such as canada moss et al 1983 finland kurttio et al 2006 new mexico usa hakonson hayes et al 2002 china wu et al 2014 and mongolia nriagu et al 2012 have identified uranium in its groundwater uranium levels in the groundwater of quaternary fluvial aquifer also exceed the german drinking water limit of 10 μg l 1 banning et al 2017 uranium is introduced to the groundwater system by the natural geochemical processes geogenic or anthropogenic activities coyte et al 2018 smedley et al 2006 geogenic source includes the mineral dissolution of host rocks and sediments along the flow path of groundwater or desorption from the surface of various minerals chen et al 2005 jerden and sinha 2006 in rocks and soil uranium is present in many major rock forming minerals and is also incorporated in a number of minor phases it can also be present on grain boundaries it is well known that clays carbonate fe mn and al oxides and hydroxides act as strong adsorbent of uranium porcelli and swarzenski 2003 anthropogenic sources of uranium include mining and ore processing of uranium radioactive material production and disposal combustion of fuels and use of phosphatic fertilizers in agricultural fields cothern and lappenbusch 1983 dreeson et al 1982 spalding and sackett 1972 tadmor 1986 however concentration is highly variable depending on the groundwater chemistry aquifer characteristics and bedrock geology frengstad et al 2000 redox processes control the enrichment of u in groundwater and its solubility is highly sensitive to the aquifer geochemistry fate of the uranium i e whether it gets sorbed mobilized precipitated or immobilized is decided mainly by its oxidation state and mineral solubility maher et al 2013 environmental chemistry of uranium is influenced by its oxidation reduction potential orp because of their redox dependency finch and murakami 1999 there are three main oxidation states of u iv v and vi in nature however u iv the reduced form and u vi the oxidized form controls most of the u geochemistry the solubility of u vi is extremely high and oxidizing conditions effectively enhance the uranium movement alam and cheng 2014 uranium mobilization is studied by the various complexes formed by it in the water system depending on ph and pco2 at lower ph 5 dominant species of u is uranyl ion uo2 2 however uo2 2 forms complexes with carbonate phosphate and calcium at higher phs bernhard 1998 langmuir 1978 porcelli and swarzenski 2003 uranium concentration is also affected by recharge and discharge from the aquifers and stable isotopes 18o 2h are widely used to get an insight to the aquifer recharge system kendall and macdonnell 1998 negrel et al 2003 these environmental tracers are recognized as recorders of important processes like evaporation transpiration recycling and mixing of water tarki et al 2016 uranium poisoning is a matter of concern more because of its chemical toxicity than its radiological impacts a considerable body of evidence also suggests that overexposure to uranium causes nephrotoxicity and osteotoxicity kurttio et al 2006 uranyl ion replaces the calcium in the bone crystal moss et al 1983 and skeleton is the main site of its accumulation wrenn et al 1985 in india 16 states have been detected with

coyte et al 2018 pant et al 2017 rishi et al 2017 singh et al 1995 singh and kishore 2010 saini et al 2016 sharma et al 2017 however work done is very limited in the barnala district which shows highest groundwater depletion sidhu et al 2021 current study is important as explained studies on vertical extent of uranium contamination are limited in the region due to aforementioned main objectives of this study are to a know the groundwater quality and vertical extent of uranium contamination b link the presence of uranium and water geochemistry by utilizing hydrochemical data c understand the source of recharge to the aquifer system by employing environmental stable isotopes and relating it with uranium contamination d study the health risks extent on humans due to uranium ingestion in drinking water groundwater being crucial source of water in the region it is important to understand the levels source and behaviour of this contaminant the findings of the current study are going to be useful in understanding the source for future exploration behaviour of uranium with changing groundwater conditions for planning remediation and better policy management to reduce the health risk 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the region forms a part of the indo gangetic alluvial plain and in general represents a flat topography it comprises of alluvium and windblown sands the alluvium is mainly composed of sands of various grades clays and silts and is divided into two parts newer and older alluvium and is thus heterogeneous in nature in accordance to the mode of deposition by constantly shifting river kankar secondary calcium carbonate in the form of sheet deposits or in nodular form is met at the depth of 0 75 cm 2 m below the surface small sand dunes of varying dimensions and different alignments are observed at a number of places these dunes can be broadly classified to be of scattered type and do not appear to have any regional linear trend although in isolate parts they do have orientation cgwb 2017b study area lies in the south part of satluj river in the malwa region of punjab and lies in the arid semi arid climatic zone paul et al 2015 it includes barnala district which is bounded by moga and ludhiana in the north bathinda in the west mansa in the south and sangrur district in the east fig 1 soil of the region is highly fertile and is under extensive agriculture land use map of the region has been provided in fig 1 national remote sensing centre 2015 16 the climate of the area is described as semi arid tropical steppe and hot area receives unevenly distributed normal monsoon and average rainfall of 434 mm and 504 mm respectively cgwb 2017a the region forms part of both ghaggar and the satluj river sub basin multiple aquifer system exists up to the depth of 300 m with alternate bands of clay and medium coarse sand ground water is in unconfined condition at shallow depth up to a depth of 60 m and under semi confined or confined conditions in the deeper aquifer top aquifer is followed by clay bed of 15 35 m thickness and the deeper aquifer extends down to the depth of 300 m the groundwater is fresh in almost whole district north eastern part is more elevated as compared to the south western part thus reflects the topographic gradient and groundwater flow follows the general slope that is from north east to south west cgwb 2017a lithological cross section as a fence diagram is shown in fig 2 chopra and krishan 2014 2 2 field sampling and analysis a total of 140 groundwater samples were collected for the post monsoon season in october november 2019 sampling was done on the basis of grid method and samples were collected from every 10 10 km grid from the barnala district and 20 20 km grid from the adjoining area however there are some variations due to the problems faced in field such as power cuts or unavailability of the required parameters for wells the water samples were collected from the supply wells used for drinking and or irrigation purposes wells continuously used for water supply were sampled directly after allowing the wells to run for 10 min prior of collection the samples were labelled properly along with the details of time place and date of collection depth of the wells was obtained from the owner and ranges from 30 to 166 m all the physical parameters like ph ec orp and temperature were measured in the field in situ with the help of hanna portable meters hi98120 and hi98121 orp values presented have been corrected to she standard hydrogen electrode as the agcl electrode was used for determination of orp the electrode probe for ec and ph were calibrated daily before the analysis samples were collected in the 125 ml tarson bottles after filtration through 0 45 μm syringe filter samples for the cations measurement and uranium analysis have been preserved by using ultrapure hno3 bottles were prewashed and dried before sampling unfiltered water samples were also collected for stable isotope analysis in 50 ml glass bottles and were sealed tightly the samples were freezed at 4 c until the laboratory analyses were carried out 2 3 laboratory analysis major cation anion measurements were carried out at panjab university laboratory chandigarh by using standard methods apha 1995 sodium na and potassium k measurement was done with the use of flame photometer calcium ca2 and the total hardness were determined by using edta titrimetric methods magnesium mg2 was then calculated theoretically bicarbonate hco3 content was measured by using hcl titrimetric method and chloride cl was estimated by using mohr s argenometric titration trivedy et al 1984 sulphate so4 2 phosphate po4 3 and nitrate no3 were analyzed with the use of uv visible spectrophotometer spectronic 21d ion charge balance error has been calculated and is within the acceptable limit of 10 uranium and stable isotope measurement is done with the help of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms agilent 8900 triple quadrupole and isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo scientific delta v advantage respectively at indian institute of technology iit kanpur precision and accuracy were determined by using standard solution as replicates the overall accuracy of the standard analyzed was 7 8 for u 0 2 for δ18o and 0 3 for δ2h with a precision better than 2 4 for u 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h 2 4 health risk assessment it can be done in terms of radiological toxicity as well as chemical toxicity as uranium is a radioactive element radiological toxicity or carcinogenic risk is measured in terms of annual effective dose d and excess cancer risk ecr and is calculated on the basis of average life span of people in the region their consumption of water and uranium activity concentration it determines the probability of individual to cancer risk due to exposure to carcinogenic hazards being a heavy metal it is necessary to measure the chemical toxicity or non carcinogenic effects of uranium with target on bone and kidneys mainly chemical toxicity risk is evaluated in terms of lifetime average daily dose ladd and hazard quotient hq

rfd reference dose value is given by aerb 2004 and is taken as 4 53 μg kg 1 day 1 3 results discussion 3 1 rock water interaction and hydrochemical facies hydro chemical characterization of groundwater using piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 shows that hco3 is the dominant species among anions whereas na k is dominant among cations fig 3 in both the aquifers it indicates that na hco3 and mg2 hco3 are dominant groundwater types in the deeper aquifer whereas shallow groundwater has dominance of na and mg2 bicarbonate type of water with na cl so4 2 type also present in few of the samples mixed facies type in the shallow water results from the higher salinity due to evaporation and mixing of surface and groundwater in the shallow aquifer the change in groundwater type also varies with the characteristics of groundwater which changes by its interaction with aquifer sediments along with change in direction flow path and recharge singh et al 2017a groundwater chemistry is also controlled by variety of hydrogeochemical processes taking placing in it to have an insight on these gibbs diagram were prepared by plotting total dissolved solids tds concentration against ratio of na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 for cations and anions respectively gibbs 1970 it is seen that majority of the samples fall in the rock dominance zone resulting from interaction of groundwater and aquifer sediments in both the shallow and deeper aquifer fig 4 a and b few of the samples also lie in the evaporation dominant zone signifying the role of evaporation particularly in case of shallow groundwater chemistry if silicate and carbonate weathering takes place bicarbonate ions are usually dominant elango and kannan 2007 na vs hco3 scatter plot fig 4 c of current study confirms the same rainwater and irrigated water infiltration results in dissolution of silicate carbonate minerals present along the path and thus bicarbonate and calcium ions are released into the groundwater dehnavi et al 2011 also calcium and magnesium ions are dominant than the bicarbonate and sulphate ions in the current study with majority of samples lying above the equiline as shown in the scatter plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 fig 4 d it shows that ca2 and mg2 are dominant under the influence of carbonate weathering samples close to the equiline shows dissolution of calcite dolomite or gypsum singh et al 2017a b few of the samples falling below the equiline show ion exchange in the silicate weathering zone from albite and bicarbonate calcium content in the groundwater has increased from the ca2 na ion exchange as shown in na vs ca2 scatter plot fig 4 e ionic species in groundwater is also affected by the factors such as evaporation in na vs cl plot samples falling along the equiline show halite dissolution fig 4 f in the current study most of the samples have na cl value 1 and thus show the dominance of na ions that may have resulted from the silicate weathering and or ion exchange processes rajmohan and elango 2003 however na cl ratios are greater than what would be expected from mixing between fresh canal water and more saline groundwater to know the process of ion exchange chloro alkaline indices are employed schoeller 1977 and negative value of indices indicate that indirect or reverse ion exchange of ca2 mg2 in groundwater takes place with na and k of aquifer material the role of reverse ion exchange processes and carbonate weathering is also observed in the adjoining areas kumar et al 2011 rishi et al 2017 3 2 hydrochemistry and distribution of ions descriptive statistics of the groundwater quality parameters were determined for both the shallow and deep water and statistical summary is given in table 1 along with the who recommended values based on the mean concentration of anions also hco3 is found to be the most dominant anion followed by cl so4 2 no3 and among cations na is found as the dominant cation followed by mg2 ca2 k in both the aquifers the ph value ranges from 6 95 to 8 27 thus indicating the alkaline nature of groundwater electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater ranges from 290 to 4970 μs cm 1 and is higher in the shallow groundwater higher oxidation reduction potential orp values are found in the shallow aquifers owing its access to oxygen in the deeper aquifer lower orp values are found in less than 5 samples representing anoxic conditions however in deeper aquifer also oxic conditions are prevalent figs 5 7 the range described is concordant with the value observed by kumar et al 2021 in bathinda barnala and ludhiana sharma et al 2021 in mansa district ahada and suthar 2018 in south west punjab spatial distribution maps and the vertical graphs figs 5 7 shows that concentration of ions is higher in the southern part and shallow aquifer of the region climate plays an important role in the increasing concentration towards southern portion rainfall decreases in the south west direction and aridity increases resulting in higher evaporation cgwb 2017b paul et al 2015 sidhu et al 2021 this leads to the high conductivity and higher ion concentration in the south higher concentration observed at shallow depth may have resulted due to the soil mineralization with rapid recharge of water through shallow aquifers along with anthropogenic input whereas source of major ions in the deeper aquifers is lithogenic resulting from dissolution of rocks minerals of aquifer sediments dissolved ion concentration in the groundwater depends on the aquifer matrix and their solubility sarin et al 1989 addition of nutrients from mineral fertilizers in farmland areas also increases the ec of shallow groundwater 3 3 distribution of uranium uranium is among the major contaminants that pose severe health risk to population uranium concentration was found to be present in 76 of the water samples higher than the detection limit of world health organization who 2011a 30 μg l 1 34 of samples have uranium concentration greater than or equal to the drinking water guideline provided by atomic energy regulatory board aerb of 60 μg l 1 uranium concentration ranges from 4 26 to 318 03 μg l 1 and is higher at shallow depth the range described is comparable to the uranium concentration reported by previous researchers in punjab bajwa et al 2015 coyte et al 2018 pant et al 2017 rishi et al 2017 singh et al 1995 singh and kishore 2010 saini et al 2016 sharma et al 2017 and barnala kumar et al 2021 virk 2019 in present study it is seen that uranium distribution is not homogenous over the entire area figs 5 and 6 and among all the samples exceeding recommended values highest concentration is observed in the shallow water of bathinda district followed by mansa sangrur barnala and ludhiana respectively in case of deeper aquifer highest contamination is seen in case of moga district followed by sangrur bathinda ludhiana and barnala respectively uranium levels are reported in all the districts in table 2 an increasing trend of contamination is observed moving from north east to south west and hotspots are prominent in the southern region increase in uranium concentration towards the south west can be due to the following reasons in the study region groundwater flow is towards the low lying terrain in the south west direction cgwb 2017b krishan et al 2021 and has resulted in higher uranium concentration due to the longer time gap available for water rock interactions increase of uranium concentration along the groundwater flow direction is also observed in the al batin alluvial fan aquifer of south iraq by alkinani et al 2016 climate also plays an important role in the higher uranium levels south west region is comparatively dry due to less rainfall and higher evaporation cgwb 2017b paul et al 2015 sidhu et al 2021 higher uranium concentration in the dry climate is also observed by other researchers ayotte et al 2011 groundwater logging and nearly disrupted cycle of groundwater recharge in the south west region pc 2013 is responsible for increased concentration of uranium in groundwater as irrigation and drinking water supply is mainly based on canals in this part and there is minimal use of groundwater due to the increased salinity krishan et al 2021 also the water recharge from unlined canal network and flood irrigation increases the water level in the south west direction baweja et al 2017 and results in increased redox potential of water with more oxygen content and thus increases the uranium concentration in groundwater because of its higher solubility and mobility in oxidized hexavalent u vi form uranium concentration levels are also strongly correlated with the depth of wells and concentration decreases with increase in depth though precise pattern varies from region to region usually wells deeper than 60 m are less contaminated and higher uranium concentration aerb permissible limit is confined to the shallow aquifer only in the top 60 m similar results have also been reported by researchers in south west punjab saini et al 2016 sharma et al 2017 anthropogenic inputs such as irrigation return flow sahoo et al 2021 input from fertilizers nitrate phosphate alrakabi et al 2012 tripathi et al 2013 in the shallow water has resulted in higher concentration of major ions such as bicarbonate electrical conductivity figs 5 and 7 and thus results in increased mobilization of uranium in a way described below 3 4 geochemical controls of uranium in groundwater uranium in the groundwater may be present from the natural processes or anthropogenic inputs that results in its increased mobilization in the sub surface coyte et al 2018 smedley et al 2006 in the present study uranium in groundwater is predicted from the basic geochemistry parameters of water the chemical parameters used in the current study are major ion composition ph ec and orp knowledge of groundwater chemistry is essential to understand its influence on the release of uranium from sediments data being non parametric in nature spearman rank correlation table 3 is employed to define the relationship between uranium and other physico chemical parameters usually ph is paramount in governing the dissolution of uranium in the groundwater and affects uranium speciation echevarria et al 2001 overall ph in the current study is alkaline 7 and alkaline ph increases the uranium desorption leading to its dissolution wu et al 2014 uranium release from soil matrix also depends on the oxidation and reduction reactions taking place oxidation reduction potential stable uranium minerals form in the reducing environment low orp causing uranium to precipitate out of the groundwater whereas oxygenated groundwater high orp helps in its dissolution and transportation alam and cheng 2014 szecsody et al 1998 high uranium concentration in oxidizing groundwater of both shallow and deeper aquifer is evident from figs 7 and 8 important role of ph and orp has been considered by kumar et al 2011 and hundal 2011 in adjoining districts in the current study it is observed that ph and orp provides favourable conditions for the release of uranium but are not the controlling factors of uranium mobilization because of oxic and alkaline nature of groundwater in the entire region u is seen to have positive correlation with electrical conductivity bicarbonate sodium and potassium in both the aquifers fig 8 table 3 it is generally believed that higher the conductance higher will be the radioactivity of water uranium sorption to the sediment decreases with increase in ionic strength because of higher competition among ions in the groundwater when ionic strength of oxidized solution increases uranyl ion displacement takes place from the soil exchange sites by other ions such as ca2 mg2 and k and results in its mobilization in high ionic strength solution kumar et al 2014 krupa et al 1998 li et al 2016 very strong correlation p 0 80 of uranium is seen with ec in shallow aquifer and is moderate p 0 49 in the deeper aquifer this is consistent with the higher ec value of shallow aquifer due to input from irrigation recharge infiltration of rainwater and nutrient addition by fertilisers thus greater mobilization is seen in the shallow aquifer and ec has strong effect on uranium mobilization in semi arid regions u is strongly correlated with na p 0 84 in the shallow aquifer and is moderately correlated in deeper aquifer p 0 41 however the values are comparable in case of k p 0 41 0 45 in both the aquifers this shows that liberation of these ions also has effect on uranium mobilization leaching and migration of u in alkali matrix is also reported by the dressen et al 1982 strong positive correlation of uranium has also been observed with sulphate p 0 74 in the shallow aquifer as higher sulphate value is observed in the shallow aquifer and it can act as competing ion for u species wu et al 2018 in u affected areas bicarbonate is a major factor controlling uranium mobilization langmuir 1978 in the study region concordant changes are observed in the uranium bicarbonate pattern figs 7 and 8 and very strong positive correlation of uranium bicarbonate has been observed in both the aquifers p 0 77 0 78 intensive agriculture in the region have resulted in the high bicarbonate present in the groundwater due to plant root respiration that increases the amount of co2 g in the soil resulting in formation of bicarbonate ions rishi et al 2017 bicarbonate ions form soluble and stable complexes with uranyl ions that lead to leaching of uranium from the sediments and its migration to long distances langmuir 1997 uranium mobilization due to the formation of carbonate complexes is known worldwide from the speciation results for similar groundwater environments krestou and panias 2004 kumar et al 2014 nair et al 2014 smedley et al 2006 wu et al 2014 use of bicarbonate rich groundwater for irrigation also results in higher mobilization of uranium to groundwater burow et al 2017 jurgens et al 2008 2010 carbonic water percolation through calcareous soils increases its efficiency of leaching uranium from soils uranium mobilization in the oxidized groundwater of alkaline ph due to higher levels of bicarbonate has also been reported by researchers from adjoining regions pant et al 2017 2019 rishi et al 2017 sharma et al 2017 3 5 environmental stable isotopes source and mechanism of groundwater recharge was identified by employing stable isotopes and were related with the uranium contamination stable isotope content is plotted as δ2h and δ18o and compared with the reference global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 isotope show wide variation with δ2h content lying in the range of 71 12 to 22 77 with an average of 44 31 δ18o content vary from 10 71 to 0 34 with average of 5 37 all the groundwater samples fall below the gmwl and imwl indicating the effect of evaporation fig 9 a the slope of best fit line indicates that the aquifers get water contribution either from irrigation return flow or from evaporated surface water body slope of value less than 8 shows the evaporation effect in groundwater samples clark and fritz 1997 precipitation as major source of groundwater recharge and contribution of irrigation return flow in the shallow aquifer is reported by various workers keesari et al 2017 rao et al 2017 sharma et al 2017 contribution by canal seepage of depleted isotopic composition rai et al 2014 is also reported by tripathi et al 2016 however less effect of evaporation is seen in the deeper aquifer and is not a case in the current study there was no significant difference observed in the isotope data of shallow and deeper aquifers showing the effect of evaporation at both the levels thus it shows that some interconnection exists between shallow and deep aquifer making it susceptible to the anthropogenic impacts recharge and discharge considerably affects the uranium concentration in groundwater brindha and elango 2013 water recharge from rainfall increases the water level thus also increases the uranium concentration in groundwater recharging fresh water interacts with the uranium enriched soil of the region and results in its dissolution however uranium concentration in groundwater starts to reduce due to dilution by continuing recharge of comparatively fresh water δ18o versus u plot in fig 9 b shows that contaminated and uncontaminated groundwater cannot be differentiated on the basis of isotope data 3 6 proposed hypothesis for the source of uranium in groundwater a lot of studies have been carried out regarding the source of uranium in the most affected punjab state however facts are still not clear and requires more work research that has been done till date indicate towards geogenic origin of uranium patnaik et al 2016 singh et al 2009 sharma et al 2018 tripathi et al 2013 current study provides a schematic representation of uranium mobilization from the siwaliks lying on the north east of punjab fig 10 a siwalik sediments are the fluvial deposits along the foothills of himalayas and are formed of the detritus from sedimentary igneous and metamorphic rocks krynine 1937 these granitic bodies have supplied the sediment to form alluvial plains of punjab lying at foothills of siwaliks primary and secondary uranium minerals are reported from the tertiary and older sedimentary rocks of siwaliks and are restricted to the uranium mineralized zones kaul et al 1993 phadke et al 1985 siwaliks contributes to the most of groundwater recharge in the region and meteoric origin groundwater is supposed to supply uranium due to the rock water interactions dhanaraju et al 1985 welch and lico 1998 uranium mineralization zones of siwaliks follow the general trend of drainage channels rojas 1989 and oxygenated groundwater percolating through these zones oxidizes and mobilizes uranium from the sediments when uranium u vi enriched groundwater moves through former river channels from basin edge to basin centre fig 10 a uranium reduction takes place from the water flowing under anaerobic conditions of past time in the favourable environment environment with deficiency of oxygen containing less permeable material and reducing agents such as carbonaceous material hydrogen sulphide and pyrite is considered as the most favourable geologic environment for the uranium ore deposition rojas 1989 in present day changing climate and land use have greater role on groundwater uranium concentration uranium concentration reaching up to the 10 mg kg 1 is observed in the aquifer sediments of region bala et al 2021 prevailing oxidizing and alkaline water results in oxidative mobilization of u iv from the sediments by interaction with uranium phases present as secondary minerals or in the form of adsorption mobilization is enhanced in the saline water with high bicarbonate resulting from carbonate weathering high na and k concentration resulting from the silicate weathering and reverse ion exchange processes from the aquifer sediments elevated uranium levels in the shallow groundwater are due to the influence of various anthropogenic activities and addition of water from multiple sources such as canal water rain water and irrigation return flow continuous addition of agrochemicals and recharge of highly ionic irrigation water affects the shallow groundwater fig 10 b and results in mobilization of uranium 3 7 health risk indices health risk assessment is calculated to determine the health effects to the people of malwa region due to ingestion of high uranium water human beings are continuously exposed to the uranium via food soil air and drinking water in the study region drinking water requirements are mainly fulfilled by the use of groundwater thus presence of uranium in the water has raised a serious health concern punjab has highest number of cancer patients and uranium is considered to be one of the factors causing cancer to the people of the region because of its known carcinogenic effect saini et al 2016 cancer risk value in the region varies from 0 12 10 4 to 9 09 10 4 and aerb has recommended maximum permissible limit of 1 67 10 4 for excess cancer risk thus in present study 33 of the samples has cancer risk above the permissible limit annual effective dose level or individual dose criterion idc due to the water consumption in individual is recommended as 100 μsv y 1 who 2011b current dose level is 7 29 544 17 crossing the safe limit lifetime daily dose due to the intake of uranium varies from 0 33 to 25 01 contrast in the dose is mainly because of the heterogeneous distribution of uranium in the region around 40 of samples have ladd higher than the recommended levels of 4 53 μg kg 1 day 1 aerb 2004 hazard quotient value also varies from 0 074 to 5 521 and value greater than 1 is not acceptable as far as the chemical toxicity is concerned thus groundwater in the region is not safe for drinking purposes with 33 of samples exceeding the safe limit 4 conclusion this study investigates the occurrence of uranium in the alluvial aquifers of semi arid punjab and defines factors controlling uranium enrichment the key findings of this study are summarized below study shows that uranium distribution is not homogenous throughout the region however spatial distribution graphs reveal that concentration increases towards south west direction factors such as regional groundwater flow high groundwater table due to water logging extensive use of canal water and higher evaporation in the semi arid south west portion controls the enhanced uranium levels in groundwater hydrochemical analysis shows that major cations anions concentration is higher at shallow depth along with the high uranium prominent in the shallow zones ec hco3 na and k are identified as the controlling factors of uranium mobilization in both the aquifers however correlation of so4 2 and cl is seen only in the shallow aquifer and gives indication towards anthropogenic enrichment anthropogenic inputs from fertilizers and irrigation plays vital role in the increased uranium concentration of shallow aquifer and cannot be ignored carbonate weathering is the dominant hydro geochemical process controlling groundwater chemistry and strong correlation of uranium with electrical conductivity and alkalinity imply that weathering of carbonates and desorption of uranium from mineral surface is major cause of uranium mobilization in the aquifer system environmental stable isotopes show the evaporation signature in both the aquifers indicating the contribution of irrigation or evaporated water to the aquifer system it also shows that a connection exists between the shallow and deeper aquifer and warns against the possible contamination of deeper aquifer in the future hazard index value exceeds the permissible limit in 33 of the samples and is a potential threat for people residing in the region by posing significant cancer risk as the spatial variability of the uranium contaminated wells is very high there is urgent need to identify the unsafe wells with large scale testing to reduce health risk shallow groundwater of the region is not suitable for domestic or irrigation use due to uranium contamination however deep wells are perhaps better option with the effective governance and by preventing mixing of shallow water to the deeper aquifer though groundwater chemistry helps in basic understanding of uranium behaviour in groundwater much detailed aquifer sediments study is required to clearly define the source of uranium in study area and is a part of our future dynamics hypothesis provided regarding the source of uranium in groundwater will be useful for the future studies in this direction and can be extrapolated to the other semi arid regions with the similar

11829,occurrence of uranium u in the groundwater of south west punjab is a matter of great concern due to the rise of contaminant levels at an alarming rate its spatial and vertical variability and poor understanding of uranium mobility with depth present study has been conducted to investigate the vertical extent of contamination and geochemical factors controlling u mobilization in the groundwater of semi arid punjab out of total 140 samples collected and analyzed 76 samples have uranium levels greater than the chemical toxicity limit of world health organization who 30 μg l 1 and 34 samples have concentration higher than the radiological toxicity limit given by atomic energy regulatory board aerb 60 μg l 1 water at shallow depth 60 m is found to be more contaminated than water at deeper depth 60 m and concentration lies in the range of 4 26 318 03 μg l 1 spatial distribution graphs are used to identify the hotspots of contamination and concentration is higher in the flow direction of groundwater towards south west in both the aquifers groundwater is alkaline and oxic in character with carbonate weathering as dominant hydrogeochemical process affecting chemical composition of water higher uranium concentration is seen in the oxidizing alkaline and carbonate rich water alkali earth metals na k are also strongly correlated with the uranium in groundwater at both the levels use of environmental stable isotopes δ18o δ2h shows the evaporation signature in both the aquifers health risk assessment is carried out and values higher than permissible limit give indication towards the health risk to the population exposed due to the consumption of uranium contaminated water from long time this study provides a strong base for better understanding the source of uranium in the aquifer system of region and the results would be useful for further studies in quaternary alluvial aquifers of semi arid regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater

drinking water health hazard is brought to the notice after the provisional guideline given by world health organization who earlier u was not a part of water quality investigations at most of the places and thus the background information on distribution and range of concentration in the groundwater is limited from past few decades element concentration in groundwater exceeding the permissible limit of who i e 30 μg l 1 who 2011a has become a serious health concern globally countries such as canada moss et al 1983 finland kurttio et al 2006 new mexico usa hakonson hayes et al 2002 china wu et al 2014 and mongolia nriagu et al 2012 have identified uranium in its groundwater uranium levels in the groundwater of quaternary fluvial aquifer also exceed the german drinking water limit of 10 μg l 1 banning et al 2017 uranium is introduced to the groundwater system by the natural geochemical processes geogenic or anthropogenic activities coyte et al 2018 smedley et al 2006 geogenic source includes the mineral dissolution of host rocks and sediments along the flow path of groundwater or desorption from the surface of various minerals chen et al 2005 jerden and sinha 2006 in rocks and soil uranium is present in many major rock forming minerals and is also incorporated in a number of minor phases it can also be present on grain boundaries it is well known that clays carbonate fe mn and al oxides and hydroxides act as strong adsorbent of uranium porcelli and swarzenski 2003 anthropogenic sources of uranium include mining and ore processing of uranium radioactive material production and disposal combustion of fuels and use of phosphatic fertilizers in agricultural fields cothern and lappenbusch 1983 dreeson et al 1982 spalding and sackett 1972 tadmor 1986 however concentration is highly variable depending on the groundwater chemistry aquifer characteristics and bedrock geology frengstad et al 2000 redox processes control the enrichment of u in groundwater and its solubility is highly sensitive to the aquifer geochemistry fate of the uranium i e whether it gets sorbed mobilized precipitated or immobilized is decided mainly by its oxidation state and mineral solubility maher et al 2013 environmental chemistry of uranium is influenced by its oxidation reduction potential orp because of their redox dependency finch and murakami 1999 there are three main oxidation states of u iv v and vi in nature however u iv the reduced form and u vi the oxidized form controls most of the u geochemistry the solubility of u vi is extremely high and oxidizing conditions effectively enhance the uranium movement alam and cheng 2014 uranium mobilization is studied by the various complexes formed by it in the water system depending on ph and pco2 at lower ph 5 dominant species of u is uranyl ion uo2 2 however uo2 2 forms complexes with carbonate phosphate and calcium at higher phs bernhard 1998 langmuir 1978 porcelli and swarzenski 2003 uranium concentration is also affected by recharge and discharge from the aquifers and stable isotopes 18o 2h are widely used to get an insight to the aquifer recharge system kendall and macdonnell 1998 negrel et al 2003 these environmental tracers are recognized as recorders of important processes like evaporation transpiration recycling and mixing of water tarki et al 2016 uranium poisoning is a matter of concern more because of its chemical toxicity than its radiological impacts a considerable body of evidence also suggests that overexposure to uranium causes nephrotoxicity and osteotoxicity kurttio et al 2006 uranyl ion replaces the calcium in the bone crystal moss et al 1983 and skeleton is the main site of its accumulation wrenn et al 1985 in india 16 states have been detected with uranium in its groundwater uranium in groundwater is prevalent in states of andhra pradesh babu et al 2008 karnataka brindha and elango 2013 gujarat west bengal chhattisgarh haryana himachal pradesh madhya pradesh punjab and rajasthan coyte et al 2018 all the states except north west nw india have pre cambrian rocks which are naturally considered to be a source of uranium thivya et al 2016 cgwb 2014 the alluvial aquifers of nw india have received worldwide attention from past few decades due to the large scale presence of uranium in its groundwater coyte et al 2018 punjab is an agriculture dominant state of nw india and major amount of groundwater is employed for irrigation requirements kumar et al 2018 aquifers in the region are exploited in terms of both groundwater quantity and quality bonsor et al 2017 baweja et al 2017 cgwb 2017b macdonald et al 2016 although various studies have been carried out on distribution of uranium in the groundwater of punjab bajwa et al 2015 coyte et al 2018 pant et al 2017 rishi et al 2017 singh et al 1995 singh and kishore 2010 saini et al 2016 sharma et al 2017 however work done is very limited in the barnala district which shows highest groundwater depletion sidhu et al 2021 current study is important as explained studies on vertical extent of uranium contamination are limited in the region due to aforementioned main objectives of this study are to a know the groundwater quality and vertical extent of uranium contamination b link the presence of uranium and water geochemistry by utilizing hydrochemical data c understand the source of recharge to the aquifer system by employing environmental stable isotopes and relating it with uranium contamination d study the health risks extent on humans due to uranium ingestion in drinking water groundwater being crucial source of water in the region it is important to understand the levels source and behaviour of this contaminant the findings of the current study are going to be useful in understanding the source for future exploration behaviour of uranium with changing groundwater conditions for planning remediation and better policy management to reduce the health risk 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the region forms a part of the indo gangetic alluvial plain and in general represents a flat topography it comprises of alluvium and windblown sands the alluvium is mainly composed of sands of various grades clays and silts and is divided into two parts newer and older alluvium and is thus heterogeneous in nature in accordance to the mode of deposition by constantly shifting river kankar secondary calcium carbonate in the form of sheet deposits or in nodular form is met at the depth of 0 75 cm 2 m below the surface small sand dunes of varying dimensions and different alignments are observed at a number of places these dunes can be broadly classified to be of scattered type and do not appear to have any regional linear trend although in isolate parts they do have orientation cgwb 2017b study area lies in the south part of satluj river in the malwa region of punjab and lies in the arid semi arid climatic zone paul et al 2015 it includes barnala district which is bounded by moga and ludhiana in the north bathinda in the west mansa in the south and sangrur district in the east fig 1 soil of the region is highly fertile and is under extensive agriculture land use map of the region has been provided in fig 1 national remote sensing centre 2015 16 the climate of the area is described as semi arid tropical steppe and hot area receives unevenly distributed normal monsoon and average rainfall of 434 mm and 504 mm respectively cgwb 2017a the region forms part of both ghaggar and the satluj river sub basin multiple aquifer system exists up to the depth of 300 m with alternate bands of clay and medium coarse sand ground water is in unconfined condition at shallow depth up to a depth of 60 m and under semi confined or confined conditions in the deeper aquifer top aquifer is followed by clay bed of 15 35 m thickness and the deeper aquifer extends down to the depth of 300 m the groundwater is fresh in almost whole district north eastern part is more elevated as compared to the south western part thus reflects the topographic gradient and groundwater flow follows the general slope that is from north east to south west cgwb 2017a lithological cross section as a fence diagram is shown in fig 2 chopra and krishan 2014 2 2 field sampling and analysis a total of 140 groundwater samples were collected for the post monsoon season in october november 2019 sampling was done on the basis of grid method and samples were collected from every 10 10 km grid from the barnala district and 20 20 km grid from the adjoining area however there are some variations due to the problems faced in field such as power cuts or unavailability of the required parameters for wells the water samples were collected from the supply wells used for drinking and or irrigation purposes wells continuously used for water supply were sampled directly after allowing the wells to run for 10 min prior of collection the samples were labelled properly along with the details of time place and date of collection depth of the wells was obtained from the owner and ranges from 30 to 166 m all the physical parameters like ph ec orp and temperature were measured in the field in situ with the help of hanna portable meters hi98120 and hi98121 orp values presented have been corrected to she standard hydrogen electrode as the agcl electrode was used for determination of orp the electrode probe for ec and ph were calibrated daily before the analysis samples were collected in the 125 ml tarson bottles after filtration through 0 45 μm syringe filter samples for the cations measurement and uranium analysis have been preserved by using ultrapure hno3 bottles were prewashed and dried before sampling unfiltered water samples were also collected for stable isotope analysis in 50 ml glass bottles and were sealed tightly the samples were freezed at 4 c until the laboratory analyses were carried out 2 3 laboratory analysis major cation anion measurements were carried out at panjab university laboratory chandigarh by using standard methods apha 1995 sodium na and potassium k measurement was done with the use of flame photometer calcium ca2 and the total hardness were determined by using edta titrimetric methods magnesium mg2 was then calculated theoretically bicarbonate hco3 content was measured by using hcl titrimetric method and chloride cl was estimated by using mohr s argenometric titration trivedy et al 1984 sulphate so4 2 phosphate po4 3 and nitrate no3 were analyzed with the use of uv visible spectrophotometer spectronic 21d ion charge balance error has been calculated and is within the acceptable limit of 10 uranium and stable isotope measurement is done with the help of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms agilent 8900 triple quadrupole and isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms thermo scientific delta v advantage respectively at indian institute of technology iit kanpur precision and accuracy were determined by using standard solution as replicates the overall accuracy of the standard analyzed was 7 8 for u 0 2 for δ18o and 0 3 for δ2h with a precision better than 2 4 for u 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h 2 4 health risk assessment it can be done in terms of radiological toxicity as well as chemical toxicity as uranium is a radioactive element radiological toxicity or carcinogenic risk is measured in terms of annual effective dose d and excess cancer risk ecr and is calculated on the basis of average life span of people in the region their consumption of water and uranium activity concentration it determines the probability of individual to cancer risk due to exposure to carcinogenic hazards being a heavy metal it is necessary to measure the chemical toxicity or non carcinogenic effects of uranium with target on bone and kidneys mainly chemical toxicity risk is evaluated in terms of lifetime average daily dose ladd and hazard quotient hq

groundwater using piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 shows that hco3 is the dominant species among anions whereas na k is dominant among cations fig 3 in both the aquifers it indicates that na hco3 and mg2 hco3 are dominant groundwater types in the deeper aquifer whereas shallow groundwater has dominance of na and mg2 bicarbonate type of water with na cl so4 2 type also present in few of the samples mixed facies type in the shallow water results from the higher salinity due to evaporation and mixing of surface and groundwater in the shallow aquifer the change in groundwater type also varies with the characteristics of groundwater which changes by its interaction with aquifer sediments along with change in direction flow path and recharge singh et al 2017a groundwater chemistry is also controlled by variety of hydrogeochemical processes taking placing in it to have an insight on these gibbs diagram were prepared by plotting total dissolved solids tds concentration against ratio of na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 for cations and anions respectively gibbs 1970 it is seen that majority of the samples fall in the rock dominance zone resulting from interaction of groundwater and aquifer sediments in both the shallow and deeper aquifer fig 4 a and b few of the samples also lie in the evaporation dominant zone signifying the role of evaporation particularly in case of shallow groundwater chemistry if silicate and carbonate weathering takes place bicarbonate ions are usually dominant elango and kannan 2007 na vs hco3 scatter plot fig 4 c of current study confirms the same rainwater and irrigated water infiltration results in dissolution of silicate carbonate minerals present along the path and thus bicarbonate and calcium ions are released into the groundwater dehnavi et al 2011 also calcium and magnesium ions are dominant than the bicarbonate and sulphate ions in the current study with majority of samples lying above the equiline as shown in the scatter plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 fig 4 d it shows that ca2 and mg2 are dominant under the influence of carbonate weathering samples close to the equiline shows dissolution of calcite dolomite or gypsum singh et al 2017a b few of the samples falling below the equiline show ion exchange in the silicate weathering zone from albite and bicarbonate calcium content in the groundwater has increased from the ca2 na ion exchange as shown in na vs ca2 scatter plot fig 4 e ionic species in groundwater is also affected by the factors such as evaporation in na vs cl plot samples falling along the equiline show halite dissolution fig 4 f in the current study most of the samples have na cl value 1 and thus show the dominance of na ions that may have resulted from the silicate weathering and or ion exchange processes rajmohan and elango 2003 however na cl ratios are greater than what would be expected from mixing between fresh canal water and more saline groundwater to know the process of ion exchange chloro alkaline indices are employed schoeller 1977 and negative value of indices indicate that indirect or reverse ion exchange of ca2 mg2 in groundwater takes place with na and k of aquifer material the role of reverse ion exchange processes and carbonate weathering is also observed in the adjoining areas kumar et al 2011 rishi et al 2017 3 2 hydrochemistry and distribution of ions descriptive statistics of the groundwater quality parameters were determined for both the shallow and deep water and statistical summary is given in table 1 along with the who recommended values based on the mean concentration of anions also hco3 is found to be the most dominant anion followed by cl so4 2 no3 and among cations na is found as the dominant cation followed by mg2 ca2 k in both the aquifers the ph value ranges from 6 95 to 8 27 thus indicating the alkaline nature of groundwater electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater ranges from 290 to 4970 μs cm 1 and is higher in the shallow groundwater higher oxidation reduction potential orp values are found in the shallow aquifers owing its access to oxygen in the deeper aquifer lower orp values are found in less than 5 samples representing anoxic conditions however in deeper aquifer also oxic conditions are prevalent figs 5 7 the range described is concordant with the value observed by kumar et al 2021 in bathinda barnala and ludhiana sharma et al 2021 in mansa district ahada and suthar 2018 in south west punjab spatial distribution maps and the vertical graphs figs 5 7 shows that concentration of ions is higher in the southern part and shallow aquifer of the region climate plays an important role in the increasing concentration towards southern portion rainfall decreases in the south west direction and aridity increases resulting in higher evaporation cgwb 2017b paul et al 2015 sidhu et al 2021 this leads to the high conductivity and higher ion concentration in the south higher concentration observed at shallow depth may have resulted due to the soil mineralization with rapid recharge of water through shallow aquifers along with anthropogenic input whereas source of major ions in the deeper aquifers is lithogenic resulting from dissolution of rocks minerals of aquifer sediments dissolved ion concentration in the groundwater depends on the aquifer matrix and their solubility sarin et al 1989 addition of nutrients from mineral fertilizers in farmland areas also increases the ec of shallow groundwater 3 3 distribution of uranium uranium is among the major contaminants that pose severe health risk to population uranium concentration was found to be present in 76 of the water samples higher than the detection limit of world health organization who 2011a 30 μg l 1 34 of samples have uranium concentration greater than or equal to the drinking water guideline provided by atomic energy regulatory board aerb of 60 μg l 1 uranium concentration ranges from 4 26 to 318 03 μg l 1 and is higher at shallow depth the range described is comparable to the uranium concentration reported by previous researchers in punjab bajwa et al 2015 coyte et al 2018 pant et al 2017 rishi et al 2017 singh et al 1995 singh and kishore 2010 saini et al 2016 sharma et al 2017 and barnala kumar et al 2021 virk 2019 in present study it is seen that uranium distribution is not homogenous over the entire area figs 5 and 6 and among all the samples exceeding recommended values highest concentration is observed in the shallow water of bathinda district followed by mansa sangrur barnala and ludhiana respectively in case of deeper aquifer highest contamination is seen in case of moga district followed by sangrur bathinda ludhiana and barnala respectively uranium levels are reported in all the districts in table 2 an increasing trend of contamination is observed moving from north east to south west and hotspots are prominent in the southern region increase in uranium concentration towards the south west can be due to the following reasons in the study region groundwater flow is towards the low lying terrain in the south west direction cgwb 2017b krishan et al 2021 and has resulted in higher uranium concentration due to the longer time gap available for water rock interactions increase of uranium concentration along the groundwater flow direction is also observed in the al batin alluvial fan aquifer of south iraq by alkinani et al 2016 climate also plays an important role in the higher uranium levels south west region is comparatively dry due to less rainfall and higher evaporation cgwb 2017b paul et al 2015 sidhu et al 2021 higher uranium concentration in the dry climate is also observed by other researchers ayotte et al 2011 groundwater logging and nearly disrupted cycle of groundwater recharge in the south west region pc 2013 is responsible for increased concentration of uranium in groundwater as irrigation and drinking water supply is mainly based on canals in this part and there is minimal use of groundwater due to the increased salinity krishan et al 2021 also the water recharge from unlined canal network and flood irrigation increases the water level in the south west direction baweja et al 2017 and results in increased redox potential of water with more oxygen content and thus increases the uranium concentration in groundwater because of its higher solubility and mobility in oxidized hexavalent u vi form uranium concentration levels are also strongly correlated with the depth of wells and concentration decreases with increase in depth though precise pattern varies from region to region usually wells deeper than 60 m are less contaminated and higher uranium concentration aerb permissible limit is confined to the shallow aquifer only in the top 60 m similar results have also been reported by researchers in south west punjab saini et al 2016 sharma et al 2017 anthropogenic inputs such as irrigation return flow sahoo et al 2021 input from fertilizers nitrate phosphate alrakabi et al 2012 tripathi et al 2013 in the shallow water has resulted in higher concentration of major ions such as bicarbonate electrical conductivity figs 5 and 7 and thus results in increased mobilization of uranium in a way described below 3 4 geochemical controls of uranium in groundwater uranium in the groundwater may be present from the natural processes or anthropogenic inputs that results in its increased mobilization in the sub surface coyte et al 2018 smedley et al 2006 in the present study uranium in groundwater is predicted from the basic geochemistry parameters of water the chemical parameters used in the current study are major ion composition ph ec and orp knowledge of groundwater chemistry is essential to understand its influence on the release of uranium from sediments data being non parametric in nature spearman rank correlation table 3 is employed to define the relationship between uranium and other physico chemical parameters usually ph is paramount in governing the dissolution of uranium in the groundwater and affects uranium speciation echevarria et al 2001 overall ph in the current study is alkaline 7 and alkaline ph increases the uranium desorption leading to its dissolution wu et al 2014 uranium release from soil matrix also depends on the oxidation and reduction reactions taking place oxidation reduction potential stable uranium minerals form in the reducing environment low orp causing uranium to precipitate out of the groundwater whereas oxygenated groundwater high orp helps in its dissolution and transportation alam and cheng 2014 szecsody et al 1998 high uranium concentration in oxidizing groundwater of both shallow and deeper aquifer is evident from figs 7 and 8 important role of ph and orp has been considered by kumar et al 2011 and hundal 2011 in adjoining districts in the current study it is observed that ph and orp provides favourable conditions for the release of uranium but are not the controlling factors of uranium mobilization because of oxic and alkaline nature of groundwater in the entire region u is seen to have positive correlation with electrical conductivity bicarbonate sodium and potassium in both the aquifers fig 8 table 3 it is generally believed that higher the conductance higher will be the radioactivity of water uranium sorption to the sediment decreases with increase in ionic strength because of higher competition among ions in the groundwater when ionic strength of oxidized solution increases uranyl ion displacement takes place from the soil exchange sites by other ions such as ca2 mg2 and k and results in its mobilization in high ionic strength solution kumar et al 2014 krupa et al 1998 li et al 2016 very strong correlation p 0 80 of uranium is seen with ec in shallow aquifer and is moderate p 0 49 in the deeper aquifer this is consistent with the higher ec value of shallow aquifer due to input from irrigation recharge infiltration of rainwater and nutrient addition by fertilisers thus greater mobilization is seen in the shallow aquifer and ec has strong effect on uranium mobilization in semi arid regions u is strongly correlated with na p 0 84 in the shallow aquifer and is moderately correlated in deeper aquifer p 0 41 however the values are comparable in case of k p 0 41 0 45 in both the aquifers this shows that liberation of these ions also has effect on uranium mobilization leaching and migration of u in alkali matrix is also reported by the dressen et al 1982 strong positive correlation of uranium has also been observed with sulphate p 0 74 in the shallow aquifer as higher sulphate value is observed in the shallow aquifer and it can act as competing ion for u species wu et al 2018 in u affected areas bicarbonate is a major factor controlling uranium mobilization langmuir 1978 in the study region concordant changes are observed in the uranium bicarbonate pattern figs 7 and 8 and very strong positive correlation of uranium bicarbonate has been observed in both the aquifers p 0 77 0 78 intensive agriculture in the region have resulted in the high bicarbonate present in the groundwater due to plant root respiration that increases the amount of co2 g in the soil resulting in formation of bicarbonate ions rishi et al 2017 bicarbonate ions form soluble and stable complexes with uranyl ions that lead to leaching of uranium from the sediments and its migration to long distances langmuir 1997 uranium mobilization due to the formation of carbonate complexes is known worldwide from the speciation results for similar groundwater environments krestou and panias 2004 kumar et al 2014 nair et al 2014 smedley et al 2006 wu et al 2014 use of bicarbonate rich groundwater for irrigation also results in higher mobilization of uranium to groundwater burow et al 2017 jurgens et al 2008 2010 carbonic water percolation through calcareous soils increases its efficiency of leaching uranium from soils uranium mobilization in the oxidized groundwater of alkaline ph due to higher levels of bicarbonate has also been reported by researchers from adjoining regions pant et al 2017 2019 rishi et al 2017 sharma et al 2017 3 5 environmental stable isotopes source and mechanism of groundwater recharge was identified by employing stable isotopes and were related with the uranium contamination stable isotope content is plotted as δ2h and δ18o and compared with the reference global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 isotope show wide variation with δ2h content lying in the range of 71 12 to 22 77 with an average of 44 31 δ18o content vary from 10 71 to 0 34 with average of 5 37 all the groundwater samples fall below the gmwl and imwl indicating the effect of evaporation fig 9 a the slope of best fit line indicates that the aquifers get water contribution either from irrigation return flow or from evaporated surface water body slope of value less than 8 shows the evaporation effect in groundwater samples clark and fritz 1997 precipitation as major source of groundwater recharge and contribution of irrigation return flow in the shallow aquifer is reported by various workers keesari et al 2017 rao et al 2017 sharma et al 2017 contribution by canal seepage of depleted isotopic composition rai et al 2014 is also reported by tripathi et al 2016 however less effect of evaporation is seen in the deeper aquifer and is not a case in the current study there was no significant difference observed in the isotope data of shallow and deeper aquifers showing the effect of evaporation at both the levels thus it shows that some interconnection exists between shallow and deep aquifer making it susceptible to the anthropogenic impacts recharge and discharge considerably affects the uranium concentration in groundwater brindha and elango 2013 water recharge from rainfall increases the water level thus also increases the uranium concentration in groundwater recharging fresh water interacts with the uranium enriched soil of the region and results in its dissolution however uranium concentration in groundwater starts to reduce due to dilution by continuing recharge of comparatively fresh water δ18o versus u plot in fig 9 b shows that contaminated and uncontaminated groundwater cannot be differentiated on the basis of isotope data 3 6 proposed hypothesis for the source of uranium in groundwater a lot of studies have been carried out regarding the source of uranium in the most affected punjab state however facts are still not clear and requires more work research that has been done till date indicate towards geogenic origin of uranium patnaik et al 2016 singh et al 2009 sharma et al 2018 tripathi et al 2013 current study provides a schematic representation of uranium mobilization from the siwaliks lying on the north east of punjab fig 10 a siwalik sediments are the fluvial deposits along the foothills of himalayas and are formed of the detritus from sedimentary igneous and metamorphic rocks krynine 1937 these granitic bodies have supplied the sediment to form alluvial plains of punjab lying at foothills of siwaliks primary and secondary uranium minerals are reported from the tertiary and older sedimentary rocks of siwaliks and are restricted to the uranium mineralized zones kaul et al 1993 phadke et al 1985 siwaliks contributes to the most of groundwater recharge in the region and meteoric origin groundwater is supposed to supply uranium due to the rock water interactions dhanaraju et al 1985 welch and lico 1998 uranium mineralization zones of siwaliks follow the general trend of drainage channels rojas 1989 and oxygenated groundwater percolating through these zones oxidizes and mobilizes uranium from the sediments when uranium u vi enriched groundwater moves through former river channels from basin edge to basin centre fig 10 a uranium reduction takes place from the water flowing under anaerobic conditions of past time in the favourable environment environment with deficiency of oxygen containing less permeable material and reducing agents such as carbonaceous material hydrogen sulphide and pyrite is considered as the most favourable geologic environment for the uranium ore deposition rojas 1989 in present day changing climate and land use have greater role on groundwater uranium concentration uranium concentration reaching up to the 10 mg kg 1 is observed in the aquifer sediments of region bala et al 2021 prevailing oxidizing and alkaline water results in oxidative mobilization of u iv from the sediments by interaction with uranium phases present as secondary minerals or in the form of adsorption mobilization is enhanced in the saline water with high bicarbonate resulting from carbonate weathering high na and k concentration resulting from the silicate weathering and reverse ion exchange processes from the aquifer sediments elevated uranium levels in the shallow groundwater are due to the influence of various anthropogenic activities and addition of water from multiple sources such as canal water rain water and irrigation return flow continuous addition of agrochemicals and recharge of highly ionic irrigation water affects the shallow groundwater fig 10 b and results in mobilization of uranium 3 7 health risk indices health risk assessment is calculated to determine the health effects to the people of malwa region due to ingestion of high uranium water human beings are continuously exposed to the uranium via food soil air and drinking water in the study region drinking water requirements are mainly fulfilled by the use of groundwater thus presence of uranium in the water has raised a serious health concern punjab has highest number of cancer patients and uranium is considered to be one of the factors causing cancer to the people of the region because of its known carcinogenic effect saini et al 2016 cancer risk value in the region varies from 0 12 10 4 to 9 09 10 4 and aerb has recommended maximum permissible limit of 1 67 10 4 for excess cancer risk thus in present study 33 of the samples has cancer risk above the permissible limit annual effective dose level or individual dose criterion idc due to the water consumption in individual is recommended as 100 μsv y 1 who 2011b current dose level is 7 29 544 17 crossing the safe limit lifetime daily dose due to the intake of uranium varies from 0 33 to 25 01 contrast in the dose is mainly because of the heterogeneous distribution of uranium in the region around 40 of samples have ladd higher than the recommended levels of 4 53 μg kg 1 day 1 aerb 2004 hazard quotient value also varies from 0 074 to 5 521 and value greater than 1 is not acceptable as far as the chemical toxicity is concerned thus groundwater in the region is not safe for drinking purposes with 33 of samples exceeding the safe limit 4 conclusion this study investigates the occurrence of uranium in the alluvial aquifers of semi arid punjab and defines factors controlling uranium enrichment the key findings of this study are summarized below study shows that uranium distribution is not homogenous throughout the region however spatial distribution graphs reveal that concentration increases towards south west direction factors such as regional groundwater flow high groundwater table due to water logging extensive use of canal water and higher evaporation in the semi arid south west portion controls the enhanced uranium levels in groundwater hydrochemical analysis shows that major cations anions concentration is higher at shallow depth along with the high uranium prominent in the shallow zones ec hco3 na and k are identified as the controlling factors of uranium mobilization in both the aquifers however correlation of so4 2 and cl is seen only in the shallow aquifer and gives indication towards anthropogenic enrichment anthropogenic inputs from fertilizers and irrigation plays vital role in the increased uranium concentration of shallow aquifer and cannot be ignored carbonate weathering is the dominant hydro geochemical process controlling groundwater chemistry and strong correlation of uranium with electrical conductivity and alkalinity imply that weathering of carbonates and desorption of uranium from mineral surface is major cause of uranium mobilization in the aquifer system environmental stable isotopes show the evaporation signature in both the aquifers indicating the contribution of irrigation or evaporated water to the aquifer system it also shows that a connection exists between the shallow and deeper aquifer and warns against the possible contamination of deeper aquifer in the future hazard index value exceeds the permissible limit in 33 of the samples and is a potential threat for people residing in the region by posing significant cancer risk as the spatial variability of the uranium contaminated wells is very high there is urgent need to identify the unsafe wells with large scale testing to reduce health risk shallow groundwater of the region is not suitable for domestic or irrigation use due to uranium contamination however deep wells are perhaps better option with the effective governance and by preventing mixing of shallow water to the deeper aquifer though groundwater chemistry helps in basic understanding of uranium behaviour in groundwater much detailed aquifer sediments study is required to clearly define the source of uranium in study area and is a part of our future dynamics hypothesis provided regarding the source of uranium in groundwater will be useful for the future studies in this direction and can be extrapolated to the other semi arid regions with the similar
