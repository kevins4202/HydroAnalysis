16215,clarifying the influence of hydrological variations on ecological function is a topic of considerable interest in watershed ecological flow assessment and water resource management net ecosystem productivity nep is a useful composite indicator of ecosystem function reflecting material cycling and energy flow however the effects of hydrological variations on nep especially the influence mechanism remain unclear due to the complex environmental characteristics in estuaries we analysed the spatial temporal variability of the aquatic environment and nep through in situ monitoring and field sampling from december 2018 to january 2020 at three outlets humen jiaomen and hongqimen with different hydrological conditions in the pearl river estuary pre china and explored the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on nep the 155 groups of effective metabolism values were estimated using odum s open water method the daily ecosystem respiration er was higher than the gross primary production gpp therefore water bodies were dominated by net heterotrophy at the three outlets the daily nep 4 34 1 40 mg o2 l 1d 1 o2 concentration 5 2 1 02 mg l 1 and ph 7 53 0 24 were lowest at humen which also had the largest discharge and tide volume deepest water depth and widest channel seasonally the nep in the summer 3 30 1 39 mg o2 l 1d 1 and autumn 3 19 1 60 mg o2 l 1d 1 was lower than those in the spring 1 56 1 92 mg o2 l 1d 1 and winter 2 17 1 50 mg o2 l 1d 1 the inhibitory effect of increased discharge on the metabolic rate exceeded the stimulation provided by seasonal factors such as increased temperature and solar radiation the scour and dilution effect caused by discharge increase reduced chlorophyll a concentration meanwhile the increase in turbidity resulted in a decrease in the photosynthetic rate and gpp er was stimulated by heterotrophic microorganisms and high total suspended solids resulting in a decrease in o2 and endogenous organics thus causing the low nep hypoxia and acidification phenomenon our results suggest that lengthening the discharge pulse period in summer and autumn will further decrease nep and increase the area of hypoxia and

mixing nutrient and organic matter enrichment and the provision of important ecological service functions he and silliman 2019 however estuarine ecosystems are typically fragile increasing human activities have greatly changed the hydrological regime adams 2014 sun et al 2015 hydrological variations such as hydrological pulse time and runoff intensity will impact fresh salt water exchange habitat availability and connectivity thus affecting species distribution changing the structure and function of estuarine ecosystems and ultimately affecting the balance and overall health of estuarine ecosystems singh et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 thus clarifying the effects of hydrological variations on ecological function and the influence mechanism except structural indicators is significant in watershed ecological flow assessment and water resource management adams 2014 net ecosystem productivity nep analogous to net ecosystem metabolism nem is the difference between gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration er nep gpp er it is an important functional indicator reflecting the ecological service functions of water purification productivity supply and carbon sources sinks when nep 0 ecosystems are dominated by autotrophic processes that consume nutrients release o2 and assimilate co2 therefore the system becomes an atmospheric carbon sink and the ph of the water body improves in addition phytoplankton synthesise their own biomass and absorb toxic and harmful substances thus purifying the water as a food supply phytoplankton biomass can increase the yield of copepods bivalve molluscs and other organisms and become the basic food resource for higher trophic level organisms including humans when synthesised organic matter sinks it stimulates the respiration of underlying organisms and resynthesis of nutrients cloern et al 2014 herfort et al 2012 by contrast when nep 0 the ecosystems are dominated by heterotrophic processes and the organic matter decomposition rate exceeds the ecosystem production rate if oxygen consumption is continuously greater than oxygen production dissolved oxygen do concentration can decrease and hypoxia can occur the ecosystem changes from an atmospheric carbon sink to a carbon source and the water body will acidate additionally the biomass of phytoplankton synthesis decreases and the quantity and structure of the biological population and estuarine food network change thus affecting offshore fishery resources caffrey et al 2014 stumpner et al 2020 therefore clarifying the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on nep can help to determine ways to regulate the hydrological regime and thus improve estuarine ecosystem function the influence of river discharge on metabolic rates has been studied many times at single locations in estuaries using odum s open water method and short or long term dissolved o2 time series beck et al 2015 murrell et al 2018 sarma et al 2009 however the differences in the geographic geologic and climate signatures between the estuaries limit the representative capability of single site nep calculations caffrey et al 2014 russell et al 2006 nep varies over time and within a bay dominated by a river at one end and ocean exchange at the other end few studies focus on statistical analysis using multi point monitoring at different outlets in the same estuary in addition our understanding of the metabolic balance in estuarine ecosystems is still poor cloern et al 2014 reviewed 1148 values of phytoplankton primary production in global estuarine coastal ecosystems and showed that the data are mainly concentrated in northern europe and north america less data are available for other parts of the world some attempts to understand seasonal and spatial variations in metabolic rates in estuaries were largely in temperate regions kemp et al 1997 caffrey 2003 cloern et al 2014 shen et al 2020 and few results have been obtained from subtropical and tropical estuaries we analysed the spatial temporal variability of the aquatic environment and nep through in situ monitoring and field sampling from december 2018 to january 2020 and explored the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on nep at three outlets with different hydrological characteristics in the subtropical pearl river estuary pre china different discharge conditions can provide a more reliable basis for exploring the influence mechanism of discharge changes on nep we also evaluated the applicability of odum s open water dissolved oxygen method commonly used to estimate aquatic metabolism in estuaries to the three outlets 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design the pre is located in a subtropical climate zone in southern central guangdong province china 21 5 23 5 n 113 0 114 5 e it is situated in the core area of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba one of the most densely populated regions in the world it has a complicated water system fig 1 the pearl river is the second largest river in china in terms of freshwater discharge with an annual discharge of 3 5 1011 m3 80 of which occurs in the wet season from april to october driven by the asian monsoon the pearl river has three main tributaries the west xijiang north beijiang and east dongjiang rivers as well as several small local rivers in the delta runoff from these tributaries discharges into the south china sea via eight major outlets humen jiaomen hongqimen hengmen modaomen jitimen hutiaomen and yamen through three subestuaries lingdingyang modaomen and huangmaohai several metropolises including shenzhen and hong kong are located on lingdingyang s east coast zhuhai and macao are located on the west coast and guangzhou is located on the north coast we collected the daily discharge data at three hydrological stations in the lower reaches of the pearl river that are closest to the estuary gaoyao shijiao and boluo hydrological stations of xijiang beijiang and dongjiang rivers respectively the total discharge m3 s 1 from the pre to the south china sea is the sum of the three hydrological stations the daily discharge data were obtained from the website of the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn hourly tidal height data at nansha shuiniutou station were downloaded from the maritime service network water sampling and in situ monitoring were conducted at humen south branch of jiaomen hereinafter referred to as jiaomen and hongqimen at the three eastern outlets of the pre fig 1 the hydrological characteristics differ considerably among the three outlets the channel of humen outlet is wider and deeper than that of the jiaomen and hongqimen outlets according to historical statistical data from the pearl river water resource commission of the ministry of water resource the daily discharge at humen jiaomen and hongqimen accounted for 24 5 16 8 and 7 2 of the total discharge into the sea respectively table 1 the order of sediment concentration at these three outlets is hongqimen jiaomen humen while the order of tidal volume and range is humen jiaomen humen the flood tidal volumes of humen jiaomen and hongqimen are 2133 108 308 108 and 95 108 m3 respectively the ratios of discharge to tide of humen jiaomen and hongqimen are 0 38 1 79 and 2 51 respectively thirteen sites 4 5 at each outlet were chosen for in situ monitoring fig 1 each site was located at approximately one sixth of the bank of the wide channel with fewer vessels passing through to avoid human disturbance water depth ranged from 3 5 9 0 m at these sites the water quality sensor was fixed and suspended at a depth of x223c0 8 1 0 m water sampling and in situ monitoring were conducted in december 2018 and from march 2019 to january 2020 considering the safety of equipment and personnel only the first monitoring was performed in december 2018 at four sites fig 1 due to the relative difficulty in equipment placement and fixation we included the metabolism data at these sites in following analysis as they can partly reflect the environmental variation at higher salinity the three most seaward sites indicated by red blue and black symbols are jointly affected by multiple outlets we assigned the red blue and black sites to the different outlets in order to ensure that the higher salinity was considered at each outlet the water columns at the red and blue sites are more affected by discharge from the humen and jiaomen outlets respectively due to the topography and flow direction the flow direction is consistent with the shoreline strike in the pre cai et al 2013 therefore the red and blue sites were classified as the humen and jiaomen outlets respectively while the black site was classified as hongqimen outlet the total monitoring period was 195 days and nights table s1 nine water quality indicators namely water temperature temp c ph

daily dissolved oxygen flux mg o2 l 1d 1 caused by biological processes in aquatic ecosystems nep estimates the change in dissolved oxygen do concentration resulting from biological processes over a period of 24 h caffrey 2003 marcarelli et al 2010 shen et al 2015 1 n e p d t c t c t 1 d t z k d where t s is time and dt is the time interval between measurements ct mg l 1 is the concentration of

oxygen deficit d 1 st st 1 200 which represents the difference between measured oxygen concentration and the concentration at which water is fully saturated with oxygen st is the do saturation measured at time t k was determined based on wind velocity as proposed by d avanzo et al 1996 k 0 56 e 0 15 x where x m s 1 is the wind velocity 10 m above the water surface the 15 min wind and water temperature diffusion corrected rates of do change were then summed over a 24 h period to calculate daily nep g o2 m 2d 1 or mg o2 l 1d 1 we present a positive er value the nep that occurs at night was multiplied by 1 to give a night respiration rate ern where solar radiation at night was defined as 0 w m 2 ern divided by hours of night hn equals the hourly respiration rate erh g o2 m 2h 1 and er g o2 m 2d 1 equals the hourly respiration rate multiplied by 24 2 e r e r h 24 e r n h n 24 this assumes the hourly respiration rate is the same during the day and night an uncertain claim that is nonetheless consistent with most standard methods marcarelli et al 2010 finally gpp nep er there are three major hypotheses based on the odum s open water method one hypothesis is that the water column was well mixed at the monitoring site and the sensors could detect changes in do throughout the ecosystem the second is that the diurnal variation of do is mainly due to biological metabolism in open water with little interference from other physical and chemical processes if the impact of physical and chemical processes on do diurnal variation is much larger than that of biological processes gpp or er values can be negative using this method and it will be regarded as an invalid value caffrey 2003 shen et al 2015 the third hypothesis is that the water flowing through the probe is homogeneous if the diurnal time series of do significantly correlates with the tidal height in the estuary this suggests that the periodic tide heterogeneous water can impact do diurnal variation monitoring data on these days tidal water bodies have different metabolic histories to that of the monitoring water column beck et al 2015 thus we excluded metabolism estimate outliers during the aforementioned three situations 2 3 statistical analysis the aquatic metabolism rate was determined by combining all samples obtained from 2018 to 2020 and aggregating the calculated fluxes according to the sampling month and season repeated measures analysis of variance at a confidence level of 0 05 was applied to test the differences in environmental factors and metabolism among different seasons and outlets using spss 22 0 and r 4 0 4 to explain the variation in metabolism associations among metabolic and environmental parameters were evaluated using pearson correlation analysis in spss 22 0 and principal component analysis pca for environmental factors and redundancy analysis rda using canoco 5 terbraak and smilauer 2012 statistical hypotheses of data were tested such as normal distribution homogeneity of variance and spherical hypothesis we treated the data without serious deviation from the normal distribution as a normal distribution 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial differences of environmental conditions rainfall frequently occurred from april to october 2019 the maximum daily cumulative rainfall was 94 4 mm data was recorded every 15 min on july 4 2019 from december 2018 to february 2020 in the pre fig 2 the mean daily discharge was 9319 7164 m3 s 1 it ranged from 213 to 40 380 m3s 1 the sum of gaoyao shijiao and boluo hydrologic stations and was almost synchronised with the rainfall the maximum and minimum daily discharge values occurred on june 14 2019 and october 27 2019 respectively seasonal variations in 16 water environmental factors and 7 meteorological factors were compared at all sites there were significant differences in the aquatic and meteorological factors except turbidity ph tn and no3 n table 2 the daily discharge varied from 45 08 to 8452 5 m3 s 1 and the seasonal variation was summer spring winter and autumn water temperature varied from 17 09 to 32 58 c at 13 sites and the order of seasonal variation was summer and autumn spring winter the orp was the highest in spring salinity ranged from 0 07 to 25 89 and the order of seasonal variation was winter autumn spring and summer turbidity varied from 1 8 to 763 ntu although there was no significant difference in turbidity the mean of turbidity peaked in summer do ranged from 2 28 to 10 18 mg l 1 do and do saturation peaked in winter and reached a minimum in autumn the chla concentration ranged from 0 07 to 54 81 mg l 1 and the order of seasonal variation was spring autumn summer and winter the order of seasonal variation of tds was winter autumn spring summer the order of seasonal variation of barometric pressure was winter autumn spring summer solar radiation peaked in summer and was the lowest in winter during the monitoring period rainfall occurred on 49 d during the study period mostly in summer relative humidity and wind speed were highest in spring and summer the dip varied from 0 to 0 32 mg l 1 and was highest in spring tc was highest in autumn and winter toc was highest in autumn and lowest in winter dic was highest in winter and lowest in spring variations in 16 water environmental factors were compared at humen jiaomen and hongqimen during the monitoring period eleven factors differed significantly except water temperature orp dip toc and no3 n table 3 the discharge at humen was significantly higher than that at jiaomen and hongqimen the salinity at humen and jiaomen was significantly higher than that at hongqimen turbidity at humen and hongqimen was significantly higher than that at jiaomen the ph 7 53 0 24 do 5 2 1 02 mg l 1 and its saturation chla concentration 5 07 3 18 μg l 1 tds 1 82 2 99 and tn 1 74 0 52 mg l 1 at humen were all significantly lower than at jiaomen and hongqimen table 3 in addition the tc 25 52 5 21 mg l 1 and dic concentrations 19 62 5 37 mg l 1 at humen and hongqimen were lower than those at jiaomen because the monitoring period was not always synchronised between the outlets the differences in meteorological conditions were also compared the results showed that meteorological conditions were similar table s2 the axes 1 and 2 explanatory variables of the pca accounted for 99 58 of all 17 and 23 environmental variables in the pre fig 3a and b the latter included the dip tc toc dic tn and n no3 the results showed that the high discharge positively correlated with high temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed turbidity and heavy rainfall furthermore high discharge is accompanied by lower chla ph do salinity tds and lower barometric pressure no significant correlation was found among discharge and dip tc toc dic tn and n no3 during the monitoring period 3 2 seasonal and spatial variations in aquatic nep we excluded 40 anomalies among the 195 groups of metabolism estimates at 13 sites including 33 groups negative gpp or er values and seven outlier values affected by tides fig s1 one group of metabolism values included one gpp er and nep value the highest probability of anomalies up to 40 was at humen 27 groups with negative gpp values and one group with a negative er value were excluded among the 82 groups at humen in addition seven groups outliers gpp 10 or er 10 were excluded at humen due to significantly positive correlation between the diurnal time series of do and tide height on these days only one group with a negative er value was excluded among the 60 groups at jiaomen five groups with negative gpp values were excluded among the 53 groups at hongqimen therefore 155 groups of valid metabolism estimates were included in the following analysis overall nep data followed a normal distribution p 0 05 for nonparametric tests gpp and er data did not follow a strictly normal distribution gpp data skewness 1 02 kurtosis 0 66 and er data skewness 0 29 kurtosis 0 60 p 0 05 for nonparametric tests daily er rate exceeded gpp rate resulting in negative mean nep among the 155 groups for metabolism estimates the mean nep value was 2 86 1 69 mg o2 l 1d 1 ranging from 6 63 mg o2 l 1 d 1 to 1 65 mg o2 l 1 d 1 the median range and mean gpp were 1 06 mg o2 l 1 d 1 0 07 4 48 mg o2 l 1 d 1 and 1 28 mg o2 l 1 d 1 respectively the median range and mean er were 4 03 mg o2 l 1 d 1 0 09 9 96 mg o2 l 1 d 1 and 4 14 mg o2 l 1 d 1 respectively table 4 the gpp at humen 1 04 0 98 mg o2 l 1d 1 was lower than that at jiaomen 1 54 0 94 mg o2 l 1d 1 and similar to that at hongqimen 1 20 0 93 mg o2 l 1d 1 p 0 017 the er rate at humen 5 38 1 76 mg o2 l 1d 1 was significantly higher than those at jiaomen 3 47 1 09 mg o2 l 1d 1 and hongqimen 3 71 1 60 mg o2 l 1d 1 p 0 001 therefore the lowest nep was observed at humen 4 34 1 40 mg o2 l 1d 1 p 0 001 gpp showed no significant seasonal difference er in summer 4 30 1 35 mg o2 l 1d 1 and autumn 4 65 1 48 mg o2 l 1d 1 was significantly higher than that in winter 3 11 1 36 mg o2 l 1d 1 and spring 2 94 2 33 mg o2 l 1d 1 table 4 fig 4 p 0 001 this led to lower nep in summer 3 30 1 39 mg o2 l 1d 1 and autumn 3 19 1 60 mg o2 l 1d 1 than that in spring 1 56 1 92 mg o2 l 1d 1 and winter 2 17 1 50 mg o2 l 1d 1 in addition we compared the seasonal and spatial variations in 151 groups of aquatic metabolism values after discarding the four valid values at three seaward sites two at the red site one at the black site and one at the blue site because the water column at these three sites could be jointly affected by the multiple outlets the results showed that the spatiotemporal variations in 151 groups of metabolism measurements were nearly the same as that under the former situation table s3 the spatiotemporal variations in metabolism were not affected by the inclusion of sites as there were fewer sampling days at these three sites aquatic metabolism exhibited seasonal differences at each outlet fig 6 table 5 the gpp was highest in spring 3 11 0 61 mg o2 l 1d 1 and the er was lowest in winter 3 25 1 43 mg o2 l 1d 1 at humen this led to lower nep in the summer 4 81 0 8 mg o2 l 1d 1 and autumn 4 88 1 13 mg o2 l 1d 1 than those in the spring 3 93 0 96 mg o2 l 1d 1 and winter 2 85 1 45 mg o2 l 1d 1 at humen fig 5a the gpp exhibited no significant seasonal differences at jiaomen the er was higher in the summer and autumn than those in the spring and winter with the highest occurring in the autumn 4 01 0 76 mg o2 l 1d 1 and lowest occurring in the winter 2 51 0 87 mg o2 l 1d 1 this led to the highest nep occurring in the spring 1 18 2 04 mg o2 l 1d 1 and lowest occurring in the summer 2 31 0 83 mg o2 l 1d 1 at jiaomen fig 5b the gpp was lowest in the spring 0 66 0 49 mg o2 l 1d 1 and highest in the winter 2 0 86 mg o2 l 1d 1 at hongqimen the er was also lowest in the spring 1 67 1 23 mg o2 l 1d 1 and highest in the winter 4 82 1 35 mg o2 l 1d 1 while the nep was highest in the spring 1 02 1 56 mg o2 l 1d 1 fig 5c 3 3 driving factors analysis of aquatic metabolism significant positive correlation between gpp and er suggests that gpp is synchronised

organic matter into inorganic nutrients and co2 they exhibit co2 oversaturation with respect to the atmosphere cloern et al 2014 sarma et al 2012 total estimates of co2 emissions from global estuaries are 0 34 gt c yr 1 borges et al 2005 0 27 0 23 gt c yr 1 laruelle et al 2010 0 25 0 25 gt c yr 1 cai 2011 to 0 10 gt c yr 1 chen et al 2013 overall the three outlets of the pre are like most estuaries dominated by net heterotrophy nep 2 86 1 69 mg o2 l 1d 1 and biological metabolism processes were the source of atmospheric co2 the inhibitory effect of high discharge on nep exceeded the stimulation effect of water temperature solar radiation nutrients and other factors at each outlet although high discharge was accompanied by high temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed in the pre it caused high turbidity and diluted chla concentration which led to low ph do salinity and tds high temperature and solar radiation can stimulate the gpp and er rate caffrey et al 2014 however a large influx of freshwater and heavy rainfall reduced water retention time and more phytoplankton was washed away from estuaries reducing the gpp of the diluted water areas simultaneously high discharge can change the underwater light climate such as the presence of light attenuating organic and inorganic matter affecting the aquatic productivity frenette et al 2006 strong mixing leads to a higher turbidity in the diluted water area and lower light transmittance in the water further limiting the gpp in low salt areas causing areas with higher salinity to have high productivity this partly explains the low gpp median gpp 1 06 mg o2 l 1 d 1 in the pre and why it did not increase significantly in the summer and autumn fig 4b gpp can be limited by low temperature and solar radiation in the spring as well as frequent rainfall and winter as well as low chla concentrations 4 36 2 8 μg l 1 by high turbidity and low chla concentration in plumes with high freshwater inflow in the summer and by low solar radiation and chla concentration in the autumn table 6 gpp was also low due to short freshwater retention time 3 5 d and insufficient illumination in the congo estuary eisma et al 1978 meanwhile it has a long freshwater retention time 20 80 d and sufficient illumination in the amazon estuary which provides conditions for high productivity guo et al 2009 hellweger and gordon 2002 the region with salinity 25 has low light transmittance tss 40 mg l 1 and high productivity occurs in the region with salinity 25 in the yangtze estuary guo et al 2009 furthermore the er rates in the summer and autumn were significantly higher than those in the winter and spring fig 4b er is largely attributed to microbial activity thus it was influenced by seasonal temperature and organic matter supply and quality patterns caffrey et al 2014 er was stimulated by high tss organic matter and heterophytic microorganisms with influx and a strong mixing of freshwater in summer and autumn in the pre time series observations from indian estuaries also identified high bacterial respiration due to high quantities of organic matter associated with high monsoonal river discharges sarma et al 2012 therefore low gpp and high er led to lower nep in the summer and autumn than those in the spring and winter the inhibitory effect of high discharge on nep can decrease do concentration at the three outlets in the summer and autumn in the pre table 2 this also suggests that it may be inappropriate to lengthen the discharge pulse period in the summer and autumn to prevent nep reduction and increases in the hypoxia and acidification area at each outlet of the pre in addition gpp can also be limited by high turbidity 55 62 49 14 ntu and low chla 5 66 4 02 μg l 1 and tn concentrations 1 74 0 52 mg l 1 due to dilution and scour with high freshwater inflow at humen table 6 the er at humen was higher than those at jiaomen and hongqimen which also may be reduced by high total suspended solids organic matter and heterophytic microorganisms the low gpp and high er also led to the lowest nep occurring at humen with the lowest ph do and tds fig 4a hypoxia and low ph are well known in the pre cui et al 2019 however it was previously believed that the hypoxia was caused by chemical factors such as eutrophication driven hypoxia yu and gan 2021 this study confirmed that the impact of increased discharge on low nep hypoxia and acidification in the pre cannot be ignored 4 2 methodological implications for estimates of aquatic metabolism in estuaries measurements of gpp er and nep provide fundamental information about the trophic status of aquatic ecosystems and can be used to assess estuarine health and the impact of human activities on estuarine ecosystems we utilised substantial amounts of manpower and resources to understand the spatiotemporal variations of metabolism in different regions of the estuary through field monitoring cloern et al 2014 shen et al 2020 staehr et al 2012 2018 however such monitoring and assessment are logistically difficult and expensive to sustain as part of long term monitoring programmes due to the high spatiotemporal variability of estuarine environments murrell et al 2018 despite many decades of research aimed at quantifying coastal ecosystem primary productivity there is no consensus on best practices making global assessments challenging cloern et al 2014 in situ datasondes are an attractive option for routine monitoring and assessing ecosystem metabolism because they are generally less labor intensive and require less expertise than water column or benthic incubation methods high frequency do data have been widely used for estimating ecosystem metabolism in a variety of freshwater estuarine and marine systems but it is important to evaluate the underlying assumptions and limitations of the method caffrey et al 2014 we evaluated the applicability of odum s open water method to the three outlets one of the most important assumptions is that the water mass being monitored is relatively homogenous and well mixed essentially having common metabolic history the highest probability of outliers was up to 40 at humen which may be mostly attributed to violation of a key assumption of the open water method homogeneity of water bodies heterogeneous water bodies appeared at specific times because of tide advection or mixing and led to estimation errors in aquatic metabolism we discarded the outlier metabolism values although one possibility that is not often considered is that anomalous values may simply reflect periods of low metabolism with values below the effective method detection limit and discarding such values would upwardly bias the estimates of metabolism caffrey et al 2014 it is difficult to determine the effect of discarded values on metabolic estimates at humen beck et al 2015 attempted to improve estimates of ecosystem metabolism by reducing the effects of tidal advection on do time series however their method was less robust when tides and the solar cycle were correlated for protracted periods therefore we suggest that key controlling factors should be screened and a model that describes the key eco hydrological processes in estuaries by considering the responses of complex water ecological processes to influencing factors should be established to analyse the spatiotemporal variation of estuarine metabolism 5 conclusions we explored the spatiotemporal variability of the aquatic environment and nep at three outlets humen jiaomen and hongqimen with different hydrological conditions in the pearl river estuary pre china through in situ monitoring and odum s open water method from december 2018 to january 2020 and explored the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on nep similar to most estuaries the three outlets of the pre are dominated by net heterotrophy and biological metabolism processes are the source of atmospheric co2 the daily nep o2 concentration and ph were the lowest at humen which also had the largest discharge and tide volume deepest water depth and widest channel seasonally the nep in the summer and autumn was lower than those in the spring and winter the spatiotemporal variations in metabolism and the influence mechanism of hydrological variation indicated that the high discharge pulse intensified low nep hypoxia and acidification at the three outlets our research provides new knowledge for improving estuarine ecosystem functioning from the perspective of discharge regulation and management additionally the high metabolic outliers at humen suggest that other models will be required to estimate metabolism in complex estuaries that are severely tidally affected declaration of competing

16215,clarifying the influence of hydrological variations on ecological function is a topic of considerable interest in watershed ecological flow assessment and water resource management net ecosystem productivity nep is a useful composite indicator of ecosystem function reflecting material cycling and energy flow however the effects of hydrological variations on nep especially the influence mechanism remain unclear due to the complex environmental characteristics in estuaries we analysed the spatial temporal variability of the aquatic environment and nep through in situ monitoring and field sampling from december 2018 to january 2020 at three outlets humen jiaomen and hongqimen with different hydrological conditions in the pearl river estuary pre china and explored the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on nep the 155 groups of effective metabolism values were estimated using odum s open water method the daily ecosystem respiration er was higher than the gross primary production gpp therefore water bodies were dominated by net heterotrophy at the three outlets the daily nep 4 34 1 40 mg o2 l 1d 1 o2 concentration 5 2 1 02 mg l 1 and ph 7 53 0 24 were lowest at humen which also had the largest discharge and tide volume deepest water depth and widest channel seasonally the nep in the summer 3 30 1 39 mg o2 l 1d 1 and autumn 3 19 1 60 mg o2 l 1d 1 was lower than those in the spring 1 56 1 92 mg o2 l 1d 1 and winter 2 17 1 50 mg o2 l 1d 1 the inhibitory effect of increased discharge on the metabolic rate exceeded the stimulation provided by seasonal factors such as increased temperature and solar radiation the scour and dilution effect caused by discharge increase reduced chlorophyll a concentration meanwhile the increase in turbidity resulted in a decrease in the photosynthetic rate and gpp er was stimulated by heterotrophic microorganisms and high total suspended solids resulting in a decrease in o2 and endogenous organics thus causing the low nep hypoxia and acidification phenomenon our results suggest that lengthening the discharge pulse period in summer and autumn will further decrease nep and increase the area of hypoxia and

mixing nutrient and organic matter enrichment and the provision of important ecological service functions he and silliman 2019 however estuarine ecosystems are typically fragile increasing human activities have greatly changed the hydrological regime adams 2014 sun et al 2015 hydrological variations such as hydrological pulse time and runoff intensity will impact fresh salt water exchange habitat availability and connectivity thus affecting species distribution changing the structure and function of estuarine ecosystems and ultimately affecting the balance and overall health of estuarine ecosystems singh et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 thus clarifying the effects of hydrological variations on ecological function and the influence mechanism except structural indicators is significant in watershed ecological flow assessment and water resource management adams 2014 net ecosystem productivity nep analogous to net ecosystem metabolism nem is the difference between gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration er nep gpp er it is an important functional indicator reflecting the ecological service functions of water purification productivity supply and carbon sources sinks when nep 0 ecosystems are dominated by autotrophic processes that consume nutrients release o2 and assimilate co2 therefore the system becomes an atmospheric carbon sink and the ph of the water body improves in addition phytoplankton synthesise their own biomass and absorb toxic and harmful substances thus purifying the water as a food supply phytoplankton biomass can increase the yield of copepods bivalve molluscs and other organisms and become the basic food resource for higher trophic level organisms including humans when synthesised organic matter sinks it stimulates the respiration of underlying organisms and resynthesis of nutrients cloern et al 2014 herfort et al 2012 by contrast when nep 0 the ecosystems are dominated by heterotrophic processes and the organic matter decomposition rate exceeds the ecosystem production rate if oxygen consumption is continuously greater than oxygen production dissolved oxygen do concentration can decrease and hypoxia can occur the ecosystem changes from an atmospheric carbon sink to a carbon source and the water body will acidate additionally the biomass of phytoplankton synthesis decreases and the quantity and structure of the biological population and estuarine food network change thus affecting offshore fishery resources caffrey et al 2014 stumpner et al 2020 therefore clarifying the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on nep can help to determine ways to regulate the hydrological regime and thus improve estuarine ecosystem function the influence of river discharge on metabolic rates has been studied many times at single locations in estuaries using odum s open water method and short or long term dissolved o2 time series beck et al 2015 murrell et al 2018 sarma et al 2009 however the differences in the geographic geologic and climate signatures between the estuaries limit the representative capability of single site nep calculations caffrey et al 2014 russell et al 2006 nep varies over time and within a bay dominated by a river at one end and ocean exchange at the other end few studies focus on statistical analysis using multi point monitoring at different outlets in the same estuary in addition our understanding of the metabolic balance in estuarine ecosystems is still poor cloern et al 2014 reviewed 1148 values of phytoplankton primary production in global estuarine coastal ecosystems and showed that the data are mainly concentrated in northern europe and north america less data are available for other parts of the world some attempts to understand seasonal and spatial variations in metabolic rates in estuaries were largely in temperate regions kemp et al 1997 caffrey 2003 cloern et al 2014 shen et al 2020 and few results have been obtained from subtropical and tropical estuaries we analysed the spatial temporal variability of the aquatic environment and nep through in situ monitoring and field sampling from december 2018 to january 2020 and explored the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on nep at three outlets with different hydrological characteristics in the subtropical pearl river estuary pre china different discharge conditions can provide a more reliable basis for exploring the influence mechanism of discharge changes on nep we also evaluated the applicability of odum s open water dissolved oxygen method commonly used to estimate aquatic metabolism in estuaries to the three outlets 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design the pre is located in a subtropical climate zone in southern central guangdong province china 21 5 23 5 n 113 0 114 5 e it is situated in the core area of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba one of the most densely populated regions in the world it has a complicated water system fig 1 the pearl river is the second largest river in china in terms of freshwater discharge with an annual discharge of 3 5 1011 m3 80 of which occurs in the wet season from april to october driven by the asian monsoon the pearl river has three main tributaries the west xijiang north beijiang and east dongjiang rivers as well as several small local rivers in the delta runoff from these tributaries discharges into the south china sea via eight major outlets humen jiaomen hongqimen hengmen modaomen jitimen hutiaomen and yamen through three subestuaries lingdingyang modaomen and huangmaohai several metropolises including shenzhen and hong kong are located on lingdingyang s east coast zhuhai and macao are located on the west coast and guangzhou is located on the north coast we collected the daily discharge data at three hydrological stations in the lower reaches of the pearl river that are closest to the estuary gaoyao shijiao and boluo hydrological stations of xijiang beijiang and dongjiang rivers respectively the total discharge m3 s 1 from the pre to the south china sea is the sum of the three hydrological stations the daily discharge data were obtained from the website of the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn hourly tidal height data at nansha shuiniutou station were downloaded from the maritime service network water sampling and in situ monitoring were conducted at humen south branch of jiaomen hereinafter referred to as jiaomen and hongqimen at the three eastern outlets of the pre fig 1 the hydrological characteristics differ considerably among the three outlets the channel of humen outlet is wider and deeper than that of the jiaomen and hongqimen outlets according to historical statistical data from the pearl river water resource commission of the ministry of water resource the daily discharge at humen jiaomen and hongqimen accounted for 24 5 16 8 and 7 2 of the total discharge into the sea respectively table 1 the order of sediment concentration at these three outlets is hongqimen jiaomen humen while the order of tidal volume and range is humen jiaomen humen the flood tidal volumes of humen jiaomen and hongqimen are 2133 108 308 108 and 95 108 m3 respectively the ratios of discharge to tide of humen jiaomen and hongqimen are 0 38 1 79 and 2 51 respectively thirteen sites 4 5 at each outlet were chosen for in situ monitoring fig 1 each site was located at approximately one sixth of the bank of the wide channel with fewer vessels passing through to avoid human disturbance water depth ranged from 3 5 9 0 m at these sites the water quality sensor was fixed and suspended at a depth of x223c0 8 1 0 m water sampling and in situ monitoring were conducted in december 2018 and from march 2019 to january 2020 considering the safety of equipment and personnel only the first monitoring was performed in december 2018 at four sites fig 1 due to the relative difficulty in equipment placement and fixation we included the metabolism data at these sites in following analysis as they can partly reflect the environmental variation at higher salinity the three most seaward sites indicated by red blue and black symbols are jointly affected by multiple outlets we assigned the red blue and black sites to the different outlets in order to ensure that the higher salinity was considered at each outlet the water columns at the red and blue sites are more affected by discharge from the humen and jiaomen outlets respectively due to the topography and flow direction the flow direction is consistent with the shoreline strike in the pre cai et al 2013 therefore the red and blue sites were classified as the humen and jiaomen outlets respectively while the black site was classified as hongqimen outlet the total monitoring period was 195 days and nights table s1 nine water quality indicators namely water temperature temp c ph

daily dissolved oxygen flux mg o2 l 1d 1 caused by biological processes in aquatic ecosystems nep estimates the change in dissolved oxygen do concentration resulting from biological processes over a

oxygen deficit d 1 st st 1 200 which represents the difference between measured oxygen concentration and the concentration at which water is fully saturated with oxygen st is the do saturation measured at time t k was determined based on wind velocity as proposed by d avanzo et al 1996 k 0 56 e 0 15 x where x m s 1 is the wind velocity 10 m above the water surface the 15 min wind and water temperature diffusion corrected rates of do change were then summed over a 24 h period to calculate daily nep g o2 m 2d 1 or mg o2 l 1d 1 we present a positive er value the nep that occurs at night was multiplied by 1 to give a night respiration rate ern where solar radiation at night was defined as 0 w m 2 ern divided by hours of night hn equals the hourly respiration rate erh g o2 m 2h 1 and er g o2 m 2d 1 equals the hourly respiration rate multiplied by 24 2 e r e r h 24 e r n h n 24 this assumes the hourly respiration rate is the same during the day and night an uncertain claim that is nonetheless consistent with most standard methods marcarelli et al 2010 finally gpp nep er there are three major hypotheses based on the odum s open water method one hypothesis is that the water column was well mixed at the monitoring site and the sensors could detect changes in do throughout the ecosystem the second is that the diurnal variation of do is mainly due to biological metabolism in open water with little interference from other physical and chemical processes if the impact of physical and chemical processes on do diurnal variation is much larger than that of biological processes gpp or er values can be negative using this method and it will be regarded as an invalid value caffrey 2003 shen et al 2015 the third hypothesis is that the water flowing through the probe is homogeneous if the diurnal time series of do significantly correlates with the tidal height in the estuary this suggests that the periodic tide heterogeneous water can impact do diurnal variation monitoring data on these days tidal water bodies have different metabolic histories to that of the monitoring water column beck et al 2015 thus we excluded metabolism estimate outliers during the aforementioned three situations 2 3 statistical analysis the aquatic metabolism rate was determined by combining all samples obtained from 2018 to 2020 and aggregating the calculated fluxes according to the sampling month and season repeated measures analysis of variance at a confidence level of 0 05 was applied to test the differences in environmental factors and metabolism among different seasons and outlets using spss 22 0 and r 4 0 4 to explain the variation in metabolism associations among metabolic and environmental parameters were evaluated using pearson correlation analysis in spss 22 0 and principal component analysis pca for environmental factors and redundancy analysis rda using canoco 5 terbraak and smilauer 2012 statistical hypotheses of data were tested such as normal distribution homogeneity of variance and spherical hypothesis we treated the data without serious deviation from the normal distribution as a normal distribution 3 results 3 1 seasonal and spatial differences of environmental conditions rainfall frequently occurred from april to october 2019 the maximum daily cumulative rainfall was 94 4 mm data was recorded every 15 min on july 4 2019 from december 2018 to february 2020 in the pre fig 2 the mean daily discharge was 9319 7164 m3 s 1 it ranged from 213 to 40 380 m3s 1 the sum of gaoyao shijiao and boluo hydrologic stations and was almost synchronised with the rainfall the maximum and minimum daily discharge values occurred on june 14 2019 and october 27 2019 respectively seasonal variations in 16 water environmental factors and 7 meteorological factors were compared at all sites there were significant differences in the aquatic and meteorological factors except turbidity ph tn and no3 n table 2 the daily discharge varied from 45 08 to 8452 5 m3 s 1 and the seasonal variation was summer spring winter and autumn water temperature varied from 17 09 to 32 58 c at 13 sites and the order of seasonal variation was summer and autumn spring winter the orp was the highest in spring salinity ranged from 0 07 to 25 89 and the order of seasonal variation was winter autumn spring and summer turbidity varied from 1 8 to 763 ntu although there was no significant difference in turbidity the mean of turbidity peaked in summer do ranged from 2 28 to 10 18 mg l 1 do and do saturation peaked in winter and reached a minimum in autumn the chla concentration ranged from 0 07 to 54 81 mg l 1 and the order of seasonal variation was spring autumn summer and winter the order of seasonal variation of tds was winter autumn spring summer the order of seasonal variation of barometric pressure was winter autumn spring summer solar radiation peaked in summer and was the lowest in winter during the monitoring period rainfall occurred on 49 d during the study period mostly in summer relative humidity and wind speed were highest in spring and summer the dip varied from 0 to 0 32 mg l 1 and was highest in spring tc was highest in autumn and winter toc was highest in autumn and lowest in winter dic was highest in winter and lowest in spring variations in 16 water environmental factors were compared at humen jiaomen and hongqimen during the monitoring period eleven factors differed significantly except water temperature orp dip toc and no3 n table 3 the discharge at humen was significantly higher than that at jiaomen and hongqimen the salinity at humen and jiaomen was significantly higher than that at hongqimen turbidity at humen and hongqimen was significantly higher than that at jiaomen the ph 7 53 0 24 do 5 2 1 02 mg l 1 and its saturation chla concentration 5 07 3 18 μg l 1 tds 1 82 2 99 and tn 1 74 0 52 mg l 1 at humen were all significantly lower than at jiaomen and hongqimen table 3 in addition the tc 25 52 5 21 mg l 1 and dic concentrations 19 62 5 37 mg l 1 at humen and hongqimen were lower than those at jiaomen because the monitoring period was not always synchronised between the outlets the differences in meteorological conditions were also compared the results showed that meteorological conditions were similar table s2 the axes 1 and 2 explanatory variables of the pca accounted for 99 58 of all 17 and 23 environmental variables in the pre fig 3a and b the latter included the dip tc toc dic tn and n no3 the results showed that the high discharge positively correlated with high temperature solar radiation relative humidity wind speed turbidity and heavy rainfall furthermore high discharge is accompanied by lower chla ph do salinity tds and lower barometric pressure no significant correlation was found among discharge and dip tc toc dic tn and n no3 during the monitoring period 3 2 seasonal and spatial variations in aquatic nep we excluded 40 anomalies among the 195 groups of metabolism estimates at 13 sites including 33 groups negative gpp or er values and seven outlier values affected by tides fig s1 one group of metabolism values included one gpp er and nep value the highest probability of anomalies up to 40 was at humen 27 groups with negative gpp values and one group with a negative er value were excluded among the 82 groups at humen in addition seven groups outliers gpp 10 or er 10 were excluded at humen due to significantly positive correlation between the diurnal time series of do and tide height on these days only one group with a negative er value was excluded among the 60 groups at jiaomen five groups with negative gpp values were excluded among the 53 groups at hongqimen therefore 155 groups of valid metabolism estimates were included in the following analysis overall nep data followed a normal distribution p 0 05 for nonparametric tests gpp and er data did not follow a strictly normal distribution gpp data skewness 1 02 kurtosis 0 66 and er data skewness 0 29 kurtosis 0 60 p 0 05 for nonparametric tests daily er rate exceeded gpp rate resulting in negative mean nep among the 155 groups for metabolism estimates the mean nep value was 2 86 1 69 mg o2 l 1d 1 ranging from 6 63 mg o2 l 1 d 1 to 1 65 mg o2 l 1 d 1 the median range and mean gpp were 1 06 mg o2 l 1 d 1 0 07 4 48 mg o2 l 1 d 1 and 1 28 mg o2 l 1 d 1 respectively the median range and mean er were 4 03 mg o2 l 1 d 1 0 09 9 96 mg o2 l 1 d 1 and 4 14 mg o2 l 1 d 1 respectively table 4 the gpp at humen 1 04 0 98 mg o2 l 1d 1 was lower than that at jiaomen 1 54 0 94 mg o2 l 1d 1 and similar to that at hongqimen 1 20 0 93 mg o2 l 1d 1 p 0 017 the er rate at humen 5 38 1 76 mg o2 l 1d 1 was significantly higher than those at jiaomen 3 47 1 09 mg o2 l 1d 1 and hongqimen 3 71 1 60 mg o2 l 1d 1 p 0 001 therefore the lowest nep was observed at humen 4 34 1 40 mg o2 l 1d 1 p 0 001 gpp showed no significant seasonal difference er in summer 4 30 1 35 mg o2 l 1d 1 and autumn 4 65 1 48 mg o2 l 1d 1 was significantly higher than that in winter 3 11 1 36 mg o2 l 1d 1 and spring 2 94 2 33 mg o2 l 1d 1 table 4 fig 4 p 0 001 this led to lower nep in summer 3 30 1 39 mg o2 l 1d 1 and autumn 3 19 1 60 mg o2 l 1d 1 than that in spring 1 56 1 92 mg o2 l 1d 1 and winter 2 17 1 50 mg o2 l 1d 1 in addition we compared the seasonal and spatial variations in 151 groups of aquatic metabolism values after discarding the four valid values at three seaward sites two at the red site one at the black site and one at the blue site because the water column at these three sites could be jointly affected by the multiple outlets the results showed that the spatiotemporal variations in 151 groups of metabolism measurements were nearly the same as that under the former situation table s3 the spatiotemporal variations in metabolism were not affected by the inclusion of sites as there were fewer sampling days at these three sites aquatic metabolism exhibited seasonal differences at each outlet fig 6 table 5 the gpp was highest in spring 3 11 0 61 mg o2 l 1d 1 and the er was lowest in winter 3 25 1 43 mg o2 l 1d 1 at humen this led to lower nep in the summer 4 81 0 8 mg o2 l 1d 1 and autumn 4 88 1 13 mg o2 l 1d 1 than those in the spring 3 93 0 96 mg o2 l 1d 1 and winter 2 85 1 45 mg o2 l 1d 1 at humen fig 5a the gpp exhibited no significant seasonal differences at jiaomen the er was higher in the summer and autumn than those in the spring and winter with the highest occurring in the autumn 4 01 0 76 mg o2 l 1d 1 and lowest occurring in the winter 2 51 0 87 mg o2 l 1d 1 this led to the highest nep occurring in the spring 1 18 2 04 mg o2 l 1d 1 and lowest occurring in the summer 2 31 0 83 mg o2 l 1d 1 at jiaomen fig 5b the gpp was lowest in the spring 0 66 0 49 mg o2 l 1d 1 and highest in the winter 2 0 86 mg o2 l 1d 1 at hongqimen the er was also lowest in the spring 1 67 1 23 mg o2 l 1d 1 and highest in the winter 4 82 1 35 mg o2 l 1d 1 while the nep was highest in the spring 1 02 1 56 mg o2 l 1d 1 fig 5c 3 3 driving factors analysis of aquatic metabolism significant positive correlation between gpp and er suggests that gpp is synchronised

organic matter into inorganic nutrients and co2 they exhibit co2 oversaturation with respect to the atmosphere cloern et al 2014 sarma et al 2012 total estimates of co2 emissions from global estuaries are 0 34 gt c yr 1 borges et al 2005 0 27 0 23 gt c yr 1 laruelle et al 2010 0 25 0 25 gt c yr 1 cai 2011 to 0 10 gt c yr 1 chen et al 2013 overall the three outlets of the pre are like most estuaries dominated by net heterotrophy nep 2 86 1 69 mg o2 l 1d 1 and biological metabolism processes were the source of atmospheric co2 the inhibitory effect of high discharge on nep exceeded the stimulation effect of water temperature solar radiation nutrients and other factors at each outlet although high discharge was accompanied by high temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed in the pre it caused high turbidity and diluted chla concentration which led to low ph do salinity and tds high temperature and solar radiation can stimulate the gpp and er rate caffrey et al 2014 however a large influx of freshwater and heavy rainfall reduced water retention time and more phytoplankton was washed away from estuaries reducing the gpp of the diluted water areas simultaneously high discharge can change the underwater light climate such as the presence of light attenuating organic and inorganic matter affecting the aquatic productivity frenette et al 2006 strong mixing leads to a higher turbidity in the diluted water area and lower light transmittance in the water further limiting the gpp in low salt areas causing areas with higher salinity to have high productivity this partly explains the low gpp median gpp 1 06 mg o2 l 1 d 1 in the pre and why it did not increase significantly in the summer and autumn fig 4b gpp can be limited by low temperature and solar radiation in the spring as well as frequent rainfall and winter as well as low chla concentrations 4 36 2 8 μg l 1 by high turbidity and low chla concentration in plumes with high freshwater inflow in the summer and by low solar radiation and chla concentration in the autumn table 6 gpp was also low due to short freshwater retention time 3 5 d and insufficient illumination in the congo estuary eisma et al 1978 meanwhile it has a long freshwater retention time 20 80 d and sufficient illumination in the amazon estuary which provides conditions for high productivity guo et al 2009 hellweger and gordon 2002 the region with salinity 25 has low light transmittance tss 40 mg l 1 and high productivity occurs in the region with salinity 25 in the yangtze estuary guo et al 2009 furthermore the er rates in the summer and autumn were significantly higher than those in the winter and spring fig 4b er is largely attributed to microbial activity thus it was influenced by seasonal temperature and organic matter supply and quality patterns caffrey et al 2014 er was stimulated by high tss organic matter and heterophytic microorganisms with influx and a strong mixing of freshwater in summer and autumn in the pre time series observations from indian estuaries also identified high bacterial respiration due to high quantities of organic matter associated with high monsoonal river discharges sarma et al 2012 therefore low gpp and high er led to lower nep in the summer and autumn than those in the spring and winter the inhibitory effect of high discharge on nep can decrease do concentration at the three outlets in the summer and autumn in the pre table 2 this also suggests that it may be inappropriate to lengthen the discharge pulse period in the summer and autumn to prevent nep reduction and increases in the hypoxia and acidification area at each outlet of the pre in addition gpp can also be limited by high turbidity 55 62 49 14 ntu and low chla 5 66 4 02 μg l 1 and tn concentrations 1 74 0 52 mg l 1 due to dilution and scour with high freshwater inflow at humen table 6 the er at humen was higher than those at jiaomen and hongqimen which also may be reduced by high total suspended solids organic matter and heterophytic microorganisms the low gpp and high er also led to the lowest nep occurring at humen with the lowest ph do and tds fig 4a hypoxia and low ph are well known in the pre cui et al 2019 however it was previously believed that the hypoxia was caused by chemical factors such as eutrophication driven hypoxia yu and gan 2021 this study confirmed that the impact of increased discharge on low nep hypoxia and acidification in the pre cannot be ignored 4 2 methodological implications for estimates of aquatic metabolism in estuaries measurements of gpp er and nep provide fundamental information about the trophic status of aquatic ecosystems and can be used to assess estuarine health and the impact of human activities on estuarine ecosystems we utilised substantial amounts of manpower and resources to understand the spatiotemporal variations of metabolism in different regions of the estuary through field monitoring cloern et al 2014 shen et al 2020 staehr et al 2012 2018 however such monitoring and assessment are logistically difficult and expensive to sustain as part of long term monitoring programmes due to the high spatiotemporal variability of estuarine environments murrell et al 2018 despite many decades of research aimed at quantifying coastal ecosystem primary productivity there is no consensus on best practices making global assessments challenging cloern et al 2014 in situ datasondes are an attractive option for routine monitoring and assessing ecosystem metabolism because they are generally less labor intensive and require less expertise than water column or benthic incubation methods high frequency do data have been widely used for estimating ecosystem metabolism in a variety of freshwater estuarine and marine systems but it is important to evaluate the underlying assumptions and limitations of the method caffrey et al 2014 we evaluated the applicability of odum s open water method to the three outlets one of the most important assumptions is that the water mass being monitored is relatively homogenous and well mixed essentially having common metabolic history the highest probability of outliers was up to 40 at humen which may be mostly attributed to violation of a key assumption of the open water method homogeneity of water bodies heterogeneous water bodies appeared at specific times because of tide advection or mixing and led to estimation errors in aquatic metabolism we discarded the outlier metabolism values although one possibility that is not often considered is that anomalous values may simply reflect periods of low metabolism with values below the effective method detection limit and discarding such values would upwardly bias the estimates of metabolism caffrey et al 2014 it is difficult to determine the effect of discarded values on metabolic estimates at humen beck et al 2015 attempted to improve estimates of ecosystem metabolism by reducing the effects of tidal advection on do time series however their method was less robust when tides and the solar cycle were correlated for protracted periods therefore we suggest that key controlling factors should be screened and a model that describes the key eco hydrological processes in estuaries by considering the responses of complex water ecological processes to influencing factors should be established to analyse the spatiotemporal variation of estuarine metabolism 5 conclusions we explored the spatiotemporal variability of the aquatic environment and nep at three outlets humen jiaomen and hongqimen with different hydrological conditions in the pearl river estuary pre china through in situ monitoring and odum s open water method from december 2018 to january 2020 and explored the influence mechanism of hydrological variation on nep similar to most estuaries the three outlets of the pre are dominated by net heterotrophy and biological metabolism processes are the source of atmospheric co2 the daily nep o2 concentration and ph were the lowest at humen which also had the largest discharge and tide volume deepest water depth and widest channel seasonally the nep in the summer and autumn was lower than those in the spring and winter the spatiotemporal variations in metabolism and the influence mechanism of hydrological variation indicated that the high discharge pulse intensified low nep hypoxia and acidification at the three outlets our research provides new knowledge for improving estuarine ecosystem functioning from the perspective of discharge regulation and management additionally the high metabolic outliers at humen suggest that other models will be required to estimate metabolism in complex estuaries that are severely tidally affected declaration of competing

16216,this study is the first to enrich a facultative qq consortium for ai 2 based quorum sensing qs disruption fqq2 and discover its quorum quenching qq performance in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr for membrane fouling retardation herein fqq2 was enriched by the enrichment culture using 4 5 dihydroxy 2 3 pentanedione dpd followed by anaerobic screening fqq2 was composed of various facultative ai 2 based qq microorganisms including acinetobacter comamonas stenotrophomonas and fqq2 was capable to degrade 96 96 of dpd in 9 h more importantly fqq2 prolonged membrane filtration operation by an average of 3 72 times via reduction of dpd in the anmbr treating domestic wastewater p 0 05 qq was implicated to reduce the content of proteins and carbohydrates of the extracellular polymeric substances eps of suspended biomass by 24 16 and 10 39 respectively and concentration of proteins of the soluble microbial products smp by 18 77 parallel factor parafac modelling of excitation emission matrix eem demonstrated that qq could reduce the content of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by product like proteins of the eps p 0 05 and abate the content of soluble microbial by product like proteins in the smp p 0 05 the lower eps content of suspended biomass could be rendered with the reduced relative abundance of ai 2 regulated christensenellaceae g hyphomicrobium leucobacter and microbacterium by 48 48 76 56 64 78 and 59 26 respectively and qq led to the reduction of the relative abundance of christensenellaceae g and leucobacter in the cake layer by 31 07 and 51 43 respectively moreover quantity of organics as well as planktonic microorganisms in the supernatant decreased in presence of fqq2 p 0 05 of note markedly lower relative abundance of ai 2 regulated sulfurovum in supernatant by 97 74 resulted in its lower abundance of cake layer intriguingly in the presence of qq methane production was statistically enhanced by 62 5 p 0 05 it was closely linked to the decrease of sulfate reduction p 0 05 which resulted from 37 93 lower abundance of sulfate reduction desulfomonile in the suspended biomass p 0 05 collectively this study sheds lights on the development of ai 2 based qq for biofouling control in anmbrs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor autoinducer 2 ceramic membrane fouling planktons quorum quenching 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs which utilize ceramic membranes for treatment of domestic wastewater are emerging and promising as this membrane material has high permeability low fouling propensity which is attributable to the weaker bonding between membranes and foulants and physical robustness against corrosive chemicals and harsh environmental conditions yue et al 2015 for example as compared to polymeric membranes ceramic membranes with superhydrophilic surface exhibited lower membrane fouling in an anmbr due to the hydrophilic hydrophobic repulsion jeong et al 2018 nevertheless inevitable membrane biofouling which decreases filtration flux and increases energy consumption is still one of the most perennial challenges impeding the commercialization of ceramic anmbrs xu et al 2020a therefore effective control strategies of membrane biofouling are crucial in enhancing the competitiveness of ceramic anmbrs for domestic wastewater treatment of note the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and biofilm formation of microorganisms in anmbrs could be subjected to regulation by quorum sensing qs which is a cell to cell communication mechanism employing qs signals xu et al 2020a 2020b therefore quorum quenching qq which is based on the disruption of qs provides a new opportunity to overcome the biofouling problem for anmbrs over the past few years liu et al 2019 mehmood et al 2021 xu et al 2020a however the examined qq in anmbrs have been limited to the disruption of n acylhomoserine lactones ahls which is an intraspecies qs signal for gram negative bacteria in contrast autoinducer 2 ai 2 signalling is used for interspecies communication for both gram negative bacteria and gram positive bacteria with widespread prevalence lee et al 2018 ai 2 has been demonstrated to play an important role in anaerobic metabolic processes xiao et al 2019 and the abundance of ai 2 in suspended biomass was governed primarily by phylum firmicutes in anmbrs moreover the formation of biofilm by gram negative anaerobes e g f nucleatum and p gingivalis was noted to be mainly induced by ai 2 ryu et al 2016 and therefore ai 2 based qq could be unsurprisingly promising in mitigation of multicellular biofilm formation however most of ai 2 based qq studies only cast attention on single species in pure culture or microorganisms in aerobic membrane bioreactors aembrs lee et al 2018 2016 for instances ai 2 based qq restrained the biofilm formation of three ai 2 qs bacteria yb 1 yb 2 and yb 3 isolated from aembrs and two well known ai 2 qs bacteria bb152 and k12 lee et al 2016 furthermore farnesol secreted from c albicans could mitigate the biofilm formation via the suppression of ai 2 qs in an aembr lee et al 2016 more recently ai 2 qq bacterium acinetobacter has been successfully isolated and applied into an aembr for biofouling control and had a higher qq efficiency than that of ahl based qq bacterium lee et al 2018 however there are still left research gaps regarding to the isolation of functional qq microorganisms which can exert ai 2 based qq for biofouling control in anmbrs knowledge of the precise roles of ai 2 based qq for biofouling control in anmbrs is still unenlightened as the complex understanding of ai 2 based qq in anmbrs cannot be extrapolated from that of aembrs due to the subtle difference in bio communities as ai 2 based qs is involved in interspecies microbial communication mechanism and that stubborn biofilm is composed of a wide spectrum of anaerobes rather than single bacterium in anmbrs xu et al 2021 ai 2 based qq regimen is expected to be a next generation anti biofouling strategy the understanding of elusive evolution of biofouling requires both physicochemical and microbial compositions of liquor fraction of mixed liquor i e supernatant in anmbrs which house not only colloidal organics but also keystone planktonic microorganisms such as filamentous anaerolineales and sulfate reducing bacteria srb causing initial colonization on membrane surface and pore blockage yao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 although biofilm formation behaviours of numerous srb are known to be regulated by ai 2 based qs scarascia et al 2016 current understanding is still inadequate to establish a linkage between microbial communities of supernatant and that of biofouling in anmbrs under the impact of ai 2 based qq moreover there is an urgency to decipher the mechanisms of qs qq regulation of organic compositions particle size distribution concentration of microorganisms i e volatile suspended solids vss and microbial communities of supernatant zhou et al 2019 the aims of this study were a enrichment and performance assessment of ai 2 based facultative qq consortium fqq2 for biofouling retardation in a ceramic anmbr b the capture of characteristics of organics and particles within mixed liquor to systematically enlighten the working mechanisms of qq on biofouling retardation from a physiochemical aspect c and the comprehensive understanding of microbial communities in supernatant suspended biomass and biofilm on membrane surface which could trigger to a certain extent thinking of the philosophy of multifaceted deterministic roles of ai 2 based qq qs on the biofouling and treatment performance from a microbial perspective in anmbrs 2 material and methods 2 1 enrichment of ai 2 based facultative qq consortium fqq2 ai 2 based qq is achieved by degradation of 4 5 dihydroxy 2 3 pentanedione dpd carbosynth which is synthesized by luxs and is the sole pre cursor of multiple ai 2 signals lee et al 2018 therefore enrichment of fqq2 was achieved by using dpd as the sole carbon source followed by anaerobic screening and the enrichment process was revised according to a previous study xu et al 2020b briefly activated sludge was collected from a local domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp and seeded into the minimal medium containing 2 mm of dpd after 3 d 10 of enriched culture was transferred to a new minimal medium with the dpd and this process was repeated thrice before the aerobic qq consortium aeqq was harvested anaerobic condition was then provided to aeqq in a serum bottle by sparging a nutrient rich medium and filling up the headspace with n2 before sealing the nutrient rich condition in the serum bottle was provided by supplementing 3 g chemical oxygen demand cod l of acetate sigmaaldrich 99 0 and minimal medium to select for facultative qq microorganisms from aeqq with the expectation of the decrease of strictly aerobic microorganisms the incubation temperature was 30 c and the shaking speed was 200 rpm after around 30d upon which the od600 of aeqq showed no further fluctuations the fqq2 was then harvested after centrifuging 4000xg for 5 min the genomic dna of fqq2 was extracted and sequenced and detailed procedure is found in section 2 5 2 2 dpd degradability of fqq2 with and without the presence of acetate under anaerobic conditions dpd degradation was conducted to preliminarily investigate ai 2 based qq performance of fqq2 possible failure of qq bioaugmentation could result from the degradation of other organics instead of dpd by fqq2 as acetate was considered as a prevalent substrate commonly utilized by anaerobes in anmbrs xu et al 2020b substrates specificity between dpd and acetate as carbon sources was investigated to assess whether presence of acetate could affect the dpd degradability of fqq2 therefore three aliquots of fqq2 with same dosage of 500 mg l were mixed with 1000 ppb of dpd 1000 ppb of dpd plus 1133 ppb of acetate i e having a cod equivalent to 1000 ppb of dpd and 1000 ppb dpd plus 2266 ppb of acetate i e having a cod double that of 1000 ppb of dpd pure dpd and dpd with 500 mg l of inactivated by sterilization fqq2 were prepared as blank and control respectively all batch tests were conducted with three biological repeats all solutions were then sparged with n2 to achieve anaerobic conditions in the serum bottles after 0 5 1 5 4 and 9 h liquid samples were extracted and subjected to derivatization with 2 3 diaminonaphthalene dan sigmaaldrich 98 0 to form dpd dan before analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms details of the lc ms ms analysis can be found in method s1 2 3 ceramic anmbrs set up and operation two parallel lab scale ceramic anmbrs with each consisting of a 6 l anaerobic tank and a 1 17 l submerged membrane tank containing a flat sheet ceramic membrane module with nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and a total surface area of 0 045 m2 were set up fig s1 the hydraulic retention time hrt solid retention time srt and membrane flux of anmbrs were 17 h 50d and 9 l m2 h lmh respectively domestic wastewater collected from wwtp was continuously fed into anmbrs throughout whole experiment and the characteristics of domestic wastewater are listed in table s1 diaphragm pumps were employed with a gas sparging rate of 0 9m3 m2 h to provide shear effect on membrane surface transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded by a digital pressure gauge to assess membrane fouling propensities when tmp reached around 35 kpa the fouled ceramic membrane module was taken offline for cleaning and the operation was continued by using a cleaned one membrane cleaning was conducted by scraping off biofilm and subsequent soaking in a 1 g l sodium hypochlorite solution followed by soaking in a 2 g l citric acid solution anmbrs achieved steady state conditions after about 60 d from the start up based on mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss cod removal and methane yield oxidation reduction potential of mixed liquor was continuously monitored with a hach probeless meters after steady state was achieved by the anmbrs 50 ml of empty hydrogel beads which were fabricated according to xu et al 2020b were dosed into both r1 and r2 and tmp was monitored to investigate whether r1 and r2 had similar filtration performance during the baseline phase after 24 d i e the start of experiment phase new empty beads were added to replace the empty beads in r1 at the same time empty beads in r2 were replaced by an equal amount of qq beads in r2 in which fqq2 were entrapped by using the method described in xu et al 2020b and the dosage of fqq2 was 30 mg fqq2 l total reactor volume 2 4 sample preparation and physiochemical analyses preparation of various fractions of mixed liquor and the fouling related physiochemical characterizations used are summarized in fig s2 briefly the liquor fraction of the mixed liquor in the anmbrs is defined as the supernatant which was obtained from centrifugation of mixed liquor at 9000xg for 10 min the smp i e dissolved fraction of supernatant was further obtained by filtration of the supernatant through 0 45 μm mce membranes the eps was extracted from the residual biomass using the heat method capillary suction time cst of mixed liquor was measured by a cst apparatus proteins and carbohydrates of the supernatant smp and eps were quantified by the modified lowry protein assay and dubois method respectively xu et al 2020b liquid chromatography organic carbon detector lcocd was employed to characterize the dissolved organic matters which constitutes biopolymer with molecular weight mw more than 20 kda and low molecular weight lmw compounds with mw less than 1000 da including humics building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals xu et al 2020a eem was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer xu et al 2020a and the measured excitation emission matrix eem of smp n 20 and eps n 20 of both r1 and r2 were subjected to parallel factor parafac modelling to quantify mathematically the deconvoluted fluorescent components yu et al 2014 the detailed procedures are shown in method s2 particle size distribution psd of mixed liquor was analysed using a laser diffraction particle analyser psd of supernatant was evaluated by a zetasizer dead end filtration was conducted to analyse fouling potential of supernatant fig s3 the details of the analysis can be found in method s3 cod mixed liquor suspended solid mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 cations and anions were quantified using ion chromatography volatile fatty acids vfas including acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid valeric acid isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid were determined by a gc fid the volume of biogas collected in gas bags was measured by syringes and methane content was analysed using a gc bid dpd was extracted and quantified from the permeates of the anmbrs by lc ms ms to investigate the direct effect of ai 2 based qq with details described in method s1 and the recovery rate rr and matrix effect me were conducted for the evaluation of the method performance the two tailed student s t tests including welch s t test were used for statistical analysis of physiochemical parameters 2 5 molecular microbiology characterization the cake layers of r1 and r2 were obtained when tmp exceeded around 35 kpa and its genomic dna was extracted by using a dna isolation kit moreover genomic dna of supernatant and suspended biomass i e mixed liquor without fraction of supernatant of r1 and r2 were extracted during the stable operation period of the experiment phase polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification of both bacterial and archaeal 16s amplicon generation were performed using specific primers of 515f gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 806r ggactachvhhhtwtctaat products of pcr with the valid strip of 400 450 bp were subjected to illumina high throughput sequencing each operational taxonomic unit otu was assigned based on 97 similarity of sequences after quality filtering the statistical difference in relative abundance of microbial taxa were analysed by the two tailed student s t tests analysis of similarity statistics anosim was performed to test the significance of discrepancy amongst bio communities all the raw reads as fastq files were deposited into the ncbi sra database with accession number prjna754324 3 results 3 1 enrichment of fqq2 dpd degradability and microbial population in fqq2 the increase of od600 during the last 2 cycles of the enrichment culture was observed which was suggestive of the successful cultivation of aeqq fig s4a and it was further demonstrated by the capability of dpd degradation by aeqq under aerobic condition fig s4b fqq2 was harvested after anaerobic screening of aeqq where the od600 decreased to a stable value implying the decrease of the strictly aerobic microorganisms fig s4c of note 96 96 of degradation of dpd by the fqq2 in 9 h showed its high efficiency in inactivation of ai 2 fig 1 a while fqq2 could deplete acetate within 0 5 h fig s5 the results showed that acetate with same or double amount of dpd as cod did not affect the overall removal of dpd by the fqq2 fig 1 a microbial composition of the fqq2 was determined to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of its qq competence the majorities of the fqq2 were composed of acinetobacter comamonas klebsiella serratia stenotrophomonas and thauera with abundance of 1 16 9 18 28 15 14 13 7 88 and 2 39 respectively fig 1 b several microbial genera were suggested to have potential ai 2 based qq abilities table s2 specifically acinetobacter is likely a facultative anaerobe and it can release hydrophilic ai 2 qq compounds mw 400 da moreover the addition of acinetobacter entrapped beads remarkably reduced membrane biofouling via decreasing dpd concentration lee et al 2018 furthermore facultative stenotrophomonas could inhibit ai 2 activity via the production of cis 9 octadecenoic acid singh et al 2013 venkidusamy and megharaj 2016 widmer et al 2007 additionally introduction of ai 2 as substrate could promote the growth of comamonas under anaerobic condition zhou et al 2021 which was suggestive of its qq ability therefore multiple potential qq microbial genera within the fqq2 were suggested to be responsible for the high degradation of dpd although there was no information regarding the ai 2 based qq ability of klebsiella serratia and thauera in literature therefore how individual microbial populations participated in the degradation of dpd needs to be further examined by applying function driven genomic approaches overall this study was the first to propose a facultative qq candidate pool for ai 2 based qs disruption via effective decomposition of dpd under anaerobic conditions the high degradation of dpd achieved by fqq2 which was not affected by the presence of acetate inferred that fqq2 could be served as a promising and implementable qq technique for anmbrs 3 2 treatment performance of ceramic anmbrs ai 2 based qq did not affect the mlvss with 7 81 1 01 g l and 7 90 1 01 g l in r1 and r2 respectively p 0 35 table s3 however a higher cod removal of r2 86 57 4 48 as compared to that of r1 82 14 6 59 p 0 05 was observed fig 2 a moreover sulfate removal of r2 64 08 13 72 was statistically lower by 16 1 p 0 05 in comparison with that in r1 74 42 7 72 fig 3 a the reduced removal of sulfate could lead to the improvement of methanogenic activities chen et al 2008 and it is aligned with the experimental observations that methane yield was significantly enhanced by 62 5 in r2 p 0 05 in the presence of qq fig 2 b although related there was no statistical difference of accumulated acetate i e the only vfa detected in smp between r1 and r2 p 0 224 fig s6 matrix effect referred to the difference of quantitative response of lc ms ms for dpd dan in standard solution versus that in a biological matrix i e permeate of anmbrs in this study it was noteworthy that excellent comparability between recovery rate of dpd and the matrix effect was observed p 0 15 table s4 this suggested that signal suppression due to the matrix effect of 89 24 from the permeate could be the main cause leading to the recovery rate of 85 31 and the high recovery of dpd demonstrated that the direct quantification of dpd dan derived from dpd in the permeate of anmbrs by lc ms ms without pre treatment e g solid phase extraction is acceptable dpd concentration of the permeate was significantly reduced by 27 8 p 0 05 in the presence of qq fig 3 b which was indicative of a successful ai 2 based qq in degrading dpd in the anmbr treating domestic wastewater 3 3 filtration performance and physiochemical properties of mixed liquor of ceramic anmbrs 3 3 1 the effect of qq on filtration performance tmp profiles were established for r1 and r2 during the baseline phase r1 and r2 had rather similar average period of fouling cycles of 6 66 d and 5 95 d respectively p 0 26 fig s7 after the introduction of qq beads i e experiment phase qq significantly extended the average membrane operation period of the anmbr by 3 72 times p 0 05 fig 2 c r2 achieved a substantially longer membrane operation period of 22 95 3 71 d as compared to r1 with a shorter membrane operation period of 6 17 2 95 d the tmp profile clearly illustrated ai 2 based qq could mitigate membrane biofouling which could offer potential lower costs and energy savings for anmbrs 3 3 2 the effect of qq on eps and smp the concentration of proteins of the eps of suspended biomass was significantly reduced by 24 1 in the presence of qq p 0 05 with average concentrations of 19 74 4 72 mg g vss and 14 9 4 09 mg g vss in r1 and r2 respectively fig 4 a however qq did not induce statistical change in the concentration of carbohydrates in the eps p 0 16 with similar carbohydrates content of 2 31 0 89 mg g vss and 2 07 0 90 mg g vss in r1 and r2 respectively fig 4 b the results were strongly associated to the observation that qq reduced the protein content of biopolymer in the eps by 26 52 p 0 05 while there was no statistical difference in the carbohydrate content of biopolymer in the eps fig s8a the organic fingerprints were revealed by the eem parafac identifying a total of six unique fluorescent components of the eps fig s9 and table s5 several aromatic and soluble microbial by product like proteins i e c1 eps c3 eps and c4 eps had high fluorescence intensities than other components of both r1 and r2 table 1 of note qq was found to lead to the statistical reduction of fulvic acid like and humic substances c2 eps tyrosine like aromatic and soluble microbial by product like protein c4 eps and aromatic protein c5 eps of eps p 0 05 overall qq was implicated to reduce protein content of eps according to results of the modified lowry protein assay the lcocd and the eem parafac as dewaterability of mixed liquor measured by cst could be crucially correlated to the content of organics of eps of suspended biomass xu et al 2020a the lower protein concentration in the eps in the presence of qq probably resulted in the lower cst values in r2 in comparison with those of r1 fig 3 c qq resulted in a reduction of the concentration of proteins in the smp by 19 1 p 0 05 whereby the concentrations were 3 28 1 40 mg g vss and 4 05 1 37 mg g vss in r1 and r2 respectively fig 4 c however there was no statistical difference in the concentration of carbohydrates in the smp between r1 0 86 0 38 mg g vss and r2 0 78 0 32 mg g vss p 0 184 fig 4 d these results could be evidenced by the reduction in protein content of biopolymer in the smp by 12 58 in the presence of qq p 0 05 while the carbohydrates of biopolymer were not statistically affected fig s8b noticeably qq induced the abatement of concentration of the lmw compounds by 8 13 p 0 05 of r2 in comparison with that of r1 eem parafac modelling showed that the smp of both r1 and r2 were mainly comprised of three fluorescent compounds and the aromatic and soluble microbial by product like protein c1 smp was dominant fig s10 and tables s6 and 1 moreover the fluorescence intensity of c1 smp was statistically reduced in the presence of qq by 10 5 p 0 05 table 1 this observation was related to the reduction of protein concentrations in the smp by qq as revealed by the modified lowry protein assay and lcocd however qq could be less effective in decreasing other fluorescent compounds such as protein like and fulvic acid like substances c2 smp as well as the humic acid like compounds c3 smp 3 3 3 the effect of qq on supernatant difference in the appearance of the supernatants of r1 and r2 was observed fig s11 and the effects of qq on the characteristics of supernatant including concentrations of organics as well as planktonic microorganisms and the fouling potential of supernatant were holistically investigated there was statistical difference in the protein content of the supernatant between r1 and r2 with 14 24 2 93 mg g vss and 9 69 2 61 mg g vss respectively p 0 05 fig 4 c moreover qq significantly reduced the carbohydrate content of the supernatant by 25 4 p 0 05 with carbohydrate contents of 3 31 1 23 mg g vss and 2 47 0 89 mg g vss in r1 and r2 respectively fig 4 d the suspended solid ss and volatile suspended solid vss within the supernatant were quantified the vss ss ratios of the supernatant were found to be approximately 90 for both reactors table s3 which indicated that the suspended particles in the supernatant were mainly comprised of planktonic microorganisms the average concentration of planktonic microorganisms in the supernatant i e vss in r2 was found to be significantly lower p 0 05 as compared to that of r1 with 0 20 0 09 g l and 0 12 0 03 g l in r1 and r2 respectively fig 3 d moreover the ratio of vss of the supernatant to mlvss in r2 was lower compared to that of r1 p 0 05 implying the lower number of microorganisms present in the supernatant of the mixed liquor induced by qq table s3 the results provided clues underpinning the psd of mixed liquor where there was lower percentage of volume of particles in r2 than that of r1 ranging from 0 to 10 µm a typical range of particles in the supernatant of anmbrs xu et al 2020a zhou et al 2019 although there was a similar unimodal dominant peak 33 µm observed in both r1 and r2 fig s12a particles and organics with difference sizes in the supernatant had distinct fouling behaviours xu et al 2020a therefore although planktonic content of the supernatant was reduced as induced by qq the psd of supernatant under the impact of qq needs to be analysed the psd of supernatant of r1 showed a dominant peak with size near 568 nm while a bimodal distribution was observed in the psd of supernatant in r2 fig s12b the first peak was with particulate sizes around 267 nm and the second peak of particulates with size of approximately 1209 nm noticeably the intensity of particles with sizes near 100 nm was reduced in the supernatant of r2 as compared to r1 fig s12b which could potentially lead to the decrease of pore blocking as pore blockage could be mainly attributed to particles and organics with size similar to the pore size of the ceramic membrane in this study 100 nm xu et al 2020a dead end filtration was used to investigate the fouling behaviour of the supernatant of r1 and r2 the time required for the filtration of similar volume of supernatant of r2 were shorter than that of the supernatant of r1 fig s13 which directly proved that the supernatant of r2 had a reduced fouling propensity in comparison with that of r1 furthermore lower cake layer resistance and pore blocking resistance induced by qq was observed after dead end filtration which was suggestive of the capability of qq to decrease cake layer formation and pore blockage in the anmbr fig s14 3 4 the effect of qq on taxonomic compositions of suspended biomass supernatant and cake layer of ceramic anmbrs 3 4 1 the effect of qq on bio communities of suspended biomass mixed liquor without supernatant the relative abundance of major microbial genera i e with relative abundance greater than 1 at least in one sample in suspended biomass of r1 and r2 was shown in fig 5 of note major ai 2 genera including christensenellaceae g hyphomicrobium leucobacter and microbacterium were found in suspended biomass in r1 and r2 table 2 it is not surprising that an abatement of ai 2 by the fqq2 might disrupt the metabolic activity of ai 2 genera which in turn resulted in the decrease of abundance of these ai 2 genera in the suspended biomass xiao et al 2019 table 2 and therefore it could lead to the statistical community dissimilarities of suspended biomass between r1 and r2 fig 5 and table s7 xiao et al 2019 this could be correlated to the anosim which showed that there was statistical microbial difference in the suspended biomass between r1 and r2 p 0 05 table s8 specifically christensenellaceae g belongs to firmicutes and the ai 2 level was demonstrated to be governed primarily by firmicutes in an anmbrs xiao et al 2019 several genera of christensenellaceae g contained rbsb gene copies which could be regulated by ai 2 based qs coil et al 2020 noticeably there was statistically 48 48 lower abundance of christensenellaceae g in the suspended biomass of r2 1 86 0 54 than that of r1 3 61 0 55 p 0 05 fig 5 and table 2 this agreed with the observation that the abundance of firmicutes declined from 11 21 to 8 58 in the suspended biomass p 0 05 in the presence of qq in r2 fig s15 moreover hyphomicrobium which was found to harbour ai 2 genes sun et al 2019 could be a key genus to form compact biofilm by production of eps tian et al 2021 there was statistically 76 56 lower abundance of hyphomicrobium in the suspended biomass in r2 0 30 0 15 than that of r1 1 28 0 29 p 0 05 fig 5 and table 2 furthermore there was statistically 66 03 lower abundance of leucobacter in r2 0 56 0 11 than that of r1 1 59 0 18 p 0 05 fig 5 and table 2 ai 2 was suggested to be yielded by leucobacter and it stimulated qq related protease activity of v cholerae sela et al 2021 additionally microbacterium which has the capability to possess ai 2 based qs activity could be strongly associated to biofouling via smp production wu and lee 2012 zhou et al 2021 statistically lower abundance by 59 26 of microbacterium in the suspended biomass in r2 0 77 0 15 than that of r1 1 89 0 32 p 0 05 was observed fig 5 and table 2 the repression of methane production by srb which compete with archaea for metabolic substrates is a persistent barrier to anmbrs chen et al 2008 especially for treatment of wastewater containing high amount of sulfate intriguingly the relative abundance of srb desulfomonile was reduced by 37 93 in the suspended biomass of r2 1 26 0 65 as compared to that of r1 2 03 0 26 p 0 05 fig 5 which could inevitably contribute to the lower sulfate removal of r2 fig 3 a noticeably proteins homologous to luxs for ai 2 synthase and luxp for ai 2 receptors were demonstrated to be present in many srb such as desulfovibrio and desulfotomaculum scarascia et al 2016 moreover it was possible that ai 2 based qs might be involved in induction of dsra li et al 2007 which was harboured within desulfomonile that potentially regulates the production of sulfate reductive enzyme kondo et al 2006 lin et al 2020 therefore ai 2 based qq was suggested to induce lower sulfate removal via regulation of desulfomonile in the suspended biomass however this study did not indicate that ai 2 based qq could directly affect the growth or activities of desulfomonile in the suspended biomass and future studies will be required to evaluate the complicated mechanisms of srbs under the impact of ai 2 based qq via metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analysis 3 4 2 the effect of qq on bio communities of supernatant although the proportion of microorganisms in the supernatant constitutes less than 3 as compared to those in the mixed liquor of both r1 and r2 table s3 supernatant harboured considerable quantities of planktonic microorganisms which could unavoidably exacerbate membrane biofouling in anmbrs especially the initial biofouling zhou et al 2019 anosim showed that there was no statistical microbial composition discrepancy of supernatant between r1 and r2 p 0 2 table s8 which could mainly attributed to similar major genera in both r1 and r2 including anaerolineaceae g p 0 09 anaerovorax p 0 34 candidatus cloacimonas p 0 23 christensenellaceae g p 0 38 rikenellaceae g p 0 10 thermovirga p 0 44 and verrucomicrobiae g p 0 41 fig 5 and table s7 noticeably the most abundant anaerolineaceae g was affiliated with filamentous bacterium in both r1 and r2 and was demonstrated as a key bacterial taxa contributing to the massive accumulation on membrane surface of an anmbr yao et al 2020 however the relative abundance of other major genera in supernatant was different between r1 and r2 specifically sulfurovum was another abundant genus in supernatant of r1 with relative abundance of 6 64 while the relative abundance of sulfurovum was conspicuously reduced to 0 15 in the supernatant of r2 p 0 05 fig 5 and table 2 it can be supported by the fact that sulfurovum is an ai 2 regulated bacteria where luxs gene is expressed during its growth pérez rodríguez et al 2015 moreover the relative abundance of desulfomonile and leptolinea were reduced in the presence of qq in the supernatant of r2 by 45 47 and 46 52 respectively as compared to those in r1 p 0 05 table s7 3 4 3 the effect of qq on bio communities of cake layer there were major genera of anaerolineaceae g 13 75 anaerovorax 3 65 caldisericum 2 13 christensenellaceae g 1 77 desulfomonile 7 99 lactivibrio 1 18 leptolinea 1 52 leucobacter 1 05 rikenellaceae g 1 60 sulfurovum 4 65 thermovirga 1 05 and methanosaeta 3 89 in the cake layer of r1 fig 5 and table s7 of note anaerolineaceae g could produce organic fouling and biofouling concurrently and it contributed relative abundance of 13 75 4 59 and 14 06 1 34 to the cake layers of r1 and r2 p 0 46 respectively which was suggestive of its high fouling potential in both anmbrs yao et al 2020 however there were statistically lower abundance of anaerovorax 2 05 christensenellaceae g 1 22 lactivibrio 0 51 leucobacter 0 51 sulfurovum 0 61 thermovirga 0 68 and methanosaeta 1 57 in the cake layer in r2 as compared to those of r1 p 0 05 fig 5 which was in agreement with that there was statistically microbial difference of cake layer between r1 and r2 as revealed by anosim p 0 05 table s8 4 discussion 4 1 potential intricate mechanisms of the enhanced methane yield in ceramic anmbrs the result highlighted that ai 2 based qq could enhance methane production although the relative abundance of major archaeal genera such as methanobacterium p 0 09 and methanosaeta p 0 10 were not statistically changed in the suspended biomass of r2 as compared to that r1 fig 5 herein mechanisms of regulation of methane production by qq was postulated concretely ai 2 based qq induced the low abundance of desulfomonile in the suspended biomass p 0 05 and thus induced a poorer removal of sulfate p 0 05 figs 3 a and 5 the low sulfate reduction could be strongly associated to the enhanced methane production chen et al 2008 as srb could compete with fermentative microorganisms which would inevitably diminish the anaerobic digestion efficiency yuan and zhu 2016 it was consistent with the higher cod removal induced by qq in r2 as compared to r1 suggesting higher substrate degradation and utilization fig 2 a furthermore srb e g desulfomonile could compete with hydrogenotrophic methanogens and aceticlastic methanogens for both hydrogen and acetate as electron acceptors chen et al 2008 and the low abundance of desulfomonile in the suspended biomass of r2 fig 5 implied that the additional carbonaceous organics in r2 could be converted to methane via methanogenesis as compared to r1 moreover the sulfate reduction could lead to the production of sulfide which would be toxic to archaeal communities chen et al 2008 and therefore the low sulfate reduction could favour archaeal activities in anmbrs in sum the enhanced methane production induced by qq was correlated to the diminished substrate competition by the sulfate reduction process however considerable effort is still needed to track the influence of ai 2 based qq on functional genes and activities of keystone microorganisms involved in treatment performance of anmbrs 4 2 why did ai 2 based qq retard membrane biofouling in the ceramic anmbrs 4 2 1 physicochemical and microbial perspectives of suspended biomass qq could altered fouling related characteristics of the eps of suspended biomass the supernatant and the smp which are vital for biofouling formation in ceramic anmbrs this study underpinned the hypothesis that external fqq2 played a key role in reducing the content of protein in the eps as revealed by the modified lowry protein assay the lcocd and the eem parafac figs 4 a 4 b and s8a and table 1 as the preponderance of ai 2 has been demonstrated to strengthen interspecific qs communication and a higher eps production of microorganisms could be regulated by ai 2 ding et al 2015 lee et al 2016 the lower eps production of the suspended biomass in r2 could be mainly attributed to the lower dpd concentration repressed by ai 2 based qq p 0 05 fig 3 b moreover reduction of ai 2 by the fqq2 could result in the decrease of abundance of ai 2 genera in the suspended biomass via the disruption of their metabolic activity xiao et al 2019 therefore from a microbial aspect the reduced eps of the suspended biomass could be attributed to the lower abundance of ai 2 regulated genera e g christensenellaceae g hyphomicrobium leucobacter and microbacterium in the suspended biomass in r2 as compared to those of r1 figs 4 a 4 b and 5 and table 2 the conspicuously reduced biofouling of r2 could be attributed to the substantial decrease in the proteins of the eps as eps had high adhesion ability and protein content of eps made the anaerobic suspended biomass sticky favouring the adhesion of suspended biomass on membrane surface teng et al 2020 xu et al 2020a moreover fqq2 would result in a longer period required to trigger the qs activities i e qs signal to reach a threshold level of these ai 2 regulated microorganisms in the suspended biomass for their eps production and the attachment colonization for biofilm formation on membrane surface xu et al 2021 yeon et al 2009 therefore the lower qs activities of christensenellaceae g and leucobacter in the suspended biomass could result in the lower abundance of christensenellaceae g by 31 07 and leucobacter by 51 43 in the cake layer and contribute to the overall lower fouling rate by qq fig 5 and table s7 noticeably filamentous anaerolineaceae g which occupied 31 07 and 27 30 of suspended biomass in r1 and r2 p 0 21 respectively could be regulated by ahls based qs in anmbrs and found to play significant roles in the fouling evolution fig 5 and table s7 tabraiz et al 2020 yao et al 2020 therefore from a practical consideration it is imperative to dose additional ahl based qq to compensate for potential deficiency of sole ai 2 based qq in anmbrs 4 2 2 physicochemical and microbial perspectives of supernatant the reduced concentration of proteins in the supernatant i e liquor fraction of mixed liquor could be partially attributed to the lower eps of suspended biomass induced by qq as the liquor fraction i e supernatant including smp could be released from the eps of suspended biomass kim et al 2001 xu et al 2020a it could be corroborated by the similarity of identification of proteins between the dissolved portion of the supernatant i e smp and the eps figs s9 and s10 and tables s5 and s6 noticeably dominant soluble microbial by product like protein c1 smp could be excreted from the main soluble microbial by product like proteins i e c1 eps c3 eps and c4 eps of both r1 and r2 table 1 moreover it could be expected that the reduction of c1 smp induced by qq could be attributed to a reduction in the release of c4 eps of the eps p 0 05 table 1 additionally ai 2 based qs activities of genera such as sulfurovum in the supernatant could be directly affected by the fqq2 fig 5 which might result in the lower organic concentrations in the supernatant of r2 as compared to r1 figs 4 c and 4 d therefore the reduced organics in the supernatant induced by qq could be attributed to the synergistic effects of reduced organic release from the eps and the selective pressure imposed on the ai 2 based qs regulated genera in the supernatant the lower organics i e proteins and carbohydrates in the supernatant could be a plausible explanation for the reduced the fouling potential of the supernatant with ai 2 based qq as revealed by the dead end filtration figs 3 d 4 c 4 d and s13 not only organics but planktons in the supernatant contribute to biofilm formation in anmbrs yao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 although the biomass concentration i e vss in the supernatant only contributed less than 3 of the mlvss table s3 planktons or small floc with high specific eps content per surface area could significantly impact initial biofilm formation and alter the membrane surface inducing cake layer formation i e tmp rise xu et al 2020a therefore the substantially lower planktonic content found in the supernatant induced by qq fig 3 d in this study would inevitably reduce the potential of biofouling formation of the supernatant which is in consistent with the lower cake layer resistance revealed by dead end filtration of the supernatant fig s14 additionally according to the microbial source tracking calculation planktonic microorganisms in the supernatant could be an important source 22 6 for the bio community of cake layer yao et al 2020 concretely the relative abundance of sulfurovum in the cake layer was statistically higher than that in the suspended biomass p 0 05 but comparable to those in the supernatant of r1 p 0 30 fig 5 therefore the sulfurovum with relative abundance of 4 65 in the cake layer of r1 was implicated to be from supernatant in r1 of note ai 2 regulated sulfurovum could produce excess eps as it has been demonstrated to play vital roles in the formation of both initial and mature biofouling in a ceramic anmbr xu et al 2021 therefore the reduced abundance of sulfurovum in the supernatant by qq resulted in the lower abundance of sulfurovum of the cake layer by 86 88 furthermore considering the potential disruption of qs activities of sulfurovum by fqq2 the retarded eps production of sulfurovum on membrane surface could contribute to the overall lower fouling rate of r2 as compared to r1 fig 5 moreover considering that desulfomonile has a strong attachment ability cutter et al 2003 and srb in the supernatant was suggested to involved in initial colonization on membrane surface in anmbrs zhou et al 2019 the reduced abundance of desulfomonile in the supernatant of r2 by 45 47 p 0 05 explains the reason for the reduced biofouling observed in r2 fig 5 the protein content of the dissolved portion of the supernatant i e smp especially the soluble microbial by product like protein c1 smp was reduced in the presence of qq p 0 05 fig 4 c and table 1 of note according to thermodynamic analyses there was extremely high adhesive ability and specific filtration resistance of smps over suspended biomass teng et al 2019 therefore the reduced content of proteins in smp could lead to improved characteristics of biomass in the presence of fqq2 moreover as the biopolymers in the smp could be mainly retained by membranes jiang et al 2010 the reduced biopolymer content of the smp in the presence of qq would contributed to the lower fouling rate of ceramic anmbr fig s8b pore blocking resistance was reported to be highly correlated to the lmw compounds in smp jiang et al 2010 therefore the lower concentration of lmw compounds by qq p 0 05 could lead to the reduced prevalence of pore constriction possibly attributable to adsorption of organics on the membrane internal pore walls fig s8b moreover the reduced intensity of particles with sizes closed to 100 nm i e pore size of ceramic membrane in the supernatant of r2 as compared to r1 was also suggested to minimise occurrence of pore constriction of ceramic membrane fig s12b this result was in consistent with lower pore blocking resistance revealed by dead end filtration of the supernatant induced by qq fig s14 moreover it suggested that the retarded membrane fouling is also attributed to reduced prevalence of pore constriction fig 2 c 5 conclusion this study is the first to propose a facultative ai 2 based qq consortium comprising of acinetobacter comamonas and stenotrophomonas fqq2 prolonged membrane filtration operation by an average of 3 72 times in the ceramic anmbr treating domestic wastewater the retarded membrane fouling could result from the decrease of protein content of the eps of the suspended biomass by qq it might be attributed to the reduction of abundance of ai 2 based genera e g christensenellaceae g hyphomicrobium leucobacter and microbacterium in the suspended biomass moreover lower abundance of christensenellaceae g and leucobacter in the cake layer was observed in the presence of qq which was suggestive of their lower attachment ability for biofilm formation qq induced a lower concentration of plankton and organics in the supernatant which reduced its fouling potential moreover a lower abundance of planktonic ai 2 regulated sulfurovum in the supernatant could also induce lower biofouling which was evidenced by the lower abundance of sulfurovum in the cake layer in the presence of qq the enhancement of methane yield could be induced by the lower sulfate reduction which favoured the conversion of substrates to methane in the

16216,this study is the first to enrich a facultative qq consortium for ai 2 based quorum sensing qs disruption fqq2 and discover its quorum quenching qq performance in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr for membrane fouling retardation herein fqq2 was enriched by the enrichment culture using 4 5 dihydroxy 2 3 pentanedione dpd followed by anaerobic screening fqq2 was composed of various facultative ai 2 based qq microorganisms including acinetobacter comamonas stenotrophomonas and fqq2 was capable to degrade 96 96 of dpd in 9 h more importantly fqq2 prolonged membrane filtration operation by an average of 3 72 times via reduction of dpd in the anmbr treating domestic wastewater p 0 05 qq was implicated to reduce the content of proteins and carbohydrates of the extracellular polymeric substances eps of suspended biomass by 24 16 and 10 39 respectively and concentration of proteins of the soluble microbial products smp by 18 77 parallel factor parafac modelling of excitation emission matrix eem demonstrated that qq could reduce the content of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by product like proteins of the eps p 0 05 and abate the content of soluble microbial by product like proteins in the smp p 0 05 the lower eps content of suspended biomass could be rendered with the reduced relative abundance of ai 2 regulated christensenellaceae g hyphomicrobium leucobacter and microbacterium by 48 48 76 56 64 78 and 59 26 respectively and qq led to the reduction of the relative abundance of christensenellaceae g and leucobacter in the cake layer by 31 07 and 51 43 respectively moreover quantity of organics as well as planktonic microorganisms in the supernatant decreased in presence of fqq2 p 0 05 of note markedly lower relative abundance of ai 2 regulated sulfurovum in supernatant by 97 74 resulted in its lower abundance of cake layer intriguingly in the presence of qq methane production was statistically enhanced by 62 5 p 0 05 it was closely linked to the decrease of sulfate reduction p 0 05 which resulted from 37 93 lower abundance of sulfate reduction desulfomonile in the suspended biomass p 0 05 collectively this study sheds lights on the development of ai 2 based qq for biofouling control in anmbrs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor autoinducer 2 ceramic membrane fouling planktons quorum quenching 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs which utilize ceramic membranes for treatment of domestic wastewater are emerging and promising as this membrane material has high permeability low fouling propensity which is attributable to the weaker bonding between membranes and foulants and physical robustness against corrosive chemicals and harsh environmental conditions yue et al 2015 for example as compared to polymeric membranes ceramic membranes with superhydrophilic surface exhibited lower membrane fouling in an anmbr due to the hydrophilic hydrophobic repulsion jeong et al 2018 nevertheless inevitable membrane biofouling which decreases filtration flux and increases energy consumption is still one of the most perennial challenges impeding the commercialization of ceramic anmbrs xu et al 2020a therefore effective control strategies of membrane biofouling are crucial in enhancing the competitiveness of ceramic anmbrs for domestic wastewater treatment of note the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and biofilm formation of microorganisms in anmbrs could be subjected to regulation by quorum sensing qs which is a cell to cell communication mechanism employing qs signals xu et al 2020a 2020b therefore quorum quenching qq which is based on the disruption of qs provides a new opportunity to overcome the biofouling problem for anmbrs over the past few years liu et al 2019 mehmood et al 2021 xu et al 2020a however the examined qq in anmbrs have been limited to the disruption of n acylhomoserine lactones ahls which is an intraspecies qs signal for gram negative bacteria in contrast autoinducer 2 ai 2 signalling is used for interspecies communication for both gram negative bacteria and gram positive bacteria with widespread prevalence lee et al 2018 ai 2 has been demonstrated to play an important role in anaerobic metabolic processes xiao et al 2019 and the abundance of ai 2 in suspended biomass was governed primarily by phylum firmicutes in anmbrs moreover the formation of biofilm by gram negative anaerobes e g f nucleatum and p gingivalis was noted to be mainly induced by ai 2 ryu et al 2016 and therefore ai 2 based qq could be unsurprisingly promising in mitigation of multicellular biofilm formation however most of ai 2 based qq studies only cast attention on single species in pure culture or microorganisms in aerobic membrane bioreactors aembrs lee et al 2018 2016 for instances ai 2 based qq restrained the biofilm formation of three ai 2 qs bacteria yb 1 yb 2 and yb 3 isolated from aembrs and two well known ai 2 qs bacteria bb152 and k12 lee et al 2016 furthermore farnesol secreted from c albicans could mitigate the biofilm formation via the suppression of ai 2 qs in an aembr lee et al 2016 more recently ai 2 qq bacterium acinetobacter has been successfully isolated and applied into an aembr for biofouling control and had a higher qq efficiency than that of ahl based qq bacterium lee et al 2018 however there are still left research gaps regarding to the isolation of functional qq microorganisms which can exert ai 2 based qq for biofouling control in anmbrs knowledge of the precise roles of ai 2 based qq for biofouling control in anmbrs is still unenlightened as the complex understanding of ai 2 based qq in anmbrs cannot be extrapolated from that of aembrs due to the subtle difference in bio communities as ai 2 based qs is involved in interspecies microbial communication mechanism and that stubborn biofilm is composed of a wide spectrum of anaerobes rather than single bacterium in anmbrs xu et al 2021 ai 2 based qq regimen is expected to be a next generation anti biofouling strategy the understanding of elusive evolution of biofouling requires both physicochemical and microbial compositions of liquor fraction of mixed liquor i e supernatant in anmbrs which house not only colloidal organics but also keystone planktonic microorganisms such as filamentous anaerolineales and sulfate reducing bacteria srb causing initial colonization on membrane surface and pore blockage yao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 although biofilm formation behaviours of numerous srb are known to be regulated by ai 2 based qs scarascia et al 2016 current understanding is still inadequate to establish a linkage between microbial communities of supernatant and that of biofouling in anmbrs under the impact of ai 2 based qq moreover there is an urgency to decipher the mechanisms of qs qq regulation of organic compositions particle size distribution concentration of microorganisms i e volatile suspended solids vss and microbial communities of supernatant zhou et al 2019 the aims of this study were a enrichment and performance assessment of ai 2 based facultative qq consortium fqq2 for biofouling retardation in a ceramic anmbr b the capture of characteristics of organics and particles within mixed liquor to systematically enlighten the working mechanisms of qq on biofouling retardation from a physiochemical aspect c and the comprehensive understanding of microbial communities in supernatant suspended biomass and biofilm on membrane surface which could trigger to a certain extent thinking of the philosophy of multifaceted deterministic roles of ai 2 based qq qs on the biofouling and treatment performance from a microbial perspective in anmbrs 2 material and methods 2 1 enrichment of ai 2 based facultative qq consortium fqq2 ai 2 based qq is achieved by degradation of 4 5 dihydroxy 2 3 pentanedione dpd carbosynth which is synthesized by luxs and is the sole pre cursor of multiple ai 2 signals lee et al 2018 therefore enrichment of fqq2 was achieved by using dpd as the sole carbon source followed by anaerobic screening and the enrichment process was revised according to a previous study xu et al 2020b briefly activated sludge was collected from a local domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp and seeded into the minimal medium containing 2 mm of dpd after 3 d 10 of enriched culture was transferred to a new minimal medium with the dpd and this process was repeated thrice before the aerobic qq consortium aeqq was harvested anaerobic condition was then provided to aeqq in a serum bottle by sparging a nutrient rich medium and filling up the headspace with n2 before sealing the nutrient rich condition in the serum bottle was provided by supplementing 3 g chemical oxygen demand cod l of acetate sigmaaldrich 99 0 and minimal medium to select for facultative qq microorganisms from aeqq with the expectation of the decrease of strictly aerobic microorganisms the incubation temperature was 30 c and the shaking speed was 200 rpm after around 30d upon which the od600 of aeqq showed no further fluctuations the fqq2 was then harvested after centrifuging 4000xg for 5 min the genomic dna of fqq2 was extracted and sequenced and detailed procedure is found in section 2 5 2 2 dpd degradability of fqq2 with and without the presence of acetate under anaerobic conditions dpd degradation was conducted to preliminarily investigate ai 2 based qq performance of fqq2 possible failure of qq bioaugmentation could result from the degradation of other organics instead of dpd by fqq2 as acetate was considered as a prevalent substrate commonly utilized by anaerobes in anmbrs xu et al 2020b substrates specificity between dpd and acetate as carbon sources was investigated to assess whether presence of acetate could affect the dpd degradability of fqq2 therefore three aliquots of fqq2 with same dosage of 500 mg l were mixed with 1000 ppb of dpd 1000 ppb of dpd plus 1133 ppb of acetate i e having a cod equivalent to 1000 ppb of dpd and 1000 ppb dpd plus 2266 ppb of acetate i e having a cod double that of 1000 ppb of dpd pure dpd and dpd with 500 mg l of inactivated by sterilization fqq2 were prepared as blank and control respectively all batch tests were conducted with three biological repeats all solutions were then sparged with n2 to achieve anaerobic conditions in the serum bottles after 0 5 1 5 4 and 9 h liquid samples were extracted and subjected to derivatization with 2 3 diaminonaphthalene dan sigmaaldrich 98 0 to form dpd dan before analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms details of the lc ms ms analysis can be found in method s1 2 3 ceramic anmbrs set up and operation two parallel lab scale ceramic anmbrs with each consisting of a 6 l anaerobic tank and a 1 17 l submerged membrane tank containing a flat sheet ceramic membrane module with nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and a total surface area of 0 045 m2 were set up fig s1 the hydraulic retention time hrt solid retention time srt and membrane flux of anmbrs were 17 h 50d and 9 l m2 h lmh respectively domestic wastewater collected from wwtp was continuously fed into anmbrs throughout whole experiment and the characteristics of domestic wastewater are listed in table s1 diaphragm pumps were employed with a gas sparging rate of 0 9m3 m2 h to provide shear effect on membrane surface transmembrane pressure tmp was recorded by a digital pressure gauge to assess membrane fouling propensities when tmp reached around 35 kpa the fouled ceramic membrane module was taken offline for cleaning and the operation was continued by using a cleaned one membrane cleaning was conducted by scraping off biofilm and subsequent soaking in a 1 g l sodium hypochlorite solution followed by soaking in a 2 g l citric acid solution anmbrs achieved steady state conditions after about 60 d from the start up based on mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss cod removal and methane yield oxidation reduction potential of mixed liquor was continuously monitored with a hach probeless meters after steady state was achieved by the anmbrs 50 ml of empty hydrogel beads which were fabricated according to xu et al 2020b were dosed into both r1 and r2 and tmp was monitored to investigate whether r1 and r2 had similar filtration performance during the baseline phase after 24 d i e the start of experiment phase new empty beads were added to replace the empty beads in r1 at the same time empty beads in r2 were replaced by an equal amount of qq beads in r2 in which fqq2 were entrapped by using the method described in xu et al 2020b and the dosage of fqq2 was 30 mg fqq2 l total reactor volume 2 4 sample preparation and physiochemical analyses preparation of various fractions of mixed liquor and the fouling related physiochemical characterizations used are summarized in fig s2 briefly the liquor fraction of the mixed liquor in the anmbrs is defined as the supernatant which was obtained from centrifugation of mixed liquor at 9000xg for 10 min the smp i e dissolved fraction of supernatant was further obtained by filtration of the supernatant through 0 45 μm mce membranes the eps was extracted from the residual biomass using the heat method capillary suction time cst of mixed liquor was measured by a cst apparatus proteins and carbohydrates of the supernatant smp and eps were quantified by the modified lowry protein assay and dubois method respectively xu et al 2020b liquid chromatography organic carbon detector lcocd was employed to characterize the dissolved organic matters which constitutes biopolymer with molecular weight mw more than 20 kda and low molecular weight lmw compounds with mw less than 1000 da including humics building blocks lmw acids and lmw neutrals xu et al 2020a eem was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer xu et al 2020a and the measured excitation emission matrix eem of smp n 20 and eps n 20 of both r1 and r2 were subjected to parallel factor parafac modelling to quantify mathematically the deconvoluted fluorescent components yu et al 2014 the detailed procedures are shown in method s2 particle size distribution psd of mixed liquor was analysed using a laser diffraction particle analyser psd of supernatant was evaluated by a zetasizer dead end filtration was conducted to analyse fouling potential of supernatant fig s3 the details of the analysis can be found in method s3 cod mixed liquor suspended solid mlss and mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 cations and anions were quantified using ion chromatography volatile fatty acids vfas including acetic acid butyric acid propionic acid valeric acid isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid were determined by a gc fid the volume of biogas collected in gas bags was measured by syringes and methane content was analysed using a gc bid dpd was extracted and quantified from the permeates of the anmbrs by lc ms ms to investigate the direct effect of ai 2 based qq with details described in method s1 and the recovery rate rr and matrix effect me were conducted for the evaluation of the method performance the two tailed student s t tests including welch s t test were used for statistical analysis of physiochemical parameters 2 5 molecular microbiology characterization the cake layers of r1 and r2 were obtained when tmp exceeded around 35 kpa and its genomic dna was extracted by using a dna isolation kit moreover genomic dna of supernatant and suspended biomass i e mixed liquor without fraction of supernatant of r1 and r2 were extracted during the stable operation period of the experiment phase polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification of both bacterial and archaeal 16s amplicon generation were performed using specific primers of

assigned based on 97 similarity of sequences after quality filtering the statistical difference in relative abundance of microbial taxa were analysed by the two tailed student s t tests analysis of similarity statistics anosim was performed to test the significance of discrepancy amongst bio communities all the raw reads as fastq files were deposited into the ncbi sra database with accession number prjna754324 3 results 3 1 enrichment of fqq2 dpd degradability and microbial population in fqq2 the increase of od600 during the last 2 cycles of the enrichment culture was observed which was suggestive of the successful cultivation of aeqq fig s4a and it was further demonstrated by the capability of dpd degradation by aeqq under aerobic condition fig s4b fqq2 was harvested after anaerobic screening of aeqq where the od600 decreased to a stable value implying the decrease of the strictly aerobic microorganisms fig s4c of note 96 96 of degradation of dpd by the fqq2 in 9 h showed its high efficiency in inactivation of ai 2 fig 1 a while fqq2 could deplete acetate within 0 5 h fig s5 the results showed that acetate with same or double amount of dpd as cod did not affect the overall removal of dpd by the fqq2 fig 1 a microbial composition of the fqq2 was determined to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of its qq competence the majorities of the fqq2 were composed of acinetobacter comamonas klebsiella serratia stenotrophomonas and thauera with abundance of 1 16 9 18 28 15 14 13 7 88 and 2 39 respectively fig 1 b several microbial genera were suggested to have potential ai 2 based qq abilities table s2 specifically acinetobacter is likely a facultative anaerobe and it can release hydrophilic ai 2 qq compounds mw 400 da moreover the addition of acinetobacter entrapped beads remarkably reduced membrane biofouling via decreasing dpd concentration lee et al 2018 furthermore facultative stenotrophomonas could inhibit ai 2 activity via the production of cis 9 octadecenoic acid singh et al 2013 venkidusamy and megharaj 2016 widmer et al 2007 additionally introduction of ai 2 as substrate could promote the growth of comamonas under anaerobic condition zhou et al 2021 which was suggestive of its qq ability therefore multiple potential qq microbial genera within the fqq2 were suggested to be responsible for the high degradation of dpd although there was no information regarding the ai 2 based qq ability of klebsiella serratia and thauera in literature therefore how individual microbial populations participated in the degradation of dpd needs to be further examined by applying function driven genomic approaches overall this study was the first to propose a facultative qq candidate pool for ai 2 based qs disruption via effective decomposition of dpd under anaerobic conditions the high degradation of dpd achieved by fqq2 which was not affected by the presence of acetate inferred that fqq2 could be served as a promising and implementable qq technique for anmbrs 3 2 treatment performance of ceramic anmbrs ai 2 based qq did not affect the mlvss with 7 81 1 01 g l and 7 90 1 01 g l in r1 and r2 respectively p 0 35 table s3 however a higher cod removal of r2 86 57 4 48 as compared to that of r1 82 14 6 59 p 0 05 was observed fig 2 a moreover sulfate removal of r2 64 08 13 72 was statistically lower by 16 1 p 0 05 in comparison with that in r1 74 42 7 72 fig 3 a the reduced removal of sulfate could lead to the improvement of methanogenic activities chen et al 2008 and it is aligned with the experimental observations that methane yield was significantly enhanced by 62 5 in r2 p 0 05 in the presence of qq fig 2 b although related there was no statistical difference of accumulated acetate i e the only vfa detected in smp between r1 and r2 p 0 224 fig s6 matrix effect referred to the difference of quantitative response of lc ms ms for dpd dan in standard solution versus that in a biological matrix i e permeate of anmbrs in this study it was noteworthy that excellent comparability between recovery rate of dpd and the matrix effect was observed p 0 15 table s4 this suggested that signal suppression due to the matrix effect of 89 24 from the permeate could be the main cause leading to the recovery rate of 85 31 and the high recovery of dpd demonstrated that the direct quantification of dpd dan derived from dpd in the permeate of anmbrs by lc ms ms without pre treatment e g solid phase extraction is acceptable dpd concentration of the permeate was significantly reduced by 27 8 p 0 05 in the presence of qq fig 3 b which was indicative of a successful ai 2 based qq in degrading dpd in the anmbr treating domestic wastewater 3 3 filtration performance and physiochemical properties of mixed liquor of ceramic anmbrs 3 3 1 the effect of qq on filtration performance tmp profiles were established for r1 and r2 during the baseline phase r1 and r2 had rather similar average period of fouling cycles of 6 66 d and 5 95 d respectively p 0 26 fig s7 after the introduction of qq beads i e experiment phase qq significantly extended the average membrane operation period of the anmbr by 3 72 times p 0 05 fig 2 c r2 achieved a substantially longer membrane operation period of 22 95 3 71 d as compared to r1 with a shorter membrane operation period of 6 17 2 95 d the tmp profile clearly illustrated ai 2 based qq could mitigate membrane biofouling which could offer potential lower costs and energy savings for anmbrs 3 3 2 the effect of qq on eps and smp the concentration of proteins of the eps of suspended biomass was significantly reduced by 24 1 in the presence of qq p 0 05 with average concentrations of 19 74 4 72 mg g vss and 14 9 4 09 mg g vss in r1 and r2 respectively fig 4 a however qq did not induce statistical change in the concentration of carbohydrates in the eps p 0 16 with similar carbohydrates content of 2 31 0 89 mg g vss and 2 07 0 90 mg g vss in r1 and r2 respectively fig 4 b the results were strongly associated to the observation that qq reduced the protein content of biopolymer in the eps by 26 52 p 0 05 while there was no statistical difference in the carbohydrate content of biopolymer in the eps fig s8a the organic fingerprints were revealed by the eem parafac identifying a total of six unique fluorescent components of the eps fig s9 and table s5 several aromatic and soluble microbial by product like proteins i e c1 eps c3 eps and c4 eps had high fluorescence intensities than other components of both r1 and r2 table 1 of note qq was found to lead to the statistical reduction of fulvic acid like and humic substances c2 eps tyrosine like aromatic and soluble microbial by product like protein c4 eps and aromatic protein c5 eps of eps p 0 05 overall qq was implicated to reduce protein content of eps according to results of the modified lowry protein assay the lcocd and the eem parafac as dewaterability of mixed liquor measured by cst could be crucially correlated to the content of organics of eps of suspended biomass xu et al 2020a the lower protein concentration in the eps in the presence of qq probably resulted in the lower cst values in r2 in comparison with those of r1 fig 3 c qq resulted in a reduction of the concentration of proteins in the smp by 19 1 p 0 05 whereby the concentrations were 3 28 1 40 mg g vss and 4 05 1 37 mg g vss in r1 and r2 respectively fig 4 c however there was no statistical difference in the concentration of carbohydrates in the smp between r1 0 86 0 38 mg g vss and r2 0 78 0 32 mg g vss p 0 184 fig 4 d these results could be evidenced by the reduction in protein content of biopolymer in the smp by 12 58 in the presence of qq p 0 05 while the carbohydrates of biopolymer were not statistically affected fig s8b noticeably qq induced the abatement of concentration of the lmw compounds by 8 13 p 0 05 of r2 in comparison with that of r1 eem parafac modelling showed that the smp of both r1 and r2 were mainly comprised of three fluorescent compounds and the aromatic and soluble microbial by product like protein c1 smp was dominant fig s10 and tables s6 and 1 moreover the fluorescence intensity of c1 smp was statistically reduced in the presence of qq by 10 5 p 0 05 table 1 this observation was related to the reduction of protein concentrations in the smp by qq as revealed by the modified lowry protein assay and lcocd however qq could be less effective in decreasing other fluorescent compounds such as protein like and fulvic acid like substances c2 smp as well as the humic acid like compounds c3 smp 3 3 3 the effect of qq on supernatant difference in the appearance of the supernatants of r1 and r2 was observed fig s11 and the effects of qq on the characteristics of supernatant including concentrations of organics as well as planktonic microorganisms and the fouling potential of supernatant were holistically investigated there was statistical difference in the protein content of the supernatant between r1 and r2 with 14 24 2 93 mg g vss and 9 69 2 61 mg g vss respectively p 0 05 fig 4 c moreover qq significantly reduced the carbohydrate content of the supernatant by 25 4 p 0 05 with carbohydrate contents of 3 31 1 23 mg g vss and 2 47 0 89 mg g vss in r1 and r2 respectively fig 4 d the suspended solid ss and volatile suspended solid vss within the supernatant were quantified the vss ss ratios of the supernatant were found to be approximately 90 for both reactors table s3 which indicated that the suspended particles in the supernatant were mainly comprised of planktonic microorganisms the average concentration of planktonic microorganisms in the supernatant i e vss in r2 was found to be significantly lower p 0 05 as compared to that of r1 with 0 20 0 09 g l and 0 12 0 03 g l in r1 and r2 respectively fig 3 d moreover the ratio of vss of the supernatant to mlvss in r2 was lower compared to that of r1 p 0 05 implying the lower number of microorganisms present in the supernatant of the mixed liquor induced by qq table s3 the results provided clues underpinning the psd of mixed liquor where there was lower percentage of volume of particles in r2 than that of r1 ranging from 0 to 10 µm a typical range of particles in the supernatant of anmbrs xu et al 2020a zhou et al 2019 although there was a similar unimodal dominant peak 33 µm observed in both r1 and r2 fig s12a particles and organics with difference sizes in the supernatant had distinct fouling behaviours xu et al 2020a therefore although planktonic content of the supernatant was reduced as induced by qq the psd of supernatant under the impact of qq needs to be analysed the psd of supernatant of r1 showed a dominant peak with size near 568 nm while a bimodal distribution was observed in the psd of supernatant in r2 fig s12b the first peak was with particulate sizes around 267 nm and the second peak of particulates with size of approximately 1209 nm noticeably the intensity of particles with sizes near 100 nm was reduced in the supernatant of r2 as compared to r1 fig s12b which could potentially lead to the decrease of pore blocking as pore blockage could be mainly attributed to particles and organics with size similar to the pore size of the ceramic membrane in this study 100 nm xu et al 2020a dead end filtration was used to investigate the fouling behaviour of the supernatant of r1 and r2 the time required for the filtration of similar volume of supernatant of r2 were shorter than that of the supernatant of r1 fig s13 which directly proved that the supernatant of r2 had a reduced fouling propensity in comparison with that of r1 furthermore lower cake layer resistance and pore blocking resistance induced by qq was observed after dead end filtration which was suggestive of the capability of qq to decrease cake layer formation and pore blockage in the anmbr fig s14 3 4 the effect of qq on taxonomic compositions of suspended biomass supernatant and cake layer of ceramic anmbrs 3 4 1 the effect of qq on bio communities of suspended biomass mixed liquor without supernatant the relative abundance of major microbial genera i e with relative abundance greater than 1 at least in one sample in suspended biomass of r1 and r2 was shown in fig 5 of note major ai 2 genera including christensenellaceae g hyphomicrobium leucobacter and microbacterium were found in suspended biomass in r1 and r2 table 2 it is not surprising that an abatement of ai 2 by the fqq2 might disrupt the metabolic activity of ai 2 genera which in turn resulted in the decrease of abundance of these ai 2 genera in the suspended biomass xiao et al 2019 table 2 and therefore it could lead to the statistical community dissimilarities of suspended biomass between r1 and r2 fig 5 and table s7 xiao et al 2019 this could be correlated to the anosim which showed that there was statistical microbial difference in the suspended biomass between r1 and r2 p 0 05 table s8 specifically christensenellaceae g belongs to firmicutes and the ai 2 level was demonstrated to be governed primarily by firmicutes in an anmbrs xiao et al 2019 several genera of christensenellaceae g contained rbsb gene copies which could be regulated by ai 2 based qs coil et al 2020 noticeably there was statistically 48 48 lower abundance of christensenellaceae g in the suspended biomass of r2 1 86 0 54 than that of r1 3 61 0 55 p 0 05 fig 5 and table 2 this agreed with the observation that the abundance of firmicutes declined from 11 21 to 8 58 in the suspended biomass p 0 05 in the presence of qq in r2 fig s15 moreover hyphomicrobium which was found to harbour ai 2 genes sun et al 2019 could be a key genus to form compact biofilm by production of eps tian et al 2021 there was statistically 76 56 lower abundance of hyphomicrobium in the suspended biomass in r2 0 30 0 15 than that of r1 1 28 0 29 p 0 05 fig 5 and table 2 furthermore there was statistically 66 03 lower abundance of leucobacter in r2 0 56 0 11 than that of r1 1 59 0 18 p 0 05 fig 5 and table 2 ai 2 was suggested to be yielded by leucobacter and it stimulated qq related protease activity of v cholerae sela et al 2021 additionally microbacterium which has the capability to possess ai 2 based qs activity could be strongly associated to biofouling via smp production wu and lee 2012 zhou et al 2021 statistically lower abundance by 59 26 of microbacterium in the suspended biomass in r2 0 77 0 15 than that of r1 1 89 0 32 p 0 05 was observed fig 5 and table 2 the repression of methane production by srb which compete with archaea for metabolic substrates is a persistent barrier to anmbrs chen et al 2008 especially for treatment of wastewater containing high amount of sulfate intriguingly the relative abundance of srb desulfomonile was reduced by 37 93 in the suspended biomass of r2 1 26 0 65 as compared to that of r1 2 03 0 26 p 0 05 fig 5 which could inevitably contribute to the lower sulfate removal of r2 fig 3 a noticeably proteins homologous to luxs for ai 2 synthase and luxp for ai 2 receptors were demonstrated to be present in many srb such as desulfovibrio and desulfotomaculum scarascia et al 2016 moreover it was possible that ai 2 based qs might be involved in induction of dsra li et al 2007 which was harboured within desulfomonile that potentially regulates the production of sulfate reductive enzyme kondo et al 2006 lin et al 2020 therefore ai 2 based qq was suggested to induce lower sulfate removal via regulation of desulfomonile in the suspended biomass however this study did not indicate that ai 2 based qq could directly affect the growth or activities of desulfomonile in the suspended biomass and future studies will be required to evaluate the complicated mechanisms of srbs under the impact of ai 2 based qq via metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analysis 3 4 2 the effect of qq on bio communities of supernatant although the proportion of microorganisms in the supernatant constitutes less than 3 as compared to those in the mixed liquor of both r1 and r2 table s3 supernatant harboured considerable quantities of planktonic microorganisms which could unavoidably exacerbate membrane biofouling in anmbrs especially the initial biofouling zhou et al 2019 anosim showed that there was no statistical microbial composition discrepancy of supernatant between r1 and r2 p 0 2 table s8 which could mainly attributed to similar major genera in both r1 and r2 including anaerolineaceae g p 0 09 anaerovorax p 0 34 candidatus cloacimonas p 0 23 christensenellaceae g p 0 38 rikenellaceae g p 0 10 thermovirga p 0 44 and verrucomicrobiae g p 0 41 fig 5 and table s7 noticeably the most abundant anaerolineaceae g was affiliated with filamentous bacterium in both r1 and r2 and was demonstrated as a key bacterial taxa contributing to the massive accumulation on membrane surface of an anmbr yao et al 2020 however the relative abundance of other major genera in supernatant was different between r1 and r2 specifically sulfurovum was another abundant genus in supernatant of r1 with relative abundance of 6 64 while the relative abundance of sulfurovum was conspicuously reduced to 0 15 in the supernatant of r2 p 0 05 fig 5 and table 2 it can be supported by the fact that sulfurovum is an ai 2 regulated bacteria where luxs gene is expressed during its growth pérez rodríguez et al 2015 moreover the relative abundance of desulfomonile and leptolinea were reduced in the presence of qq in the supernatant of r2 by 45 47 and 46 52 respectively as compared to those in r1 p 0 05 table s7 3 4 3 the effect of qq on bio communities of cake layer there were major genera of anaerolineaceae g 13 75 anaerovorax 3 65 caldisericum 2 13 christensenellaceae g 1 77 desulfomonile 7 99 lactivibrio 1 18 leptolinea 1 52 leucobacter 1 05 rikenellaceae g 1 60 sulfurovum 4 65 thermovirga 1 05 and methanosaeta 3 89 in the cake layer of r1 fig 5 and table s7 of note anaerolineaceae g could produce organic fouling and biofouling concurrently and it contributed relative abundance of 13 75 4 59 and 14 06 1 34 to the cake layers of r1 and r2 p 0 46 respectively which was suggestive of its high fouling potential in both anmbrs yao et al 2020 however there were statistically lower abundance of anaerovorax 2 05 christensenellaceae g 1 22 lactivibrio 0 51 leucobacter 0 51 sulfurovum 0 61 thermovirga 0 68 and methanosaeta 1 57 in the cake layer in r2 as compared to those of r1 p 0 05 fig 5 which was in agreement with that there was statistically microbial difference of cake layer between r1 and r2 as revealed by anosim p 0 05 table s8 4 discussion 4 1 potential intricate mechanisms of the enhanced methane yield in ceramic anmbrs the result highlighted that ai 2 based qq could enhance methane production although the relative abundance of major archaeal genera such as methanobacterium p 0 09 and methanosaeta p 0 10 were not statistically changed in the suspended biomass of r2 as compared to that r1 fig 5 herein mechanisms of regulation of methane production by qq was postulated concretely ai 2 based qq induced the low abundance of desulfomonile in the suspended biomass p 0 05 and thus induced a poorer removal of sulfate p 0 05 figs 3 a and 5 the low sulfate reduction could be strongly associated to the enhanced methane production chen et al 2008 as srb could compete with fermentative microorganisms which would inevitably diminish the anaerobic digestion efficiency yuan and zhu 2016 it was consistent with the higher cod removal induced by qq in r2 as compared to r1 suggesting higher substrate degradation and utilization fig 2 a furthermore srb e g desulfomonile could compete with hydrogenotrophic methanogens and aceticlastic methanogens for both hydrogen and acetate as electron acceptors chen et al 2008 and the low abundance of desulfomonile in the suspended biomass of r2 fig 5 implied that the additional carbonaceous organics in r2 could be converted to methane via methanogenesis as compared to r1 moreover the sulfate reduction could lead to the production of sulfide which would be toxic to archaeal communities chen et al 2008 and therefore the low sulfate reduction could favour archaeal activities in anmbrs in sum the enhanced methane production induced by qq was correlated to the diminished substrate competition by the sulfate reduction process however considerable effort is still needed to track the influence of ai 2 based qq on functional genes and activities of keystone microorganisms involved in treatment performance of anmbrs 4 2 why did ai 2 based qq retard membrane biofouling in the ceramic anmbrs 4 2 1 physicochemical and microbial perspectives of suspended biomass qq could altered fouling related characteristics of the eps of suspended biomass the supernatant and the smp which are vital for biofouling formation in ceramic anmbrs this study underpinned the hypothesis that external fqq2 played a key role in reducing the content of protein in the eps as revealed by the modified lowry protein assay the lcocd and the eem parafac figs 4 a 4 b and s8a and table 1 as the preponderance of ai 2 has been demonstrated to strengthen interspecific qs communication and a higher eps production of microorganisms could be regulated by ai 2 ding et al 2015 lee et al 2016 the lower eps production of the suspended biomass in r2 could be mainly attributed to the lower dpd concentration repressed by ai 2 based qq p 0 05 fig 3 b moreover reduction of ai 2 by the fqq2 could result in the decrease of abundance of ai 2 genera in the suspended biomass via the disruption of their metabolic activity xiao et al 2019 therefore from a microbial aspect the reduced eps of the suspended biomass could be attributed to the lower abundance of ai 2 regulated genera e g christensenellaceae g hyphomicrobium leucobacter and microbacterium in the suspended biomass in r2 as compared to those of r1 figs 4 a 4 b and 5 and table 2 the conspicuously reduced biofouling of r2 could be attributed to the substantial decrease in the proteins of the eps as eps had high adhesion ability and protein content of eps made the anaerobic suspended biomass sticky favouring the adhesion of suspended biomass on membrane surface teng et al 2020 xu et al 2020a moreover fqq2 would result in a longer period required to trigger the qs activities i e qs signal to reach a threshold level of these ai 2 regulated microorganisms in the suspended biomass for their eps production and the attachment colonization for biofilm formation on membrane surface xu et al 2021 yeon et al 2009 therefore the lower qs activities of christensenellaceae g and leucobacter in the suspended biomass could result in the lower abundance of christensenellaceae g by 31 07 and leucobacter by 51 43 in the cake layer and contribute to the overall lower fouling rate by qq fig 5 and table s7 noticeably filamentous anaerolineaceae g which occupied 31 07 and 27 30 of suspended biomass in r1 and r2 p 0 21 respectively could be regulated by ahls based qs in anmbrs and found to play significant roles in the fouling evolution fig 5 and table s7 tabraiz et al 2020 yao et al 2020 therefore from a practical consideration it is imperative to dose additional ahl based qq to compensate for potential deficiency of sole ai 2 based qq in anmbrs 4 2 2 physicochemical and microbial perspectives of supernatant the reduced concentration of proteins in the supernatant i e liquor fraction of mixed liquor could be partially attributed to the lower eps of suspended biomass induced by qq as the liquor fraction i e supernatant including smp could be released from the eps of suspended biomass kim et al 2001 xu et al 2020a it could be corroborated by the similarity of identification of proteins between the dissolved portion of the supernatant i e smp and the eps figs s9 and s10 and tables s5 and s6 noticeably dominant soluble microbial by product like protein c1 smp could be excreted from the main soluble microbial by product like proteins i e c1 eps c3 eps and c4 eps of both r1 and r2 table 1 moreover it could be expected that the reduction of c1 smp induced by qq could be attributed to a reduction in the release of c4 eps of the eps p 0 05 table 1 additionally ai 2 based qs activities of genera such as sulfurovum in the supernatant could be directly affected by the fqq2 fig 5 which might result in the lower organic concentrations in the supernatant of r2 as compared to r1 figs 4 c and 4 d therefore the reduced organics in the supernatant induced by qq could be attributed to the synergistic effects of reduced organic release from the eps and the selective pressure imposed on the ai 2 based qs regulated genera in the supernatant the lower organics i e proteins and carbohydrates in the supernatant could be a plausible explanation for the reduced the fouling potential of the supernatant with ai 2 based qq as revealed by the dead end filtration figs 3 d 4 c 4 d and s13 not only organics but planktons in the supernatant contribute to biofilm formation in anmbrs yao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 although the biomass concentration i e vss in the supernatant only contributed less than 3 of the mlvss table s3 planktons or small floc with high specific eps content per surface area could significantly impact initial biofilm formation and alter the membrane surface inducing cake layer formation i e tmp rise xu et al 2020a therefore the substantially lower planktonic content found in the supernatant induced by qq fig 3 d in this study would inevitably reduce the potential of biofouling formation of the supernatant which is in consistent with the lower cake layer resistance revealed by dead end filtration of the supernatant fig s14 additionally according to the microbial source tracking calculation planktonic microorganisms in the supernatant could be an important source 22 6 for the bio community of cake layer yao et al 2020 concretely the relative abundance of sulfurovum in the cake layer was statistically higher than that in the suspended biomass p 0 05 but comparable to those in the supernatant of r1 p 0 30 fig 5 therefore the sulfurovum with relative abundance of 4 65 in the cake layer of r1 was implicated to be from supernatant in r1 of note ai 2 regulated sulfurovum could produce excess eps as it has been demonstrated to play vital roles in the formation of both initial and mature biofouling in a ceramic anmbr xu et al 2021 therefore the reduced abundance of sulfurovum in the supernatant by qq resulted in the lower abundance of sulfurovum of the cake layer by 86 88 furthermore considering the potential disruption of qs activities of sulfurovum by fqq2 the retarded eps production of sulfurovum on membrane surface could contribute to the overall lower fouling rate of r2 as compared to r1 fig 5 moreover considering that desulfomonile has a strong attachment ability cutter et al 2003 and srb in the supernatant was suggested to involved in initial colonization on membrane surface in anmbrs zhou et al 2019 the reduced abundance of desulfomonile in the supernatant of r2 by 45 47 p 0 05 explains the reason for the reduced biofouling observed in r2 fig 5 the protein content of the dissolved portion of the supernatant i e smp especially the soluble microbial by product like protein c1 smp was reduced in the presence of qq p 0 05 fig 4 c and table 1 of note according to thermodynamic analyses there was extremely high adhesive ability and specific filtration resistance of smps over suspended biomass teng et al 2019 therefore the reduced content of proteins in smp could lead to improved characteristics of biomass in the presence of fqq2 moreover as the biopolymers in the smp could be mainly retained by membranes jiang et al 2010 the reduced biopolymer content of the smp in the presence of qq would contributed to the lower fouling rate of ceramic anmbr fig s8b pore blocking resistance was reported to be highly correlated to the lmw compounds in smp jiang et al 2010 therefore the lower concentration of lmw compounds by qq p 0 05 could lead to the reduced prevalence of pore constriction possibly attributable to adsorption of organics on the membrane internal pore walls fig s8b moreover the reduced intensity of particles with sizes closed to 100 nm i e pore size of ceramic membrane in the supernatant of r2 as compared to r1 was also suggested to minimise occurrence of pore constriction of ceramic membrane fig s12b this result was in consistent with lower pore blocking resistance revealed by dead end filtration of the supernatant induced by qq fig s14 moreover it suggested that the retarded membrane fouling is also attributed to reduced prevalence of pore constriction fig 2 c 5 conclusion this study is the first to propose a facultative ai 2 based qq consortium comprising of acinetobacter comamonas and stenotrophomonas fqq2 prolonged membrane filtration operation by an average of 3 72 times in the ceramic anmbr treating domestic wastewater the retarded membrane fouling could result from the decrease of protein content of the eps of the suspended biomass by qq it might be attributed to the reduction of abundance of ai 2 based genera e g christensenellaceae g hyphomicrobium leucobacter and microbacterium in the suspended biomass moreover lower abundance of christensenellaceae g and leucobacter in the cake layer was observed in the presence of qq which was suggestive of their lower attachment ability for biofilm formation qq induced a lower concentration of plankton and organics in the supernatant which reduced its fouling potential moreover a lower abundance of planktonic ai 2 regulated sulfurovum in the supernatant could also induce lower biofouling which was evidenced by the lower abundance of sulfurovum in the cake layer in the presence of qq the enhancement of methane yield could be induced by the lower sulfate reduction which favoured the conversion of substrates to methane in the

16217,the monitoring and prediction of algae cell density are the fundamental supports for eutrophication management as the molecular marker of algae n heptadecane has been successfully utilized to reflect algae biomass in sedimentary studies however whether biogenic n heptadecane bio c17 can be utilized to represent algae cell density dynamics in water environment still remains an issue current study aims to provide novel evidences from both field investigation and laboratory validation for it firstly we found a strinkingly positive correlation between algae cell density dynamics and bio c17 variations p 4 34 10 10 via meta analysis using field dataset in lake chaohu then we selected microcystis aeruginosa chlorella vulgaris and melosira sp as model species of cyanobacteria green algae and diatom respectively for laboratory validation our results illustrated that n heptadecane was synchronized with the growth for cyanobacteria and green algae but not for diatom the association between bio c17 and algae cell density was species dependent and the relationship between bio c17 and cell density was linear within 107 cells ml 1 therefore we established and optimized a generalized additive model to fit observed algae cell density in lake chaohu in the optimal model bio c17 pielou evenness index j and shannon wiener index h were included totally explaining 66 of the variance of algae cell density model comparisons revealed that considering algae community could indeed improve the interpretation of algae cell density in natural environment in conclusion our study provided

we designed a longitudinal experiment to monitor the variations of bio c17 with algae growth algae community analysis revealed that cyanobacteria and green algae were two main phyla accounting for over 70 of the total species in lake chaohu whereas diatom were found to have certain abundance in winter jiang et al 2014 here we selected microcystis aeruginosa fachb 1319 chlorella vulgaris fachb 1227 and melosira sp fachb 1946 as model species of cyanobacteria green algae and diatom respectively to simulate and validate the dynamic relationship between algae cell density and the content of bio c17 by a longitudinal design algae were purchased from freshwater algae culture collection at institute of hydrobiology wuhan china all algae species were cultured in bg11 csi media their ingredients were shown in table s1 purchased algae were acclimatized in bg11 csi media for three generations then each algae species was inoculated for formal batch culture experiment the initial algae cell density for all species was set at approximately 105 for diatom to 106 for cyanobacteria and green alge cells l 1 and the initial volume of culture solution was approximately 1200 ml with the growth of algae 5 to 100 ml culture solution were sampled every certain days the experiment lasted for 107 days and 20 panels were investigated algae were separated by filtering sampled culture

lichen xps 8cav optical digital biological microscope shanghai lichen bx instrument technology co ltd shanghai china bio c17 was investigated following our previously reported procedures he et al 2020 with some modifications concretely filtered algae samples were dried at room temperature packaged with aluminum and stored in a desiccator before analysis before extraction the gff was packaged into a

as blank control both culturing and sampling processes were under sterilized condition before sampling the solution was shaken evenly to guarantee the representativeness of the sample algae cell density for each sample was counted for two repetitions qa qc for the instrument analysis of bio c17 shared same criterions with those reported in our previous study he et al 2020 please see text s2 for details 2 4 statistical analysis generalized additive model gam was conducted to fit observed algae cell density in lake chaohu with bio c17 j and h in this study according to table 1 all variables are normally or lognormally distributed therefore a gam with gaussian distribution family was applied in this study the basic nonlinear full model was defined as formula 1 1 lo g 10 y b 0 s x i e where y refers to the algae cell density b 0 is the intercept x i indicates independent variables concerned in this study including bio c17 j and h in this model the logarithms log10 of bio c17 was employed e stands for random error s denotes thin plate penalized spline smooth to avoid overfitting analysis of variance anova was utilized to simply the model using chi square test and the significance level was set at 0 05 with a null hypothesis of no difference between linear and nonlinear treatments the result showed that bio c17 could be simplified as linear regression p 0 09553 0 05 hence the simplified full model was expressed as formula 2 2 lo g 10 y b 0 b 1 lo g 10 bio c 17 s x j e where b 1 stands for the linear regression coefficient of lo g 10 bio c 17 x j denotes algae community variables of j and h the model was implemented via the mgcv package version 1 8 31 on the platform of r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 in this study enter approach was conducted to select the optimal model with minimal value of akaike information criteria aic anova was applied to ensure the significance of an independent variable in the model using chi square test and the significance level was also set at 0 05 with the null hypothesis of ignorable independent variable added 3 results and discussion 3 1 association between algae cell density and bio c17 in lake chaohu the datasets of algae cell density and bio c17 were both lognormally distributed table 1 in lake chaohu the logarithms of algae cell density ranged from 4 00 to 7 99 cells l 1 log10 with geometric mean gm of 6 16 0 90 cells l 1 gm geometric standard deviation logsd while the logarithms of bio c17 ranged from 0 07 to 3 54 ng l 1 with gm of 2 06 0 70 ng l 1 surprisingly we found that during the four seasons algae cell density had strikingly positive correlation with bio c17 p 4 34 10 10 and 40 7 of the variance of algae cell density was explained by bio c17 fig 1 it indicated that bio c17 was a potential proxy to represent dynamic changes of algae cell density in lake at seasonal resolution level 3 2 variations of bio c17 with algae growth in laboratory culturing fig 2 a shows the growth curves of different algae species within 107 days the cell densities of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris gradually elevated an order of magnitude from approximately 2 106 cells ml 1 to 3 107 cells ml 1 however the cell density of melosira sp only increased from approximately 8 104 cells ml 1 to 3 105 cells ml 1 within 60 days and gradually decreased later fig 2b shows the variations of the corresponding bio c17 for different algae species for microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris under same culture conditions of humidity temperature and light intensity with the enhancement of algae cell density the concentration of bio c17 was also synchronously increased within approximately 60 days however with the cell density elevated further after 60 days the concentration of bio c17 did not increased but remained or declined posing an apparent asynchronism with algae cell density actually current cell counting method we used can only obtain the total number of algae cells and cannot distinguish living and dead cells in lag and logarithmic phases algae were dominated by living cells while the fraction of living cells greatly declined in stationary and decline phases therefore the remained or declined variations of bio c17 after 60 days might be related to the variations of living algae cells of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris different from microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris bio c17 posed an absolutely low level 0 1 ng ml 1 on average throughout the whole culturing experiment for melosira sp it implied that n heptadecane may not be produced by diatom which is in accordance with previous reference tolosa et al 2008 fig 2c shows the selected ion monitoring chromatogram on the 39th culturing day for microcystis aeruginosa melosira sp and chlorella vulgaris compared to negative control medium only microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris both showed significant carbon preference at n heptadecane besides microcystis aeruginosa also showed an obvious content of n octadecane and the ratio of n octadecane to n heptadecane fluctuated around 1 3 fig s3 however the chromatogram of melosira sp showed no significant carbon preference at n heptadecane and the content of c16 to c18 were at similar level with negative control this result demonstrated that cyanobacteria and green algae can generate n heptadecane and n heptadecane is not the product of diatom to quatify the associations between bio c17 and algae cell density the panel data were divided into two parts within 50 days and exceed 50 days to avoid the effect of declined cells the associations between algae cell density and bio c17 for the species of microcystis aeruginosa melosira sp and chlorella vulgaris were illustrated in fig 3 within 50 days the cell densities of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris both showed significantly linear relationship with bio c17 but this association was species specific the linear regression coefficients of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris were 0 0838 0 0019 106 cells ng 1 average standard deviation s d and 0 2309 0 0540 106 cells ng 1 respectively the linear range of this relationship for algae cell density was within 107 cells ml 1 which covered the cell density range in lake chaohu jiang et al 2014 therefore bio c17 can be utilized to represent the dynamic changes of cyanobacteria and green algae in natural aquatic environment however the species dependent relations between cyanobacteria green algae and bio c17 illustrated that algae community should also be considered for better prediction of algae cell density in natural aquatic environment 3 3 generalized additive model considering the limited explained variance of algae cell density just 40 7 interpreted by bio c17 only fig 1 and species specific associations between bio c17 and algae cell density fig 3 algae community was considered to improve the explained variance of algae cell density in lake chaohu fig 4 shows the prediction of algae cell density using multiple gams as shown in fig 4a with multiple variables entered the model successively the cumulative explained variance of algae cell density elevated from 0 gam0 intercept only to 66 gam3 all variables 40 7 7 3 and 18 of the variance of algae cell density was explained by bio c17 h and j respectively the full model gam3 was selected as the optimal model because of its lowest aic value among all models fig 4b the linear and nonlinear estimations of the optimal model were summarized in table s3 and table s4 respectively the nonlinear response curves and residual analysis were shown in fig s4 and fig s5 respectively the results showed that there were no obvious patterns between residuals and variables fig s5a and the prediction errors for 70 of samples were within 0 5 log10 unit fig s5b all parameters were significant p 0 05 table s3 and table s4 for smooth terms the k indexes were larger than 1 and the p values were large enough table s4 indicating the basis dimensions for nonlinear smooth were adequate therefore the optimized model was robust and the estimated results were reliable the total explained variance of algae cell density in the optimal model was 66 which was greatly elevated by considering algae community or j and h fig 4a it proved that considering algae community can indeed improve the interpretation of algae cell density in natural environment which is mutually verified with the results of our laboratory batch experiments however in this study only two integrated variables j and h were used to describe the evenness and diversity of algae community in lake chaohu more detailed information was limited recently a novel environmental dna edna metabarcoding technic was developed to rapidly and accurately constitute the zooplankton community in a certain environment yang and zhang 2020 yang et al 2018 in this study we confirmed that the synthetic rate of bio c17 per cell was species dependent fig 3 accordingly bio c17 combined with species information obtained via edna metabarcoding technic could be developed in future study to develop a more precise and convenient model for the prediction of algae cell density in natural environment zhang 2019 liu et al 2020 although the variance of algae cell density was well explained by optimized gam there still remains 34 of unexplained variance fig 4 firstly one possible reason is from the investigation errors the algae cell density was determined by concentrating 10 to 20 l raw water into approximately 50 ml and take 100 random fields from several microliter algae solution to count using microscope jiang et al 2014 it was tolerable that this classical method may lead to some technical biases due to the nonuniformity of taking just several microliter algae concentrates for observation and the complex morphology of algae such as agglomeration and overlaying moreover some small algae were inevitably leaked out when filtering raw water through the plankton net jiang et al 2014 resulting in an underestimation of algae cell density one the other hand the normal uncertainty of bio c17 analysis can also contribute to the unexplained variance he et al 2020 besides the cell density of diatom fig 2 and some other species blumer et al 1971 could not be characterized by bio c17 in lake chaohu cyanobacteria were the absolute dominant species in summer while the increase of diatom occurred in winter jiang et al 2014 therefore insert other biomarkers such as biogenic silica liu et al 2019 to the model might further elevate the explained variance secondly the unexplained variance might also come from the complicated species species and species environment interactions that are impractical to describe in gam kim et al 2020 jöhnk et al 2008 kromkamp et al 1989 4 conclusion in current study the issue if bio c17 can be utilized to represent algae cell density dynamics in lake was studied field investigation showed algae cell density had strikingly positive correlation with bio c17 during all seasons in lake chaohu laboratory batch culturing experiments validated that bio c17 was synchronized with the growth of cyanobacteria and green algae but the relation between algae cell density and bio c17 was species dependent the relationship between bio c17 and algae cell density was linear within 107 cells ml 1 optimized generalized additive model illustrated that considering algae community variables j and h could result in a better prediction of algae cell density in natural water environment in conclusion this study gave novel evidences that bio c17 can be utilized to represent the cell density dynamics of cyanobacteria and green algae in water environment however

16217,the monitoring and prediction of algae cell density are the fundamental supports for eutrophication management as the molecular marker of algae n heptadecane has been successfully utilized to reflect algae biomass in sedimentary studies however whether biogenic n heptadecane bio c17 can be utilized to represent algae cell density dynamics in water environment still remains an issue current study aims to provide novel evidences from both field investigation and laboratory validation for it firstly we found a strinkingly positive correlation between algae cell density dynamics and bio c17 variations p 4 34 10 10 via meta analysis using field dataset in lake chaohu then we selected microcystis aeruginosa chlorella vulgaris and melosira sp as model species of cyanobacteria green algae and diatom respectively for laboratory validation our results illustrated that n heptadecane was synchronized with the growth for cyanobacteria and green algae but not for diatom the association between bio c17 and algae cell density was species dependent and the relationship between bio c17 and cell density was linear within 107 cells ml 1 therefore we established and optimized a generalized additive model to fit observed algae cell density in lake chaohu in the optimal model bio c17 pielou evenness index j and shannon wiener index h were included totally explaining 66 of the variance of

cannot distinguish living and dead cells in lag and logarithmic phases algae were dominated by living cells while the fraction of living cells greatly declined in stationary and decline phases therefore the remained or declined variations of bio c17 after 60 days might be related to the variations of living algae cells of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris different from microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris bio c17 posed an absolutely low level 0 1 ng ml 1 on average throughout the whole culturing experiment for melosira sp it implied that n heptadecane may not be produced by diatom which is in accordance with previous reference tolosa et al 2008 fig 2c shows the selected ion monitoring chromatogram on the 39th culturing day for microcystis aeruginosa melosira sp and chlorella vulgaris compared to negative control medium only microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris both showed significant carbon preference at n heptadecane besides microcystis aeruginosa also showed an obvious content of n octadecane and the ratio of n octadecane to n heptadecane fluctuated around 1 3 fig s3 however the chromatogram of melosira sp showed no significant carbon preference at n heptadecane and the content of c16 to c18 were at similar level with negative control this result demonstrated that cyanobacteria and green algae can generate n heptadecane and n heptadecane is not the product of diatom to quatify the associations between bio c17 and algae cell density the panel data were divided into two parts within 50 days and exceed 50 days to avoid the effect of declined cells the associations between algae cell density and bio c17 for the species of microcystis aeruginosa melosira sp and chlorella vulgaris were illustrated in fig 3 within 50 days the cell densities of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris both showed significantly linear relationship with bio c17 but this association was species specific the linear regression coefficients of microcystis aeruginosa and chlorella vulgaris were 0 0838 0 0019 106 cells ng 1 average standard deviation s d and 0 2309 0 0540 106 cells ng 1 respectively the linear range of this relationship for algae cell density was within 107 cells ml 1 which covered the cell density range in lake chaohu jiang et al 2014 therefore bio c17 can be utilized to represent the dynamic changes of cyanobacteria and green algae in natural aquatic environment however the species dependent relations between cyanobacteria green algae and bio c17 illustrated that algae community should also be considered for better prediction of algae cell density in natural aquatic environment 3 3 generalized additive model considering the limited explained variance of algae cell density just 40 7 interpreted by bio c17 only fig 1 and species specific associations between bio c17 and algae cell density fig 3 algae community was considered to improve the explained variance of algae cell density in lake chaohu fig 4 shows the prediction of algae cell density using multiple gams as shown in fig 4a with multiple variables entered the model successively the cumulative explained variance of algae cell density elevated from 0 gam0 intercept only to 66 gam3 all variables 40 7 7 3 and 18 of the variance of algae cell density was explained by bio c17 h and j respectively the full model gam3 was selected as the optimal model because of its lowest aic value among all models fig 4b the linear and nonlinear estimations of the optimal model were summarized in table s3 and table s4 respectively the nonlinear response curves and residual analysis were shown in fig s4 and fig s5 respectively the results showed that there were no obvious patterns between residuals and variables fig s5a and the prediction errors for 70 of samples were within 0 5 log10 unit fig s5b all parameters were significant p 0 05 table s3 and table s4 for smooth terms the k indexes were larger than 1 and the p values were large enough table s4 indicating the basis dimensions for nonlinear smooth were adequate therefore the optimized model was robust and the estimated results were reliable the total explained variance of algae cell density in the optimal model was 66 which was greatly elevated by considering algae community or j and h fig 4a it proved that considering algae community can indeed improve the interpretation of algae cell density in natural environment which is mutually verified with the results of our laboratory batch experiments however in this study only two integrated variables j and h were used to describe the evenness and diversity of algae community in lake chaohu more detailed information was limited recently a novel environmental dna edna metabarcoding technic was developed to rapidly and accurately constitute the zooplankton community in a certain environment yang and zhang 2020 yang et al 2018 in this study we confirmed that the synthetic rate of bio c17 per cell was species dependent fig 3 accordingly bio c17 combined with species information obtained via edna metabarcoding technic could be developed in future study to develop a more precise and convenient model for the prediction of algae cell density in natural environment zhang 2019 liu et al 2020 although the variance of algae cell density was well explained by optimized gam there still remains 34 of unexplained variance fig 4 firstly one possible reason is from the investigation errors the algae cell density was determined by concentrating 10 to 20 l raw water into approximately 50 ml and take 100 random fields from several microliter algae solution to count using microscope jiang et al 2014 it was tolerable that this classical method may lead to some technical biases due to the nonuniformity of taking just several microliter algae concentrates for observation and the complex morphology of algae such as agglomeration and overlaying moreover some small algae were inevitably leaked out when filtering raw water through the plankton net jiang et al 2014 resulting in an underestimation of algae cell density one the other hand the normal uncertainty of bio c17 analysis can also contribute to the unexplained variance he et al 2020 besides the cell density of diatom fig 2 and some other species blumer et al 1971 could not be characterized by bio c17 in lake chaohu cyanobacteria were the absolute dominant species in summer while the increase of diatom occurred in winter jiang et al 2014 therefore insert other biomarkers such as biogenic silica liu et al 2019 to the model might further elevate the explained variance secondly the unexplained variance might also come from the complicated species species and species environment interactions that are impractical to describe in gam kim et al 2020 jöhnk et al 2008 kromkamp et al 1989 4 conclusion in current study the issue if bio c17 can be utilized to represent algae cell density dynamics in lake was studied field investigation showed algae cell density had strikingly positive correlation with bio c17 during all seasons in lake chaohu laboratory batch culturing experiments validated that bio c17 was synchronized with the growth of cyanobacteria and green algae but the relation between algae cell density and bio c17 was species dependent the relationship between bio c17 and algae cell density was linear within 107 cells ml 1 optimized generalized additive model illustrated that considering algae community variables j and h could result in a better prediction of algae cell density in natural water environment in conclusion this study gave novel evidences that bio c17 can be utilized to represent the cell density dynamics of cyanobacteria and green algae in water environment however

16218,waters contaminated with micropollutants are of environmental and public health concern globally stormwater is a significant source of anthropogenic micropollutants to receiving waters hence sustainable stormwater remediation is needed to reduce contamination of waterways yet designing sustainable bioremediation solutions including those targeted to remove micropollutants is a major scientific challenge this study aimed to adapt the design of stormwater biofiltration systems to improve the removal of micropollutants and understand the role of the micropollutant degrading bacteria in this bioremediation process we investigated the atrazine removal performance of a prototype biofiltration system in which the filter media was supplemented with granulated activated carbon gac the prototype biofiltration system completely removed atrazine to below detectable limits significantly exceeding the gac s adsorption capacity alone suggesting other biological processes were present we showed that atrazine degradation capacity measured by the kinetics of the trzn gene abundance was accelerated in the prototype system compared to the standard system which had no added gac 0 8 vs 0 37 week 1 respectively notably this high level of atrazine removal did not come at the expense of the removal performance of other typical stormwater macropollutants e g nutrients suspended solids the prototype biofiltration system showed a proof of concept of sustaining microbial remediation of a model micropollutant alongside stormwater macropollutants which could be used to reduce impacts on receiving waterways and protect our ecosystems and human health image graphical abstract keywords bioaugmentation micropollutants atrazine adsorption biodegradation stormwater management ecological engineering abbreviations gac granulated activated carbon car carex appressa lep leptospermum continentale nv non vegetated nvnb non vegetated non bioaugmented 1 introduction stormwater biofiltration systems also known as rain gardens or bio retention systems are stormwater control measures that can remediate polluted stormwater at or near its source deletic et al 2014 fletcher et al 2015 lund et al 2019 studies have shown that biofiltration systems rely on physical processes plant uptake and microbial degradation for bioremediation of stormwater pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus bratieres et al 2008 hatt et al 2007 morse et al 2018 payne et al 2014b such a nature based system benefits the urban landscape not only through stormwater management but also through urban heat reduction and improved air quality and urban amenities deletic et al 2014 lund et al 2019 however to date the best practice biofiltration systems i e filter media type and depth and submerged zone payne et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 are unable to promote consistent and effective removal of micropollutants randelovic et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 2015 2014 the main goal of this study is to extend the capacity of stormwater biofiltration systems to effectively remove micropollutants our model micropollutant of choice atrazine is the most commonly found herbicide in surface and ground waters apvma s report 2008 wu et al 2010 atrazine is an endocrine disruptor causing sexual abnormalities and is toxic to the aquatic system at low levels of ppb wirbisky and freeman 2016 hayes et al 2010 atrazine belongs to the s triazine herbicides group that has been identified as one of the dominant pesticide groups in stormwater rippy et al 2017 and has low removal efficiencies via currently used biofiltration systems 20 zhang et al 2015 2014 a low cost sustainable approach to bioremediation is an application of contaminant degrading bacteria by bioaugmentation some cases of successful bioaugmentation with contaminant degrading bacteria have been reported for contaminated sites e g for groundwater contaminated with organohalogen compounds adrian and löffler 2016 berkowitz et al 2014 however sustaining the foreign bacteria in ecological environments has been identified as a key knowledge gap albers et al 2015 horemans et al 2017 mrozik and piotrowska seget 2010 particularly in a micropollutant level atashgahi et al 2018 the impact of bioaugmentation using micropollutant degrading bacteria in a stormwater biofiltration system on micropollutant removal performance of the system has not yet been studied the environmental conditions of the aforementioned studies where bioaugmentation has been studied differ greatly from biofiltration systems first stormwater biofiltration systems receive stormwater with relatively low concentrations of micropollutants e g atrazine levels of 6 10 3 6 24 10 3 mg l 1 reported by chen et al 2019 rippy et al 2017 spahr et al 2020 or 1 9 10 3 9 3 10 3 mg l 1 reported by sidhu et al 2012 ulrich et al 2015 alongside other available sources of carbon and nitrogen allinson et al 2014 moore et al 2018 micropollutant degrading bacteria may survive more readily in oligotrophic environments such as groundwater dong et al 2014 where available nutrients are scarce and the ability to metabolize micropollutants may be particularly competitive as such the conditions in a stormwater biofiltration system may not necessarily be favorable for the survival of the micropollutant degrading bacteria or for maintaining its micropollutant degradation functions second the successful bioaugmentation of stormwater biofiltration systems is challenged by the very short hydraulic retention time hrt of the systems several hours payne et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 studies showed that atrazine mineralization using degrading species was achieved on a scale of days for example zhao et al 2019 showed that bioaugmentation of a constructed wetland with pseudomonas sp zxy 1 and arthrobacter sp zxy 2 enhanced atrazine degradation to an undetected value within 43 days zhao et al 2019 this is an unrealistic timeframe for a biofiltration system because stormwater does not remain in the system for such a long period typically 4hrs it should be mentioned that stormwater constructed wetlands also differ from biofiltration systems in that the latter can be more oxic particularly when the filter media is dry or unsaturated oxic conditions are essential for many microbial degradation processes including atrazine degradation via aerobic bacteria such as arthrobacter aurescens strain tc1 mongodin et al 2006 shapir et al 2007 strong et al 2002 third biodegradation stability in the biofiltration systems may be challenged by prolonged dry periods without any rainfall payne et al 2014a zinger et al 2021 this is mainly since dry conditions slow down hydrolytic reactions meereboer et al 2020 or et al 2007 which are the basis for the rapid atrazine degradation pathway shapir et al 2007 udikoviç koliç et al 2012 fourth in freely draining systems like stormwater biofiltration systems payne et al 2019 it is difficult to ensure that introduced microorganisms attach to and colonize the filter media microbial aggregates biofilm are usually accumulated at a solid liquid interface and are encased in a matrix of highly hydrated extracellular polymeric substances eps allison 2003 thus contaminant biodegradation by sessile microorganisms occurs at the solid liquid interface and is affected by the adsorption desorption process of the subjected contaminant to and from the media leviram et al 2019a in addition the effect of vegetation in supporting the micropollutant adsorption and biodegradation by introduced microorganisms has not been studied in biofiltration systems all the above leads to the following research question can we adapt the design of stormwater biofiltration systems to improve the removal of low but chronic concentrations of micropollutants found in stormwater in this study we focus on specific micropollutant and specific bacterium to allow us to understand processes and mechanisms that later on could be applied to a larger scale of micropollutants we developed a prototype biofiltration system that includes a portion of granulated activated carbon gac within the biofiltration system gac has been shown to perform well in the removal of pollutants from water including atrazine herzberg et al 2006 2004 however unlike conventional gac which in the past has been applied as a stand alone non selective bioreactor lu et al 2020 shen et al 2012 here we investigate gac ability to select and stabilize the micropollutant degrading bacteria directly within the biofiltration ecosystem such gac application is the first of its kind to our knowledge we hypothesize that when combined with bioaugmentation gac will not have to undergo energy intensive regeneration because the microorganisms will be able to increase the longevity of the gac this study builds on our previous study of the effect of adsorption desorption capabilities on atrazine biodegradation leviram et al 2019a and we employ this previous understanding into a prototype stormwater biofiltration system accordingly the specific objectives addressed in this study are to determine 1 the removal performance of atrazine alongside typical stormwater pollutants via stormwater biofiltration systems that are bioaugmented with micropollutant degrading bacteria 2 the impact of wet and dry periods on micropollutant removal performance of biofiltration systems 3 the effects of supplemented gac with or without vegetation on atrazine removal stability and involved mechanisms adsorption or adsorption followed by microbial degradation and 4 the effect of the supplemented gac with or without vegetation on micropollutant degrading bacteria kinetics in the stormwater biofiltration system for better understanding the conditions affecting the survival and growth of micropollutant degrading bacteria in ecologically competitive conditions 2 materials and methods the objectives of this study were tested using laboratory scale biofiltration systems over a period of 14 months as outlined below 2 1 biofiltration system experimental setup thirty two stormwater biofiltration columns internal diameter 240 mm height 1000 mm were constructed fig 1 the columns had either a sand filter media standard system design deletic et al 2014 or a 100 mm layer of gac acticarb gc1200 1 6 2 mm in addition to the sand filter media prototype system design we chose to use gac in the prototype system because our previous study that compared the atrazine adsorption capacities of pristine and biofilm coated gac and zeolite to common filter media found that gac had optimal adsorption capacity even with biofilm coating tables s1 si leviram et al 2019b each standard design and prototype design system column was planted with either carex appressa car leptospermum continentale lep or was not vegetated nv or was not vegetated and not bioaugmented nvnb the different configurations were designed to assist with distinguishing between the underlying mechanisms involved in the micropollutant removal i e adsorption microbial biodegradation plant uptake the vegetated columns had five replicates each and non vegetated columns had triplicates the columns were dosed with semi synthetic stormwater containing atrazine for 11 weeks after this the columns were bio augmented with arthrobacter aurescens tc1 atcc baa1386 by direct inculcation of 8 107 cfu ml 1 per column into the ponding water above the filter media during a stormwater dosing event a significant advantage of a aurescens tc1 for bioaugmentation in stormwater biofiltration systems is that this strain rapidly consumes atrazine as its source of nitrogen carbon and energy and metabolizes a wider range of s triazine herbicides strong et al 2002 moreover the primary enzyme of this strain that converts atrazine to hydroxyatrazine has high activity in environments with high zinc levels shapir et al 2006 such as reported in stormwater 0 02 5 mg l 1 charters et al 2017 davis et al 2001 a aurescens tc1 was grown on 2662 atcc r medium 30 mg l 1 atrazine and was harvested at the exponential growth phase by centrifugation at 6000 g for 5 min following method epa 1611 haugland et al 2012 the cell density was determined by colony forming units cfu the cfu and the optical density od were correlated using varying cell densities figs s1 si 2 2 operating conditions the stormwater biofiltration systems were operated and sampled over 62 weeks the operation regime comprised of four phases background and plant establishment tap water dosing pre bioaugmentation dosing with stormwater containing atrazine post bioaugmentation with atrazine and atrazine free stormwater dosing table 1 each phase consists of two different dosing patterns dry no dosing for two weeks and wet twice weekly dosing semi synthetic stormwater was used for dosing and was made by mixing dechlorinated tap water with 1 mm sieved sediment collected from a stormwater pond with laboratory grade chemicals as described elsewhere hatt et al 2007 the target pollutant concentrations are consistent with the australian urban stormwater quality as specified by duncan 1999 and taylor et al 2005 the target atrazine concentration was 0 12 0 2 mg l 1 based on values reported by millet and sorghum 1997 and rattray et al 2007 tables s2 si rather than other reports chen et al 2019 rippy et al 2017 spahr et al 2020 this was aimed to allow removal range detection of more than 90 in respect to the detection of limit 0 01 mg l 1 at the authorized laboratory and to exceed adsorption capacity within the study timeframe we chose to include only atrazine and no other s triazine herbicides found in stormwater e g simazine ametryn tebutryn in order to link between trzn gene abundance and the consequent micropollutant removal the dosing volume per event was 11 l for each column equivalent to 1 pore volume which is based on the assumption that each biofiltration system was sized to 2 5 of its catchment area and had melbourne s rainfall pattern 2 3 sample collection and analysis over the 62 weeks of operation 10 sampling events were carried out and a total of 330 samples were collected during sampling events effluent samples were collected in a 20 l bucket after mixing sub samples were collected for chemical analyses placed on ice and delivered to the laboratories the

differences in pollutants concentrations in the system effluents as well as differences in gene abundance at a 95 level of confidence p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofiltration systems performance of the prototype and standard designs biofiltration system performance measurements show that the prototype system reached complete atrazine removal atrazine levels found in effluent were below the limit of detection in all of the prototype system configurations fig 2 by contrast atrazine removal efficiencies of the standard system ranged between 11 and 58 fig 2 overall atrazine loading during the entire period of operation was 103 µgatrazine gr 1 gac per column with inflow atrazine concentrations ranging between 0 12 and 0 2 mg l 1 a total of 748 l of semisynthetic stormwater was treated in each column over the 62 weeks of operation no breakthrough of atrazine was observed over the entire 62 weeks of the prototype system operation using only 5 w w gac filter media at an average infiltration rate of 270 mm hr 1 equal to flow rate of 12 l hr 1 the prototype systems performance appears to exceed expectations of atrazine adsorption capacities by one order of magnitude based on reported gac atrazine adsorption capacities in previous studies tables s5 si esquerdo et al 2021 fernandes 2017 knappe et al 1999 suggesting other removal processes are occurring in contrast to the prototype systems all standard system configurations failed to meet regulatory requirements of atrazine concentrations in freshwater environments 0 013 mg l 1 anzecc and armcanz 2000 atrazine removal efficiencies of the standard biofiltration systems at pre bioaugmentation phase ranged between 11 nvnb and 28 car during wet periods and between 13 nvnb and 23 car during dry periods bioaugmentation improved atrazine removal efficiency slightly to a range between 21 nvnb and 38 car and lep during wet periods and between 17 nv and 58 car during dry periods 3 2 atrazine degradation stability and the effect of bioaugmentation using qpcr we monitored the abundance of the triazine hydrolase gene trzn coding for the enzyme converting atrazine to hydroxyatrazine of the augmented bacteria a aurescens tc1 shapir et al 2007 the analysis was performed at weeks 18 and 33 pre bioaugmentation and at weeks 42 54 and 58 post bioaugmentation on media taken from both the prototype gac and standard sand systems the trzn gene abundance in both the prototype and standard systems were elevated mainly during the post bioaugmentation phase between weeks 42 and 54 gene copies per wet gram media were elevated from 2 5 101 to 3 2 105 and from 1 1 104 to 2 106 copies gr 1 for the prototype and standard systems respectively fig 3 the lack of significant elevation in trzn gene abundance during pre bioaugmentation corresponds to the low removal efficiencies of the standard systems at that phase 11 28 fig 2 after bioaugmentation elevation kinetics of the trzn gene abundance was accelerated on gac in the prototype system compared to sand in the standard system the mean values of this elevation for all prototype and standard configurations were 0 80 0 06 vs 0 37 0 26 week 1 respectively p 0 001 fig 3 and table 2 the elevation in the abundance kinetics of the trzn gene was not significantly different between the system configurations car lep nv p 0 1 suggesting that the filter media was the primary factor affecting the trzn gene kinetics in the system p 0 001 trzn gene abundance before the augmentation phase with a aurescens reached up to 1 105 gene copies gr 1 in the sand including the nvnb configuration fig 3 thus the biofiltration system contained genetic material related to endogenous microbial communities prior to bioaugmentation this finding shows that in particular the sand configurations contained a higher pre disposition to carriage of these specific gene families than the gac it is essential to recognize that the presence of these genes does not always correlate to gene transcription and therefore activity rocca et al 2015 understanding this relationship or defining the role of background communities pre bioaugmentation on atrazine removal would require meta transcriptomic analysis which was beyond the scope of the current study alternatively considering these figures rather than the maximum gene copy number on the filter media the kinetic parameters of the trzn gene abundance provide a better understanding of atrazine microbial degradation capacity on the different carriers rocca et al 2015 such kinetics normalizes the background trzn gene abundance and offers a more suitable indication of bacterial degradation capacity this study shows that the kinetics of the trzn gene abundance was accelerated in the prototype system compared to the standard system table 2 suggesting higher rates of atrazine degrading bacteria proliferation on gac the trzn gene abundance elevation during the post bioaugmentation phase suggests that the atrazine removal mechanism in the biofiltration system includes microbial atrazine degradation since atrazine is the only triazine molecule added to the inflow tables s2 si elevation in triazine hydrolase gene trzn is indicative of microbial proliferation at the expense of atrazine shapir et al 2006 hence if the protein product of this gene is active it is likely that atrazine is not just being temporarily stored in the system by adsorption but also broken down into its non toxic metabolite hydroxatrazine by triazine hydrolase and possibly further down in the hydrolytic degradation pathway shapir et al 2007 due to this indication of the hydrolytic degradation pathway presence we suspect that the oxidative degradation pathway that may produce toxic metabolites deethylatrazine and deisoprpylatrazine is less likely udikoviç koliç et al 2012 though warrant further study the post bioaugmentation elevation of trzn abundance explains the rise in atrazine removal efficiencies during the post bioaugmentation phase in the standard system compared to atrazine removal at the pre bioaugmentation phase e g for the car case in which atrazine removal improved from 28 to 38 during the wet periods and from 23 to 58 during the dry periods fig 1 the elevation of trzn abundance in the nvnb configuration after bioaugmentation might be either due to growth of the endogenous microorganisms in the system or cross transfer between the systems i e carry over from the augmented systems it is more likely to be the latter because the increase in trzn abundance was observed only during post bioaugmentation and not during pre bioaugmentation moreover the elevation in trzn abundance in the nvnb corresponds to the similarities in atrazine removal efficiencies between nvnb and nv during post bioaugmentation fig 2 the kinetics of the trzn gene abundance in the biofiltration system is qualitatively compared to the growth kinetics of a aurescens pure culture in the presence and absence of gac under laboratory conditions fig 4 in the batch conditions a aurescens gradually proliferated when it was associated with gac while a rapid growth followed by bacterial die off was detected in the absence of gac we calculated a doubling time of 37 6 1 vs 26 6 6 hr for conditions with and without gac respectively fig 4 the latter corresponds with a previously reported doubling time for this strain grown on atrazine strong et al 2002 notably the kinetics in the biofiltration system and at the batch scale was affected differently by the presence of gac in the biofiltration system the trzn gene kinetics on gac was elevated compared to sand with rates of 0 8 0 06 vs 0 37 0 26 week 1 respectively whereas in the batch conditions the growth rate was reduced due to the presence of gac from 4 6 1 2 week 1 to 3 2 0 5 week 1 under the batch conditions a pristine gac was used without any atrazine pre adsorption while in the biofiltration system atrazine was adsorbed during the operation of the system in the previous 42 weeks as seen in fig 4 under batch conditions the presence of gac changes bacterial growth kinetics due to atrazine adsorption shifting atrazine availability to the bacteria hence the growth kinetics with gac is dependent on the rate of desorption and thus at the early stages of this experiment dissolved atrazine is less available reducing bacterial growth rates at later stages the dissolved atrazine is diminished in the absence of gac and bacterial die off takes place while a steady state is observed in the presence of gac fig 4 in contrast to the batch conditions it seems that gac in the biofiltration system did not reduce atrazine degrading bacteria proliferation since trzn gene abundance was elevated and at higher kinetics than in the standard system table 2 therefore the accelerated trzn gene kinetics on gac in the prototype system must be driven by an additional source of energy provided by the supplemented gac pre loaded with atrazine from the stormwater mix moreover this finding indicates that the accelerated trzn gene kinetics in the prototype system is driven not only by biodegradation of atrazine in the bulk liquid but also by the breakdown of atrazine previously adsorbed to the gac other biological gac studies have shown that such biodegradation regenerates the gac adsorption sites which in return extends the gac s lifetime aktaş and çeçen 2007 shen et al 2012 as such we hypothesize that biological degradation of atrazine not only eliminates the toxic chemical but also regenerates gac adsorption sites thus sustaining its adsorption capacity for a longer period of time this corresponds to both our findings i the accelerated kinetics of trzn abundance in gac vs sand ii the extended lifespan of gac such that no exhaustion appeared despite loading the gac with one order of magnitude beyond the adsorption capacity tables 2 and s5 future studies should explore this hypothesis further using extended adsorption experiments 3 3 the support of biomass by the biofiltration media and the effect of vegetation the gac of the prototype biofiltration system was a better host for biomass biofilm over time compared to the sand in the standard system with up to 2 3 0 8 µg gr 1 dna vs 0 3 0 17 µg gr 1 dna respectively fig 5 this is aligned with our laboratory results of biomass carrying capacities of the sand and gac media for biofilm growth tables s1 si dna concentrations detected on the sand were fairly constant over the 62 weeks operational period across all standard configurations ranging from mean values of 0 04 0 06 to 0 2 0 1 µg gr 1 however dna concentrations on the gac increased with time even throughout the phase of atrazine free stormwater dosing during the pre bioaugmentation phase week 18 dna concentrations on gac were as low as 9 6 10 3 µg gr 1 nvnb and 1 6 10 1 µg gr 1 lep dna concentrations on gac gradually increased until reaching a peak after the atrazine free phase week 58 ranging between 3 8 10 1 µg gr 1 car and 2 3 µg gr 1 nv these findings suggest that the presence of gac in the biofiltration system assisted with maintaining microbial mass regardless of the supply of atrazine we speculate that this function will also contribute to ensuring high removal performance of micropollutant and the microbial degradation functions even when stormwater micropollutant levels vary significantly the non vegetated configurations were better hosts for biomass compared to the vegetated configurations for both the prototype and standard systems mean value of 0 48 0 09 vs 0 24 0 04 µg gr 1 respectively it is likely that vegetation acts as a sink for nutrients thus in the non vegetated systems microorganism do not have to complete with the vegetation for nutrients and other resources as was similarly observed and suggested by morse et al 2018 nevertheless the vegetated standard configurations had better atrazine removal efficiencies compared to the non vegetated standard configurations mean values of 35 7 1 9 vs 17 6 1 3 respectively fig 2 this negative relationship between biomass load and atrazine removal indicates that the microbial biomass load in the biofiltration systems is not the only factor predicting atrazine removal and that atrazine removal in the vegetated systems might also be driven by plant uptake moreover there was no statistically significant difference in trzn abundance between the vegetated and non vegetated configurations p 0 1 fig 3 indeed atrazine uptake by vegetation has previously been reported by others chang et al 2005 lin et al 2011 unlike the non vegetated standard systems in vegetated standard systems higher atrazine removal was observed during the dry periods compared to wet periods mean percentage removal of 51 5 14 vs 37 6 8 respectively this result corresponds to the improvement in atrazine removal during dry periods previously seen in vegetated standard biofiltration systems zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 concluded that prolonged dry periods benefit the removal of some micropollutants our findings show that only the vegetated systems improve in atrazine removal performance following dry periods compared to the non vegetated ones therefore we suspect that the improvement in removal performance during dry periods results from the effect of vegetation i e atrazine uptake by plants which might be more significant at limited water availability 3 4 nutrients suspended solids and metals removal performance the adaptations that we made to the standard biofiltration system i e adding gac to the filter media and bioaugmentation with micropollutant degrading bacteria did not negatively affect tn tp tss and metals removal and the hydraulic conductivity the tn removal efficiencies of the prototype system were 97 98 during wet periods and 94 95 during dry periods figs s3 si these removal efficiencies are in a similar range or even better to those previously reported for standard systems 74 87 bratieres et al 2008 fletcher et al 2007 payne et al 2014b the tp removal efficiencies of the prototype system ranged between 85 and 92 lep and car respectively to 57 and 64 nvnb and nv respectively during wet periods and between 77 lep and car to 55 62 nvnb and nv respectively during dry periods figs s3 si the phosphorous removal efficiencies of the vegetated configuration are similar to what has been previously reported 55 90 bratieres et al 2008 fowdar et al 2021 hatt et al 2007 tss removal efficiencies of the prototype system were 79 86 during wet periods and 81 84 during dry periods these removal efficiencies resemble what has been reported by other studies 70 98 li et al 2020 zinger et al 2021 metals removals were tested at a single sampling event for the gold standard configuration car figs s4 si effluent levels of all metals of both of the systems met regulatory requirements anzecc and armcanz 2000 similar to what has been reported for standard biofiltration systems before al ameri et al 2018 blecken et al 2009 the total organic carbon removal in the prototype biofiltration system across all configurations ranged between 89 and 95 during wet periods and 61 to 80 during dry periods these toc removal efficiencies resemble what has been reported for standard biofiltration systems by other studies 38 97 zinger et al 2021 the introduction of the gac did not cause a difference in hydraulic conductivity over time indicated by the similarity in infiltration rates of the prototype and the standard systems p 0 1 figs s5 si moreover the two systems had no significant differences in ph conductivity and orp figs s5 si these results indicate that the higher atrazine removal observed in the prototype systems and by bioaugmentation has not come at the cost of removal performance of other stormwater pollutants demonstrating potential real world applicability of these prototype biofiltration systems further investigation of this prototype system should include performance testing on a variety of micropollutants using a consortium of micropollutant degrading microorganisms 4 concluding remarks this study aimed to adapt the design of stormwater biofiltration systems to improve the removal of micropollutants and understand the role of micropollutant degrading bacteria in bioremediation of stormwater in these systems the bioaugmentation of a aurescens led to higher rates of micropollutant degrading gene elevation in the prototype biofiltration design that contains gac compared to the standard design which contains sand specifically the kinetics of trzn gene abundance was accelerated in the prototype system compared to the standard system 0 8 0 06 vs 0 37 0 26 week 1 respectively these findings show a positive effect of supplementing gac in stormwater biofiltration systems as this can promote the proliferation of micropollutant degrading microorganisms within the stormwater biofiltration ecosystem furthermore it appears that gac lifespan was extended such that no exhaustion appeared despite loading the gac with one order of magnitude over the reported atrazine adsorption likely due to bio regeneration gac plays an important role in maintaining microbial biomass functions throughout fluctuation in micropollutant seasoning load which is typical for stormwater notably this high level of atrazine removal did not come at the expense of removal performance of other typical stormwater macropollutants e g nutrients suspended solids the micropollutants removal concepts studied here i e the combined effect of adsorption biodegradation and vegetation and shown to successfully remove atrazine from stormwater could potentially be transferred to different micropollutants upon further study in all tested aspects it seems that the prototype biofiltration system suggested in this study could be used to enhance atrazine free stormwater recycling reduce impacts on receiving waterways

16218,waters contaminated with micropollutants are of environmental and public health concern globally stormwater is a significant source of anthropogenic micropollutants to receiving waters hence sustainable stormwater remediation is needed to reduce contamination of waterways yet designing sustainable bioremediation solutions including those targeted to remove micropollutants is a major scientific challenge this study aimed to adapt the design of stormwater biofiltration systems to improve the removal of micropollutants and understand the role of the micropollutant degrading bacteria in this bioremediation process we investigated the atrazine removal performance of a prototype biofiltration system in which the filter media was supplemented with granulated activated carbon gac the prototype biofiltration system completely removed atrazine to below detectable limits significantly exceeding the gac s adsorption capacity alone suggesting other biological processes were present we showed that atrazine degradation capacity measured by the kinetics of the trzn gene abundance was accelerated in the prototype system compared to the standard system which had no added gac 0 8 vs 0 37 week 1 respectively notably this high level of atrazine removal did not come at the expense of the removal performance of other typical stormwater macropollutants e g nutrients suspended solids the prototype biofiltration system showed a proof of concept of sustaining microbial remediation of a model micropollutant alongside stormwater macropollutants which could be used to reduce impacts on

systems also known as rain gardens or bio retention systems are stormwater control measures that can remediate polluted stormwater at or near its source deletic et al 2014 fletcher et al 2015 lund et al 2019 studies have shown that biofiltration systems rely on physical processes plant uptake and microbial degradation for bioremediation of stormwater pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus bratieres et al 2008 hatt et al 2007 morse et al 2018 payne et al 2014b such a nature based system benefits the urban landscape not only through stormwater management but also through urban heat reduction and improved air quality and urban amenities deletic et al 2014 lund et al 2019 however to date the best practice biofiltration systems i e filter media type and depth and submerged zone payne et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 are unable to promote consistent and effective removal of micropollutants randelovic et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 2015 2014 the main goal of this study is to extend the capacity of stormwater biofiltration systems to effectively remove micropollutants our model micropollutant of choice atrazine is the most commonly found herbicide in surface and ground waters apvma s report 2008 wu et al 2010 atrazine is an endocrine disruptor causing sexual abnormalities and is toxic to the aquatic system at low levels of ppb wirbisky and freeman 2016 hayes et al 2010 atrazine belongs to the s triazine herbicides group that has been identified as one of the dominant pesticide groups in stormwater rippy et al 2017 and has low removal efficiencies via currently used biofiltration systems 20 zhang et al 2015 2014 a low cost sustainable approach to bioremediation is an application of contaminant degrading bacteria by bioaugmentation some cases of successful bioaugmentation with contaminant degrading bacteria have been reported for contaminated sites e g for groundwater contaminated with organohalogen compounds adrian and löffler 2016 berkowitz et al 2014 however sustaining the foreign bacteria in ecological environments has been identified as a key knowledge gap albers et al 2015 horemans et al 2017 mrozik and piotrowska seget 2010 particularly in a micropollutant level atashgahi et al 2018 the impact of bioaugmentation using micropollutant degrading bacteria in a stormwater biofiltration system on micropollutant removal performance of the system has not yet been studied the environmental conditions of the aforementioned studies where bioaugmentation has been studied differ greatly from biofiltration systems first stormwater biofiltration systems receive stormwater with relatively low concentrations of micropollutants e g atrazine levels of 6 10 3 6 24 10 3 mg l 1 reported by chen et al 2019 rippy et al 2017 spahr et al 2020 or 1 9 10 3 9 3 10 3 mg l 1 reported by sidhu et al 2012 ulrich et al 2015 alongside other available sources of carbon and nitrogen allinson et al 2014 moore et al 2018 micropollutant degrading bacteria may survive more readily in oligotrophic environments such as groundwater dong et al 2014 where available nutrients are scarce and the ability to metabolize micropollutants may be particularly competitive as such the conditions in a stormwater biofiltration system may not necessarily be favorable for the survival of the micropollutant degrading bacteria or for maintaining its micropollutant degradation functions second the successful bioaugmentation of stormwater biofiltration systems is challenged by the very short hydraulic retention time hrt of the systems several hours payne et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 studies showed that atrazine mineralization using degrading species was achieved on a scale of days for example zhao et al 2019 showed that bioaugmentation of a constructed wetland with pseudomonas sp zxy 1 and arthrobacter sp zxy 2 enhanced atrazine degradation to an undetected value within 43 days zhao et al 2019 this is an unrealistic timeframe for a biofiltration system because stormwater does not remain in the system for such a long period typically 4hrs it should be mentioned that stormwater constructed wetlands also differ from biofiltration systems in that the latter can be more oxic particularly when the filter media is dry or unsaturated oxic conditions are essential for many microbial degradation processes including atrazine degradation via aerobic bacteria such as arthrobacter aurescens strain tc1 mongodin et al 2006 shapir et al 2007 strong et al 2002 third biodegradation stability in the biofiltration systems may be challenged by prolonged dry periods without any rainfall payne et al 2014a zinger et al 2021 this is mainly since dry conditions slow down hydrolytic reactions meereboer et al 2020 or et al 2007 which are the basis for the rapid atrazine degradation pathway shapir et al 2007 udikoviç koliç et al 2012 fourth in freely draining systems like stormwater biofiltration systems payne et al 2019 it is difficult to ensure that introduced microorganisms attach to and colonize the filter media microbial aggregates biofilm are usually accumulated at a solid liquid interface and are encased in a matrix of highly hydrated extracellular polymeric substances eps allison 2003 thus contaminant biodegradation by sessile microorganisms occurs at the solid liquid interface and is affected by the adsorption desorption process of the subjected contaminant to and from the media leviram et al 2019a in addition the effect of vegetation in supporting the micropollutant adsorption and biodegradation by introduced microorganisms has not been studied in biofiltration systems all the above leads to the following research question can we adapt the design of stormwater biofiltration systems to improve the removal of low but chronic concentrations of micropollutants found in stormwater in this study we focus on specific micropollutant and specific bacterium to allow us to understand processes and mechanisms that later on could be applied to a larger scale of micropollutants we developed a prototype biofiltration system that includes a portion of granulated activated carbon gac within the biofiltration system gac has been shown to perform well in the removal of pollutants from water including atrazine herzberg et al 2006 2004 however unlike conventional gac which in the past has been applied as a stand alone non selective bioreactor lu et al 2020 shen et al 2012 here we investigate gac ability to select and stabilize the micropollutant degrading bacteria directly within the biofiltration ecosystem such gac application is the first of its kind to our knowledge we hypothesize that when combined with bioaugmentation gac will not have to undergo energy intensive regeneration because the microorganisms will be able to increase the longevity of the gac this study builds on our previous study of the effect of adsorption desorption capabilities on atrazine biodegradation leviram et al 2019a and we employ this previous understanding into a prototype stormwater biofiltration system accordingly the specific objectives addressed in this study are to determine 1 the removal performance of atrazine alongside typical stormwater pollutants via stormwater biofiltration systems that are bioaugmented with micropollutant degrading bacteria 2 the impact of wet and dry periods on micropollutant removal performance of biofiltration systems 3 the effects of supplemented gac with or without vegetation on atrazine removal stability and involved mechanisms adsorption or adsorption followed by microbial degradation and 4 the effect of the supplemented gac with or without vegetation on micropollutant degrading bacteria kinetics in the stormwater biofiltration system for better understanding the conditions affecting the survival and growth of micropollutant degrading bacteria in ecologically competitive conditions 2 materials and methods the objectives of this study were tested using laboratory scale biofiltration systems over a period of 14 months as outlined below 2 1 biofiltration system experimental setup thirty two stormwater biofiltration columns internal diameter 240 mm height 1000 mm were constructed fig 1 the columns had either a sand filter media standard system design deletic et al 2014 or a 100 mm layer of gac acticarb gc1200 1 6 2 mm in addition to the sand filter media prototype system design we chose to use gac in the prototype system because our previous study that compared the atrazine adsorption capacities of pristine and biofilm coated gac and zeolite to common filter media found that gac had optimal adsorption capacity even with biofilm coating tables s1 si leviram et al 2019b each standard design and prototype design system column was planted with either carex appressa car leptospermum continentale lep or was not vegetated nv or was not vegetated and not bioaugmented nvnb the different configurations were designed to assist with distinguishing between the underlying mechanisms involved in the micropollutant removal i e adsorption microbial biodegradation plant uptake the vegetated columns had five replicates each and non vegetated columns had triplicates the columns were dosed with semi synthetic stormwater containing atrazine for 11 weeks after this the columns were bio augmented with arthrobacter aurescens tc1 atcc baa1386 by direct inculcation of 8 107 cfu ml 1 per column into the ponding water above the filter media during a stormwater dosing event a significant advantage of a aurescens tc1 for bioaugmentation in stormwater biofiltration systems is that this strain rapidly consumes atrazine as its source of nitrogen carbon and energy and metabolizes a wider range of s triazine herbicides strong et al 2002 moreover the primary enzyme of this strain that converts atrazine to hydroxyatrazine has high activity in environments with high zinc levels shapir et al 2006 such as reported in stormwater 0 02 5 mg l 1 charters et al 2017 davis et al 2001 a aurescens tc1 was grown on 2662 atcc r medium 30 mg l 1 atrazine and was harvested at the exponential growth phase by centrifugation at 6000 g for 5 min following method

conditions the stormwater biofiltration systems were operated and sampled over 62 weeks the operation regime comprised of four phases background and plant establishment tap water dosing pre bioaugmentation dosing with stormwater containing atrazine post bioaugmentation with atrazine and atrazine free stormwater dosing table 1 each phase consists of two different dosing patterns dry no dosing for two weeks and wet twice weekly dosing semi synthetic stormwater was used for dosing and was made by mixing dechlorinated tap water with 1 mm sieved sediment collected from a stormwater pond with laboratory grade chemicals as described elsewhere hatt et al 2007 the target pollutant concentrations are consistent with the australian urban stormwater quality as specified by duncan 1999 and taylor et al 2005 the target atrazine concentration was 0 12 0 2 mg l 1 based on values reported by millet and sorghum 1997 and rattray et al 2007 tables s2 si rather than other reports chen et al 2019 rippy et al 2017 spahr et al 2020 this was aimed to allow removal range detection of more than 90 in respect to the detection of limit 0 01 mg l 1 at the authorized laboratory and to exceed adsorption capacity within the study timeframe we chose to include only atrazine and no other s triazine herbicides found in stormwater e g simazine ametryn tebutryn in order to link between trzn gene abundance and the consequent micropollutant removal the dosing volume per event was 11 l for each column equivalent to 1 pore volume which is based on the assumption that each biofiltration system was sized to 2 5 of its catchment area and had melbourne s rainfall pattern 2 3 sample collection and analysis over the 62 weeks of operation 10 sampling events were carried out and a total of 330 samples

differences in pollutants concentrations in the system effluents as well as differences in gene abundance at a 95 level of confidence p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofiltration systems performance of the prototype and standard designs biofiltration system performance measurements show that the prototype system reached complete atrazine removal atrazine levels found in effluent were below the limit of detection in all of the prototype system configurations fig 2 by contrast atrazine removal efficiencies of the standard system ranged between 11 and 58 fig 2 overall atrazine loading during the entire period of operation was 103 µgatrazine gr 1 gac per column with inflow atrazine concentrations ranging between 0 12 and 0 2 mg l 1 a total of 748 l of semisynthetic stormwater was treated in each column over the 62 weeks of operation no breakthrough of atrazine was observed over the entire 62 weeks of the prototype system operation using only 5 w w gac filter media at an average infiltration rate of 270 mm hr 1 equal to flow rate of 12 l hr 1 the prototype systems performance appears to exceed expectations of atrazine adsorption capacities by one order of magnitude based on reported gac atrazine adsorption capacities in previous studies tables s5 si esquerdo et al 2021 fernandes 2017 knappe et al 1999 suggesting other removal processes are occurring in contrast to the prototype systems all standard system configurations failed to meet regulatory requirements of atrazine concentrations in freshwater environments 0 013 mg l 1 anzecc and armcanz 2000 atrazine removal efficiencies of the standard biofiltration systems at pre bioaugmentation phase ranged between 11 nvnb and 28 car during wet periods and between 13 nvnb and 23 car during dry periods bioaugmentation improved atrazine removal efficiency slightly to a range between 21 nvnb and 38 car and lep during wet periods and between 17 nv and 58 car during dry periods 3 2 atrazine degradation stability and the effect of bioaugmentation using qpcr we monitored the abundance of the triazine hydrolase gene trzn coding for the enzyme converting atrazine to hydroxyatrazine of the augmented bacteria a aurescens tc1 shapir et al 2007 the analysis was performed at weeks 18 and 33 pre bioaugmentation and at weeks 42 54 and 58 post bioaugmentation on media taken from both the prototype gac and standard sand systems the trzn gene abundance in both the prototype and standard systems were elevated mainly during the post bioaugmentation phase between weeks 42 and 54 gene copies per wet gram media were elevated from 2 5 101 to 3 2 105 and from 1 1 104 to 2 106 copies gr 1 for the prototype and standard systems respectively fig 3 the lack of significant elevation in trzn gene abundance during pre bioaugmentation corresponds to the low removal efficiencies of the standard systems at that phase 11 28 fig 2 after bioaugmentation elevation kinetics of the trzn gene abundance was accelerated on gac in the prototype system compared to sand in the standard system the mean values of this elevation for all prototype and standard configurations were 0 80 0 06 vs 0 37 0 26 week 1 respectively p 0 001 fig 3 and table 2 the elevation in the abundance kinetics of the trzn gene was not significantly different between the system configurations car lep nv p 0 1 suggesting that the filter media was the primary factor affecting the trzn gene kinetics in the system p 0 001 trzn gene abundance before the augmentation phase with a aurescens reached up to 1 105 gene copies gr 1 in the sand including the nvnb configuration fig 3 thus the biofiltration system contained genetic material related to endogenous microbial communities prior to bioaugmentation this finding shows that in particular the sand configurations contained a higher pre disposition to carriage of these specific gene families than the gac it is essential to recognize that the presence of these genes does not always correlate to gene transcription and therefore activity rocca et al 2015 understanding this relationship or defining the role of background communities pre bioaugmentation on atrazine removal would require meta transcriptomic analysis which was beyond the scope of the current study alternatively considering these figures rather than the maximum gene copy number on the filter media the kinetic parameters of the trzn gene abundance provide a better understanding of atrazine microbial degradation capacity on the different carriers rocca et al 2015 such kinetics normalizes the background trzn gene abundance and offers a more suitable indication of bacterial degradation capacity this study shows that the kinetics of the trzn gene abundance was accelerated in the prototype system compared to the standard system table 2 suggesting higher rates of atrazine degrading bacteria proliferation on gac the trzn gene abundance elevation during the post bioaugmentation phase suggests that the atrazine removal mechanism in the biofiltration system includes microbial atrazine degradation since atrazine is the only triazine molecule added to the inflow tables s2 si elevation in triazine hydrolase gene trzn is indicative of microbial proliferation at the expense of atrazine shapir et al 2006 hence if the protein product of this gene is active it is likely that atrazine is not just being temporarily stored in the system by adsorption but also broken down into its non toxic metabolite hydroxatrazine by triazine hydrolase and possibly further down in the hydrolytic degradation pathway shapir et al 2007 due to this indication of the hydrolytic degradation pathway presence we suspect that the oxidative degradation pathway that may produce toxic metabolites deethylatrazine and deisoprpylatrazine is less likely udikoviç koliç et al 2012 though warrant further study the post bioaugmentation elevation of trzn abundance explains the rise in atrazine removal efficiencies during the post bioaugmentation phase in the standard system compared to atrazine removal at the pre bioaugmentation phase e g for the car case in which atrazine removal improved from 28 to 38 during the wet periods and from 23 to 58 during the dry periods fig 1 the elevation of trzn abundance in the nvnb configuration after bioaugmentation might be either due to growth of the endogenous microorganisms in the system or cross transfer between the systems i e carry over from the augmented systems it is more likely to be the latter because the increase in trzn abundance was observed only during post bioaugmentation and not during pre bioaugmentation moreover the elevation in trzn abundance in the nvnb corresponds to the similarities in atrazine removal efficiencies between nvnb and nv during post bioaugmentation fig 2 the kinetics of the trzn gene abundance in the biofiltration system is qualitatively compared to the growth kinetics of a aurescens pure culture in the presence and absence of gac under laboratory conditions fig 4 in the batch conditions a aurescens gradually proliferated when it was associated with gac while a rapid growth followed by bacterial die off was detected in the absence of gac we calculated a doubling time of 37 6 1 vs 26 6 6 hr for conditions with and without gac respectively fig 4 the latter corresponds with a previously reported doubling time for this strain grown on atrazine strong et al 2002 notably the kinetics in the biofiltration system and at the batch scale was affected differently by the presence of gac in the biofiltration system the trzn gene kinetics on gac was elevated compared to sand with rates of 0 8 0 06 vs 0 37 0 26 week 1 respectively whereas in the batch conditions the growth rate was reduced due to the presence of gac from 4 6 1 2 week 1 to 3 2 0 5 week 1 under the batch conditions a pristine gac was used without any atrazine pre adsorption while in the biofiltration system atrazine was adsorbed during the operation of the system in the previous 42 weeks as seen in fig 4 under batch conditions the presence of gac changes bacterial growth kinetics due to atrazine adsorption shifting atrazine availability to the bacteria hence the growth kinetics with gac is dependent on the rate of desorption and thus at the early stages of this experiment dissolved atrazine is less available reducing bacterial growth rates at later stages the dissolved atrazine is diminished in the absence of gac and bacterial die off takes place while a steady state is observed in the presence of gac fig 4 in contrast to the batch conditions it seems that gac in the biofiltration system did not reduce atrazine degrading bacteria proliferation since trzn gene abundance was elevated and at higher kinetics than in the standard system table 2 therefore the accelerated trzn gene kinetics on gac in the prototype system must be driven by an additional source of energy provided by the supplemented gac pre loaded with atrazine from the stormwater mix moreover this finding indicates that the accelerated trzn gene kinetics in the prototype system is driven not only by biodegradation of atrazine in the bulk liquid but also by the breakdown of atrazine previously adsorbed to the gac other biological gac studies have shown that such biodegradation regenerates the gac adsorption sites which in return extends the gac s lifetime aktaş and çeçen 2007 shen et al 2012 as such we hypothesize that biological degradation of atrazine not only eliminates the toxic chemical but also regenerates gac adsorption sites thus sustaining its adsorption capacity for a longer period of time this corresponds to both our findings i the accelerated kinetics of trzn abundance in gac vs sand ii the extended lifespan of gac such that no exhaustion appeared despite loading the gac with one order of magnitude beyond the adsorption capacity tables 2 and s5 future studies should explore this hypothesis further using extended adsorption experiments 3 3 the support of biomass by the biofiltration media and the effect of vegetation the gac of the prototype biofiltration system was a better host for biomass biofilm over time compared to the sand in the standard system with up to 2 3 0 8 µg gr 1 dna vs 0 3 0 17 µg gr 1 dna respectively fig 5 this is aligned with our laboratory results of biomass carrying capacities of the sand and gac media for biofilm growth tables s1 si dna concentrations detected on the sand were fairly constant over the 62 weeks operational period across all standard configurations ranging from mean values of 0 04 0 06 to 0 2 0 1 µg gr 1 however dna concentrations on the gac increased with time even throughout the phase of atrazine free stormwater dosing during the pre bioaugmentation phase week 18 dna concentrations on gac were as low as 9 6 10 3 µg gr 1 nvnb and 1 6 10 1 µg gr 1 lep dna concentrations on gac gradually increased until reaching a peak after the atrazine free phase week 58 ranging between 3 8 10 1 µg gr 1 car and 2 3 µg gr 1 nv these findings suggest that the presence of gac in the biofiltration system assisted with maintaining microbial mass regardless of the supply of atrazine we speculate that this function will also contribute to ensuring high removal performance of micropollutant and the microbial degradation functions even when stormwater micropollutant levels vary significantly the non vegetated configurations were better hosts for biomass compared to the vegetated configurations for both the prototype and standard systems mean value of 0 48 0 09 vs 0 24 0 04 µg gr 1 respectively it is likely that vegetation acts as a sink for nutrients thus in the non vegetated systems microorganism do not have to complete with the vegetation for nutrients and other resources as was similarly observed and suggested by morse et al 2018 nevertheless the vegetated standard configurations had better atrazine removal efficiencies compared to the non vegetated standard configurations mean values of 35 7 1 9 vs 17 6 1 3 respectively fig 2 this negative relationship between biomass load and atrazine removal indicates that the microbial biomass load in the biofiltration systems is not the only factor predicting atrazine removal and that atrazine removal in the vegetated systems might also be driven by plant uptake moreover there was no statistically significant difference in trzn abundance between the vegetated and non vegetated configurations p 0 1 fig 3 indeed atrazine uptake by vegetation has previously been reported by others chang et al 2005 lin et al 2011 unlike the non vegetated standard systems in vegetated standard systems higher atrazine removal was observed during the dry periods compared to wet periods mean percentage removal of 51 5 14 vs 37 6 8 respectively this result corresponds to the improvement in atrazine removal during dry periods previously seen in vegetated standard biofiltration systems zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 concluded that prolonged dry periods benefit the removal of some micropollutants our findings show that only the vegetated systems improve in atrazine removal performance following dry periods compared to the non vegetated ones therefore we suspect that the improvement in removal performance during dry periods results from the effect of vegetation i e atrazine uptake by plants which might be more significant at limited water availability 3 4 nutrients suspended solids and metals removal performance the adaptations that we made to the standard biofiltration system i e adding gac to the filter media and bioaugmentation with micropollutant degrading bacteria did not negatively affect tn tp tss and metals removal and the hydraulic conductivity the tn removal efficiencies of the prototype system were 97 98 during wet periods and 94 95 during dry periods figs s3 si these removal efficiencies are in a similar range or even better to those previously reported for standard systems 74 87 bratieres et al 2008 fletcher et al 2007 payne et al 2014b the tp removal efficiencies of the prototype system ranged between 85 and 92 lep and car respectively to 57 and 64 nvnb and nv respectively during wet periods and between 77 lep and car to 55 62 nvnb and nv respectively during dry periods figs s3 si the phosphorous removal efficiencies of the vegetated configuration are similar to what has been previously reported 55 90 bratieres et al 2008 fowdar et al 2021 hatt et al 2007 tss removal efficiencies of the prototype system were 79 86 during wet periods and 81 84 during dry periods these removal efficiencies resemble what has been reported by other studies 70 98 li et al 2020 zinger et al 2021 metals removals were tested at a single sampling event for the gold standard configuration car figs s4 si effluent levels of all metals of both of the systems met regulatory requirements anzecc and armcanz 2000 similar to what has been reported for standard biofiltration systems before al ameri et al 2018 blecken et al 2009 the total organic carbon removal in the prototype biofiltration system across all configurations ranged between 89 and 95 during wet periods and 61 to 80 during dry periods these toc removal efficiencies resemble what has been reported for standard biofiltration systems by other studies 38 97 zinger et al 2021 the introduction of the gac did not cause a difference in hydraulic conductivity over time indicated by the similarity in infiltration rates of the prototype and the standard systems p 0 1 figs s5 si moreover the two systems had no significant differences in ph conductivity and orp figs s5 si these results indicate that the higher atrazine removal observed in the prototype systems and by bioaugmentation has not come at the cost of removal performance of other stormwater pollutants demonstrating potential real world applicability of these prototype biofiltration systems further investigation of this prototype system should include performance testing on a variety of micropollutants using a consortium of micropollutant degrading microorganisms 4 concluding remarks this study aimed to adapt the design of stormwater biofiltration systems to improve the removal of micropollutants and understand the role of micropollutant degrading bacteria in bioremediation of stormwater in these systems the bioaugmentation of a aurescens led to higher rates of micropollutant degrading gene elevation in the prototype biofiltration design that contains gac compared to the standard design which contains sand specifically the kinetics of trzn gene abundance was accelerated in the prototype system compared to the standard system 0 8 0 06 vs 0 37 0 26 week 1 respectively these findings show a positive effect of supplementing gac in stormwater biofiltration systems as this can promote the proliferation of micropollutant degrading microorganisms within the stormwater biofiltration ecosystem furthermore it appears that gac lifespan was extended such that no exhaustion appeared despite loading the gac with one order of magnitude over the reported atrazine adsorption likely due to bio regeneration gac plays an important role in maintaining microbial biomass functions throughout fluctuation in micropollutant seasoning load which is typical for stormwater notably this high level of atrazine removal did not come at the expense of removal performance of other typical stormwater macropollutants e g nutrients suspended solids the micropollutants removal concepts studied here i e the combined effect of adsorption biodegradation and vegetation and shown to successfully remove atrazine from stormwater could potentially be transferred to different micropollutants upon further study in all tested aspects it seems that the prototype biofiltration system suggested in this study could be used to enhance atrazine free stormwater recycling reduce impacts on receiving waterways

16219,flocculation is a key process for controlling the fate and transport of suspended particulate matter spm in water environments and has received considerable attention in the field of water science e g oceanography limnology and hydrology remaining an active area of research the research on flocculation has been conducted to elucidate the spm dynamics and to diagnose various environmental issues the flocculation sedimentation and transportation of spm are closely linked to the compositional and structural properties of flocs in fact flocs are highly heterogeneous in terms of composition however the lack of comprehensive research on floc composition and structure has led to misconceptions regarding the temporal and spatial dynamics of spm this review summarizes the current understanding of the heterogeneous composition of flocs e g minerals organic matter metals microplastic engineered nanoparticles and its effect on their structure and on their fate and transport within aquatic environments furthermore the effects of human activities e g pollutant discharge construction on floc composition are discussed graphical abstract graphical abstract image

introduction flocculation involves a combined process of the aggregation and breakage of suspended particulate matter spm in the water environment as shown in fig 1 here aggregation induces particles to attach to each other to form larger flocs while breakage disaggregates large flocs into smaller flocs or into primary particles lee et al 2012 maggi 2005 flocculation determines the structure density and settling velocity of flocs and thus the overall governing fate and transport of spm alongside the recent changes in climate conditions and land use flocculation sedimentation and transportation can alter the spm dynamics and budget in water environments the water environment is full of dissolved substances and living and nonliving particles that are suspended in the water column in the continuum from river and estuary to coast flocs largely consist of minerals in estuarine and nearshore turbidity maximum zones while they contain more organic matter and low density aggregates e g marine snow in offshore zones the size density and settling velocity of these flocs determine their fate and transport under tidal currents while their concentration affects the water clarity clearly then the mineralogical and biological components of flocs are important parameters for understanding the spm dynamics in water environments various physical and biochemical processes result in some variation in floc structure and spm dynamics in terms of a short timescale tides waves and winds come into play while in terms of a long timescale seasonal climatological and interannual dynamics are significant seasonal dynamics are primarily caused by the seasonality of solar forcing that drives the physical e g weather conditions thermal stratification and light and biochemical e g primary production processes the result of human activities related to both land and water resources such as agriculture construction pollutant discharge eutrophication sediment deposition and dredging can also affect floc structure and spm dynamics the flocs in aquatic systems are highly heterogeneous in terms of composition droppo et al 1997 droppo 2001 maggi 2013 as shown in table 1 in fact flocs can be regarded as individual microecosystems with autonomous and interactive chemical physical and biological reactions and processes activating within the floc matrices droppo et al 1997 they contain three major groups of heterogeneous components including inorganic components that contain cohesive e g clay and noncohesive minerals e g sand quartz carbonates biological components that include living e g phytoplankton bacterial and nonliving components e g extracellular polymeric substances epss transparent extracellular polymers teps and chemical components that include ions e g metals and organic compounds e g glucose humic substances tang 2016 as noted above flocs can vary in their heterogeneous composition both temporally and spatially fettweis and lee 2017 the heterogeneous composition of flocs affects their structure porosity density and size and as such ultimately the spm dynamics in water environments this paper provides a review of the current understanding of the heterogeneous composition of flocs and its effect on floc structure and the spm dynamics in water environments a better understanding of the heterogeneous composition of flocs will ultimately enhance our knowledge regarding their compositional and structure properties as well as the spm dynamics in water environments 2 the heterogeneous composition of flocs 2 1 inorganic matter the inorganic matter in flocs can be categorized into minerals and naturally occurring metals inorganic matter meditates not only physical processes e g floc density settling and transportation droppo 2001 but also chemical processes e g the adsorption and transportation of pollutants and nutrients horowitz 1991 whereas this form of matter especially minerals can also provide habitats and reactive sites for bacterial colonization and chemical and biological reactions droppo and ongley 1994 liss et al 1996 2 1 1 minerals minerals are a major component of flocs mineral particles aggregate with one another and incorporate other dissolved and suspended substances into flocs ultimately determining the floc composition and structure for example as building materials mineral particles combine with particulate organic matter pom to assemble large settleable biomineral flocs chen et al 1994 here mineral particles and pom are arranged in an irregular and complex manner with pore spaces in the floc occupied by water droppo et al 1997 moreover mineral particles also provide habitats and sites for bacterial colonization and biochemical reaction droppo and ongley 1994 liss et al 1996 the suspended and deposited sediment in water environments is categorized according to size in terms of clay 2 μm silt 2 63 μm and sand 63 2000 μm as well as larger particles with a variety of mineral compositions mccave and hall 2006 walsh and nittrouer 2009 a large number of clay sized particles consist of clay minerals e g kaolinite montmorillonite illite as well as other minerals such as quartz carbonates or feldspars meanwhile quartz carbonates and other silicates typically appear in the silt and sand sized particles clay minerals are cohesive due to certain physicochemical attractive forces e g van der waals and electrostatic forces while silt and sand sized particles are less cohesive or even noncohesive clay and silt particles are the most abundant in a floc with sand particles seldomly found in this form of matter due to their heaviness and noncohesiveness clay minerals are tightly bound in the flocculi a compound word of floc and nuclei lee et al 2012 via electrostatic attraction with the flocculi subsequently aggregating further to form flocs through the gluing action of epss as shown in fig 2 yin 2013 this stepwise growth from primary particle to flocculi and floc tends to accelerate in aggregation favorable conditions with a high clay concentration and moderate turbulence silt can present a heterogeneous composition in a clay dominant floc while it is less cohesive tran and strom 2017 tran et al reported that when silt and clay minerals are in suspension clay dominant flocs can incorporate silt particles within the floc structure thereby increasing the floc density and settling velocity and changing the floc structure tran and strom 2017 as such silt sized particles can contribute to the heterogeneous composition of flocs however silt dominant flocs with less clay composition are highly porous and are readily broken down by turbulence li et al 1993 2 1 2 naturally occurring metals the metals that appear in nature can be incorporated into floc matrices metals undergo biogeochemical cycling and ultimately surface in aquatic environments having been released from rocks and top soil via erosion and weathering garrett 2000 at which point they are transported to waterbodies as dissolved ions chemically precipitated particles or sorbed to other particulate species metal rich precipitates are often found in flocs with a heterogeneous composition jonas and millward 2010 palanques et al 1995 for example the red colored precipitates of iron oxide easily attach to clay particles in soil and water while epss can also contribute to binding metals on flocs and to increasing the heterogeneity of the floc composition decho and gutierrez 2017 2 2 organic matter organic matter can be integrated into flocs in the forms of pom and dissolved organic matter dom while the latter is able to pass through a filter 0 45 μm the former is generally retained on the filter hartnett 2018 with its composition including living microorganisms e g bacteria phytoplankton and nonliving compounds e g teps coomassie stainable particles csps plant or animal debris and xenobiotic particles from human activities e g microplastics lee et al 2019 the quantity of pom in suspension can be determined by various methods loss on ignition for example involves the combustion of pom on a filter and will give the percentage of om in the spm wang et al 2011 other methods such as element analysis ehrhardt and koeve 1999 will give the concentration of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen while hplc method wright et al 1991 will provide the concentration of pigments such as chlorophyll a bacteria and phytoplankton can be quantified using conventional counting methods for example bacterial cells are generally counted via light or epifluorescence microscopy while phytoplankton cells tend to be enumerated using an electronic particle counter muthukrishnan et al 2017 picazo et al 2013 willén 1976 meanwhile teps and csps are generally quantified through staining with alcian blue ab and coomassie brilliant blue cbb respectively cisternas novoa et al 2014 passow and alldredge 1995 the dom in aquatic systems consists of numerous allochthonous and autochthonous organic compounds with a wide ranging molecular weight from micro e g organic acids to macromolecule e g fulvic and humic acids amy et al 1987 leenheer and jean philippe 2022 rashid and king 1969 epss can be an important part of either dom or pom depending on their molecular size significantly contributing to the heterogeneous composition of flocs with eps concentration generally quantified using total carbohydrates and protein analysis hung and santschi 2001 panagiotopoulos and sempéré 2005 smith et al 1985 the different analysis methods measure all or parts of the om in suspension and combine living and non living types of om that can be labile semi labile or refractory as a simple distinction pom can be separated into a freshly produced free floating and a mineral associated more refractory om fraction schartau et al 2019 the mineral associated and the freshly produced pom have different susceptibilities towards microbial degradation arndt et al 2013 the mineral associated om content is a function of the available mineral surface area and is particularly bound with phyllosilicates blattmann et al 2019 keil et al 1994 mayer 1994 the relative fractions of freshly produced labile om along with the rather recalcitrant mineral associated om of the spm change with spm concentration and season fettweis et al 2022 schartau et al 2019 below a more specific classification of the pom and dom is given based on the above mentioned methods and on its origin 2 2 1 microorganisms some microorganisms especially phytoplankton form biological flocs in aquatic systems often adhering to mineral particles and building large biomineral flocs many phytoplankton species have extruding spines or hairs that enhance flocculation via the mechanical adhesion or entanglement of the particles kiørboe et al 1990 microorganisms are thus important heterogeneous components of flocs and can be used to determine their morphological aspects including size porosity and density alldredge and gotschalk 1989 kranck and milligan 1980 the stickiness and flocculation potential of phytoplankton cells are based on the frequency and efficiency of cell collision and attachment which depends on the cells physicochemical and biological properties kiørboe et al 1990 kiørboe and hansen 1993 the stickiness and flocculation potential become particularly high in nutrient depleted conditions smetacek 1985 notably the stickiness and flocculation potential depend on the generic species of phytoplankton for example in lake environments colonial phytoplankton species e g aphanotece attach better to mineral particles and form larger flocs than filamentous species e g aphanizomenon de lucas pardo et al 2015 verspagen et al 2006 marine snow is a special type of organic rich floc that appears in offshore areas with a floc size of over 500 μm and a composition of detritus living organisms and inorganic matter alldredge and silver 1988 turner 2015 marine snow has a fluffy structure with high porosity and a heterogeneous composition maerz et al 2020 with phytoplankton and phytodetritus as the main components turner 2015 a high population of phytoplankton in aquatic environments increases the occurrence of marine snow as such the presence of marine snow indicates the high productivity of the aquatic ecosystem the interaction between heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton also promotes a bacteria mediated aggregation of microbial cells the stickiness and flocculatio potential of bacteria vary depending on the bacterial taxa or exopolymers tran et al 2020 certain species of bacteria influence phytoplanktonic physiology and enhance the stickiness and flocculation of phytoplankton cells decho 1990 heissenberger and herndl 1994 other species of bacteria have also attach directly to phytoplankton and enhance flocculation gärdes et al 2010 grossart et al 2006 2 2 2 nonliving organic particles detrital pom is produced via the decaying of various aquatic and terrestrial organisms e g plant litter cyanobacterial fungi algae and becomes suspended in the water column and ultimately contributes to floc formation as a heterogeneous ingredient the main sources of detrital pom include zooplankton phytoplankton terrestrial plants and animals with the matter diversified in terms of properties depending on the source various detrital pom species can thus act as heterogeneous ingredients in floc formation fecal pellets generally secreted by filter feeders e g mussels oysters can also contribute to flocs with a heterogeneous composition for example mussels enhance biological fouling and result in the conversion of slowly sinking organic and inorganic spm into large and fast sinking fecal pellets which can be regarded as large biomineral flocs mussels can thus enhance the stability of spm deposits on the sea floor making them resistant to tidal currents furthermore when fecal pellets are decomposed via biological and tidal actions they are subject to resuspension and flocculation in the water column winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 2 2 3 extracellular polymeric substances the production of epss is a general feature of microorganisms in water environments which occurs in eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms wingender et al 1999 in simple terms epss are polymeric substances biosynthesized from several strains of microorganisms flemming and wingender 2010 eps formation from microbial cells has many origins including cell surface material shedding active secretion from microorganisms cell lysis and sorption from the environment liu and fang 2003 wingender et al 1999 however when microorganisms exist within nitrogen limiting conditions they produce more epss as the intracellular carbon cannot be allocated for growth bhaskar and bhosle 2005 engel et al 2004 the nitrogen concentration is often used as an indicator of eps production in water sediment environments the epss act as polymeric bridges between particles to build large settleable flocs here multivalent cations can further enhance the formation of polymeric bridges by connecting between the functional sites of epss and the negatively charged sites of bacterial and mineral particles zhang et al 2015 the epss and binding cations mitigate the overall negative surface charge of particles thereby increasing the flocculation potential of particles nouha et al 2018 schmidt and ahring 1994 shen et al 1993 clearly epss play an important role in flocculation and are a key component in the heterogeneous composition of flocs in general epss are classified into soluble and bound substances as shown in fig 3 soluble epss include macromolecules slimes and colloids while bound epss include capsular polymers loosely bound polymers condensed gels sheaths and attached organic compounds comte et al 2006 laspidou and rittmann 2002 nielsen and jahn 1999 yu et al 2008 soluble epss are also termed soluble microbial products smp and can move freely among the microbial flocs and the surrounding liquid meanwhile bound epss exhibit a dynamic double layer like structure and can be roughly grouped into loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps liang et al 2010 ramesh et al 2006 these substances also differ in terms of chemical composition under different environmental conditions of microbial communities with the most abundant chemical compounds of eps being polysaccharides and proteins leppard 1997 more et al 2012 nouha et al 2015 santschi et al 1998 subramanian et al 2010 while more minor compounds include humic substances hs nucleic acids uronic acids humic acids and lipids d abzac et al 2010a d abzac et al 2010b nguyen et al 2016 sutherland 2001b wingender et al 1999 2 2 4 transparent exopolymer particles as a special particulate species of eps teps are ubiquitous in water environments while this has only been known since the development of quantification methods from 1993 onward alldredge et al 1993 the average size of teps has been determined to be larger than 0 4 μm while they tend to present various forms including clouds amorphous blobs sheets filaments or clumps alldredge et al 1993 berman and passow 2007 this form of particle can be regarded as a sticky building material in flocs since it exists in particle form rather than as a cell coating or dissolved slime as shown in fig 4 alldredge et al 1993 the quantity of teps varies spatially in the continuum from river and estuaryto coast in low turbid environments the quantity of teps in marine and fresh waters is similar to that of phytoplankton with the highest occurrence appearing in phytoplankton blooms in contrast in turbid environments e g a turbidity maximum zone a large quantity of minerals can adsorb teps on their surface and hence tep coated or tep associated minerals are deposited on the bed layer therefore the quantity of teps tends to decrease in turbid waters during the summer bloom season the clay minerals in turbid environments can thus facilitate the stabilization and burial of organic matter i e tep depending on their abundance blattmann et al 2019 fettweis et al 2022 keil et al 1994 mayer 1994 the teps enhance flocculation and are an important heterogeneous component of flocs due to their adhering capacity as polymeric binders or glue highly viscose and sticky teps can enhance flocculation as they combine numerous solids nonsticky particles cells debris and dissolved substances passow 2002b an abundance of teps will also enhance the probability of particle collision in the water environment jackson 1995 passow et al 1994 thereby increasing the particle aggregation rate however it is important to note that not all the tep species have the same adhesive quality with teps from nondiatom microorganisms not as sticky as those from diatom species kiørboe and hansen 1993 logan et al 1995 passow and alldredge 1994 while teps and epss have been categorized into the same biopolymer group in scientific communities in the authors opinion teps should be classified into a subgroup of epss li et al 2016 morelle et al 2017 passow 2002b in fact while both teps and epss contain a large proportion of acidic polysaccharides passow 2002a 2002b they do not include exactly the same substances while not all epss are a tep precursor nor do they develop into teps passow 2002b furthermore teps and epss should ideally be measured using different analytical methods since they present different physicochemical properties xu et al 2018 in short teps and epss should be regarded as independent indices and should be investigated as such to ensure a better understanding of the heterogeneous composition of flocs 2 2 5 coomassie stainable particles coomassie stainable particles are transparent gel like particles and can be characterized as protein including particles as shown in fig 4 they are present everywhere in water environments and are abundant in cultures of cyanobacteria diatoms and heterotrophic bacteria indicating that microorganisms are a significant source cisternas novoa et al 2015 huang et al 2016 long and azam 1996 thornton 2018 in a study on phytoplankton mesocosm the quantity of csps was found to be similar to that of teps prieto et al 2002 however csps are generally more labile and less sticky than teps thornton 2018 in seawater csps are 3 13 times more numerous and have a surface area of up to two orders of magnitude greater than teps thus while a fraction of csps may overlap teps the remaining fraction of the former will tend to differ from the latter long and azam 1996 however there is a lack of information on csps compared with teps engel et al 2020 in fact csps can be an important heterogeneous component in flocs given their abundance in aquatic systems however the flocculation and sedimentation of csps in water environments have not been comprehensively investigated cisternas novoa et al 2015 and few studies have found that csps have less effect on flocculation than teps the role of teps in flocculation and sedimentation has been better identified than that of csps prieto et al 2002 2 2 6 humic substances humic substances hs are an important pool of transient refractory organic carbon in the geosphere and they are present everywhere in soil and water environments hs is produced mainly through the decay of terrestrial and aquatic plants hs is classified into humic acids ha fulvic acids fa and humin hu beck et al 1974 black and christman 1963 schnitzer and khan 1972 sipler and bronk 2015 in freshwater hs comprises 50 80 of the total dom black and christman 1963 rocker et al 2012 in contrast hs in the ocean comprises only a small fraction of the total dom 0 7 2 4 because a large part of hs is removed in the estuarine and coastal zone opsahl and benner 1997 hs can thus be an important component of the om in flocs in fresh or estuarine water environments adsorption of hs on spm such as clay minerals is common in both fresh and saline waters chotzen et al 2016 kloster and avena 2015 rashid et al 1972 hs adsorption on spm enhances particle stabilization in freshwater whereas it promotes flocculation of hs and particles and incorporation of hs into floc matrices in brackish and saline water such as estuarine and coastal zones hs adsorption on spm and hs mediated flocculation are usually higher in brackish and saline water than in freshwater due to the compression of the electrical double layer and reduction of the electrostatic repulsion between hs and spm rashid et al 1972 sieburth and jensen 1968 swanson and palacas 1965 besides high salinity low ph and abundant metal ions increase hs adsorption and hs mediated flocculation kholodov et al 2014 komy et al 2014 hs associated with flocs also scavenges trace inorganic elements in estuaries nissenbaum and swaine 1976 sholkovitz 1976 therefore hs is not only an important heterogeneous component of flocs but also a mediator that scavenges other components into floc matrices especially in brackish and saline water 2 3 water and pore space 2 3 1 water in flocs water in and around flocs consists of bound surface interstitial and free waters which reside in or flow around the flocs vesilind and martel 1990 such waters affect floc formation and biota droppo 2001 with the water running through the flocs potentially incorporating inorganic and organic particles into the floc matrices droppo et al 1997 furthermore when water flows through flocs it acts as a food stream supplying nutrients and trace elements to the existing biota and exchanging waste products bound water is chemically bound to solid particles kopper 2017 bound and surface waters are barely detached via fluid shear force vesilind 1994 since they are tightly bound via chemical bonding physical adsorption and mechanical capture in both micro and macro capillaries of porous media wu et al 2018 surface water occasionally referred to as vicinal water includes water attached to the surface of solid particles via adsorption and adhesion forces vaxelaire and cézac 2004 meanwhile free water is bound by capillary forces acting between flocs and the surrounding water thus it does not reach the inner particles and pore space directly free water can also be washed away by fluid shear force kopp and dichtl 2001 finally interstitial water occupies the pore space of flocs it is retained inside the floc by capillary forces but turns into free water when the flocs are broken vesilind and martel 1990 2 3 2 pore space in flocs the pore space plays an important role in determining floc structure and density when particles aggregate to form large flocs they create pore space in the floc matrices droppo 2001 the pore space generally occupied by water i e pore water necessarily affects floc structure and density li and ganczarczyk 1988 logan and hunt 1987 sherman 1953 flocs are assembled in a hierarchical manner in terms of the arrangement of particles and pore space for example a tight assemblage of particles can result in dense flocculi with nanoscale pore space with the assemblage of flocculi subsequently developing microflocs with a moderate pore meanwhile a loose assemblage of microflocs results in macroflocs with a large pore as shown in fig 5 the hierarchical assemblage of flocculi microflocs and macroflocs determines the porosity density settling velocity and transportation of the flocs within the water environment gorczyca 2000 pore space also serves as active media hosting physical and biochemical reactions of the various chemicals and nutrients present in flocs these reactions within the floc especially those in the pore space can cause a modification of floc structure and density and can affect floc hydrodynamics and transportation in aquatic environments droppo 2001 for example if flocs consist of several of epss due to microbial growth in the pore space they will contain numerous fibrils and will thus develop a fluffy less dense floc structure liss et al reported that eps fibrils could enlarge the pore space and change the flocs morphology and settling velocity liss et al 1996 2 4 xenobiotic substances among several varieties of xenobiotic substances microplastics and engineered nanoparticles are the most prominent and threatening substances these xenobiotics are usually well dispersed in aquatic environments due to electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobicity but they are often subject to flocculation and become heterogeneous components of flocs under favorable conditions eps as natural tackiness agents enhance attachment between xenobiotics and other particles and flocculation bacosa et al 2018 cunha et al 2019 gao et al 2019 shiu et al 2020 other types of organic matter e g hs may also enhance xenobiotics associated flocculation but they may have less effect on flocculation than eps because of their low molecular weight and tackiness the eps role in xenobiotics associated flocculation is reviewed in the following sections 2 4 1 microplastics microplastics are small plastic particles 5 mm that are ubiquitous in aquatic environments taylor et al 2016 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 they have been found everywhere from the poles to the tropics and from surface waters to seafloors van sebille et al 2015 they are released into various water bodies and are ultimately transported into the oceans andrady 2011 lebreton et al 2017 woodall et al 2014 as a result the sediment deposits on the seafloor are often recognized as a major sink of mps chen et al 2020 the population density of mps in coastal sediments was found to range from 259 to 1743 items l of sediment bashir et al 2021 while they have also been found in the guts of over 300 different marine species kühn et al 2015 thus mps are regarded as emerging and threatening pollutants for both aquatic ecosystems and humans meanwhile while data are limited mps particularly those 300 µm in diameter are likely to associate with spm and be transported within heterogeneous flocculated materials nizzetto et al 2016 stickiness is a key characteristic of flocs that facilitates the scavenging of mps in the water column and results in an accumulation of mps on river or sea floors and the benthic food web cunha et al 2019 de haan et al 2019 sakhon et al 2019 while mps transport deposit and resuspend they can become associated with spm and become incorporated into floc matrices michels et al 2018 it is also important to note that the stickiness between mps and spm has been found to depend on the size and shape of the mps which are governed by weathering including abiotic physicochemical and biotic processes as well as mechanical degradation and fragmentation arp et al 2021 however mps are not only building materials of flocs but also a controlling factor in flocculation and sedimentation for example if mps adhere to flocs via the action of sticky epss or teps they change the floc morphology and density michels et al 2018 nguyen et al 2020 furthermore large mps 100 s micron can provide a habitat for microorganisms and exudate substrates or become precursors for biofilm formation the plastisphere eich et al 2015 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 oberbeckmann et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2016 yang et al 2020 zettler et al 2013 since biofilm is essentially a sticky eps matrix on mps it is likely to increase the stickiness of the mps and mp associated flocs and consequently the scavenging capacity in terms of other suspended particles petrova and sauer 2012 sutherland 2001a beside eps other natural organic matter such as hs can be a component of mp associated flocs wells and stretz 2019 hs can also adsorb on the surface of mps and become a heterogeneous component of mp associated flocs and it eventually changes the fate and transport of mps and hs in aquatic environments abdurahman et al 2020 alimi et al 2018 tourinho et al 2019 notably mps are not only heterogeneous components of flocs but also mediators or scavengers of other components of flocs thereby changing the compositional and structural characteristics of flocs 2 4 2 engineered nanoparticles engineered nanoparticles enps are now often found in water environments following the development of nanotechnology industries in recent years the enps are released into these environments from various industrial sources including paints coatings cosmetics catalysts lubricants food packaging water and wastewater treatments plant protection products and human and veterinary medicines for example the use of personal care and cosmetic products in the city of macao was estimated to release over 37 billion enps per year into water environments via wastewater treatment plants bashir et al 2021 the fate and transport of enps in water environments are driven by physical and biochemical processes such as advection and dispersion partitioning to sediment and biotic and abiotic degradation boxall et al 2007 with the enps ultimately increasing the toxicity to organisms through the food webs maurer jones et al 2013 however the knowledge on enps remains largely lacking in terms of their fate and transport in water environments due to the diversity of enp species and the complexity of the enp associated physical and biochemical processes in aquatic environments dunphy guzman et al 2006 fabrega et al 2011 oberdörster et al 2005 furthermore little consideration of enps has been adopted in studies on the heterogeneous composition of flocs enps associate with eps in floc matrices through electrostatic interaction resulting in the incorporation of enps into heterogeneous floc matrices adeleye and keller 2016 fernando et al 2020 for example metal or metal oxide enps with a positive surface charge such as al2o3 zno fe3o4 and ceo2 easily attach to the negatively charged functional groups of epss and enhance flocculation via charge neutralization in contrast enps with a negative surface charge such as sio2 cuo and carbon composites do not interact with epss inhibiting floc formation huangfu et al 2019 miao et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 enps also interact with hs which has lower molecular weights than eps previous studies have shown that hs can stabilize enps through patchy coatings on enps baalousha et al 2011 gibson et al 2007 hou et al 2017 however the presence of divalent ions such as ca2 and mg2 could promote attachment between hs and enps and the formation of hs enp flocs chen and elimelech 2007 as shown in fig 6 in other words the negative charge of hs on enps can be neutralized by divalent cations which then reduce the electrostatic repulsion and cause the flocculation of enps liu et al 2010 saleh et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 thus hs is also an important factor in enp associated flocculation depending on the environmental conditions e g the presence of mono or divalent ions 2 5 oil droplets oil spills occur at various sources in the oil industries often due to small incidents such as spills from ship refueling or large accidents such as pipeline breakage oil tanker stranding drilling operation failure or transportation related accidents oil droplets can easily adhere to spm due to their hydrophobicity and are thus incorporated into flocs with a heterogeneous composition the collision and attachment of oil droplets and spm can enhance flocculation which facilitates the scavenging and deposition of oil droplets from the water column to the river sea bed lee 2002 a previous study demonstrated that 87 98 of spilled oil is transformed into either oil globules or oil spm aggregates gordon jr et al 1973 and boehm reported that a high spm concentration enhances the formation and deposition of oil droplet spm flocs due to the increase in the collision and attachment between droplets and spm boehm 1987 the size and shape of both droplets and spm are also critical for oil spm floc formation as shown in fig 7 lee and stoffyn egli 2001 oil droplets can also interact with epss with the two substances potentially attaching to each other to form flocs with a heterogeneous composition much like eps enriched marine snow as shown in fig 8 quigg et al 2016 gutierrez et al reported that the eps producing bacteria that are abundant in oil spill sites could enhance floc formation which will ultimately lead to the degradation of hydrocarbons gutierrez et al 2013 in the current authors opinion since oil droplets spm and epss are highly mutually interactive they undoubtedly contribute to flocs with a heterogeneous composition oil droplets in aquatic environments often attach to pom and minerals cloutier et al 2002 lee 2002 lee et al showed that pom e g phytoplankton readily form oil organic aggregates lee et al 1985 grazing by zooplankton also enhances the transportation of oil droplets through the excretion of fecal pellets conover 1971 mackie et al 1978 subsequently the fecal pellets can be trapped in the net of sticky components of flocs there are thus various pathways for oil droplets to be incorporated into flocs 3 insight into flocs with heterogeneous composition and structure fractal dimensions have been used as a traditional empirical index of floc composition and structure in the past few decades the fractal dimension of a floc describes its space filling capacity for primary particles and ranges from 1 to 3 the higher the value the more compact and uniform the floc will be wheatland 2017 a dense floc has a relatively high fractal dimension of around 2 3 2 5 or higher while a fluffy floc has a low fractal dimension of around 1 7 1 8 lee et al 2005 the fractal dimension was found to increase with a higher suspended sediment concentration in intertidal mudflats implying that the floc structure becomes more dense and compact with abundant suspended sediments dyer and manning 1999 in contrast the fractal dimension tends to decrease with higher organic matter content indicating that the floc structure becomes less dense and more fluffy in biologically enriched conditions much like the marine snow in an offshore zone chen and eisma 1995 dyer and manning 1999 for example larsen et al found that flocs with high organic matter content are more porous less dense and less settleable and are thus more mobile in water environments than flocs with low organic matter content larsen et al 2009a however recent studies have revealed the non fractal nature of flocs in the water environment while investigating detailed floc composition and structure spencer et al 2021 recent developments in 3d volumetric imaging of flocs wheatland et al 2017 wheatland et al 2020 enables new insight into flocs with heterogeneous composition and structure based on their 3d analysis wheatland et al revealed that the geometries of individual components are far more complex than suggested by traditional 2d imaging techniques here the authors analyzed a 3d dataset and could recognize five basic elements of flocs pore space clay minerals nonclay minerals microbial cells and organic detritus fig 9 here irregularly shaped objects with high gray level values were deemed to be organic detritus while the nonclay minerals were differentiated based on their distinct blocky irregular morphology and uniform gray scale value within 3d datasets the volumes of each component and pore space in a given floc could be successfully quantified and the authors could also identify epss linking multiplatelet clay particles within the primary structure of flocculi and could discern micrometer sized pores between the substructures of flocs wheatland et al 2017 wheatland 2017 state of the art microscopic techniques could reconstruct a 3d image of a typical estuarine floc with heterogeneous composition e g clay minerals and other organic substances spencer and coworkers further identified the hierarchical floc structures associated with heterogeneous composition in a stepwise particle floc aggregation process droppo et al 1997 droppo and ongley 1994 spencer et al 2021 in the earlier stage of the aggregation process clay minerals are organized into multiparticle units aligned in either stacked or stepped arrangement fig 10 a then heterogeneous components such as clay and nonclay minerals pores unicellular organisms filamentous cyanobacteria decaying organic detritus and organo mineral debris are organized in a more complex manner figs 10 b d here eps plays an important role in combining heterogeneous components in floc structures liss et al 1996 spencer et al 2021 such heterogeneous flocs further aggregate to macroflocs and megaflocs which have large tortuous pore channels in their floc structure providing good habitats for bacteria populations e g filamentous cyanobacteria this observation on the hierarchical floc structure with heterogeneous composition agrees well with previous studies because om i e eps tep as heterogeneous composition enhances the flocculation and formation of less dense biomineral flocs alldredge and gotschalk 1989 chen and eisma 1995 passow 2002b 4 human activities affecting floc composition 4 1 pollutant discharge and eutrophication a wide variety of particulate and dissolved pollutants are dischared from urban and industrial areas to water environments müller et al 2020 siddique and kiani 2020 such particulate pollutants include mps enps soil particles road dust particles from various industries and soot from combustion whereas dissolved pollutants consist of various organic e g petrochemical compounds and inorganic e g heavy metals ionic species pollutants cisneros 2011 müller et al 2020 agricultural areas also discharge various particulate and dissolved pollutants including sediments biomass microorganisms nutrients pesticides salts metals and so on mateo sagasta et al 2017 particulate pollutants from the urban industrial and agriculture areas may contribute to formation of flocs with heterogeneous composition also dissolved organic and inorganic pollutants may adsorb on spm and finally become a part of flocs awad et al 2019 certain components of the flocs in aquatic systems emanate from the runoff or discharge from landcover and the associated land use as shown in fig 11 here the level of impact depends on the intensity of the activities which include agriculture timber harvesting housing industry and road construction these activities will provide various components of flocs including minerals organic matter metals mps enps and oil droplets in addition the discharge of excessive nutrients via human activities e g sewage animal waste atmospheric deposition and fertilizer application enhances phytoplankton blooms and changes the spm dynamics i e flocculation sedimentation deposition and resuspension in the water environment phytoplankton bloom can deteriorate due to climate changes population increases industrialization and agribusiness development anderson et al 2002 rabalais et al 2009 specifically the phosphorus and nitrogen loads from watersheds are known to be the main drivers of phytoplankton production and bloom anderson et al 2002 phytoplankton bloom increases the eps tep concentration since certain phytoplankton species produce a large quantity of eps tep precursors typically in the decaying phase of algal bloom decho and gutierrez 2017 lee et al 2019 lee et al 2012 increasing the quantity of phytoplankton and eps tep in the eutrophic condition can ultimately enhance the formation of large and highly settleable biomineral flocs and sedimentation and deposition on river lake estuarine coastal and sea floors droppo 2001 larsen et al 2009b 4 2 construction activities alongside marine and inland navigation and construction dredging can result in the resuspension of various mineral and organic particles flocs from river or sea floors into water columns and can thus affect floc composition and structure such resuspended particles from a dredging site are subject to transportation i e dispersion and advection flocculation sedimentation and deposition and they may ultimately cause harmful siltation in nearby benthic ecological systems dankers 2002 dredging may also cause the resuspension of particulate heavy metals and other organic and inorganic pollutants sin et al 1991 tang et al 1997 river dam construction can also affect flocculation and the heterogeneous composition of flocs such dams can alter the ecological hydrological and biogeochemical conditions which subsequently alter the organic matter and spm composition in the river water for example a river with a constructed dam can become more lacustrine than riverine with this lacustrine condition facilitating algae bloom and eps tep production and ultimately enhancing flocculation with heterogeneous composition lee et al 2019 meanwhile offshore wind farms owfs can also affect flocculation with a heterogeneous composition and the spm dynamics in water environments the construction operation and decommission activities of owfs can enhance phytoplankton growth and organic matter i e eps and tep production while also changing the flow and turbulence near the sea floor van berkel et al 2020 for example ivanov et al demonstrated that the total organic carbon toc concentration increased up to 50 in an area of 5 km around the monopiles of the owfs ivanov et al 2021 a high toc concentration around owfs indicates an abundance of organic matter which could affect floc composition and structure moreover the owf structures act as artificial reefs providing new habitats for filter feeders e g clams snails oysters mussels with the fecal pellets secreted by the filter feeders potentially contributing to floc composition and structure as was noted in section 3 2 5 conclusions it is well known that spm is indispensable in water environments with its fate and transport involved in various current environmental issues including water pollution ecosystem destruction and natural disasters i e siltation and erosion understanding flocculation with a heterogeneous composition which is the core process in the fate and transport of spm must be the first step in protecting or reducing these environmental issues the heterogeneous composition of flocs includes inorganic matter e g inorganic particulate matter heavy metals organic matter e g eps tep hs pom pore water and xenobiotic particulate matter e g mps enps oil droplets each component has a unique function in floc formation with heterogeneous composition for instance clay minerals and pom are basic building materials for flocs eps and tep make bridges among particles and thus promote flocculation hs also enhances the connection among particles under suitable conditions e g the presence of divalent cations and high ionic strength mps provide habitats and substrates for microorganisms which can create biofilms and scavenge various dissolved and particulate matter the interaction between enps and hs can enhance flocculation under favorable physicochemical conditions human activities such as pollutant discharge eutrophication and construction can be additional drivers for facilitating flocculation with a heterogeneous composition however in the current authors opinion flocculation with a heterogeneous composition is at present not fully understood within the scientific communities in short more efforts should be made to investigate flocs with a heterogeneous composition specifically in terms of their effects on the current environmental issues declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16219,flocculation is a key process for controlling the fate and transport of suspended particulate matter spm in water environments and has received considerable attention in the field of water science e g oceanography limnology and hydrology remaining an active area of research the research on flocculation has been conducted to elucidate the spm dynamics and to diagnose various environmental issues the flocculation sedimentation and transportation of spm are closely linked to the compositional and structural properties of flocs in fact flocs are highly heterogeneous in terms of composition however the lack of comprehensive research on floc composition and structure has led to misconceptions regarding the temporal and spatial dynamics of spm this review summarizes the current understanding of the heterogeneous composition of flocs e g minerals organic matter metals microplastic engineered nanoparticles and its effect on their structure and on their fate and transport within aquatic environments furthermore the effects of human activities e g pollutant discharge construction on floc composition are discussed graphical abstract graphical abstract image

introduction flocculation involves a combined process of the aggregation and breakage of suspended particulate matter spm in the water environment as shown in fig 1 here aggregation induces particles to attach to each other to form larger flocs while breakage disaggregates large flocs into smaller flocs or into primary particles lee et al 2012 maggi 2005 flocculation determines the structure density and settling velocity of flocs and thus the overall governing fate and transport of spm alongside the recent changes in climate conditions and land use flocculation sedimentation and transportation can alter the spm dynamics and budget in water environments the water environment is full of dissolved substances and living and nonliving particles that are suspended in the water column in the continuum from river and estuary to coast flocs largely consist of minerals in estuarine and nearshore turbidity maximum zones while they contain more organic matter and low density aggregates e g marine snow in offshore zones the size density and settling velocity of these flocs determine their fate and transport under tidal currents while their concentration affects the water clarity clearly then the mineralogical and biological components of flocs are important parameters for understanding the spm dynamics in water environments various physical and biochemical processes result in some variation in floc structure and spm dynamics in terms of a short timescale tides waves and winds come into play while in terms of a long timescale seasonal climatological and interannual dynamics are significant seasonal dynamics are primarily caused by the seasonality of solar forcing that drives the physical e g weather conditions thermal stratification and light and biochemical e g primary production processes the result of human activities related to both land and water resources such as agriculture construction pollutant discharge eutrophication sediment deposition and dredging can also affect floc structure and spm dynamics the flocs in aquatic systems are highly heterogeneous in terms of composition droppo et al 1997 droppo 2001 maggi 2013 as shown in table 1 in fact flocs can be regarded as individual microecosystems with autonomous and interactive chemical physical and biological reactions and processes activating within the floc matrices droppo et al 1997 they contain three major groups of heterogeneous components including inorganic components that contain cohesive e g clay and noncohesive minerals e g sand quartz carbonates biological components that include living e g phytoplankton bacterial and nonliving components e g extracellular polymeric substances epss transparent extracellular polymers teps and chemical components that include ions e g metals and organic compounds e g glucose humic substances tang 2016 as noted above flocs can vary in their heterogeneous composition both temporally and spatially fettweis and lee 2017 the heterogeneous composition of flocs affects their structure porosity density and size and as such ultimately the spm dynamics in water environments this paper provides a review of the current understanding of the heterogeneous composition of flocs and its effect on floc structure and the spm dynamics in water environments a better understanding of the heterogeneous composition of flocs will ultimately enhance our knowledge regarding their compositional and structure properties as well as the spm dynamics in water environments 2 the heterogeneous composition of flocs 2 1 inorganic matter the inorganic matter in flocs can be categorized into minerals and naturally occurring metals inorganic matter meditates not only physical processes e g floc density settling and transportation droppo 2001 but also chemical processes e g the adsorption and transportation of pollutants and nutrients horowitz 1991 whereas this form of matter especially minerals can also provide habitats and reactive sites for bacterial colonization and chemical and biological reactions droppo and ongley 1994 liss et al 1996 2 1 1 minerals minerals are a major component of flocs mineral particles aggregate with one another and incorporate other dissolved and suspended substances into flocs ultimately determining the floc composition and structure for example as building materials mineral particles combine with particulate organic matter pom to assemble large settleable biomineral flocs chen et al 1994 here mineral particles and pom are arranged in an irregular and complex manner with pore spaces in the floc occupied by water droppo et al 1997 moreover mineral particles also provide habitats and sites for bacterial colonization and biochemical reaction droppo and ongley 1994 liss et al 1996 the suspended and deposited sediment in water environments is categorized according to size in terms of clay 2 μm silt 2 63 μm and sand 63 2000 μm as well as larger particles with a variety of mineral compositions mccave and hall 2006 walsh and nittrouer 2009 a large number of clay sized particles consist of clay minerals e g kaolinite montmorillonite illite as well as other minerals such as quartz carbonates or feldspars meanwhile quartz carbonates and other silicates typically appear in the silt and sand sized particles clay minerals are cohesive due to certain physicochemical attractive forces e g van der waals and electrostatic forces while silt and sand sized particles are less cohesive or even noncohesive clay and silt particles are the most abundant in a floc with sand particles seldomly found in this form of matter due to their heaviness and noncohesiveness clay minerals are tightly bound in the flocculi a compound word of floc and nuclei lee et al 2012 via electrostatic attraction with the flocculi subsequently aggregating further to form flocs through the gluing action of epss as shown in fig 2 yin 2013 this stepwise growth from primary particle to flocculi and floc tends to accelerate in aggregation favorable conditions with a high clay concentration and moderate turbulence silt can present a heterogeneous composition in a clay dominant floc while it is less cohesive tran and strom 2017 tran et al reported that when silt and clay minerals are in suspension clay dominant flocs can incorporate silt particles within the floc structure thereby increasing the floc density and settling velocity and changing the floc structure tran and strom 2017 as such silt sized particles can contribute to the heterogeneous composition of flocs however silt dominant flocs with less clay composition are highly porous and are readily broken down by turbulence li et al 1993 2 1 2 naturally occurring metals the metals that appear in nature can be incorporated into floc matrices metals undergo biogeochemical cycling and ultimately surface in aquatic environments having been released from rocks and top soil via erosion and weathering garrett 2000 at which point they are transported to waterbodies as dissolved ions chemically precipitated particles or sorbed to other particulate species metal rich precipitates are often found in flocs with a heterogeneous composition jonas and millward 2010 palanques et al 1995 for example the red colored precipitates of iron oxide easily attach to clay particles in soil and water while epss can also contribute to binding metals on flocs and to increasing the heterogeneity of the floc composition decho and gutierrez 2017 2 2 organic matter organic matter can be integrated into flocs in the forms of pom and dissolved organic matter dom while the latter is able to pass through a filter 0 45 μm the former is generally retained on the filter hartnett 2018 with its composition including living microorganisms e g bacteria phytoplankton and nonliving compounds e g teps coomassie stainable particles csps plant or animal debris and xenobiotic particles from human activities e g microplastics lee et al 2019 the quantity of pom in suspension can be determined by various methods loss on ignition for example involves the combustion of pom on a filter and will give the percentage of om in the spm wang et al 2011 other methods such as element analysis ehrhardt and koeve 1999 will give the concentration of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen while hplc method wright et al 1991 will provide the concentration of pigments such as chlorophyll a bacteria and phytoplankton can be quantified using conventional counting methods for example bacterial cells are generally counted via light or epifluorescence microscopy while phytoplankton cells tend to be enumerated using an electronic particle counter muthukrishnan et al 2017 picazo et al 2013 willén 1976 meanwhile teps and csps are generally quantified through staining with alcian blue ab and coomassie brilliant blue cbb respectively cisternas novoa et al 2014 passow and alldredge 1995 the dom in aquatic systems consists of numerous allochthonous and autochthonous organic compounds with a wide ranging molecular weight from micro e g organic acids to macromolecule e g fulvic and humic acids amy et al 1987 leenheer and jean philippe 2022 rashid and king 1969 epss can be an important part of either dom or pom depending on their molecular size significantly contributing to the heterogeneous composition of flocs with eps concentration generally quantified using total carbohydrates and protein analysis hung and santschi 2001 panagiotopoulos and sempéré 2005 smith et al 1985 the different analysis methods measure all or parts of the om in suspension and combine living and non living types of om that can be labile semi labile or refractory as a simple distinction pom can be separated into a freshly produced free floating and a mineral associated more refractory om fraction schartau et al 2019 the mineral associated and the freshly produced pom have different susceptibilities towards microbial degradation arndt et al 2013 the mineral associated om content is a function of the available mineral surface area and is particularly bound with phyllosilicates blattmann et al 2019 keil et al 1994 mayer 1994 the relative fractions of freshly produced labile om along with the rather recalcitrant mineral associated om of the spm change with spm concentration and season fettweis et al 2022 schartau et al 2019 below a more specific classification of the pom and dom is given based on the above mentioned methods and on its origin 2 2 1 microorganisms some microorganisms especially phytoplankton form biological flocs in aquatic systems often adhering to mineral particles and building large biomineral flocs many phytoplankton species have extruding spines or hairs that enhance flocculation via the mechanical adhesion or entanglement of the particles kiørboe et al 1990 microorganisms are thus important heterogeneous components of flocs and can be used to determine their morphological aspects including size porosity and density alldredge and gotschalk 1989 kranck and milligan 1980 the stickiness and flocculation potential of phytoplankton cells are based on the frequency and efficiency of cell collision and attachment which depends on the cells physicochemical and biological properties kiørboe et al 1990 kiørboe and hansen 1993 the stickiness and flocculation potential become particularly high in nutrient depleted conditions smetacek 1985 notably the stickiness and flocculation potential depend on the generic species of phytoplankton for example in lake environments colonial phytoplankton species e g aphanotece attach better to mineral particles and form larger flocs than filamentous species e g aphanizomenon de lucas pardo et al 2015 verspagen et al 2006 marine snow is a special type of organic rich floc that appears in offshore areas with a floc size of over 500 μm and a composition of detritus living organisms and inorganic matter alldredge and silver 1988 turner 2015 marine snow has a fluffy structure with high porosity and a heterogeneous composition maerz et al 2020 with phytoplankton and phytodetritus as the main components turner 2015 a high population of phytoplankton in aquatic environments increases the occurrence of marine snow as such the presence of marine snow indicates the high productivity of the aquatic ecosystem the interaction between heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton also promotes a bacteria mediated aggregation of microbial cells the stickiness and flocculatio potential of bacteria vary depending on the bacterial taxa or exopolymers tran et al 2020 certain species of bacteria influence phytoplanktonic physiology and enhance the stickiness and flocculation of phytoplankton cells decho 1990 heissenberger and herndl 1994 other species of bacteria have also attach directly to phytoplankton and enhance flocculation gärdes et al 2010 grossart et al 2006 2 2 2 nonliving organic particles detrital pom is produced via the decaying of various aquatic and terrestrial organisms e g plant litter cyanobacterial fungi algae and becomes suspended in the water column and ultimately contributes to floc formation as a heterogeneous ingredient the main sources of detrital pom include zooplankton phytoplankton terrestrial plants and animals with the matter diversified in terms of properties depending on the source various detrital pom species can thus act as heterogeneous ingredients in floc formation fecal pellets generally secreted by filter feeders e g mussels oysters can also contribute to flocs with a heterogeneous composition for example mussels enhance biological fouling and result in the conversion of slowly sinking organic and inorganic spm into large and fast sinking fecal pellets which can be regarded as large biomineral flocs mussels can thus enhance the stability of spm deposits on the sea floor making them resistant to tidal currents furthermore when fecal pellets are decomposed via biological and tidal actions they are subject to resuspension and flocculation in the water column winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 2 2 3 extracellular polymeric substances the production of epss is a general feature of microorganisms in water environments which occurs in eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms wingender et al 1999 in simple terms epss are polymeric substances biosynthesized from several strains of microorganisms flemming and wingender 2010 eps formation from microbial cells has many origins including cell surface material shedding active secretion from microorganisms cell lysis and sorption from the environment liu and fang 2003 wingender et al 1999 however when microorganisms exist within nitrogen limiting conditions they produce more epss as the intracellular carbon cannot be allocated for growth bhaskar and bhosle 2005 engel et al 2004 the nitrogen concentration is often used as an indicator of eps production in water sediment environments the epss act as polymeric bridges between particles to build large settleable flocs here multivalent cations can further enhance the formation of polymeric bridges by connecting between the functional sites of epss and the negatively charged sites of bacterial and mineral particles zhang et al 2015 the epss and binding cations mitigate the overall negative surface charge of particles thereby increasing the flocculation potential of particles nouha et al 2018 schmidt and ahring 1994 shen et al 1993 clearly epss play an important role in flocculation and are a key component in the heterogeneous composition of flocs in general epss are classified into soluble and bound substances as shown in fig 3 soluble epss include macromolecules slimes and colloids while bound epss include capsular polymers loosely bound polymers condensed gels sheaths and attached organic compounds comte et al 2006 laspidou and rittmann 2002 nielsen and jahn 1999 yu et al 2008 soluble epss are also termed soluble microbial products smp and can move freely among the microbial flocs and the surrounding liquid meanwhile bound epss exhibit a dynamic double layer like structure and can be roughly grouped into loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps liang et al 2010 ramesh et al 2006 these substances also differ in terms of chemical composition under different environmental conditions of microbial communities with the most abundant chemical compounds of eps being polysaccharides and proteins leppard 1997 more et al 2012 nouha et al 2015 santschi et al 1998 subramanian et al 2010 while more minor compounds include humic substances hs nucleic acids uronic acids humic acids and lipids d abzac et al 2010a d abzac et al 2010b nguyen et al 2016 sutherland 2001b wingender et al 1999 2 2 4 transparent exopolymer particles as a special particulate species of eps teps are ubiquitous in water environments while this has only been known since the development of quantification methods from 1993 onward alldredge et al 1993 the average size of teps has been determined to be larger than 0 4 μm while they tend to present various forms including clouds amorphous blobs sheets filaments or clumps alldredge et al 1993 berman and passow 2007 this form of particle can be regarded as a sticky building material in flocs since it exists in particle form rather than as a cell coating or dissolved slime as shown in fig 4 alldredge et al 1993 the quantity of teps varies spatially in the continuum from river and estuaryto coast in low turbid environments the quantity of teps in marine and fresh waters is similar to that of phytoplankton with the highest occurrence appearing in phytoplankton blooms in contrast in turbid environments e g a turbidity maximum zone a large quantity of minerals can adsorb teps on their surface and hence tep coated or tep associated minerals are deposited on the bed layer therefore the quantity of teps tends to decrease in turbid waters during the summer bloom season the clay minerals in turbid environments can thus facilitate the stabilization and burial of organic matter i e tep depending on their abundance blattmann et al 2019 fettweis et al 2022 keil et al 1994 mayer 1994 the teps enhance flocculation and are an important heterogeneous component of flocs due to their adhering capacity as polymeric binders or glue highly viscose and sticky teps can enhance flocculation as they combine numerous solids nonsticky particles cells debris and dissolved substances passow 2002b an abundance of teps will also enhance the probability of particle collision in the water environment jackson 1995 passow et al 1994 thereby increasing the particle aggregation rate however it is important to note that not all the tep species have the same adhesive quality with teps from nondiatom microorganisms not as sticky as those from diatom species kiørboe and hansen 1993 logan et al 1995 passow and alldredge 1994 while teps and epss have been categorized into the same biopolymer group in scientific communities in the authors opinion teps should be classified into a subgroup of epss li et al 2016 morelle et al 2017 passow 2002b in fact while both teps and epss contain a large proportion of acidic polysaccharides passow 2002a 2002b they do not include exactly the same substances while not all epss are a tep precursor nor do they develop into teps passow 2002b furthermore teps and epss should ideally be measured using different analytical methods since they present different physicochemical properties xu et al 2018 in short teps and epss should be regarded as independent indices and should be investigated as such to ensure a better understanding of the heterogeneous composition of flocs 2 2 5 coomassie stainable particles coomassie stainable particles are transparent gel like particles and can be characterized as protein including particles as shown in fig 4 they are present everywhere in water environments and are abundant in cultures of cyanobacteria diatoms and heterotrophic bacteria indicating that microorganisms are a significant source cisternas novoa et al 2015 huang et al 2016 long and azam 1996 thornton 2018 in a study on phytoplankton mesocosm the quantity of csps was found to be similar to that of teps prieto et al 2002 however csps are generally more labile and less sticky than teps thornton 2018 in seawater csps are 3 13 times more numerous and have a surface area of up to two orders of magnitude greater than teps thus while a fraction of csps may overlap teps the remaining fraction of the former will tend to differ from the latter long and azam 1996 however there is a lack of information on csps compared with teps engel et al 2020 in fact csps can be an important heterogeneous component in flocs given their abundance in aquatic systems however the flocculation and sedimentation of csps in water environments have not been comprehensively investigated cisternas novoa et al 2015 and few studies have found that csps have less effect on flocculation than teps the role of teps in flocculation and sedimentation has been better identified than that of csps prieto et al 2002 2 2 6 humic substances humic substances hs are an important pool of transient refractory organic carbon in the geosphere and they are present everywhere in soil and water environments hs is produced mainly through the decay of terrestrial and aquatic plants hs is classified into humic acids ha fulvic acids fa and humin hu beck et al 1974 black and christman 1963 schnitzer and khan 1972 sipler and bronk 2015 in freshwater hs comprises 50 80 of the total dom black and christman 1963 rocker et al 2012 in contrast hs in the ocean comprises only a small fraction of the total dom 0 7 2 4 because a large part of hs is removed in the estuarine and coastal zone opsahl and benner 1997 hs can thus be an important component of the om in flocs in fresh or estuarine water environments adsorption of hs on spm such as clay minerals is common in both fresh and saline waters chotzen et al 2016 kloster and avena 2015 rashid et al 1972 hs adsorption on spm enhances particle stabilization in freshwater whereas it promotes flocculation of hs and particles and incorporation of hs into floc matrices in brackish and saline water such as estuarine and coastal zones hs adsorption on spm and hs mediated flocculation are usually higher in brackish and saline water than in freshwater due to the compression of the electrical double layer and reduction of the electrostatic repulsion between hs and spm rashid et al 1972 sieburth and jensen 1968 swanson and palacas 1965 besides high salinity low ph and abundant metal ions increase hs adsorption and hs mediated flocculation kholodov et al 2014 komy et al 2014 hs associated with flocs also scavenges trace inorganic elements in estuaries nissenbaum and swaine 1976 sholkovitz 1976 therefore hs is not only an important heterogeneous component of flocs but also a mediator that scavenges other components into floc matrices especially in brackish and saline water 2 3 water and pore space 2 3 1 water in flocs water in and around flocs consists of bound surface interstitial and free waters which reside in or flow around the flocs vesilind and martel 1990 such waters affect floc formation and biota droppo 2001 with the water running through the flocs potentially incorporating inorganic and organic particles into the floc matrices droppo et al 1997 furthermore when water flows through flocs it acts as a food stream supplying nutrients and trace elements to the existing biota and exchanging waste products bound water is chemically bound to solid particles kopper 2017 bound and surface waters are barely detached via fluid shear force vesilind 1994 since they are tightly bound via chemical bonding physical adsorption and mechanical capture in both micro and macro capillaries of porous media wu et al 2018 surface water occasionally referred to as vicinal water includes water attached to the surface of solid particles via adsorption and adhesion forces vaxelaire and cézac 2004 meanwhile free water is bound by capillary forces acting between flocs and the surrounding water thus it does not reach the inner particles and pore space directly free water can also be washed away by fluid shear force kopp and dichtl 2001 finally interstitial water occupies the pore space of flocs it is retained inside the floc by capillary forces but turns into free water when the flocs are broken vesilind and martel 1990 2 3 2 pore space in flocs the pore space plays an important role in determining floc structure and density when particles aggregate to form large flocs they create pore space in the floc matrices droppo 2001 the pore space generally occupied by water i e pore water necessarily affects floc structure and density li and ganczarczyk 1988 logan and hunt 1987 sherman 1953 flocs are assembled in a hierarchical manner in terms of the arrangement of particles and pore space for example a tight assemblage of particles can result in dense flocculi with nanoscale pore space with the assemblage of flocculi subsequently developing microflocs with a moderate pore meanwhile a loose assemblage of microflocs results in macroflocs with a large pore as shown in fig 5 the hierarchical assemblage of flocculi microflocs and macroflocs determines the porosity density settling velocity and transportation of the flocs within the water environment gorczyca 2000 pore space also serves as active media hosting physical and biochemical reactions of the various chemicals and nutrients present in flocs these reactions within the floc especially those in the pore space can cause a modification of floc structure and density and can affect floc hydrodynamics and transportation in aquatic environments droppo 2001 for example if flocs consist of several of epss due to microbial growth in the pore space they will contain numerous fibrils and will thus develop a fluffy less dense floc structure liss et al reported that eps fibrils could enlarge the pore space and change the flocs morphology and settling velocity liss et al 1996 2 4 xenobiotic substances among several varieties of xenobiotic substances microplastics and engineered nanoparticles are the most prominent and threatening substances these xenobiotics are usually well dispersed in aquatic environments due to electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobicity but they are often subject to flocculation and become heterogeneous components of flocs under favorable conditions eps as natural tackiness agents enhance attachment between xenobiotics and other particles and flocculation bacosa et al 2018 cunha et al 2019 gao et al 2019 shiu et al 2020 other types of organic matter e g hs may also enhance xenobiotics associated flocculation but they may have less effect on flocculation than eps because of their low molecular weight and tackiness the eps role in xenobiotics associated flocculation is reviewed in the following sections 2 4 1 microplastics microplastics are small plastic particles 5 mm that are ubiquitous in aquatic environments taylor et al 2016 van cauwenberghe et al 2013 they have been found everywhere from the poles to the tropics and from surface waters to seafloors van sebille et al 2015 they are released into various water bodies and are ultimately transported into the oceans andrady 2011 lebreton et al 2017 woodall et al 2014 as a result the sediment deposits on the seafloor are often recognized as a major sink of mps chen et al 2020 the population density of mps in coastal sediments was found to range from 259 to 1743 items l of sediment bashir et al 2021 while they have also been found in the guts of over 300 different marine species kühn et al 2015 thus mps are regarded as emerging and threatening pollutants for both aquatic ecosystems and humans meanwhile while data are limited mps particularly those 300 µm in diameter are likely to associate with spm and be transported within heterogeneous flocculated materials nizzetto et al 2016 stickiness is a key characteristic of flocs that facilitates the scavenging of mps in the water column and results in an accumulation of mps on river or sea floors and the benthic food web cunha et al 2019 de haan et al 2019 sakhon et al 2019 while mps transport deposit and resuspend they can become associated with spm and become incorporated into floc matrices michels et al 2018 it is also important to note that the stickiness between mps and spm has been found to depend on the size and shape of the mps which are governed by weathering including abiotic physicochemical and biotic processes as well as mechanical degradation and fragmentation arp et al 2021 however mps are not only building materials of flocs but also a controlling factor in flocculation and sedimentation for example if mps adhere to flocs via the action of sticky epss or teps they change the floc morphology and density michels et al 2018 nguyen et al 2020 furthermore large mps 100 s micron can provide a habitat for microorganisms and exudate substrates or become precursors for biofilm formation the plastisphere eich et al 2015 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 oberbeckmann et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2016 yang et al 2020 zettler et al 2013 since biofilm is essentially a sticky eps matrix on mps it is likely to increase the stickiness of the mps and mp associated flocs and consequently the scavenging capacity in terms of other suspended particles petrova and sauer 2012 sutherland 2001a beside eps other natural organic matter such as hs can be a component of mp associated flocs wells and stretz 2019 hs can also adsorb on the surface of mps and become a heterogeneous component of mp associated flocs and it eventually changes the fate and transport of mps and hs in aquatic environments abdurahman et al 2020 alimi et al 2018 tourinho et al 2019 notably mps are not only heterogeneous components of flocs but also mediators or scavengers of other components of flocs thereby changing the compositional and structural characteristics of flocs 2 4 2 engineered nanoparticles engineered nanoparticles enps are now often found in water environments following the development of nanotechnology industries in recent years the enps are released into these environments from various industrial sources including paints coatings cosmetics catalysts lubricants food packaging water and wastewater treatments plant protection products and human and veterinary medicines for example the use of personal care and cosmetic products in the city of macao was estimated to release over 37 billion enps per year into water environments via wastewater treatment plants bashir et al 2021 the fate and transport of enps in water environments are driven by physical and biochemical processes such as advection and dispersion partitioning to sediment and biotic and abiotic degradation boxall et al 2007 with the enps ultimately increasing the toxicity to organisms through the food webs maurer jones et al 2013 however the knowledge on enps remains largely lacking in terms of their fate and transport in water environments due to the diversity of enp species and the complexity of the enp associated physical and biochemical processes in aquatic environments dunphy guzman et al 2006 fabrega et al 2011 oberdörster et al 2005 furthermore little consideration of enps has been adopted in studies on the heterogeneous composition of flocs enps associate with eps in floc matrices through electrostatic interaction resulting in the incorporation of enps into heterogeneous floc matrices adeleye and keller 2016 fernando et al 2020 for example metal or metal oxide enps with a positive surface charge such as al2o3 zno fe3o4 and ceo2 easily attach to the negatively charged functional groups of epss and enhance flocculation via charge neutralization in contrast enps with a negative surface charge such as sio2 cuo and carbon composites do not interact with epss inhibiting floc formation huangfu et al 2019 miao et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 enps also interact with hs which has lower molecular weights than eps previous studies have shown that hs can stabilize enps through patchy coatings on enps baalousha et al 2011 gibson et al 2007 hou et al 2017 however the presence of divalent ions such as ca2 and mg2 could promote attachment between hs and enps and the formation of hs enp flocs chen and elimelech 2007 as shown in fig 6 in other words the negative charge of hs on enps can be neutralized by divalent cations which then reduce the electrostatic repulsion and cause the flocculation of enps liu et al 2010 saleh et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 thus hs is also an important factor in enp associated flocculation depending on the environmental conditions e g the presence of mono or divalent ions 2 5 oil droplets oil spills occur at various sources in the oil industries often due to small incidents such as spills from ship refueling or large accidents such as pipeline breakage oil tanker stranding drilling operation failure or transportation related accidents oil droplets can easily adhere to spm due to their hydrophobicity and are thus incorporated into flocs with a heterogeneous composition the collision and attachment of oil droplets and spm can enhance flocculation which facilitates the scavenging and deposition of oil droplets from the water column to the river sea bed lee 2002 a previous study demonstrated that 87 98 of spilled oil is transformed into either oil globules or oil spm aggregates gordon jr et al 1973 and boehm reported that a high spm concentration enhances the formation and deposition of oil droplet spm flocs due to the increase in the collision and attachment between droplets and spm boehm 1987 the size and shape of both droplets and spm are also critical for oil spm floc formation as shown in fig 7 lee and stoffyn egli 2001 oil droplets can also interact with epss with the two substances potentially attaching to each other to form flocs with a heterogeneous composition much like eps enriched marine snow as shown in fig 8 quigg et al 2016 gutierrez et al reported that the eps producing bacteria that are abundant in oil spill sites could enhance floc formation which will ultimately lead to the degradation of hydrocarbons gutierrez et al 2013 in the current authors opinion since oil droplets spm and epss are highly mutually interactive they undoubtedly contribute to flocs with a heterogeneous composition oil droplets in aquatic environments often attach to pom and minerals cloutier et al 2002 lee 2002 lee et al showed that pom e g phytoplankton readily form oil organic aggregates lee et al 1985 grazing by zooplankton also enhances the transportation of oil droplets through the excretion of fecal pellets conover 1971 mackie et al 1978 subsequently the fecal pellets can be trapped in the net of sticky components of flocs there are thus various pathways for oil droplets to be incorporated into flocs 3 insight into flocs with heterogeneous composition and structure fractal dimensions have been used as a traditional empirical index of floc composition and structure in the past few decades the fractal dimension of a floc describes its space filling capacity for primary particles and ranges from 1 to 3 the higher the value the more compact and uniform the floc will be wheatland 2017 a dense floc has a relatively high fractal dimension of around 2 3 2 5 or higher while a fluffy floc has a low fractal dimension of around 1 7 1 8 lee et al 2005 the fractal dimension was found to increase with a higher suspended sediment concentration in intertidal mudflats implying that the floc structure becomes more dense and compact with abundant suspended sediments dyer and manning 1999 in contrast the fractal dimension tends to decrease with higher organic matter content indicating that the floc structure becomes less dense and more fluffy in biologically enriched conditions much like the marine snow in an offshore zone chen and eisma 1995 dyer and manning 1999 for example larsen et al found that flocs with high organic matter content are more porous less dense and less settleable and are thus more mobile in water environments than flocs with low organic matter content larsen et al 2009a however recent studies have revealed the non fractal nature of flocs in the water environment while investigating detailed floc composition and structure spencer et al 2021 recent developments in 3d volumetric imaging of flocs wheatland et al 2017 wheatland et al 2020 enables new insight into flocs with heterogeneous composition and structure based on their 3d analysis wheatland et al revealed that the geometries of individual components are far more complex than suggested by traditional 2d imaging techniques here the authors analyzed a 3d dataset and could recognize five basic elements of flocs pore space clay minerals nonclay minerals microbial cells and organic detritus fig 9 here irregularly shaped objects with high gray level values were deemed to be organic detritus while the nonclay minerals were differentiated based on their distinct blocky irregular morphology and uniform gray scale value within 3d datasets the volumes of each component and pore space in a given floc could be successfully quantified and the authors could also identify epss linking multiplatelet clay particles within the primary structure of flocculi and could discern micrometer sized pores between the substructures of flocs wheatland et al 2017 wheatland 2017 state of the art microscopic techniques could reconstruct a 3d image of a typical estuarine floc with heterogeneous composition e g clay minerals and other organic substances spencer and coworkers further identified the hierarchical floc structures associated with heterogeneous composition in a stepwise particle floc aggregation process droppo et al 1997 droppo and ongley 1994 spencer et al 2021 in the earlier stage of the aggregation process clay minerals are organized into multiparticle units aligned in either stacked or stepped arrangement fig 10 a then heterogeneous components such as clay and nonclay minerals pores unicellular organisms filamentous cyanobacteria decaying organic detritus and organo mineral debris are organized in a more complex manner figs 10 b d here eps plays an important role in combining heterogeneous components in floc structures liss et al 1996 spencer et al 2021 such heterogeneous flocs further aggregate to macroflocs and megaflocs which have large tortuous pore channels in their floc structure providing good habitats for bacteria populations e g filamentous cyanobacteria this observation on the hierarchical floc structure with heterogeneous composition agrees well with previous studies because om i e eps tep as heterogeneous composition enhances the flocculation and formation of less dense biomineral flocs alldredge and gotschalk 1989 chen and eisma 1995 passow 2002b 4 human activities affecting floc composition 4 1 pollutant discharge and eutrophication a wide variety of particulate and dissolved pollutants are dischared from urban and industrial areas to water environments müller et al 2020 siddique and kiani 2020 such particulate pollutants include mps enps soil particles road dust particles from various industries and soot from combustion whereas dissolved pollutants consist of various organic e g petrochemical compounds and inorganic e g heavy metals ionic species pollutants cisneros 2011 müller et al 2020 agricultural areas also discharge various particulate and dissolved pollutants including sediments biomass microorganisms nutrients pesticides salts metals and so on mateo sagasta et al 2017 particulate pollutants from the urban industrial and agriculture areas may contribute to formation of flocs with heterogeneous composition also dissolved organic and inorganic pollutants may adsorb on spm and finally become a part of flocs awad et al 2019 certain components of the flocs in aquatic systems emanate from the runoff or discharge from landcover and the associated land use as shown in fig 11 here the level of impact depends on the intensity of the activities which include agriculture timber harvesting housing industry and road construction these activities will provide various components of flocs including minerals organic matter metals mps enps and oil droplets in addition the discharge of excessive nutrients via human activities e g sewage animal waste atmospheric deposition and fertilizer application enhances phytoplankton blooms and changes the spm dynamics i e flocculation sedimentation deposition and resuspension in the water environment phytoplankton bloom can deteriorate due to climate changes population increases industrialization and agribusiness development anderson et al 2002 rabalais et al 2009 specifically the phosphorus and nitrogen loads from watersheds are known to be the main drivers of phytoplankton production and bloom anderson et al 2002 phytoplankton bloom increases the eps tep concentration since certain phytoplankton species produce a large quantity of eps tep precursors typically in the decaying phase of algal bloom decho and gutierrez 2017 lee et al 2019 lee et al 2012 increasing the quantity of phytoplankton and eps tep in the eutrophic condition can ultimately enhance the formation of large and highly settleable biomineral flocs and sedimentation and deposition on river lake estuarine coastal and sea floors droppo 2001 larsen et al 2009b 4 2 construction activities alongside marine and inland navigation and construction dredging can result in the resuspension of various mineral and organic particles flocs from river or sea floors into water columns and can thus affect floc composition and structure such resuspended particles from a dredging site are subject to transportation i e dispersion and advection flocculation sedimentation and deposition and they may ultimately cause harmful siltation in nearby benthic ecological systems dankers 2002 dredging may also cause the resuspension of particulate heavy metals and other organic and inorganic pollutants sin et al 1991 tang et al 1997 river dam construction can also affect flocculation and the heterogeneous composition of flocs such dams can alter the ecological hydrological and biogeochemical conditions which subsequently alter the organic matter and spm composition in the river water for example a river with a constructed dam can become more lacustrine than riverine with this lacustrine condition facilitating algae bloom and eps tep production and ultimately enhancing flocculation with heterogeneous composition lee et al 2019 meanwhile offshore wind farms owfs can also affect flocculation with a heterogeneous composition and the spm dynamics in water environments the construction operation and decommission activities of owfs can enhance phytoplankton growth and organic matter i e eps and tep production while also changing the flow and turbulence near the sea floor van berkel et al 2020 for example ivanov et al demonstrated that the total organic carbon toc concentration increased up to 50 in an area of 5 km around the monopiles of the owfs ivanov et al 2021 a high toc concentration around owfs indicates an abundance of organic matter which could affect floc composition and structure moreover the owf structures act as artificial reefs providing new habitats for filter feeders e g clams snails oysters mussels with the fecal pellets secreted by the filter feeders potentially contributing to floc composition and structure as was noted in section 3 2 5 conclusions it is well known that spm is indispensable in water environments with its fate and transport involved in various current environmental issues including water pollution ecosystem destruction and natural disasters i e siltation and erosion understanding flocculation with a heterogeneous composition which is the core process in the fate and transport of spm must be the first step in protecting or reducing these environmental issues the heterogeneous composition of flocs includes inorganic matter e g inorganic particulate matter heavy metals organic matter e g eps tep hs pom pore water and xenobiotic particulate matter e g mps enps oil droplets each component has a unique function in floc formation with heterogeneous composition for instance clay minerals and pom are basic building materials for flocs eps and tep make bridges among particles and thus promote flocculation hs also enhances the connection among particles under suitable conditions e g the presence of divalent cations and high ionic strength mps provide habitats and substrates for microorganisms which can create biofilms and scavenge various dissolved and particulate matter the interaction between enps and hs can enhance flocculation under favorable physicochemical conditions human activities such as pollutant discharge eutrophication and construction can be additional drivers for facilitating flocculation with a heterogeneous composition however in the current authors opinion flocculation with a heterogeneous composition is at present not fully understood within the scientific communities in short more efforts should be made to investigate flocs with a heterogeneous composition specifically in terms of their effects on the current environmental issues declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
