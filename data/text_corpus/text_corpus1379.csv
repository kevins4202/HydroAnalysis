6895,the hydrological alterations induced by dam construction modify natural flora and fauna habitats and impair ecosystem stability although many studies have documented the impacts of large dams on streamflow few have described the effects of small dam construction on hydrological conditions the cumulative effects of intensive small dams may also cause severe ecological problems to evaluate the impacts of dam construction on the indicators of hydrological alterations a framework that combined a hydrological model and the post bias correction method was proposed the hydrological alterations of two individual rivers in the jiulong river basin that experienced impacts from intensifying small hydropower reservoirs the north river and the west river were analyzed using the proposed framework the results show that the framework can successfully avoid misleading the impacts of dam construction on monthly runoff and multi minimum values detected by the previously common method that did not separate the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime the small hydropower dominated north river and the flood control dominated west river exhibited generally consistent change patterns of unchanging monthly river discharge reduced high pulse count reduced rise and fall rates and increased number of reversals conversely the changes to several indicators of hydrologic alterations iha differed between the two rivers the flood control dominated west river exhibited 1 increased indicators such as the base flow index multi day minimum flow and high pulse duration and 2 decreased multi day maximum flow and low pulse count unlike the west river the hydropower dominated north river experienced 1 increased low pulse count and 2 decreased indicators such as multi day minimum flow and low pulse duration our results implied that the ecological impacts of the small hydropower dominated north river may exceed those of the flood control dominated west river therefore the minimum ecological water demand should be considered not only in the large reservoirs operation but also in the operation of small hydropower reservoirs keywords flow regime indicators of hydrological alterations distributed hydrological model post bias correction method small dam construction 1 introduction dam construction has substantially altered the flow regimes of the majority of the rivers throughout the world naiman et al 1993 the construction of dams can alter the natural flow regime by affecting the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change in the flow richter et al 1996 nislow et al 2002 magilligan and nislow 2005 as well as by changing the sediment nutrients energy and biota ligon et al 1995 changes in flow regimes within the context of dam construction result in extensive environmental degradation and loss of biological diversity lytle and poff 2004 ziv et al 2012 castello and macedo 2016 therefore it is necessary to assess the degree of deviation from the natural flow regime characteristics that is induced by dam construction to provide support for the maintenance of fundamental ecological functions arthington et al 2006 poff et al 2010 schneider et al 2013 in this regard over 170 metrics have been developed to describe the different characteristics of the flow regime among which the indicators of hydrologic alterations iha method richter et al 1996 has been widely used olden and poff 2003 gao et al 2009 highly regulated rivers in china are dominated by large scale ecosystem alterations induced by hydrological alterations many of the previous studies associated with dam induced hydrological alterations across river basins in china have focused on the impacts of large dams that generally aim to control floods in large basins such as the lancang river zhao et al 2012 the mekong river li et al 2017 the pearl river zhang et al 2014 the yangtze river gao et al 2012 and the yellow river yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 all of these studies used the iha method to evaluate the hydrological impacts of dam construction in general these studies found that the operation of large dams 1 reduced the streamflow during wet seasons and increased the streamflow during dry seasons 2 reduced the maximum flow values and 3 increased the number of reversals but decreased the rates of rise and fall however the minimum flow values base flow indexes and pulsing behaviors varied depending on the operation size and location of the dam i e increases in the yangtze and mekong river li et al 2017 gao et al 2012 magilligan and nislow 2005 and decreases at several stations in the yellow river zhang et al 2018 these hydrological alterations caused further environmental problems for example the three gorges dam in the yangtze river caused reduced flow pulses that led to diminished aquatic biodiversity and fish populations gao et al 2012 moreover the magnitudes of large floods decreased and the high flow variability decreased the connectivity between the floodplain and the river channel which may have further reduced the species richness and abundance of waterfowl and aquatic plants wang et al 2016a b large decreases in the magnitude of high flow due to damming in the mekong river caused the trapping of sediments which altered the nutrient dynamics and other biogeochemical processes in the related deltas estuaries and marine shelf ecosystems kondolf et al 2014 li et al 2017 in addition to large dams the development of small dams has also been highlighted in national energy policies in china li and ma 2009 therefore small dam construction is intense in china especially in south china where the hydropower resources are extensive small dams are mainly designed for hydropower generation and may be constructed anywhere in the catchment where appropriate physical conditions exist deitch et al 2013 although small dams may not be individually capable of significantly influencing the streamflow the cumulative effects of many small dams may exceed those of large hydropower dams particularly with regard to ecologically relevant flow regimes deitch et al 2013 kibler and tullos 2013 however analogous research addressing the effects of high density small dams on hydrological conditions are scarce we thus present an investigation of the hydrological impacts of intense small hydropower development in the jiulong river basin which is a typical small catchment in southeast china to this end a framework for evaluating the impacts of dam construction on the flow regime was first proposed and then the changes in the flow regime before and after dam construction were analyzed by using this framework 2 study area and data acquisition 2 1 the jiulong river basin the jiulong river basin is a subtropical coastal watershed in southeast china with a drainage area of 14 741 km2 fig 1 the mean annual runoff is 1010 mm and the annual precipitation ranges from 1400 mm to 1800 mm and nearly 75 of the precipitation occurs from april to september the mean annual temperature is 19 9 21 1 c two major tributaries the north river and west river cover nearly 95 of the total area of the jiulong river basin the basin had 193 constructed reservoirs with storage capacities of 1 11 10 9 m 3 by the end of 2011 which were built for flood control hydropower generation irrigation and domestic and industrial water use 2 2 data acquisition and processing three hydrological stations and 10 meteorological stations in the jiulong river basin are available within the study area fig 1 the daily river discharge data were obtained from the hydrology and water resources bureau the meteorological data including daily air temperature mean maxima and minima daily relative humidity daily sunshine duration and daily wind speed were obtained from the national meteorological stations managed by the china meteorological administration cma precipitation data were from the 0 25 0 25 china gauge based daily precipitation cgdpa product shen et al 2014 the meteorological data were first interpolated to grids using an angular distance weighting method since the meteorological stations are sparse and unevenly distributed in the study area new et al 2000 and the 0 25 0 25 precipitation data were resampled to a 1 km grid using the nearest neighbor assignment in arcgis software after spatial interpolation the duration of the rainfall in a day was determined by the daily rainfall amounts the more rain the longer the duration gao et al 2016 the precipitation start time in a day is determined randomly and the daily precipitation amounts were downscaled into hourly precipitation by a normal distribution gao et al 2016 the land cover data at a 30 m resolution in 2000 were from the geographical information monitoring cloud platform http www dsac cn the land cover map was been reclassed into 10 categories including water body urban area bare soil forest irrigated cropland upland grassland shrub wetland and ice for each land use type a 15 day leaf area index lai was calculated by the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values sellers 1996 the ndvi data with 15 day and 0 05 0 05 temporal and spatial resolutions from 1982 to 2014 were collected from the 3rd generation of ndvi ndvi3g from global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms data the ndvi input in the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm before 1982 was replaced by the ndvi data in 1982 ma et al 2010 the soil hydraulic parameters including saturated soil moisture residual soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity and parameters α and n in the van genuchten model were provided by the china soil hydraulic parameters dataset which was provided by dai et al 2013 digital elevation data with a resolution of 90 m were downloaded from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm database jarvis et al 2008 the reservoir information achieved from a water resource planning survey implemented in 2011 included the reservoir name year of completion controlled basin area reservoir capacity and reservoir function 3 methodology 3 1 indicators of hydrologic alterations the iha method was first proposed by richter et al 1996 to evaluate the hydrological regime changes induced by various human activities such as dam operations flow diversion or groundwater pumping the iha method includes 33 biologically relevant hydrological parameters that characterize the intra annual variations in streamflow conditions richter et al 1996 proposed the 33 iha parameters because of high sensitivity of physical habitat alteration in lotic systems and high frequency of occurrences in limnology studies the 33 hydrological indicators are generally divided into the following 5 groups 1 the magnitude of the monthly discharge 2 the magnitude and duration of the annual extreme streamflow 3 the timing of the annual extreme streamflow 4 the frequency and duration of high and low pulses and 5 the rate and frequency of flow changes table s1 because no zero flow events occurred in this region 32 hydrological indicators excluding zero flow days were applied in this study 3 2 a framework for evaluating the impacts of dam construction on flow regime a previously common method to assess the hydrological impacts of dam construction using iha methods divided the pre impact and post impact period and then calculated the relative change between the observed iha metrics during the pre impact period and post impact period gao et al 2012 yang et al 2012 the previously common method requires less data and easier to be accomplished however the method that relies on observed flow data ignores the impacts of climate change and ascribes the observed hydrological alteration to the impacts of dam construction climate change maybe alter hydrological regimes greatly magilligan and nislow 2005 timpe and kaplan 2017 therefore a new framework was proposed to eliminate the impacts of climate change when quantifying the hydrological impacts of dam construction since post impact flow regime simulated by hydrological model without dam regulation module represented the natural flow regime and observed post impact flow regime represented the altered flow regime influenced by climate change and dam construction the framework quantified the impacts of dam construction through subtracting the simulated post impact flow regime from the observed flow regime the framework consists of four main steps fig 2 1 the pettitt test pettitt 1979 was used to identify the abrupt change point of the reservoir capacities variations during the available streamflow period and the whole period was divided into a pre impact and post impact period based on the abrupt change point then the observed iha metrics for the two periods were calculated 2 a distributed gbhm was employed to simulate the natural flow series during the post impact period 3 based on the observed and simulated pre impact iha metrics post bias correction was used to obtain bias corrected simulated iha values in the post impact period 4 the observed and bias corrected simulated post impact flow statistics were compared to estimate the flow alteration due to dam construction 3 2 1 brief description of the distributed hydrological model and evaluation in this study the daily runoff in the jiulong river basin a humid catchment over the period from 1960 to 2014 need to be simulated by a hydrological model the gbhm developed by yang et al 1998 2002 has been successfully applied in humid regions like yangtze river li et al 2015 mekong river wang et al 2016a b and chao phraya river yang and musiake 2003 and performs well in simulating daily runoff therefore the gbhm is used in this study to simulate the natural streamflow processes over the period from 1960 to 2014 the distributed model is forced by meteorological data and the regulations of dams are not included in the model structure the gbhm uses a basin subdivision scheme and a sub grid parameterization scheme the horton strahler scheme is applied to subdivide the study basin into subcatchments and order the river network conveniently based on the dem data each subcatchment is divided into several flow intervals according to the flow distance to the outlet and then a flow interval is generalized as a series of hillslope units the hillslope unit is the computational unit for hydrological simulation yang et al 2002 2004 hydrological simulation in the gbhm includes two main components the hillslope hydrological module and flow routing module yang et al 2004 the hydrological processes calculated in the hillslope hydrological module are canopy interception evapotranspiration infiltration surface flow subsurface flow and exchange between groundwater and the river the flow routing in the river network was solved using the kinematic wave approach more information about methods used in these hydrological processes in gbhm can be found in yang et al 2002 2004 in the present study the gbhm uses a 1 km resolution hillslope and is implemented on a one hour time step a warm up run of the model from 1960 to 1962 was used to get a stable value of model state variables such as soil moisture groundwater table and river water depth at the beginning of 1963 specifically the model ran recursively during 1960 1962 and the nse and bias were calculated using simulated streamflow from the latest run and the last run if nse is equal to 1 and bias ranges from 0 3 and 0 3 the warm up run can be stopped and the stable value of model state variables at the beginning of 1963 was obtained after the warm up run the daily river discharge data from 1963 to 1967 were used to calibrate the model parameters the objective of calibration is to constrain the percent bias pbias between 10 and 10 and constrain the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and logarithmic transformed nash and sutcliffe efficiency lnse coefficient to 0 7 according to the general performance recommended by moriasi et al 2007 the parameters used in the gbhm are listed in table 1 miao et al 2016 the manually calibrated parameters in the gbhm included the hydraulic conductivity of groundwater groundwater storage coefficient slope shape factor and saturated hydraulic conductivity at the bottom the daily river discharge from 1968 to 1972 was used for model validation and then simulations were performed from 1963 to 2014 the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 lnse smakhtin et al 1998 and pbias gupta et al 1999 were adopted to evaluate the model performance in terms of the accuracy of simulated daily data compared to the measured daily flow which are defined as 1 nse 1 t 1 t q sim t q sim t 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 2 lnse 1 t 1 t l n q sim t l n q sim t 2 t 1 t l n q obs t l n q obs 2 3 pbias t 1 t q obs t q sim t 100 t 1 t q obs t where q obs t and q sim t are the observed and simulated streamflow at time t respectively q obs is the average value of the observed streamflow during the period t to evaluate the ability of a hydrological model to replicate iha values two statistical methods were employed 1 pearson correlation coefficient and 2 mann whitney u test nachar 2008 the correlation analysis evaluated the simulation accuracy of the interannual variabilities of those iha values while the mann whitney u test examined the statistical significance of the mean differences between the observed and simulated iha values according to the recommendation by moriasi et al 2007 nse lnse values between 0 65 and 1 0 and pbias values between 10 and 10 indicate that the model performs well at simulating the daily discharge process in this study the iha value passes the mann whitney u test which means that the observed and simulated mean values are not significantly different and the pearson correlation coefficient is higher than 0 4 which represents that the model can adequately replicate the corresponding iha values shrestha et al 2014 ryo et al 2015 3 2 2 post bias correction for the simulated iha values the objective function for manual calibration of the model is single and the model is calibrated step by step firstly evaporation related parameters are adjusted to reduce pbias value within the reasonable range defined in the study then other parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity of groundwater groundwater storage coefficient slope shape factor and saturated hydraulic conductivity at the bottom are adjusted to make nse and lnse values reach the expected level and maintain pbias value within the recommended range because our calibration objective is to maintain pbias nse and lnse in a recommended range this cannot guarantee that each iha metric is appropriately simulated however quantification of the impacts of dams requires a relatively high model accuracy when reproducing the iha values thus it is necessary to remove the possible bias from the simulated mean iha values to this end a simple bias removal method called the quantile mapping method panofsky and brier 1968 was used in this study this method removes the mean bias by matching the cumulative distribution functions cdf of the observed and simulated iha values the quantile mapping method has the benefit of accounting for biases in all statistical moments and it is assumed that biases relative to observations at each quantile are constant during the projections thrasher et al 2012 there are three major limitations of this method boé et al 2007 i the temporal autocorrelation properties of the series are not corrected ii each variable is corrected independently iii the spatial autocorrelation of the different variables may be biased this approach has been used extensively to reduce the bias of satellite retrievals of soil moisture reichle and koster 2004 and correct the systematic distributional bias in precipitation and temperature outputs from climate models piani et al 2010 in particular hashino et al 2007 used the quantile mapping method to shift the probability distribution of the ensemble forecasts of monthly streamflow fig 3 shows the principal scheme of the quantile mapping method taking one iha value as an example the observed and simulated cdf in the pre impact period and the simulated cdf in the post impact period can be obtained through empirical quantiles of data i e the sorted values in a sample the steps that obtain corrected cdf for simulated cdf in the post impact period are as follows step1 xsim reprensents the simulated value smaller than the largest simulated value in the pre impact period maxsim on simulated cdf in the post impact period probabilities p 1 and p 2 corresponding to xsim can be found for the simulated cdf during the pre impact period and post impact period respectively step2 given the probability p 1 the value xcorr can be obtained from the observed cdf during the pre impact period step3 p 2 xcorr on corrected cdf is the corrected point of p 2 xsim on simulated cdf in the post impact period step4 ysim reprensents the simulated value larger than maxsim the largest observed value maxobs in the pre impact period and probabilities p 3 corresponding to ysim for the simulated cdf during post impact period can be obtained step5 p 3 ysim maxobs maxsim on corrected cdf is the corrected point of p 3 ysim on simulated cdf in the post impact period 4 results 4 1 model performance in simulating streamflow and iha metrics fig 4 shows the observed and simulated daily logarithmic transformed river discharge at the zhangping upper north river punan lower north river and zhengdian lower west river stations during the calibration period 1963 1967 and validation period 1968 1972 the pbias nse and lnse values for the simulated daily discharges at the three stations are listed in table 2 the simulated river discharge at the zhangping upper north river station and punan lower north river station exhibited similar results with pbias values greater than 9 and nse lnse values larger than 0 79 which indicated that the daily discharge simulations in the north river were very good although the statistics at the zhengdian lower west river station were slightly worse than those in the north river the simulation discharge at the zhengdian lower west river station still performed well in general the model effectively captured the temporal variability of streamflow at all three stations table 3 depicts the pearson correlation coefficient and results of the mann whitney u test between the observed and gbhm simulated iha values for the three stations during the pre impact period the number in bold means that the observed and gbhm simulated iha values were significant differences at the 95 confidence level fig s1 shows the observed and simulated 30 day minimum and 1 day maximum value at three stations from 1963 to 2014 of the 32 iha values 29 for zhangping upper north river station 29 for punan lower north river station and 24 for zhengdian lower west river station passed the mann whitney u test and had pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0 4 representing that the model can adequately replicate the corresponding iha value when simulating most of the iha values at the three stations however the fall rate number of reversals at three stations and low flow related iha indicators such as 1 day 3 day 7 day baseflow index low pulse count and duration at the zhengdian lower west river station showed significant differences in mean values but relatively high correlation values 0 4 in addition low pulse duration at the zhangping upper north river station and rise rate at the punan lower north river station have low correlation values but no significant difference in mean values 4 2 changes in reservoir storage fig 5 shows the accumulated water storage capacities in the drainage area of zhangping upper north river punan lower north river and zhengdian lower west river stations in the jiulong river basin from 1956 to 2011 based on the pettitt test pettitt 1979 the abrupt change point was 1973 for the west river station whereas it was 1976 for the north river stations at a significance level of 0 05 the extracted change points represented the start year of intensive dam construction therefore for the north river stations the streamflow from 1963 to 1999 and 2006 2014 were separated into a pre impact period 1963 1975 and a post impact period 1976 1999 2006 2014 for the west river station the pre impact period was 1963 1972 and the post impact period was 1973 1999 and 2006 2014 the 193 reservoirs constructed in the jiulong river basin were built to meet certain purposes such as flood control hydropower generation and water supply including irrigation domestic and industrial water use a total of 51 of these reservoirs are single purpose reservoirs of which 98 serve for hydropower generation the rest are multipurpose reservoirs that serve several purposes with different precedence levels the higher precedence level of one purpose of one multipurpose reservoir means that the purpose should be satisfied first when it conflicts with other purposes with lower precedence levels for simplicity we assumed that the operation rules of multipurpose reservoirs are determined by the purpose with the highest precedence level fig 1 shows the distribution of the existing reservoirs used in this study all of the reservoirs are widely spread throughout the jiulong river basin and 135 out of the 193 reservoirs are located in tributaries hydropower reservoirs accounted for 68 and 60 of the reservoirs in the drainage areas of the zhangping upper north river station and punan lower north river station respectively while 41 of the reservoirs are hydropower reservoirs in the drainage area of the zhengdian lower west river station only two flood control reservoirs exist in the jiulong river basin and both are located in the tributaries the reservoir capacities for hydropower flood control and water supply in the drainage areas of three stations in the jiulong river basin by the end of 2011 are shown in fig 6 the reservoirs in the drainage areas of the zhangping and punan north river stations had largest hydropower storage capacities while those in the drainage area of the zhengdian lower west river station had largest flood control storage capacities in the drainage areas of the punan and zhangping north river stations the hydropower reservoir storage is far greater than the storage of the other two reservoir types in the drainage area of the zhengdian lower west river station water supply reservoirs are most abundant but they have the smallest storage capacities and the flood control reservoir has the largest storage capacity hence the streamflow at the zhangping and punan north river stations are dominantly affected by hydropower reservoirs and that at the zhengdian lower west river station is mainly influenced by flood control reservoirs 4 3 impact of dam construction on flow regime table 4 lists the observed and simulated monthly runoff during the post impact period the number in bold indicates that the iha value is significantly different compared to the observed and simulated values during the post impact period at the 95 confidence level twenty eight out of the 32 iha metrics at the zhangping upper north river and punan lower north river stations experienced consistent decreased or increased changes and the other 4 metrics exhibited no obvious changes for both stations indicating that the zhangping and punan stations in north river had similar change patterns in iha metrics to compare the change pattern differences in the north and west river the zhangping upper north river and punan lower north river stations were considered as one group called north river stations and zhengdian station was called west river station we assumed that a significant change in one iha metric at any of the zhangping and punan stations in north river was considered to be a significant iha metric change for the north river the changes in monthly runoff rise rate high pulse count fall rate and number of reversals exhibit consistent patterns among the three stations as shown in table 4 the average monthly runoff in most months exhibited a nonsignificant difference the rise rate and fall rate decreased dramatically while the number of reversals increased dramatically the high pulse counts at the north river and west river stations all decreased most of the iha metrics showed different patterns at the two river stations the different patterns can be categorized into two types 1 both the north river and west river stations exhibit significant changes but have different change directions e g one is positive and one is negative 2 one river station changes significantly while the other one changes nonsignificantly the 3 day and 7 day minimum values and the low pulse count belonged to the first category specifically the 3 day and 7 day minimums at the north river stations decreased significantly with relative changes below 20 while those at the west river stations increased significantly the low pulse counts at the north river stations significantly increased with an average relative change of 43 2 while those at the west river stations decreased with a relative change of 43 8 the 30 day maximum value base flow index date of minimum flow high pulse duration and low pulse duration belonged to the second category at the west river station the 30 day maximum value and date of minimum flow exhibited significant decreases while the base flow index and high pulse duration increased significantly however these indicators did not exhibit significant changes at the north river stations in contrast the north river stations experienced significant changes in low pulse duration while the west river stations exhibited no obvious changes 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the framework with the previously common method although the daily discharge simulations at the downstream west river station were still considered to be good moriasi et al 2007 they were slightly worse compared to the north river stations before 1972 the end of the validation period the total reservoir storage were 33 31 222 61 m3 in the drainage area of zhangping and punan north river stations respectively the total reservoir storage the drainage area of zhengdian lower west river station was 877 09 m3 which is much larger than that of the north river stations therefore the observed discharge at zhengdian lower west river station during the calibration and validation period may deviate from the natural runoff on the other hand the model simulates the natural runoff the slightly worse model simulations at the zhengdian lower west river station may be caused by the deviation of observed runoff rather than the model limitations the relative change between simulated iha results in table s2 during the pre impact and post impact period represents the flow alteration caused by climate change from pre impact period to post impact period it can be seen that the climate change from pre impact period and post impact period was demonstrated to have influences on flow regime such as monthly runoff during march and april the multi minimum values low pulse count and high pulse count table 5 lists the iha for the three stations using the previously common method the relative change calculated by the previously common method obspost obspre obspre in table 5 was compared to those calculated by the proposed framework obs sim obs in table 4 most of the iha metrics calculated by the proposed framework had consistent statistical significance with those calculated by the previously common method however the monthly runoff data exhibited no clear change in the proposed framework while the previously common method indicated increased monthly runoff such as during march at three stations and increased monthly runoff during 5 other months at the zhengdian lower west river station moreover the decreased multi minimum values calculated by the proposed framework at the punan lower north river station were not detected by the previously common method the previously common method did not separate the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime which can mislead the estimations of the patterns of monthly runoff and multi minimum values magilligan and nislow 2005 zhao et al 2012 as the minimum flow has played an important role in maintaining the normal functioning of the ecosystem rolls et al 2012 it is necessary to use the framework instead of the previously common method to quantify the flow regime alteration induced by dams 5 2 dam induced hydrological alterations comparison of hydropower and flood control reservoirs in the jiulong river basin the north river was dominated by hydropower reservoirs while the west river was dominated by flood control reservoirs according to the reservoir capacities fig 6 the dominated reservoir type of river was determined by the type of reservoir that has the largest storage capacities zhang et al 2015 stated that the hydropower facilities in the jiulong river were small scale 50 mw dams irrespective of the dominant reservoirs in the north and west river changes in monthly runoff high pulse count rise and fall rate and number of reversals were consistent between the north river and west river the monthly runoff exhibited a nonsignificant difference the high pulse count rise rate and fall rate decreased while the number of reversals increased our results confirm the conclusions of a previous study by magilligan and nislow 2005 who found that the number of reversals was increased by either hydropower or flood control reservoirs changes in monthly runoff is in contrast to the results found for large dams which reduced the streamflow during wet seasons and increased the streamflow during dry seasons li et al 2017 gao et al 2012 one large difference between the hydropower dominated north river and the flood control dominated west river was associated with the magnitude of annual extreme streamflow increased minimum flow and decreased maximum flow in the west river are associated with the operation of large reservoir reserves the large reservoirs can reduce the maximum flow significantly for providing flood suppression graf 2006 gao et al 2012 in addition to preventing flood the large reservoirs also need to release water to downstream users during dry seasons which results in the increased minimum flow li et al 2017 räsänen et al 2017 with respect to the hydropower dominated north river the decreased minimum flow was induced by hydropower generation in which the small reservoir was designed for only power generation and needed to generate as much electricity as possible and this reservoir may even store water to reach a sufficient head before generating electricity during dry seasons richter et al 1996 deitch et al 2013 li et al 2017 timpe and kaplan 2017 the lack of an obvious change in the maximum flow in the north river may be the result of the fact that small dams do not reduce high flows kibler and tullos 2013 deitch et al 2013 the low pulse dynamics represented another different change pattern the significantly decreased low pulse count in the west river indicated that the flood control reservoir caused the reduction of the low pulse this finding fits the commonly held belief that impoundment of flood control reservoirs leads to increased minimum flows graf 2006 gao et al 2012 5 3 the possible impacts of hydrological alterations on river ecology our study demonstrated that both rivers exhibited consistent changes in the rise rate high pulse count fall rate and number of reversals these changes may trap aquatic organisms in floodplain lakes and strand terrestrial organisms on floodplain islands timpe and kaplan 2017 the decreased high pulse count also reduced hydrological connectivity which prevents exchange of matter energy and organisms between floodplains and river systems which should reduce the spawning area and recruitment success of river fish and lead to a decline in the richness and abundance of waterbird species and wetland vegetation through habitat fragmentation hu et al 2008 changes in low flow and high flow magnitude showed different patterns in the north river and west river the low flow value decreased in the north river but increased in the west river in the north river the decreased low flow magnitude contributed to a decrease in the water velocity which directly led to accelerated channel bed sedimentation and aggravated the effects of water pollution resulting in many concomitant biological changes smakhtin 2001 during the dry period the deterioration of the water quality such as low oxygen contents and high levels of nutrients that are associated with decreasing low flow can drive the production of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria thereby contributing to significant and widespread occurrences of phytoplankton blooms associated with eutrophication vliet and zwolsman 2008 bilotta and brazier 2008 the high flow value exhibited no obvious changes in the north river but it decreased in the west river zhao et al 2015 demonstrated that the sediment carried by high flow events was the main source of sediment in the jiulong river estuary therefore the decreased high flow in the west river may reduce the sedimentation in the jiulong river estuary and change the high flow structure and morphology of the stream channel yang et al 2012 the low pulse and high pulse dynamics showed another different pattern in the north river and west river the low pulse count increased in the north river and decreased in the west river the increasing number of low pulses in the west river suggests that the richness of plant and animal species that are unable to tolerate or persist would decline and the reduced number of low pulses in the north river support a greater proportion of plant and animal species with life history traits that are unsuited to survival under low flow conditions rolls et al 2012 either increased or decreased low pulse count influences soil moisture and anaerobic stress for plants and the availability of floodplain habitats for aquatic organisms graf 2006 therefore maintaining a natural low pulse count is beneficial to aquatic system health and a natural low pulse count at the downstream at least can be maintained possibly by operation of the last one locates on the lower reach of cascade dams the high pulse duration also exhibited no clear change in the north river but increased in the west river the increased high pulse duration in the west river may lead to excessive hydrological connectivity which is also expected to reduce habitat heterogeneity with concomitant declines in biodiversity ward et al 2010 in the north river decreased high pulse counts and the lack of changes in the high pulse duration reduced the connectivity between floodplains and river systems which was associated with declines in biodiversity in the west river increased high pulse duration and decreased high pulse count may offset the influence of each other on hydrological connectivity which is beneficial to maintaining the balance of nutrient and organic matter exchanges between rivers and floodplains 6 conclusions according to the results of this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a framework that combined a hydrological model and the post bias correction method was proposed to investigate the effects of dam construction on iha the hydrological model gbhm used in this study can adequately reproduce the temporal variability of the streamflow in the jiulong river basin considering the uncertainty of the iha simulation a post bias correction for the simulated iha was accomplished by using the quantile mapping method compared to the previously common method that did not separate the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime the framework can effectively avoid the misleading of the change pattern of monthly runoff and multi minimum values 2 reservoir storages in the north river are built primarily for hydropower while those in the west river are primarily used for flood control irrespective of the dominant reservoir type the generally consistent change patterns of both rivers were as follows the monthly river discharge exhibited no obvious change the rise and fall rate decreased dramatically the number of reversals increased significantly and the high pulse count decreased 3 in the west river the low flow related indicators such as the base flow index and multi day minimum flow exhibited significant increases while the multi day maximum values exhibited significant decreases in the north river the multi day minimum values decreased and the maximum values exhibited no obvious change with respect to the pulse dynamics the low pulse count in the west river decreased with no clear change in the low pulse duration while the low pulse count in the north river increased with a shorter low pulse duration the high pulse duration increased in only the west river and exhibited no obvious change in the north river our study implies that the minimum ecological water demand should be considered not only in the large reservoirs operation but also in the operation of small hydropower reservoirs

6895,the hydrological alterations induced by dam construction modify natural flora and fauna habitats and impair ecosystem stability although many studies have documented the impacts of large dams on streamflow few have described the effects of small dam construction on hydrological conditions the cumulative effects of intensive small dams may also cause severe ecological problems to evaluate the impacts of dam construction on the indicators of hydrological alterations a framework that combined a hydrological model and the post bias correction method was proposed the hydrological alterations of two individual rivers in the jiulong river basin that experienced impacts from intensifying small hydropower reservoirs the north river and the west river were analyzed using the proposed framework the results show that the framework can successfully avoid misleading the impacts of dam construction on monthly runoff and multi minimum values detected by the previously common method that did not separate the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime the small hydropower dominated north river and the flood control dominated west river exhibited generally consistent change patterns of unchanging monthly river discharge reduced high pulse count reduced rise and fall rates and increased number of reversals conversely the changes to several indicators of hydrologic alterations iha differed between the two rivers the flood control dominated west river exhibited 1 increased indicators such as the base flow index multi day minimum flow and high pulse duration and 2 decreased multi day maximum flow and low pulse count unlike the west river the hydropower dominated north river experienced 1 increased low pulse count and 2 decreased indicators such as multi day minimum flow and low pulse duration our results implied that the ecological impacts of the small hydropower dominated north river may exceed those of the flood control dominated west river therefore the minimum ecological water demand should be considered not only in the large reservoirs operation but also in the operation of small hydropower reservoirs keywords flow regime indicators of hydrological alterations distributed hydrological model post bias correction method small dam construction 1 introduction dam construction has substantially altered the flow regimes of the majority of the rivers throughout the world naiman et al 1993 the construction of dams can alter the natural flow regime by affecting the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change in the flow richter et al 1996 nislow et al 2002 magilligan and nislow 2005 as well as by changing the sediment nutrients energy and biota ligon et al 1995 changes in flow regimes within the context of dam construction result in extensive environmental degradation and loss of biological diversity lytle and poff 2004 ziv et al 2012 castello and macedo 2016 therefore it is necessary to assess the degree of deviation from the natural flow regime characteristics that is induced by dam construction to provide support for the maintenance of fundamental ecological functions arthington et al 2006 poff et al 2010 schneider et al 2013 in this regard over 170 metrics have been developed to describe the different characteristics of the flow regime among which the indicators of hydrologic alterations iha method richter et al 1996 has been widely used olden and poff 2003 gao et al 2009 highly regulated rivers in china are dominated by large scale ecosystem alterations induced by hydrological alterations many of the previous studies associated with dam induced hydrological alterations across river basins in china have focused on the impacts of large dams that generally aim to control floods in large basins such as the lancang river zhao et al 2012 the mekong river li et al 2017 the pearl river zhang et al 2014 the yangtze river gao et al 2012 and the yellow river yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 all of these studies used the iha method to evaluate the hydrological impacts of dam construction in general these studies found that the operation of large dams 1 reduced the streamflow during wet seasons and increased the streamflow during dry seasons 2 reduced the maximum flow values and 3 increased the number of reversals but decreased the rates of rise and fall however the minimum flow values base flow indexes and pulsing behaviors varied depending on the operation size and location of the dam i e increases in the yangtze and mekong river li et al 2017 gao et al 2012 magilligan and nislow 2005 and decreases at several stations in the yellow river zhang et al 2018 these hydrological alterations caused further environmental problems for example the three gorges dam in the yangtze river caused reduced flow pulses that led to diminished aquatic biodiversity and fish populations gao et al 2012 moreover the magnitudes of large floods decreased and the high flow variability decreased the connectivity between the floodplain and the river channel which may have further reduced the species richness and abundance of waterfowl and aquatic plants wang et al 2016a b large decreases in the magnitude of high flow due to damming in the mekong river caused the trapping of sediments which altered the nutrient dynamics and other biogeochemical processes in the related deltas estuaries and marine shelf ecosystems kondolf et al 2014 li et al 2017 in addition to large dams the development of small dams has also been highlighted in national energy policies in china li and ma 2009 therefore small dam construction is intense in china especially in south china where the hydropower resources are extensive small dams are mainly designed for hydropower generation and may be constructed anywhere in the catchment where appropriate physical conditions exist deitch et al 2013 although small dams may not be individually capable of significantly influencing the streamflow the cumulative effects of many small dams may exceed those of large hydropower dams particularly with regard to ecologically relevant flow regimes deitch et al 2013 kibler and tullos 2013 however analogous research addressing the effects of high density small dams on hydrological conditions are scarce we thus present an investigation of the hydrological impacts of intense small hydropower development in the jiulong river basin which is a typical small catchment in southeast china to this end a framework for evaluating the impacts of dam construction on the flow regime was first proposed and then the changes in the flow regime before and after dam construction were analyzed by using this framework 2 study area and data acquisition 2 1 the jiulong river basin the jiulong river basin is a subtropical coastal watershed in southeast china with a drainage area of 14 741 km2 fig 1 the mean annual runoff is 1010 mm and the annual precipitation ranges from 1400 mm to 1800 mm and nearly 75 of the precipitation occurs from april to september the mean annual temperature is 19 9 21 1 c two major tributaries the north river and west river cover nearly 95 of the total area of the jiulong river basin the basin had 193 constructed reservoirs with storage capacities of 1 11 10 9 m 3 by the end of 2011 which were built for flood control hydropower generation irrigation and domestic and industrial water use 2 2 data acquisition and processing three hydrological stations and 10 meteorological stations in the jiulong river basin are available within the study area fig 1 the daily river discharge data were obtained from the hydrology and water resources bureau the meteorological data including daily air temperature mean maxima and minima daily relative humidity daily sunshine duration and daily wind speed were obtained from the national meteorological stations managed by the china meteorological administration cma precipitation data were from the 0 25 0 25 china gauge based daily precipitation cgdpa product shen et al 2014 the meteorological data were first interpolated to grids using an angular distance weighting method since the meteorological stations are sparse and unevenly distributed in the study area new et al 2000 and the 0 25 0 25 precipitation data were resampled to a 1 km grid using the nearest neighbor assignment in arcgis software after spatial interpolation the duration of the rainfall in a day was determined by the daily rainfall amounts the more rain the longer the duration gao et al 2016 the precipitation start time in a day is determined randomly and the daily precipitation amounts were downscaled into hourly precipitation by a normal distribution gao et al 2016 the land cover data at a 30 m resolution in 2000 were from the geographical information monitoring cloud platform http www dsac cn the land cover map was been reclassed into 10 categories including water body urban area bare soil forest irrigated cropland upland grassland shrub wetland and ice for each land use type a 15 day leaf area index lai was calculated by the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values sellers 1996 the ndvi data with 15 day and 0 05 0 05 temporal and spatial resolutions from 1982 to 2014 were collected from the 3rd generation of ndvi ndvi3g from global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms data the ndvi input in the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm before 1982 was replaced by the ndvi data in 1982 ma et al 2010 the soil hydraulic parameters including saturated soil moisture residual soil moisture and soil hydraulic conductivity and parameters α and n in the van genuchten model were provided by the china soil hydraulic parameters dataset which was provided by dai et al 2013 digital elevation data with a resolution of 90 m were downloaded from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm database jarvis et al 2008 the reservoir information achieved from a water resource planning survey implemented in 2011 included the reservoir name year of completion controlled basin area reservoir capacity and reservoir function 3 methodology 3 1 indicators of hydrologic alterations the iha method was first proposed by richter et al 1996 to evaluate the hydrological regime changes induced by various human activities such as dam operations flow diversion or groundwater pumping the iha method includes 33 biologically relevant hydrological parameters that characterize the intra annual variations in streamflow conditions richter et al 1996 proposed the 33 iha parameters because of high sensitivity of physical habitat alteration in lotic systems and high frequency of occurrences in limnology studies the 33 hydrological indicators are generally divided into the following 5 groups 1 the magnitude of the monthly discharge 2 the magnitude and duration of the annual extreme streamflow 3 the timing of the annual extreme streamflow 4 the frequency and duration of high and low pulses and 5 the rate and frequency of flow changes table s1 because no zero flow events occurred in this region 32 hydrological indicators excluding zero flow days were applied in this study 3 2 a framework for evaluating the impacts of dam construction on flow regime a previously common method to assess the hydrological impacts of dam construction using iha methods divided the pre impact and post impact period and then calculated the relative change between the observed iha metrics during the pre impact period and post impact period gao et al 2012 yang et al 2012 the previously common method requires less data and easier to be accomplished however the method that relies on observed flow data ignores the impacts of climate change and ascribes the observed hydrological alteration to the impacts of dam construction climate change maybe alter hydrological regimes greatly magilligan and nislow 2005 timpe and kaplan 2017 therefore a new framework was proposed to eliminate the impacts of climate change when quantifying the hydrological impacts of dam construction since post impact flow regime simulated by hydrological model without dam regulation module represented the natural flow regime and observed post impact flow regime represented the altered flow regime influenced by climate change and dam construction the framework quantified the impacts of dam construction through subtracting the simulated post impact flow regime from the observed flow regime the framework consists of four main steps fig 2 1 the pettitt test pettitt 1979 was used to identify the abrupt change point of the reservoir capacities variations during the available streamflow period and the whole period was divided into a pre impact and post impact period based on the abrupt change point then the observed iha metrics for the two periods were calculated 2 a distributed gbhm was employed to simulate the natural flow series during the post impact period 3 based on the observed and simulated pre impact iha metrics post bias correction was used to obtain bias corrected simulated iha values in the post impact period 4 the observed and bias corrected simulated post impact flow statistics were compared to estimate the flow alteration due to dam construction 3 2 1 brief description of the distributed hydrological model and evaluation in this study the daily runoff in the jiulong river basin a humid catchment over the period from 1960 to 2014 need to be simulated by a hydrological model the gbhm developed by yang et al 1998 2002 has been successfully applied in humid regions like yangtze river li et al 2015 mekong river wang et al 2016a b and chao phraya river yang and musiake 2003 and performs well in simulating daily runoff therefore the gbhm is used in this study to simulate the natural streamflow processes over the period from 1960 to 2014 the distributed model is forced by meteorological data and the regulations of dams are not included in the model structure the gbhm uses a basin subdivision scheme and a sub grid parameterization scheme the horton strahler scheme is applied to subdivide the study basin into subcatchments and order the river network conveniently based on the dem data each subcatchment is divided into several flow intervals according to the flow distance to the outlet and then a flow interval is generalized as a series of hillslope units the hillslope unit is the computational unit for hydrological simulation yang et al 2002 2004 hydrological simulation in the gbhm includes two main components the hillslope hydrological module and flow routing module yang et al 2004 the hydrological processes calculated in the hillslope hydrological module are canopy interception evapotranspiration infiltration surface flow subsurface flow and exchange between groundwater and the river the flow routing in the river network was solved using the kinematic wave approach more information about methods used in these hydrological processes in gbhm can be found in yang et al 2002 2004 in the present study the gbhm uses a 1 km resolution hillslope and is implemented on a one hour time step a warm up run of the model from 1960 to 1962 was used to get a stable value of model state variables such as soil moisture groundwater table and river water depth at the beginning of 1963 specifically the model ran recursively during 1960 1962 and the nse and bias were calculated using simulated streamflow from the latest run and the last run if nse is equal to 1 and bias ranges from 0 3 and 0 3 the warm up run can be stopped and the stable value of model state variables at the beginning of 1963 was obtained after the warm up run the daily river discharge data from 1963 to 1967 were used to calibrate the model parameters the objective of calibration is to constrain the percent bias pbias between 10 and 10 and constrain the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and logarithmic transformed nash and sutcliffe efficiency lnse coefficient to 0 7 according to the general performance recommended by moriasi et al 2007 the parameters used in the gbhm are listed in table 1 miao et al 2016 the manually calibrated parameters in the gbhm included the hydraulic conductivity of groundwater groundwater storage coefficient slope shape factor and saturated hydraulic conductivity at the bottom the daily river discharge from 1968 to 1972 was used for model validation and then simulations were performed from 1963 to 2014 the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 lnse smakhtin et al 1998 and pbias gupta et al 1999 were adopted to evaluate the model performance in terms of the accuracy of simulated daily data compared to the measured daily flow which are defined as 1 nse 1 t 1 t q sim t q sim t 2 t 1 t q obs t q obs 2 2 lnse 1 t 1 t l n q sim t l n q sim t 2 t 1 t l n q obs t l n q obs 2 3 pbias t 1 t q obs t q sim t 100 t 1 t q obs t where q obs t and q sim t are the observed and simulated streamflow at time t respectively q obs is the average value of the observed streamflow during the period t to evaluate the ability of a hydrological model to replicate iha values two statistical methods were employed 1 pearson correlation coefficient and 2 mann whitney u test nachar 2008 the correlation analysis evaluated the simulation accuracy of the interannual variabilities of those iha values while the mann whitney u test examined the statistical significance of the mean differences between the observed and simulated iha values according to the recommendation by moriasi et al 2007 nse lnse values between 0 65 and 1 0 and pbias values between 10 and 10 indicate that the model performs well at simulating the daily discharge process in this study the iha value passes the mann whitney u test which means that the observed and simulated mean values are not significantly different and the pearson correlation coefficient is higher than 0 4 which represents that the model can adequately replicate the corresponding iha values shrestha et al 2014 ryo et al 2015 3 2 2 post bias correction for the simulated iha values the objective function for manual calibration of the model is single and the model is calibrated step by step firstly evaporation related parameters are adjusted to reduce pbias value within the reasonable range defined in the study then other parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity of groundwater groundwater storage coefficient slope shape factor and saturated hydraulic conductivity at the bottom are adjusted to make nse and lnse values reach the expected level and maintain pbias value within the recommended range because our calibration objective is to maintain pbias nse and lnse in a recommended range this cannot guarantee that each iha metric is appropriately simulated however quantification of the impacts of dams requires a relatively high model accuracy when reproducing the iha values thus it is necessary to remove the possible bias from the simulated mean iha values to this end a simple bias removal method called the quantile mapping method panofsky and brier 1968 was used in this study this method removes the mean bias by matching the cumulative distribution functions cdf of the observed and simulated iha values the quantile mapping method has the benefit of accounting for biases in all statistical moments and it is assumed that biases relative to observations at each quantile are constant during the projections thrasher et al 2012 there are three major limitations of this method boé et al 2007 i the temporal autocorrelation properties of the series are not corrected ii each variable is corrected independently iii the spatial autocorrelation of the different variables may be biased this approach has been used extensively to reduce the bias of satellite retrievals of soil moisture reichle and koster 2004 and correct the systematic distributional bias in precipitation and temperature outputs from climate models piani et al 2010 in particular hashino et al 2007 used the quantile mapping method to shift the probability distribution of the ensemble forecasts of monthly streamflow fig 3 shows the principal scheme of the quantile mapping method taking one iha value as an example the observed and simulated cdf in the pre impact period and the simulated cdf in the post impact period can be obtained through empirical quantiles of data i e the sorted values in a sample the steps that obtain corrected cdf for simulated cdf in the post impact period are as follows step1 xsim reprensents the simulated value smaller than the largest simulated value in the pre impact period maxsim on simulated cdf in the post impact period probabilities p 1 and p 2 corresponding to xsim can be found for the simulated cdf during the pre impact period and post impact period respectively step2 given the probability p 1 the value xcorr can be obtained from the observed cdf during the pre impact period step3 p 2 xcorr on corrected cdf is the corrected point of p 2 xsim on simulated cdf in the post impact period step4 ysim reprensents the simulated value larger than maxsim the largest observed value maxobs in the pre impact period and probabilities p 3 corresponding to ysim for the simulated cdf during post impact period can be obtained step5 p 3 ysim maxobs maxsim on corrected cdf is the corrected point of p 3 ysim on simulated cdf in the post impact period 4 results 4 1 model performance in simulating streamflow and iha metrics fig 4 shows the observed and simulated daily logarithmic transformed river discharge at the zhangping upper north river punan lower north river and zhengdian lower west river stations during the calibration period 1963 1967 and validation period 1968 1972 the pbias nse and lnse values for the simulated daily discharges at the three stations are listed in table 2 the simulated river discharge at the zhangping upper north river station and punan lower north river station exhibited similar results with pbias values greater than 9 and nse lnse values larger than 0 79 which indicated that the daily discharge simulations in the north river were very good although the statistics at the zhengdian lower west river station were slightly worse than those in the north river the simulation discharge at the zhengdian lower west river station still performed well in general the model effectively captured the temporal variability of streamflow at all three stations table 3 depicts the pearson correlation coefficient and results of the mann whitney u test between the observed and gbhm simulated iha values for the three stations during the pre impact period the number in bold means that the observed and gbhm simulated iha values were significant differences at the 95 confidence level fig s1 shows the observed and simulated 30 day minimum and 1 day maximum value at three stations from 1963 to 2014 of the 32 iha values 29 for zhangping upper north river station 29 for punan lower north river station and 24 for zhengdian lower west river station passed the mann whitney u test and had pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0 4 representing that the model can adequately replicate the corresponding iha value when simulating most of the iha values at the three stations however the fall rate number of reversals at three stations and low flow related iha indicators such as 1 day 3 day 7 day baseflow index low pulse count and duration at the zhengdian lower west river station showed significant differences in mean values but relatively high correlation values 0 4 in addition low pulse duration at the zhangping upper north river station and rise rate at the punan lower north river station have low correlation values but no significant difference in mean values 4 2 changes in reservoir storage fig 5 shows the accumulated water storage capacities in the drainage area of zhangping upper north river punan lower north river and zhengdian lower west river stations in the jiulong river basin from 1956 to 2011 based on the pettitt test pettitt 1979 the abrupt change point was 1973 for the west river station whereas it was 1976 for the north river stations at a significance level of 0 05 the extracted change points represented the start year of intensive dam construction therefore for the north river stations the streamflow from 1963 to 1999 and 2006 2014 were separated into a pre impact period 1963 1975 and a post impact period 1976 1999 2006 2014 for the west river station the pre impact period was 1963 1972 and the post impact period was 1973 1999 and 2006 2014 the 193 reservoirs constructed in the jiulong river basin were built to meet certain purposes such as flood control hydropower generation and water supply including irrigation domestic and industrial water use a total of 51 of these reservoirs are single purpose reservoirs of which 98 serve for hydropower generation the rest are multipurpose reservoirs that serve several purposes with different precedence levels the higher precedence level of one purpose of one multipurpose reservoir means that the purpose should be satisfied first when it conflicts with other purposes with lower precedence levels for simplicity we assumed that the operation rules of multipurpose reservoirs are determined by the purpose with the highest precedence level fig 1 shows the distribution of the existing reservoirs used in this study all of the reservoirs are widely spread throughout the jiulong river basin and 135 out of the 193 reservoirs are located in tributaries hydropower reservoirs accounted for 68 and 60 of the reservoirs in the drainage areas of the zhangping upper north river station and punan lower north river station respectively while 41 of the reservoirs are hydropower reservoirs in the drainage area of the zhengdian lower west river station only two flood control reservoirs exist in the jiulong river basin and both are located in the tributaries the reservoir capacities for hydropower flood control and water supply in the drainage areas of three stations in the jiulong river basin by the end of 2011 are shown in fig 6 the reservoirs in the drainage areas of the zhangping and punan north river stations had largest hydropower storage capacities while those in the drainage area of the zhengdian lower west river station had largest flood control storage capacities in the drainage areas of the punan and zhangping north river stations the hydropower reservoir storage is far greater than the storage of the other two reservoir types in the drainage area of the zhengdian lower west river station water supply reservoirs are most abundant but they have the smallest storage capacities and the flood control reservoir has the largest storage capacity hence the streamflow at the zhangping and punan north river stations are dominantly affected by hydropower reservoirs and that at the zhengdian lower west river station is mainly influenced by flood control reservoirs 4 3 impact of dam construction on flow regime table 4 lists the observed and simulated monthly runoff during the post impact period the number in bold indicates that the iha value is significantly different compared to the observed and simulated values during the post impact period at the 95 confidence level twenty eight out of the 32 iha metrics at the zhangping upper north river and punan lower north river stations experienced consistent decreased or increased changes and the other 4 metrics exhibited no obvious changes for both stations indicating that the zhangping and punan stations in north river had similar change patterns in iha metrics to compare the change pattern differences in the north and west river the zhangping upper north river and punan lower north river stations were considered as one group called north river stations and zhengdian station was called west river station we assumed that a significant change in one iha metric at any of the zhangping and punan stations in north river was considered to be a significant iha metric change for the north river the changes in monthly runoff rise rate high pulse count fall rate and number of reversals exhibit consistent patterns among the three stations as shown in table 4 the average monthly runoff in most months exhibited a nonsignificant difference the rise rate and fall rate decreased dramatically while the number of reversals increased dramatically the high pulse counts at the north river and west river stations all decreased most of the iha metrics showed different patterns at the two river stations the different patterns can be categorized into two types 1 both the north river and west river stations exhibit significant changes but have different change directions e g one is positive and one is negative 2 one river station changes significantly while the other one changes nonsignificantly the 3 day and 7 day minimum values and the low pulse count belonged to the first category specifically the 3 day and 7 day minimums at the north river stations decreased significantly with relative changes below 20 while those at the west river stations increased significantly the low pulse counts at the north river stations significantly increased with an average relative change of 43 2 while those at the west river stations decreased with a relative change of 43 8 the 30 day maximum value base flow index date of minimum flow high pulse duration and low pulse duration belonged to the second category at the west river station the 30 day maximum value and date of minimum flow exhibited significant decreases while the base flow index and high pulse duration increased significantly however these indicators did not exhibit significant changes at the north river stations in contrast the north river stations experienced significant changes in low pulse duration while the west river stations exhibited no obvious changes 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the framework with the previously common method although the daily discharge simulations at the downstream west river station were still considered to be good moriasi et al 2007 they were slightly worse compared to the north river stations before 1972 the end of the validation period the total reservoir storage were 33 31 222 61 m3 in the drainage area of zhangping and punan north river stations respectively the total reservoir storage the drainage area of zhengdian lower west river station was 877 09 m3 which is much larger than that of the north river stations therefore the observed discharge at zhengdian lower west river station during the calibration and validation period may deviate from the natural runoff on the other hand the model simulates the natural runoff the slightly worse model simulations at the zhengdian lower west river station may be caused by the deviation of observed runoff rather than the model limitations the relative change between simulated iha results in table s2 during the pre impact and post impact period represents the flow alteration caused by climate change from pre impact period to post impact period it can be seen that the climate change from pre impact period and post impact period was demonstrated to have influences on flow regime such as monthly runoff during march and april the multi minimum values low pulse count and high pulse count table 5 lists the iha for the three stations using the previously common method the relative change calculated by the previously common method obspost obspre obspre in table 5 was compared to those calculated by the proposed framework obs sim obs in table 4 most of the iha metrics calculated by the proposed framework had consistent statistical significance with those calculated by the previously common method however the monthly runoff data exhibited no clear change in the proposed framework while the previously common method indicated increased monthly runoff such as during march at three stations and increased monthly runoff during 5 other months at the zhengdian lower west river station moreover the decreased multi minimum values calculated by the proposed framework at the punan lower north river station were not detected by the previously common method the previously common method did not separate the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime which can mislead the estimations of the patterns of monthly runoff and multi minimum values magilligan and nislow 2005 zhao et al 2012 as the minimum flow has played an important role in maintaining the normal functioning of the ecosystem rolls et al 2012 it is necessary to use the framework instead of the previously common method to quantify the flow regime alteration induced by dams 5 2 dam induced hydrological alterations comparison of hydropower and flood control reservoirs in the jiulong river basin the north river was dominated by hydropower reservoirs while the west river was dominated by flood control reservoirs according to the reservoir capacities fig 6 the dominated reservoir type of river was determined by the type of reservoir that has the largest storage capacities zhang et al 2015 stated that the hydropower facilities in the jiulong river were small scale 50 mw dams irrespective of the dominant reservoirs in the north and west river changes in monthly runoff high pulse count rise and fall rate and number of reversals were consistent between the north river and west river the monthly runoff exhibited a nonsignificant difference the high pulse count rise rate and fall rate decreased while the number of reversals increased our results confirm the conclusions of a previous study by magilligan and nislow 2005 who found that the number of reversals was increased by either hydropower or flood control reservoirs changes in monthly runoff is in contrast to the results found for large dams which reduced the streamflow during wet seasons and increased the streamflow during dry seasons li et al 2017 gao et al 2012 one large difference between the hydropower dominated north river and the flood control dominated west river was associated with the magnitude of annual extreme streamflow increased minimum flow and decreased maximum flow in the west river are associated with the operation of large reservoir reserves the large reservoirs can reduce the maximum flow significantly for providing flood suppression graf 2006 gao et al 2012 in addition to preventing flood the large reservoirs also need to release water to downstream users during dry seasons which results in the increased minimum flow li et al 2017 räsänen et al 2017 with respect to the hydropower dominated north river the decreased minimum flow was induced by hydropower generation in which the small reservoir was designed for only power generation and needed to generate as much electricity as possible and this reservoir may even store water to reach a sufficient head before generating electricity during dry seasons richter et al 1996 deitch et al 2013 li et al 2017 timpe and kaplan 2017 the lack of an obvious change in the maximum flow in the north river may be the result of the fact that small dams do not reduce high flows kibler and tullos 2013 deitch et al 2013 the low pulse dynamics represented another different change pattern the significantly decreased low pulse count in the west river indicated that the flood control reservoir caused the reduction of the low pulse this finding fits the commonly held belief that impoundment of flood control reservoirs leads to increased minimum flows graf 2006 gao et al 2012 5 3 the possible impacts of hydrological alterations on river ecology our study demonstrated that both rivers exhibited consistent changes in the rise rate high pulse count fall rate and number of reversals these changes may trap aquatic organisms in floodplain lakes and strand terrestrial organisms on floodplain islands timpe and kaplan 2017 the decreased high pulse count also reduced hydrological connectivity which prevents exchange of matter energy and organisms between floodplains and river systems which should reduce the spawning area and recruitment success of river fish and lead to a decline in the richness and abundance of waterbird species and wetland vegetation through habitat fragmentation hu et al 2008 changes in low flow and high flow magnitude showed different patterns in the north river and west river the low flow value decreased in the north river but increased in the west river in the north river the decreased low flow magnitude contributed to a decrease in the water velocity which directly led to accelerated channel bed sedimentation and aggravated the effects of water pollution resulting in many concomitant biological changes smakhtin 2001 during the dry period the deterioration of the water quality such as low oxygen contents and high levels of nutrients that are associated with decreasing low flow can drive the production of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria thereby contributing to significant and widespread occurrences of phytoplankton blooms associated with eutrophication vliet and zwolsman 2008 bilotta and brazier 2008 the high flow value exhibited no obvious changes in the north river but it decreased in the west river zhao et al 2015 demonstrated that the sediment carried by high flow events was the main source of sediment in the jiulong river estuary therefore the decreased high flow in the west river may reduce the sedimentation in the jiulong river estuary and change the high flow structure and morphology of the stream channel yang et al 2012 the low pulse and high pulse dynamics showed another different pattern in the north river and west river the low pulse count increased in the north river and decreased in the west river the increasing number of low pulses in the west river suggests that the richness of plant and animal species that are unable to tolerate or persist would decline and the reduced number of low pulses in the north river support a greater proportion of plant and animal species with life history traits that are unsuited to survival under low flow conditions rolls et al 2012 either increased or decreased low pulse count influences soil moisture and anaerobic stress for plants and the availability of floodplain habitats for aquatic organisms graf 2006 therefore maintaining a natural low pulse count is beneficial to aquatic system health and a natural low pulse count at the downstream at least can be maintained possibly by operation of the last one locates on the lower reach of cascade dams the high pulse duration also exhibited no clear change in the north river but increased in the west river the increased high pulse duration in the west river may lead to excessive hydrological connectivity which is also expected to reduce habitat heterogeneity with concomitant declines in biodiversity ward et al 2010 in the north river decreased high pulse counts and the lack of changes in the high pulse duration reduced the connectivity between floodplains and river systems which was associated with declines in biodiversity in the west river increased high pulse duration and decreased high pulse count may offset the influence of each other on hydrological connectivity which is beneficial to maintaining the balance of nutrient and organic matter exchanges between rivers and floodplains 6 conclusions according to the results of this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a framework that combined a hydrological model and the post bias correction method was proposed to investigate the effects of dam construction on iha the hydrological model gbhm used in this study can adequately reproduce the temporal variability of the streamflow in the jiulong river basin considering the uncertainty of the iha simulation a post bias correction for the simulated iha was accomplished by using the quantile mapping method compared to the previously common method that did not separate the impacts of climate change and dam construction on flow regime the framework can effectively avoid the misleading of the change pattern of monthly runoff and multi minimum values 2 reservoir storages in the north river are built primarily for hydropower while those in the west river are primarily used for flood control irrespective of the dominant reservoir type the generally consistent change patterns of both rivers were as follows the monthly river discharge exhibited no obvious change the rise and fall rate decreased dramatically the number of reversals increased significantly and the high pulse count decreased 3 in the west river the low flow related indicators such as the base flow index and multi day minimum flow exhibited significant increases while the multi day maximum values exhibited significant decreases in the north river the multi day minimum values decreased and the maximum values exhibited no obvious change with respect to the pulse dynamics the low pulse count in the west river decreased with no clear change in the low pulse duration while the low pulse count in the north river increased with a shorter low pulse duration the high pulse duration increased in only the west river and exhibited no obvious change in the north river our study implies that the minimum ecological water demand should be considered not only in the large reservoirs operation but also in the operation of small hydropower reservoirs

6896,using monthly streamflow data from 9 gauging stations covering a period of 1960 2014 across the huai river basin china the pettitt method and gamlss model were used to quantify flood frequency and related implications for flood hazards results indicated that 1 no significant change points were observed in flood flows at the huangchuan hengpaitou and bengbu stations however significant hydrological alterations were detected for flood flows at other 6 stations with change points during 2000 2 flood flows at the bantai jiangjiaji and hengpaitou stations were nonstationary but stationary flood flows were detected at other 6 stations the weibull distribution was the appropriate probability distribution describing flood flows across the huai river basin and the lognormal distribution is the second best distribution 3 no significant difference was detected for 10 and 20 year flood frequencies using the pearson iii type distribution function under the stationarity assumption however significant and increasing differences were expected for 30 50 and 100 year floods it can be concluded that the assumption of stationarity if the flood flows are actually nonstationary can produce biased flood frequencies using pearson iii type distribution and this result provides a critical reference for flood frequency analysis under the nonstationarity and or stationarity assumption 4 after 30 years the flood magnification factor at hengpaitou and bengbu stations increased from 1 to 1 12 and from 1 to 1 06 respectively implying higher flood risks at the hengpaitou station in addition after 30 years the return period of 100 year flood decreased from 100 years to less 70 years at the hengpaitou station and from 100 years to nearly 78 years implying higher frequency of floods with return periods of 100 years moreover significant relations were detected between annual peak flood flow and flood affected crop areas implying that annual peak flood flow can be taken as an indicator of flood disasters across the huai river basin and even in the anhui province keywords nonstationarity annual peak flood flow gamlss flood magnification factor return period 1 introduction warming climate due to human induced emission of greenhouse gases e g min et al 2011 and relevant impacts on ecological systems daufresne et al 2009 and on hydrological cycle in particular have aroused a widespread international interest mirza 2002 alan et al 2003 allan and soden 2008 hirabayashi et al 2013 apurv et al 2015 li et al 2015 flood management policies and designs are generally based on an estimate of flood frequency with a certain return period such as 30 years 50 years or even 100 years gilroy and mccuen 2012 the assumption of stationarity of annual peak flood series is of significant interest for managing flood hazards water resources management and design of hydraulic facilities such as water reservoirs thus the stationarity of flood records pertains to the physical processes associated with flood production sample properties of flood records statistical procedures that are used to infer distributional properties of floods and temporal changes in the flood peak distribution villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 however it was advocated that stationarity is dead and cannot be revived milly et al 2008 milly et al 2008 ascribed the demise of stationarity to anthropogenic changes of earth s climate changes in land use land cover and regulation of rivers by dams and reservoirs climate is changing and warming climate in particular boosts the atmosphere s water holding capacity by about 7 per 1 c and hence more intense precipitation regimes e g berg et al 2013 kunkel et al 2013 therefore warming climate has the potential to increase flood and drought risks jongman et al 2014 besides human activities also have increasingly interfered in the streamflow processes as well as extreme hydrological processes zhang et al 2015a zhang et al 2015a indicated that human interferences in hydrological processes via damming and construction of reservoirs greatly alter the streamflow vs precipitation relation therefore the nonstationarity assumption has been widely accepted in the quantification of flood frequency and flood risk gilroy and mccuen 2012 tan and gan 2015 zhang et al 2015b china has the largest population in the world and hence agricultural development means much for china due to substantial food requirement since 2009 frequent extreme droughts and floods have occurred in most parts of china and consequently huge losses of crop yields e g wang et al 2014 wu et al 2015 furthermore population in eastern china accounts for more than 70 of the total population of the country e g zhu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 the study region considered in this study the huai river basin is located exactly in the eastern part of china fig 1 in this study and fig 1 in zhang et al 2017 the huai river basin is also densely populated with great potential in socio economy the basin provides 20 of the total agricultural products with 10 of the total crop land of china feeding 20 4 of the total countryside population hence agricultural development in the huai river basin is critical for food security of china however the basin is located in the transitional zone between semi arid and semi humid climates with frequent occurrences of droughts and floods from the beginning of the 21st century the annual average drought affected crop area has reached 2 698 106 hm2 and the drought destroyed crop land area has reached 1 408 106 hm2 accounting for 21 and 11 of the total cropland of the basin further booming development of social economy combined with increasing water demand is causing the basin to be more vulnerable to droughts and floods therefore basin scale management of water resources and agricultural irrigation calls for the evaluation of flood frequency and flood risk and this point constitutes the research objective of this study however no reports are available so far addressing nonstationary evaluation of flood frequency and flood risk in the huai river basin therefore this study can help bridge the knowledge gap in terms of flood frequency and flood risk with the assumption of nonstationarity which formulates the motivation of this study therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to understand the role of change points in nonstationary flood processes 2 to know about the temporal behavior of annual peak flood flow and to 3 to understand changes of annual peak flood flow with different return periods and variation of return periods under the nonstationarity assumption in addition the relation between annual peak flood flow and flood affected flood damaged crop areas in the huai river basin and also anhui province was developed this study although it is a kind of regional study provides a protocol in terms of nonstationary flood behavior in regions of climatic demarcation between semi arid and semi humid climates besides results of this study will be important for the understanding of flood behavior in a changing environment at regional and basin scales 2 data and methods 2 1 data annual maximum flow data from 9 hydrological stations were collected for analysis in this study locations of these 9 stations can be found in fig 1 the data from the huangchuan and hengpaitou stations covered a time period of 1964 2016 and the data from other stations covered a period of 1956 2016 the hydrological data were obtained from water commission of huai river basin china at http www hrc gov cn smodel model hrc data of agricultural losses of wheat and rice were collected from encyclopedia of meteorological disasters in china edited by wen 2005 in 2005 this encyclopedia includes 32 volumes for 32 provinces of china besides data of hazards and hazard induced losses were collected from collections of agricultural statistics of the 30 years of reform and opening in china nbsc 2009 and china agriculture yearbook liang and shen 2000 sun et al 2017 2 2 detection of change points pettitt method is a kind of nonparametric method based on mann whitney pettitt 1979 for detection of change points in terms of mean and variance it is assumed that two samples i e x 1 x 2 x t and x t 1 x n are from the same population beaulieu et al 2012 1 u t n u t 1 n j 1 n sgn x t x j where x t and x j are the tth and jth data of the hydrological series respectively t 1 2 n at the significance level of 0 05 the change point at t can be confirmed given p 0 05 eq 1 aims to detect change points in terms of mean value detection of change points can be done as 1 x 1 x 2 x n denote the real world observed flood series 2 l denotes the loss function and 3 y denotes the series of the square sum of residuals 4 t denotes the time 5 f t denotes the goodness of fit model for the real world observed flood series i e y i i 1 n x i l i 2 2 l x i f t i x i 2 eq 2 is for the detection of change point in terms of variance 2 3 modified mann kendall in this study the nonparametric mann kendall trend m k test method was used in detection of trends mann 1945 kendall 1975 alan et al 2003 however many researchers found that the serial correlation of the time series can affect results by the m k method and the serial effects should be screened out before trend analysis von storch and navarra 1995 thereafter hamed and rao 1998 developed a modified m k mmk test based on the effective or equivalent sample size ess to remove the effects of autocorrelation on m k results in the modified m k method the modified variance of the mk statistic was used to replace the original one if the lag i autocorrelation coefficients were significantly different from zero at the 5 significance level hamed and rao 1998 mmk was also used in this study to quantify trends of hydrological series the significance level for mmk was set at 5 detailed algorithm of mmk can be found in daufresne et al 2009 2 4 gamlss model the gamlss generalized additive models for location scale and shape model was proposed by vogel et al 2011 to evaluate stationarity and nonstationarity of a time series in the gamlss model a time series of y 1 y 2 y n is assumed to be independent and follows the distribution function of f y y i θ i and θ i θ 1 θ 2 θ p denotes the vector with p parameters such as location scale and shape here g k is defined as a monotonic functional relation between the explanatory variable θ k and the random component x k as 3 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k z jk γ jk where η k and θ k are vectors with sample size of n β k t β 1 k β 2 k β j k k is the parameter vector with sample size of j k x k is the matrix of the explanatory variable with length of n j k z jk is the fixed design matrix of n q jk γ jk is the variable following the standard normal distribution without considering the impact of random effects on the distribution parameters let j k 0 and eq 3 is deduced as 4 g k θ k η k x k β k when t is the explanatory variable the explanatory variable matrix can be 5 x k 1 t t i k 1 1 t t i k 1 1 t t i k 1 1 t t i k 1 n i k putting eq 4 into eq 5 one can obtain the functional relations between distribution parameters and explanatory variable of t as 6 g 1 θ 1 t β 11 β 21 t β i 1 1 t i 1 1 g 2 θ 2 t β 12 β 21 t β i 2 2 t i 2 1 in this study the stationarity of mean and variance corresponding to the location and scale parameters respectively was evaluated taking t as the only explanatory variable a linear function was developed to link mean θ 1 and variance θ 2 and eq 6 can be deduced as 7 g 1 θ 1 i t i β 1 8 g 2 θ 2 i t i β 2 the recent studies reported that applying only the linear trend to model non stationarity may increase the bias of the non stationary model agilan and umamahesh 2017 moreover the choice of covariate has a significant influence on calculating non stationary return levels agilan and umamahesh 2018 based on the method of self starting nonlinear logistic https www r project org taking t as the only explanatory variable a non linear function was developed to link mean θ 1 and variance θ 2 and eq 6 can be deduced as lambert and lindsey 1999 rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 9 g 1 θ 1 i α 1 e xmid scale t where α xmid scale are three parameters of logistic in this study functional relations were built between the distribution matrix of time series and time t using the gamlss model trends and abrupt changes of the hydrological series were combined into the gamlss model for further analysis four two parameter distribution functions were selected in this study i e gumbel gu gamma ga lognormal logno and weibull wei four types of models were developed 1 stationary model θ 1 and θ 2 are constants 2 θ 1 is nonstationary and is the linear function of time t 3 θ 2 is nonstationary and is the linear function of time t 4 θ 1 θ 2 are nonstationary and are the linear function of time t the akaike information criterion aic was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the distribution models and functions worm plot was used for visualizing the fitting performance of candidate models 2 5 flood magnification factor the flood magnification factor is defined so that the current design flood quantile are multiplied by the flood magnification factor to obtain the flood magnitude in some future year employing the nonstationary flood frequency model to derive the flood magnification factor was defined by vogel et al 2011 as x p t exp y β t t n 1 t n 2 t 1 2 2 n z p s y 10 m x p t δ t x p t exp β δ t if the flood magnification factor is larger than 1 then it points to floods with larger magnitudes in the future and hence the designed flood mitigation infrastructure may satisfy the flood mitigation objective and vice versa in eq 10 m is the flood magnification factor and δt is the time interval t is some current time period of interest s y is an estimate of the standard deviation of natural logarithms of the annual maximum floods and z p is he inverse of a standard normal random variable with exceedance probability p 2 6 return reduction return reduction is defined as the average time between floods in some future year t f associated with the flood with an average recurrence interval of t o in some reference year t o vogel et al 2011 if the average recurrence intervals related with a flood today and in some future year are t o and tf respectively then their respective exceedance probabilities are given by p o 1 t o and p f 1 t f respectively the tf can be computed as 11 t f 1 1 φ z p o β s y φ is the cumulative probability distribution function of a standardized normal variable and represents the probability that a standardized normal variable is less than the value inside the parentheses vogel et al 2011 before flood frequency analysis using the nonstationary model the annual peak streamflow series should be tested for normality and the normality test was done for the residuals from the exponential trend model in this study kolmogorov smirnov s statistic d k s d method was used to test the normality the empirical or experimental frequency was computed using the blom equation recommended by heo et al 2008 i e 12 p i i 0 375 n 0 25 where p i is the experimental frequency i is the order and n is the sample size of data under consideration 2 7 pearson iii p iii distribution famous statistician carl pearson developed a whole system consisting of seven types of distributions the pearson iii distribution is sometimes called as the three parameter gamma distribution since it can be obtained from the two parameter gamma distribution by introducing so called location parameter c landwehr et al 1978 13 f x 1 β γ α x c β α 1 e x c β parameter c is also the lower bound for this distribution x 3 c the pearson iii distribution is very flexible since it has three parameters which can produce a wide variety of shapes of density function parameter a is governing the skewness of the distribution and when it tends to infinity the pearson iii distribution becomes normal distribution the pearson type iii distribution is frequently used for annual maximum floods 2 8 nonstationary return levels with assumption of nonstationarity the gev parameters are varying in a temporal sense and the return level can be computed in each year which is known as the effective return level cheng et al 2014 renards et al 2013 in the case of nonstationary gev parameters a stationary return level can be computed based on quantiles of the nonstationary parameters p 1 1 t 15 r p μ σ ξ log p ξ 1 16 μ t q k μ 1 μ 2 μ t 17 σ t q k σ 1 σ 2 σ t 18 ξ t q k ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ t where qk indicates the kth quantile of the arguments which can be chosen based on the application for example choosing k 0 5 would represent the median behavior of each nonstationary gev parameter 3 results and discussions 3 1 change points and trends of annual maximum flow amf fig 2 a and b illustrate the spatial distribution of stations with different change points with respect to the mean and variance values it can be seen from fig 2a that annual maximum flow amf series at only three stations were subject to significant change points during 2009 1992 and 2000 respectively in addition these three stations are located on northern side to the mainstream of the upper and middle huai river basin however significant change points for variance during 1969 2000 and 2001 were detected at 6 out of 9 stations specifically the amf series of 5 out of 6 stations were characterized by significant change points during 2000 and 2001 implying similar hydrometeorological mechanisms behind change points and hence similar timing of change points fig 2b recent 60 years have witnessed significant warming processes in the upper and middle huang river basin and it is particularly the case after the 1990s in addition precipitate fluctuations which bring about frequent occurrences of floods and droughts and other related weather and hydrological extremes xiao et al 2017 in general decreased precipitation can be observed before the 1990s and increased precipitation after 2000 and increased extreme precipitation in particular zhang et al 2016 significant intensification of precipitation processes was observed during the 1990s 2000s and more frequent floods and droughts were also observed after the 1990s zhang et al 2017 it should be interpreted that 1991 witnessed widespread floods across the entire huai river basin and then serious and drought occurred during 1992 which was the major cause behind the abrupt change of mean flood flow during 1992 along the mainstream of the upper and middle huai river basin fig 2a it should be emphasized here that no large scale hydraulic facilities were built in the upper and middle huai river basin after the 1990s and hence the abrupt behavior of flood flow with respect to mean and variance should be attributed to precipitation changes for trends of amf no significant trends were detected for amf at huangchuan hengpaitou and bengbu stations but significant amf trends were found at other stations fig 3 table 1 table 1 shows more details pertaining to trends of the entire amf series and trends of subseries before and after change points it can be seen from fig 3 and table 1 that amf was decreasing at six stations xixian jiangjiaji lutaizi with different changing magnitudes of trends before and after the change points while negative trends before the change point but positive trends after change point of amf at wangjiaba station were detected generally more significant decreased amf was detected before change points in fuyang station however amf was decreasing at bantai station with different changing magnitudes of trends before and after the change points therefore without consideration of change points trends of amf can be misleading 3 2 the temporal behavior of the annual peak flood flow 3 2 1 goodness of fit evaluation of gamlss model amf series were nonstationary based on the above results due to change points and trends hence gamlss model was used to model amf changes based on two parameter probability distribution functions it can be seen from table 2 that weibull distribution function can be used to simulate amf changes at the huangchuan and bengbu stations while the lognormal distribution function was the right one for describing the statistical properties of amf at the hengpaitou station with respect to nonstationarity the selected models for amf at the huangchuan and bengbu stations were stationary but θ 1 and θ 2 parameters for amf at the hengpaitou station were nonstationary actually the aic values exhibited slight differences for these five models table 3 nonlinear nonstationarity is not necessarily considered in describing the gamlss model behaviors of the amf for those stations with change points within amf series table 2 weibull distribution function was the right choice and was used for modelling amf at the xixian bantai and wangjiaba stations the gamma distribution function was the right choice for modelling amf at the jiangjiaji and bantai stations nonstationary models in θ 1 and θ 2 parameters were used for modelling amf at the bantai and jiangjiaji stations in summary the optimal distribution functions were weibull function and then the lognormal distribution function for modelling amf at 5 out of 9 stations nonstationary models can be developed for amf analysis at two stations i e bantai jiangjiaji and hengpaitou stations amf series at other 6 hydrological stations considered in this study can be modelled by stationary models for modelling of amf series with no significant change points nonstationary and stationary models have similar aic values however for modelling amf series with significant change points nonstationary and stationary models had distinctly different aic values therefore it can be concluded that whether amf is subject to abrupt changes or significant change points is the decisive factor behind the selection of nonstationary and or stationary models 3 2 2 worm plot based analysis of residuals analysis of residuals is necessary to evaluate the performance of the selected models to quantitatively evaluate the model performance as shown in table 3 for analyzing amf at related stations analysis of residuals by gamlss was done as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 it can be observed from figs 4 and 5 that sample points of amf at each station follow the red solid curves fluctuating between two dashed curves implying that the selected models have performed statistically well in modelling amf changes at the hydrological stations at 95 confidence level fig 6 demonstrates qq plots for gamlss based linear regression analysis results it can be discerned from fig 5 that the residuals followed the theoretical value as shown by red solid line and the residual data points were along the diagonal line indicating that the real world residual data points were in good agreement with theoretical residual data points therefore the gamlss models developed for modelling of amf series at the 9 stations had statistically good modelling performance based on fitting results by gamlss models for amf series figs 4 6 the quantile regression results were obtained fig 7 and then the frequency values under each quantile curve were summarized table 4 quantile regression curves of amf at xixian huangchuan wangjiaba fuyang lutaizi stations showed that amf components at these stations were decreasing with different decreasing magnitudes besides an apparent decrease of amf was a found at huangchuan wangjiaba and fuyang stations implying lower risk of flood risk at these stations larger fluctuations of quantile regression curves were found at the jiangjiaji and hengpaitou stations the amf changes reflected by quantile regression curves were dominated by an increasing tendency however it should be noted here that trends of amf were sometimes global and sometimes local therefore trends of the annual maximum flow percentile regression analysis with the assumption of stationarity were not theoretically appropriate with respect to evaluation of trends from a long term viewpoint misleading evaluation results of trends could be obtained under the stationarity assumption fig 3 therefore gamlss model was developed by taking two and or three parameter distribution functions 3 3 nonstationary and stationary evaluation of flood frequency and flood risks nonstationary model was used to quantify flood frequency in the huai river basin fig 8 the results indicated different designed flood flow magnitudes during different time intervals for the am series at the same station for example the designed flood flow for the am series at the hengpaitou station is increasing over time while adverse results can be found for designed flood flow of different return periods at the jiangjiaji and bantai stations based on k s d the four probability distribution functions perform better in describing probability behaviors of hydrological extremes and can be accepted in this current study goodness of fit test was performed using kolmogorov smirnov s statistic d k s d in this paper 95 confidence level was accepted to set the significance level table 5 displayed that gamma and lognormal functions are subject to the highest goodness of fit performance the mean goodness of fit performance of these two functions at six stations shows that gamma performs better than lognormal fig 9 shows the variation curves of the cumulative frequency of the annual maximum peak flood by stationary flood frequency analysis model in the huai river basin the pearson iii distribution model was used in this analysis and which is an optimal model for empirical frequency curve fitting due to the fact that the empirical flood observations fit well the cs 2cv curve thus this curve is selected as the pearson type iii cumulative frequency curve comparison of the designed flood flow by pearson iii model against that by nonstationary frequency analysis model indicated decreased designed flood flow over time based on nonstationary model figs 8 and 9 while no discernable difference can be found between designed flood flow by pearson iii model and nonstationary model for flood events with return periods of 10 and 20 years while remarkable difference between designed flood flow by pearson iii model and nonstationary model for flood events with return periods of longer than 30 years such as 30 50 and even 100 years specifically increased designed flood flow for flood events with different return periods by nonstationary model indicated relatively lower flood control standard for now due to changing climate and shifting geographical features of the study region while this phenomenon seems to be worldwide i e changing climate drives higher frequency of flood events with similar return periods posing serious challenges for flood control ability of the flood controlling infrastructure alan et al 2003 allan and soden 2008 after 2010 designed flood flow for flood events with return periods of 10 and 20 years is subject to moderate changing magnitude while larger increasing magnitude of the designed flood flow can be detected for flood events with return periods of longer than 30 years in this sense the flood control standards in the huai river basin should be improved to satisfy the flood controlling requirements in a changing environment 3 4 evaluation of flood risk fig 10 shows changes in flood magnification factor and recurrence period with time steps of 5 years for all hydrological stations the flood magnification factor at the hengpaitou and bengbu stations was increasing temporally and was larger than 1 showing intensifying flood flows and increasingly higher flood risk besides it can be seen from fig 10g and i that after 30 years the flood magnification factor at hengpaitou and bengbu stations increased from 1 to 1 12 and from 1 to 1 05 respectively implying a higher flood risk at the hengpaitou station extreme precipitation analysis results zhang et al 2016 indicated intensifying extreme precipitation in the regions where the hengpaitou station is located flood magnification factors at other stations considered in this study were decreasing and flood magnification factors were smaller than 1 showing alleviating flood flows and lower flood risk temporally furthermore flood events with a return period of 50 years at the hengpaitou and bengbu stations decreased temporally in terms of return periods after 30 years the return period of flood with respect to 50 year return period decreased from 50 years to less 30 years at the hengpaitou station and from 50 years to nearly 31 years implying higher frequency of floods with return periods of 50 years thus hydraulic facilities in the lower parts of the middle huai river basin and also along the tributary where hengpaitou station is located should be enhanced to face intensifying flood flows frequent occurrences of flood and waterlogging have negative impacts on agricultural production and socio economic development the flood affected and flood damaged cropland area has comprehensively reflected the degree to which the natural disasters influence the grain output as shown in figs 11 and 12 correlations were calculated using spearman method between annual peak flood flow at 9 hydrological stations in the huai river basin and flood affected and flood damaged cropland area indicated least square linear regression analysis between annual peak flood flow in the huai river basin and flood disaster related cropland area in the anhui province at p 0 05 meanwhile more significant relations can also be identified between peak flood flow at the wangjiaba jiangjiaji lutaizi and bengbu stations and flood disaster related cropland area across the huai river basin and even over the anhui province at 99 confidence level in particular the correlation coefficient between annual peak flood flow at the bengbu station is the largest and this station is located midst the middle reaches of the huai river and the hongze lake controlling drainage area as large as 121 330 square kilometers the river reach in the proximity of the bengbu station is low lying and is easily impacted by flood and waterlogging from the perspective of regional differences the annual peak flood discharges in the huai river basin huai river basin have paramount impacts on the flood disaster related area affected by floods in anhui province this is mainly due to the fact that the extreme precipitation in the huai river basin are mainly concentrated in the flood storage area and surrounding low lying areas in the middle and upper huai river basin rendering the anhui province be the region with serious flood disasters the arable land area in the northern anhui province accounts for 56 2 of the total arable land area of the anhui province due to the weak ability of arable land to resist flood disaster the proportion of vulnerable farmland is very high xiang 2010 in general the huai river basin is not only the most densely populated area amongst major river basins in china but also an important food production base and energy base from 1983 to 2014 the grain planting area in the huai river basin increased from 16 4 104 km2 to 19 2 104 km2 rice crops such as rice and wheat are the most important disaster bearing bodies of flood disasters in addition the gdp and population of the huai river basin increased gradually since 2000 up to 2014 gdp has increased by 5584 6 billion yuan rmb chinese money and the population has also increased by 17 139 million this has changed the hydrological situation in the huai river basin to a certain extent so that the designed flood flow of the annual maximum peak discharge in the huai river basin has decreased over the time however it is worth noting that disorder reclaiming land for cropland and also crude deforestation during booming development of socio economy resulted in shifts of river channels and massive loss of water and soil and which lower flood resilience of the huai river basin 4 conclusions based on long term monthly streamflow data from 9 hydrological stations covering a period of 1960 2014 nonstationary analysis was performed to quantify flood frequency and flood risk the important conclusions were obtained as follows 1 abrupt changes were evaluated in terms of mean and variance parameters no significant change points were identified for amf series at the huangchuan hengpaitou and bengbu stations significant change points with respect to mean and or variance were detected at other 6 stations and the change points mainly concentrated during 2000 change points in terms of mean parameter occurred during 1992 2009 and 2000 abrupt behavior of amf in the upper and middle huai river basin can be attributed to the shifting extreme precipitation and warming climate based on analyses of change points trends before and after change points were quantified and nonstationarity features of amf at hydrological stations considered in this study were evaluated using gamlss model weibull distribution function is the appropriate choice in modelling amf and the lognormal distribution function is the second appropriate choice stationary models are determined for the amf series at the rest of the hydrological stations 2 gamlss can model amf changes well and quantile regression method can describe statistical properties in time well for nonstationary amf series quantile regression curves differentiate from the real world observed amf distribution however for stationary amf series quantile regression curve can model amf changes well this study evaluated impacts of the stationarity assumption on the quantification of flood magnitude of flood regimes at different return periods the stationarity assumption has limited implications for the evaluation of flood magnitude of return periods of 20 years however substantial difference can be observed in evaluated flood magnitudes with return periods of 30 years under stationarity and or nonstationarity assumption and the difference increases for flood magnitudes with longer return periods such as return period of 100 years therefore evaluation of stationarity and nonstationarity assumption is critical for the quantification of flood magnitude of a certain return period 3 two out of nine stations are characterized by intensifying flood flows i e hengpaitou and bengbu stations after 30 years the flood magnification factor at hengpaitou and bengbu stations increases from 1 to 1 12 and from 1 to 1 06 respectively implying a higher flood risk at the hengpaitou station however lower flood risks can be observed at other seven stations except hengpaitou and bengbu stations relations between amf and flood affected crop areas in the huai river basin and anhui province indicated significant relations showing critical implications of amf changes for mitigation of flood hazards and for understanding the impacts of flood hazards on agricultural development at regional and basin scales acknowledgment

6896,using monthly streamflow data from 9 gauging stations covering a period of 1960 2014 across the huai river basin china the pettitt method and gamlss model were used to quantify flood frequency and related implications for flood hazards results indicated that 1 no significant change points were observed in flood flows at the huangchuan hengpaitou and bengbu stations however significant hydrological alterations were detected for flood flows at other 6 stations with change points during 2000 2 flood flows at the bantai jiangjiaji and hengpaitou stations were nonstationary but stationary flood flows were detected at other 6 stations the weibull distribution was the appropriate probability distribution describing flood flows across the huai river basin and the lognormal distribution is the second best distribution 3 no significant difference was detected for 10 and 20 year flood frequencies using the pearson iii type distribution function under the stationarity assumption however significant and increasing differences were expected for 30 50 and 100 year floods it can be concluded that the assumption of stationarity if the flood flows are actually nonstationary can produce biased flood frequencies using pearson iii type distribution and this result provides a critical reference for flood frequency analysis under the nonstationarity and or stationarity assumption 4 after 30 years the flood magnification factor at hengpaitou and bengbu stations increased from 1 to 1 12 and from 1 to 1 06 respectively implying higher flood risks at the hengpaitou station in addition after 30 years the return period of 100 year flood decreased from 100 years to less 70 years at the hengpaitou station and from 100 years to nearly 78 years implying higher frequency of floods with return periods of 100 years moreover significant relations were detected between annual peak flood flow and flood affected crop areas implying that annual peak flood flow can be taken as an indicator of flood disasters across the huai river basin and even in the anhui province keywords nonstationarity annual peak flood flow gamlss flood magnification factor return period 1 introduction warming climate due to human induced emission of greenhouse gases e g min et al 2011 and relevant impacts on ecological systems daufresne et al 2009 and on hydrological cycle in particular have aroused a widespread international interest mirza 2002 alan et al 2003 allan and soden 2008 hirabayashi et al 2013 apurv et al 2015 li et al 2015 flood management policies and designs are generally based on an estimate of flood frequency with a certain return period such as 30 years 50 years or even 100 years gilroy and mccuen 2012 the assumption of stationarity of annual peak flood series is of significant interest for managing flood hazards water resources management and design of hydraulic facilities such as water reservoirs thus the stationarity of flood records pertains to the physical processes associated with flood production sample properties of flood records statistical procedures that are used to infer distributional properties of floods and temporal changes in the flood peak distribution villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 however it was advocated that stationarity is dead and cannot be revived milly et al 2008 milly et al 2008 ascribed the demise of stationarity to anthropogenic changes of earth s climate changes in land use land cover and regulation of rivers by dams and reservoirs climate is changing and warming climate in particular boosts the atmosphere s water holding capacity by about 7 per 1 c and hence more intense precipitation regimes e g berg et al 2013 kunkel et al 2013 therefore warming climate has the potential to increase flood and drought risks jongman et al 2014 besides human activities also have increasingly interfered in the streamflow processes as well as extreme hydrological processes zhang et al 2015a zhang et al 2015a indicated that human interferences in hydrological processes via damming and construction of reservoirs greatly alter the streamflow vs precipitation relation therefore the nonstationarity assumption has been widely accepted in the quantification of flood frequency and flood risk gilroy and mccuen 2012 tan and gan 2015 zhang et al 2015b china has the largest population in the world and hence agricultural development means much for china due to substantial food requirement since 2009 frequent extreme droughts and floods have occurred in most parts of china and consequently huge losses of crop yields e g wang et al 2014 wu et al 2015 furthermore population in eastern china accounts for more than 70 of the total population of the country e g zhu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 the study region considered in this study the huai river basin is located exactly in the eastern part of china fig 1 in this study and fig 1 in zhang et al 2017 the huai river basin is also densely populated with great potential in socio economy the basin provides 20 of the total agricultural products with 10 of the total crop land of china feeding 20 4 of the total countryside population hence agricultural development in the huai river basin is critical for food security of china however the basin is located in the transitional zone between semi arid and semi humid climates with frequent occurrences of droughts and floods from the beginning of the 21st century the annual average drought affected crop area has reached 2 698 106 hm2 and the drought destroyed crop land area has reached 1 408 106 hm2 accounting for 21 and 11 of the total cropland of the basin further booming development of social economy combined with increasing water demand is causing the basin to be more vulnerable to droughts and floods therefore basin scale management of water resources and agricultural irrigation calls for the evaluation of flood frequency and flood risk and this point constitutes the research objective of this study however no reports are available so far addressing nonstationary evaluation of flood frequency and flood risk in the huai river basin therefore this study can help bridge the knowledge gap in terms of flood frequency and flood risk with the assumption of nonstationarity which formulates the motivation of this study therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to understand the role of change points in nonstationary flood processes 2 to know about the temporal behavior of annual peak flood flow and to 3 to understand changes of annual peak flood flow with different return periods and variation of return periods under the nonstationarity assumption in addition the relation between annual peak flood flow and flood affected flood damaged crop areas in the huai river basin and also anhui province was developed this study although it is a kind of regional study provides a protocol in terms of nonstationary flood behavior in regions of climatic demarcation between semi arid and semi humid climates besides results of this study will be important for the understanding of flood behavior in a changing environment at regional and basin scales 2 data and methods 2 1 data annual maximum flow data from 9 hydrological stations were collected for analysis in this study locations of these 9 stations can be found in fig 1 the data from the huangchuan and hengpaitou stations covered a time period of 1964 2016 and the data from other stations covered a period of 1956 2016 the hydrological data were obtained from water commission of huai river basin china at http www hrc gov cn smodel model hrc data of agricultural losses of wheat and rice were collected from encyclopedia of meteorological disasters in china edited by wen 2005 in 2005 this encyclopedia includes 32 volumes for 32 provinces of china besides data of hazards and hazard induced losses were collected from collections of agricultural statistics of the 30 years of reform and opening in china nbsc 2009 and china agriculture yearbook liang and shen 2000 sun et al 2017 2 2 detection of change points pettitt method is a kind of nonparametric method based on mann whitney pettitt 1979 for detection of change points in terms of mean and variance it is assumed that two samples i e x 1 x 2 x t and x t 1 x n are from the same population beaulieu et al 2012 1 u t n u t 1 n j 1 n sgn x t x j where x t and x j are the tth and jth data of the hydrological series respectively t 1 2 n at the significance level of 0 05 the change point at t can be confirmed given p 0 05 eq 1 aims to detect change points in terms of mean value detection of change points can be done as 1 x 1 x 2 x n denote the real world observed flood series 2 l denotes the loss function and 3 y denotes the series of the square sum of residuals 4 t denotes the time 5 f t denotes the goodness of fit model for the real world observed flood series i e y i i 1 n x i l i 2 2 l x i f t i x i 2 eq 2 is for the detection of change point in terms of variance 2 3 modified mann kendall in this study the nonparametric mann kendall trend m k test method was used in detection of trends mann 1945 kendall 1975 alan et al 2003 however many researchers found that the serial correlation of the time series can affect results by the m k method and the serial effects should be screened out before trend analysis von storch and navarra 1995 thereafter hamed and rao 1998 developed a modified m k mmk test based on the effective or equivalent sample size ess to remove the effects of autocorrelation on m k results in the modified m k method the modified variance of the mk statistic was used to replace the original one if the lag i autocorrelation coefficients were significantly different from zero at the 5 significance level hamed and rao 1998 mmk was also used in this study to quantify trends of hydrological series the significance level for mmk was set at 5 detailed algorithm of mmk can be found in daufresne et al 2009 2 4 gamlss model the gamlss generalized additive models for location scale and shape model was proposed by vogel et al 2011 to evaluate stationarity and nonstationarity of a time series in the gamlss model a time series of y 1 y 2 y n is assumed to be independent and follows the distribution function of f y y i θ i and θ i θ 1 θ 2 θ p denotes the vector with p parameters such as location scale and shape here g k is defined as a monotonic functional relation between the explanatory variable θ k and the random component x k as 3 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k z jk γ jk where η k and θ k are vectors with sample size of n β k t β 1 k β 2 k β j k k is the parameter vector with sample size of j k x k is the matrix of the explanatory variable with length of n j k z jk is the fixed design matrix of n q jk γ jk is the variable following the standard normal distribution without considering the impact of random effects on the distribution parameters let j k 0 and eq 3 is deduced as 4 g k θ k η k x k β k when t is the explanatory variable the explanatory variable matrix can be 5 x k 1 t t i k 1 1 t t i k 1 1 t t i k 1 1 t t i k 1 n i k putting eq 4 into eq 5 one can obtain the functional relations between distribution parameters and explanatory variable of t as 6 g 1 θ 1 t β 11 β 21 t β i 1 1 t i 1 1 g 2 θ 2 t β 12 β 21 t β i 2 2 t i 2 1 in this study the stationarity of mean and variance corresponding to the location and scale parameters respectively was evaluated taking t as the only explanatory variable a linear function was developed to link mean θ 1 and variance θ 2 and eq 6 can be deduced as 7 g 1 θ 1 i t i β 1 8 g 2 θ 2 i t i β 2 the recent studies reported that applying only the linear trend to model non stationarity may increase the bias of the non stationary model agilan and umamahesh 2017 moreover the choice of covariate has a significant influence on calculating non stationary return levels agilan and umamahesh 2018 based on the method of self starting nonlinear logistic https www r project org taking t as the only explanatory variable a non linear function was developed to link mean θ 1 and variance θ 2 and eq 6 can be deduced as lambert and lindsey 1999 rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 9 g 1 θ 1 i α 1 e xmid scale t where α xmid scale are three parameters of logistic in this study functional relations were built between the distribution matrix of time series and time t using the gamlss model trends and abrupt changes of the hydrological series were combined into the gamlss model for further analysis four two parameter distribution functions were selected in this study i e gumbel gu gamma ga lognormal logno and weibull wei four types of models were developed 1 stationary model θ 1 and θ 2 are constants 2 θ 1 is nonstationary and is the linear function of time t 3 θ 2 is nonstationary and is the linear function of time t 4 θ 1 θ 2 are nonstationary and are the linear function of time t the akaike information criterion aic was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the distribution models and functions worm plot was used for visualizing the fitting performance of candidate models 2 5 flood magnification factor the flood magnification factor is defined so that the current design flood quantile are multiplied by the flood magnification factor to obtain the flood magnitude in some future year employing the nonstationary flood frequency model to derive the flood magnification factor was defined by vogel et al 2011 as x p t exp y β t t n 1 t n 2 t 1 2 2 n z p s y 10 m x p t δ t x p t exp β δ t if the flood magnification factor is larger than 1 then it points to floods with larger magnitudes in the future and hence the designed flood mitigation infrastructure may satisfy the flood mitigation objective and vice versa in eq 10 m is the flood magnification factor and δt is the time interval t is some current time period of interest s y is an estimate of the standard deviation of natural logarithms of the annual maximum floods and z p is he inverse of a standard normal random variable with exceedance probability p 2 6 return reduction return reduction is defined as the average time between floods in some future year t f associated with the flood with an average recurrence interval of t o in some reference year t o vogel et al 2011 if the average recurrence intervals related with a flood today and in some future year are t o and tf respectively then their respective exceedance probabilities are given by p o 1 t o and p f 1 t f respectively the tf can be computed as 11 t f 1 1 φ z p o β s y φ is the cumulative probability distribution function of a standardized normal variable and represents the probability that a standardized normal variable is less than the value inside the parentheses vogel et al 2011 before flood frequency analysis using the nonstationary model the annual peak streamflow series should be tested for normality and the normality test was done for the residuals from the exponential trend model in this study kolmogorov smirnov s statistic d k s d method was used to test the normality the empirical or experimental frequency was computed using the blom equation recommended by heo et al 2008 i e 12 p i i 0 375 n 0 25 where p i is the experimental frequency i is the order and n is the sample size of data under consideration 2 7 pearson iii p iii distribution famous statistician carl pearson developed a whole system consisting of seven types of distributions the pearson iii distribution is sometimes called as the three parameter gamma distribution since it can be obtained from the two parameter gamma distribution by introducing so called location parameter c landwehr et al 1978 13 f x 1 β γ α x c β α 1 e x c β parameter c is also the lower bound for this distribution x 3 c the pearson iii distribution is very flexible since it has three parameters which can produce a wide variety of shapes of density function parameter a is governing the skewness of the distribution and when it tends to infinity the pearson iii distribution becomes normal distribution the pearson type iii distribution is frequently used for annual maximum floods 2 8 nonstationary return levels with assumption of nonstationarity the gev parameters are varying in a temporal sense and the return level can be computed in each year which is known as the effective return level cheng et al 2014 renards et al 2013 in the case of nonstationary gev parameters a stationary return level can be computed based on quantiles of the nonstationary parameters p 1 1 t 15 r p μ σ ξ log p ξ 1 16 μ t q k μ 1 μ 2 μ t 17 σ t q k σ 1 σ 2 σ t 18 ξ t q k ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ t where qk indicates the kth quantile of the arguments which can be chosen based on the application for example choosing k 0 5 would represent the median behavior of each nonstationary gev parameter 3 results and discussions 3 1 change points and trends of annual maximum flow amf fig 2 a and b illustrate the spatial distribution of stations with different change points with respect to the mean and variance values it can be seen from fig 2a that annual maximum flow amf series at only three stations were subject to significant change points during 2009 1992 and 2000 respectively in addition these three stations are located on northern side to the mainstream of the upper and middle huai river basin however significant change points for variance during 1969 2000 and 2001 were detected at 6 out of 9 stations specifically the amf series of 5 out of 6 stations were characterized by significant change points during 2000 and 2001 implying similar hydrometeorological mechanisms behind change points and hence similar timing of change points fig 2b recent 60 years have witnessed significant warming processes in the upper and middle huang river basin and it is particularly the case after the 1990s in addition precipitate fluctuations which bring about frequent occurrences of floods and droughts and other related weather and hydrological extremes xiao et al 2017 in general decreased precipitation can be observed before the 1990s and increased precipitation after 2000 and increased extreme precipitation in particular zhang et al 2016 significant intensification of precipitation processes was observed during the 1990s 2000s and more frequent floods and droughts were also observed after the 1990s zhang et al 2017 it should be interpreted that 1991 witnessed widespread floods across the entire huai river basin and then serious and drought occurred during 1992 which was the major cause behind the abrupt change of mean flood flow during 1992 along the mainstream of the upper and middle huai river basin fig 2a it should be emphasized here that no large scale hydraulic facilities were built in the upper and middle huai river basin after the 1990s and hence the abrupt behavior of flood flow with respect to mean and variance should be attributed to precipitation changes for trends of amf no significant trends were detected for amf at huangchuan hengpaitou and bengbu stations but significant amf trends were found at other stations fig 3 table 1 table 1 shows more details pertaining to trends of the entire amf series and trends of subseries before and after change points it can be seen from fig 3 and table 1 that amf was decreasing at six stations xixian jiangjiaji lutaizi with different changing magnitudes of trends before and after the change points while negative trends before the change point but positive trends after change point of amf at wangjiaba station were detected generally more significant decreased amf was detected before change points in fuyang station however amf was decreasing at bantai station with different changing magnitudes of trends before and after the change points therefore without consideration of change points trends of amf can be misleading 3 2 the temporal behavior of the annual peak flood flow 3 2 1 goodness of fit evaluation of gamlss model amf series were nonstationary based on the above results due to change points and trends hence gamlss model was used to model amf changes based on two parameter probability distribution functions it can be seen from table 2 that weibull distribution function can be used to simulate amf changes at the huangchuan and bengbu stations while the lognormal distribution function was the right one for describing the statistical properties of amf at the hengpaitou station with respect to nonstationarity the selected models for amf at the huangchuan and bengbu stations were stationary but θ 1 and θ 2 parameters for amf at the hengpaitou station were nonstationary actually the aic values exhibited slight differences for these five models table 3 nonlinear nonstationarity is not necessarily considered in describing the gamlss model behaviors of the amf for those stations with change points within amf series table 2 weibull distribution function was the right choice and was used for modelling amf at the xixian bantai and wangjiaba stations the gamma distribution function was the right choice for modelling amf at the jiangjiaji and bantai stations nonstationary models in θ 1 and θ 2 parameters were used for modelling amf at the bantai and jiangjiaji stations in summary the optimal distribution functions were weibull function and then the lognormal distribution function for modelling amf at 5 out of 9 stations nonstationary models can be developed for amf analysis at two stations i e bantai jiangjiaji and hengpaitou stations amf series at other 6 hydrological stations considered in this study can be modelled by stationary models for modelling of amf series with no significant change points nonstationary and stationary models have similar aic values however for modelling amf series with significant change points nonstationary and stationary models had distinctly different aic values therefore it can be concluded that whether amf is subject to abrupt changes or significant change points is the decisive factor behind the selection of nonstationary and or stationary models 3 2 2 worm plot based analysis of residuals analysis of residuals is necessary to evaluate the performance of the selected models to quantitatively evaluate the model performance as shown in table 3 for analyzing amf at related stations analysis of residuals by gamlss was done as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 it can be observed from figs 4 and 5 that sample points of amf at each station follow the red solid curves fluctuating between two dashed curves implying that the selected models have performed statistically well in modelling amf changes at the hydrological stations at 95 confidence level fig 6 demonstrates qq plots for gamlss based linear regression analysis results it can be discerned from fig 5 that the residuals followed the theoretical value as shown by red solid line and the residual data points were along the diagonal line indicating that the real world residual data points were in good agreement with theoretical residual data points therefore the gamlss models developed for modelling of amf series at the 9 stations had statistically good modelling performance based on fitting results by gamlss models for amf series figs 4 6 the quantile regression results were obtained fig 7 and then the frequency values under each quantile curve were summarized table 4 quantile regression curves of amf at xixian huangchuan wangjiaba fuyang lutaizi stations showed that amf components at these stations were decreasing with different decreasing magnitudes besides an apparent decrease of amf was a found at huangchuan wangjiaba and fuyang stations implying lower risk of flood risk at these stations larger fluctuations of quantile regression curves were found at the jiangjiaji and hengpaitou stations the amf changes reflected by quantile regression curves were dominated by an increasing tendency however it should be noted here that trends of amf were sometimes global and sometimes local therefore trends of the annual maximum flow percentile regression analysis with the assumption of stationarity were not theoretically appropriate with respect to evaluation of trends from a long term viewpoint misleading evaluation results of trends could be obtained under the stationarity assumption fig 3 therefore gamlss model was developed by taking two and or three parameter distribution functions 3 3 nonstationary and stationary evaluation of flood frequency and flood risks nonstationary model was used to quantify flood frequency in the huai river basin fig 8 the results indicated different designed flood flow magnitudes during different time intervals for the am series at the same station for example the designed flood flow for the am series at the hengpaitou station is increasing over time while adverse results can be found for designed flood flow of different return periods at the jiangjiaji and bantai stations based on k s d the four probability distribution functions perform better in describing probability behaviors of hydrological extremes and can be accepted in this current study goodness of fit test was performed using kolmogorov smirnov s statistic d k s d in this paper 95 confidence level was accepted to set the significance level table 5 displayed that gamma and lognormal functions are subject to the highest goodness of fit performance the mean goodness of fit performance of these two functions at six stations shows that gamma performs better than lognormal fig 9 shows the variation curves of the cumulative frequency of the annual maximum peak flood by stationary flood frequency analysis model in the huai river basin the pearson iii distribution model was used in this analysis and which is an optimal model for empirical frequency curve fitting due to the fact that the empirical flood observations fit well the cs 2cv curve thus this curve is selected as the pearson type iii cumulative frequency curve comparison of the designed flood flow by pearson iii model against that by nonstationary frequency analysis model indicated decreased designed flood flow over time based on nonstationary model figs 8 and 9 while no discernable difference can be found between designed flood flow by pearson iii model and nonstationary model for flood events with return periods of 10 and 20 years while remarkable difference between designed flood flow by pearson iii model and nonstationary model for flood events with return periods of longer than 30 years such as 30 50 and even 100 years specifically increased designed flood flow for flood events with different return periods by nonstationary model indicated relatively lower flood control standard for now due to changing climate and shifting geographical features of the study region while this phenomenon seems to be worldwide i e changing climate drives higher frequency of flood events with similar return periods posing serious challenges for flood control ability of the flood controlling infrastructure alan et al 2003 allan and soden 2008 after 2010 designed flood flow for flood events with return periods of 10 and 20 years is subject to moderate changing magnitude while larger increasing magnitude of the designed flood flow can be detected for flood events with return periods of longer than 30 years in this sense the flood control standards in the huai river basin should be improved to satisfy the flood controlling requirements in a changing environment 3 4 evaluation of flood risk fig 10 shows changes in flood magnification factor and recurrence period with time steps of 5 years for all hydrological stations the flood magnification factor at the hengpaitou and bengbu stations was increasing temporally and was larger than 1 showing intensifying flood flows and increasingly higher flood risk besides it can be seen from fig 10g and i that after 30 years the flood magnification factor at hengpaitou and bengbu stations increased from 1 to 1 12 and from 1 to 1 05 respectively implying a higher flood risk at the hengpaitou station extreme precipitation analysis results zhang et al 2016 indicated intensifying extreme precipitation in the regions where the hengpaitou station is located flood magnification factors at other stations considered in this study were decreasing and flood magnification factors were smaller than 1 showing alleviating flood flows and lower flood risk temporally furthermore flood events with a return period of 50 years at the hengpaitou and bengbu stations decreased temporally in terms of return periods after 30 years the return period of flood with respect to 50 year return period decreased from 50 years to less 30 years at the hengpaitou station and from 50 years to nearly 31 years implying higher frequency of floods with return periods of 50 years thus hydraulic facilities in the lower parts of the middle huai river basin and also along the tributary where hengpaitou station is located should be enhanced to face intensifying flood flows frequent occurrences of flood and waterlogging have negative impacts on agricultural production and socio economic development the flood affected and flood damaged cropland area has comprehensively reflected the degree to which the natural disasters influence the grain output as shown in figs 11 and 12 correlations were calculated using spearman method between annual peak flood flow at 9 hydrological stations in the huai river basin and flood affected and flood damaged cropland area indicated least square linear regression analysis between annual peak flood flow in the huai river basin and flood disaster related cropland area in the anhui province at p 0 05 meanwhile more significant relations can also be identified between peak flood flow at the wangjiaba jiangjiaji lutaizi and bengbu stations and flood disaster related cropland area across the huai river basin and even over the anhui province at 99 confidence level in particular the correlation coefficient between annual peak flood flow at the bengbu station is the largest and this station is located midst the middle reaches of the huai river and the hongze lake controlling drainage area as large as 121 330 square kilometers the river reach in the proximity of the bengbu station is low lying and is easily impacted by flood and waterlogging from the perspective of regional differences the annual peak flood discharges in the huai river basin huai river basin have paramount impacts on the flood disaster related area affected by floods in anhui province this is mainly due to the fact that the extreme precipitation in the huai river basin are mainly concentrated in the flood storage area and surrounding low lying areas in the middle and upper huai river basin rendering the anhui province be the region with serious flood disasters the arable land area in the northern anhui province accounts for 56 2 of the total arable land area of the anhui province due to the weak ability of arable land to resist flood disaster the proportion of vulnerable farmland is very high xiang 2010 in general the huai river basin is not only the most densely populated area amongst major river basins in china but also an important food production base and energy base from 1983 to 2014 the grain planting area in the huai river basin increased from 16 4 104 km2 to 19 2 104 km2 rice crops such as rice and wheat are the most important disaster bearing bodies of flood disasters in addition the gdp and population of the huai river basin increased gradually since 2000 up to 2014 gdp has increased by 5584 6 billion yuan rmb chinese money and the population has also increased by 17 139 million this has changed the hydrological situation in the huai river basin to a certain extent so that the designed flood flow of the annual maximum peak discharge in the huai river basin has decreased over the time however it is worth noting that disorder reclaiming land for cropland and also crude deforestation during booming development of socio economy resulted in shifts of river channels and massive loss of water and soil and which lower flood resilience of the huai river basin 4 conclusions based on long term monthly streamflow data from 9 hydrological stations covering a period of 1960 2014 nonstationary analysis was performed to quantify flood frequency and flood risk the important conclusions were obtained as follows 1 abrupt changes were evaluated in terms of mean and variance parameters no significant change points were identified for amf series at the huangchuan hengpaitou and bengbu stations significant change points with respect to mean and or variance were detected at other 6 stations and the change points mainly concentrated during 2000 change points in terms of mean parameter occurred during 1992 2009 and 2000 abrupt behavior of amf in the upper and middle huai river basin can be attributed to the shifting extreme precipitation and warming climate based on analyses of change points trends before and after change points were quantified and nonstationarity features of amf at hydrological stations considered in this study were evaluated using gamlss model weibull distribution function is the appropriate choice in modelling amf and the lognormal distribution function is the second appropriate choice stationary models are determined for the amf series at the rest of the hydrological stations 2 gamlss can model amf changes well and quantile regression method can describe statistical properties in time well for nonstationary amf series quantile regression curves differentiate from the real world observed amf distribution however for stationary amf series quantile regression curve can model amf changes well this study evaluated impacts of the stationarity assumption on the quantification of flood magnitude of flood regimes at different return periods the stationarity assumption has limited implications for the evaluation of flood magnitude of return periods of 20 years however substantial difference can be observed in evaluated flood magnitudes with return periods of 30 years under stationarity and or nonstationarity assumption and the difference increases for flood magnitudes with longer return periods such as return period of 100 years therefore evaluation of stationarity and nonstationarity assumption is critical for the quantification of flood magnitude of a certain return period 3 two out of nine stations are characterized by intensifying flood flows i e hengpaitou and bengbu stations after 30 years the flood magnification factor at hengpaitou and bengbu stations increases from 1 to 1 12 and from 1 to 1 06 respectively implying a higher flood risk at the hengpaitou station however lower flood risks can be observed at other seven stations except hengpaitou and bengbu stations relations between amf and flood affected crop areas in the huai river basin and anhui province indicated significant relations showing critical implications of amf changes for mitigation of flood hazards and for understanding the impacts of flood hazards on agricultural development at regional and basin scales acknowledgment

6897,bare soils and grasslands in arid and semi arid conditions constitute a large portion of the earth surface evaporation which is the main component of the water balance in these conditions often takes place through a dry soil layer dsl there is no scientific agreement yet on the dsl effects on evaporation rates the implementations of three conceptual models of dsl evaporation were tested for the simulation of evaporation rates in a semi arid study area in central spain i the daily average model based on the assumption that the daily average vapour transport in a dsl can be represented in analogy to isothermal liquid flow ii the numerical model solving the richards equation in this case hydrus1d was used and iii the pore scale model based on soil column experiments in laboratory conditions the evaporation rates estimated by the three conceptual models for semi arid field conditions were compared with the evaporation rates measured by an eddy covariance tower in the same area the results indicate that the daily average conceptual model assumption in which the dsl has no effects on evaporation does not hold in very dry conditions the numerical model solving the richards equation was not able to simulate the effects of the dsl on evaporation rates the evaporation estimates obtained by the pore scale conceptual model were closest to the eddy covariance measurements during the dry season however this model was applicable only to the relatively steady evaporation conditions during afternoons and only assuming spatially constant dsl thickness keywords dry soil layer soil evaporation semi arid arid water vapour flow 1 introduction evaporation from bare soils and grasslands is the most important component of the hydrological balance in semi arid and arid areas lawrence et al 2006 wang 2015 such areas cover a significant part of the earth surface and can be found in all continents peel et al 2007 they are particularly vulnerable to desertification processes following changes in their hydrological balances badreldin et al 2017 the grass in these areas typically transpires only during short rainy seasons while in rest of the time tend to become dormant senesce or die converting to bare soil therefore evaporation from the bare soil becomes the main water flux in the water budget in semi arid and arid areas brutsaert 2014 in this study the soil is defined as the porous unconsolidated material covering an underlying bedrock regardless of its water content the soil evaporation process is strongly dependent on the hydraulic connection between the soil surface and the saturated zone good et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 gardner and fireman 1958 studied the steady state evaporation from a water table in soil columns laboratory experiments calculating the upward liquid flow with the buckingham darcy law they found that the bare soil evaporation shows an exponential decay with increasing water table depth shah et al 2007 simulated the steady state evaporation from a bare soil as dependent on water table depth using a variable saturation one dimensional flow model hydrus1d based on the numerical solution of the richards equation simunek et al 2005 this type of model requires a continuous liquid connection between the saturated zone and the soil surface which is a valid assumption for a shallow water table with mild evaporative conditions lehmann et al 2008a 2008b but questionable for arid and semi arid conditions and or a deep water table at a certain water table depth wtd the gravity forces become stronger than the capillary forces and liquid continuity is disrupted shokri and salvucci 2011 when the liquid continuity through a soil profile is lost a dry soil layer dsl is formed in the topsoil first few decimetres of soil below the surface where water transport is mainly in the gas phase as water vapour or et al 2013 this is often the case in semi arid and arid areas wang 2015 the bare soil evaporation process have been divided into two lehmann et al 2008a 2008b three idso et al 1979 or four stages zhang et al 2015 here we describe the two stages conceptualization during the first stage of evaporation s1 there is liquid continuity between the saturated zone and the soil surface the evaporation of water takes place at the vaporization plane fig 1 which at the beginning of an evaporation cycle is at the soil surface as the evaporation progresses the liquid water moves upward due to capillary flow driven by the water pressure gradient while the depth of the drying front which marks the transition between saturated and unsaturated zone increases here the unsaturated zone is defined as the part of the soil not saturated by gas or liquid where the water moves mainly by liquid flow the soil surface gradually dries as the drying front and the water table move down at a certain wtd dependent on soil hydraulic properties the capillary forces becomes too small to ensure liquid continuity between water table and soil surface and a layer of soil not hydraulically connected to the water table develops lehmann et al 2008a 2008b this is the beginning of the second stage of evaporation s2 fig 1a when water evaporates from a vaporization plane below the soil surface and then moves through the dsl according to shokri and salvucci 2011 mainly by vapour diffusion in an unsaturated soil profile the process of dsl formation is similar in this case the depletion of the water stored close to the soil surface results in a very dry upper soil fig 1b some authors e g hillel 1998 prefer to divide the evaporation into three stages depending on evaporation rates which are equal to potential values during stage i dependent on the hydraulic properties of the soil material during stage ii and dependent on vapour diffusion during stage iii the evaporation rates from bare soils drop significantly when a dsl develops i e between s1 and s2 or et al 2013 with s2 evaporation rates so small that they are usually neglected in field studies balugani et al 2017 the transition between s1 and s2 evaporation depends on soil material properties and also on soil temperature which has recently been found by neriah et al 2014 laboratory experiments show that s2 evaporation rates are independent from s1 rates and do not vary much over a wide range of soil materials and boundary conditions or et al 2013 this means that s2 evaporation rates are mostly similar in different evaporative conditions the small s2 evaporation rates 1 mm d 1 are often neglected in field studies when either the soil surface is dry or the water table is considered to be deep enough shah et al 2007 for example miller et al 2010 neglected groundwater evaporation in an area with wtd between 7 and 12 m b g s below ground surface while paço et al 2009 neglected soil evaporation when pasture was dry with a wtd between 4 and 6 m b g s however the bare soil evaporation can be an important component in a hydrological balance in both dry deserted lands wang 2015 and during dry seasons in mediterranean climates as confirmed by balugani et al 2017 in a study area characterized by an open woodland ecosystem and wtd between 1 and 10 m b g s moreover evaporation in arid conditions was documented even at wtd 100 m b g s by li et al 2014 scanlon 2000 walvoord et al 2002a and walvoord et al 2002b the presence of a dsl has been attested both in laboratory and field studies but its effects on bare soil evaporation are controversial the dsl observed in laboratory conditions consists of an air dry layer between the soil surface and the vaporization plane fig 1a and b water in the dsl is present only in vapour form the soil is completely saturated by the gaseous phase that has therefore higher mobility than in the remaining part of unsaturated zone the thickness of the observed dsl zdsl goes from few mm deol et al 2014 to more than 50 cm sun et al 2016 in the laboratory experiments typically under steady state conditions water transport from the vaporization plane to the soil surface can be explained by vapour diffusion alone and the formation of a dsl results in a strong decrease of evaporation rates or et al 2013 in field studies however the dsl is more dynamic due to daily changes in evaporative condition i zdsl can change due to redistribution of soil moisture when the driving solar radiation is absent during night idso et al 1979 water vapour can condense in the dsl due to temperature profile changes and evaporate from it in the morning assouline et al 2013 deol et al 2014 ii air turbulence in the atmosphere can enhance the vapour transport in the first 2 4 cm of the dsl ishihara et al 1992 these processes can greatly increase the transport of water vapour through the dsl which can be as high as the upward flow of liquid water from the deeper soil to the vaporization plane brutsaert 2014 the three main approaches to modelling the evaporation from a soil with a dsl are to i assume that the dsl has no real effect on the daily cumulative soil evaporation ii assume that the dsl can be modelled as if the liquid water continuity through the profile is maintained iii use the dsl model developed from laboratory experiments observations we call these three conceptual models respectively i the daily average da conceptual model ii the numerical solution to the richards equation nsre conceptual model and iii the pore scale ps conceptual model table 1 shows a collection of studies about soil evaporation in the presence of a dsl the conceptual models used and the type of experiment field laboratory and numeric for more studies of dsl soil evaporation see wang 2015 the da conceptual model is based on the assumption that the limiting factor for the daily averaged soil evaporation during s2 is the upward isothermal flow of liquid water to the vaporization plane in other words the complex vapour transport processes in the dsl can be simplified when integrated through a daily cycle resulting in a negligible effect of the dsl on the daily soil evaporation rates therefore the soil evaporation can be calculated as isothermal liquid water flow to the soil surface with an exponential evaporation decay behaviour brutsaert 2014 however the exponential behaviour seems dependent on climatic conditions as well as on soil material mccoll et al 2017 the nsre conceptual model is based on the assumption that the numerical solution to richards equation can properly model evaporation from a soil even in the presence of a dsl however the nsre conceptual model cannot properly model an air dry dsl because it does not permit discontinuity in the liquid phase dijkema et al 2017 instead a pseudo dsl can be modelled defined as a soil layer where soil moisture is almost at residual state and water vapour flow is larger than liquid water flow the idea is that the pseudo dsl can properly model the soil evaporation rates albeit not the soil moisture profile assouline et al 2013 however recent publications have shown that this approach leads to wrong evaporation rates estimates especially in arid and semi arid conditions fetzer et al 2017 dijkema et al 2017 probably due to the imperfect modelling of the evaporation process in the dsl the ps conceptual model is based on the laboratory observations reviewed in or et al 2013 this conceptual model first predicts the depth of the drying front at the end of the s1 evaporation as dependent on soil material properties then calculates water vapour flow using fick s equation an analytical solution for bare soil evaporation under steady state conditions with a dsl layer in which water can move only by vapour diffusion has been elaborated by sadeghi et al 2012 a limitation of this approach is that it assumes hydrostatic equilibrium above the drying front and stable evaporative conditions neither of these conditions are met in the field moreover several field studies reported water vapour flow larger than estimated by vapour diffusion alone and the cause is still debated webb and ho 1998 zeng et al 2011b assouline et al 2013 the main objectives of this study are to test in a semi arid area with a reported 0 25 m thick dsl the assumption of the da conceptual model that the dsl has a negligible effect on soil evaporation the assumption of the nsre conceptual model that it is possible to predict the soil evaporation rates by modelling a pseudo dsl the ability of the ps conceptual model to explain the observed evaporation rates in the area these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussion sections 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the selected study site is a 2 2 km area with the central point latitude 41 1172 and longitude 6 1471 located within the 80 km2 sardón catchment in salamanca province spain fig 2 the study area is characterized by semi arid climate very sparse vegetation cover and a shallow groundwater the morphology is typical of spanish meseta landscape with gentle hills mean slope of 2 6 with sardón river valley crossing the area in the centre from south to north and ground surface elevation gently rising from the river valley to west and east the average elevation of the area is 790 m a s l the elevation difference between the river and the highest point in the east is 30 m the area experiences large differences in meteorological conditions between winter and summer winters are cold 5 c mean air temperature with frequent mild precipitation 100 mm month 1 while summers are warm and dry 20 c mean air temperature with rare rainfall showers 20 mm month 1 the vegetation in the study area consists of scattered oak trees 7 canopy coverage and sparse annual grasses which are continuously grazed by cattle the sardón study area has already been studied extensively lubczynski and gurwin 2005 setup first groundwater model of the study area lubczynski 2009 lubczynski et al 2011 reyes acosta et al 2012 and reyes acosta and lubczynski 2013 2014 studied the oak trees transpiration using sap flow techniques mahmoudzadeh et al 2012 investigated spatial variability of water table depth with ground penetrating radar francés et al 2014 used various geophysical techniques to develop a new hydrogeological conceptual model of the catchment francés et al 2015 and hassan et al 2014 modelled the groundwater surface interactions and balugani et al 2017 performed a partitioning and sourcing evapotranspiration study with an eddy covariance tower sap flow measurements and hydrus1d modelling the soil in the study area is spatially homogeneous with texture between sandy loam and loamy sand it is formed by weathering of the underlying fractured granite rock extensive soil sampling was conducted in the study area to determine top soil water content soil hydraulic properties soil texture and depth to bedrock double ring infiltrometer tests were used to determine vertical hydraulic conductivity fig 2 2 2 groundwater measurement and modelling the shallow groundwater shows a change of wtd ranging from 0 5 m b g s in the west close to the river to 10 m b g s in the east in the higher terrain fig 2 we installed several piezometers in the western part in the sloping terrain recording wtd every hour while in the eastern part the presence of shallow granite prevented the installation of piezometers however we monitored a deep well further east just outside of the study area the typical yearly changes of the wtd range from the shallowest at the end of spring march april to the deepest at the end of summer october with amplitude of 2 m the spatio temporal water table dynamics for the years 2009 2010 were modelled by francés et al 2015 2 3 micrometeorological measurements an ec tower was installed in the study area to measure the actual evapotranspiration etec every 30 min balugani et al 2017 the 10 m high tower average trees height is 4 5 m was equipped with a cnr1 four components radiometer kipp and zonen delft the netherlands a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc utah usa a li7500 gas analyzer licor biosciences nebraska usa and a wxt520 multi weather sensor for measurements of wind speed direction air temperature and air humidity vaisala oyj helsinki finland the ec tower was positioned on a gently sloping terrain about 300 m from the river fig 2 additional equipment consisted of two soil heat flux plates hukseflux and 19 temperature sensors placed on a vertical profile from below to above the soil surface used for the assessment of energy balance the data collected for a total duration of 2 years 2009 2010 was then processed with the software alteddy wageningen university and research the netherlands the footprint of the ec tower was calculated using the analytical model by hsieh et al 2000 for the main wind direction with the modification by detto et al 2006 for the inclusion of the lateral dispersion a 2 m high weather station was also available in the area at 100 m from the ec tower which measured continuously wind speed relative humidity air temperature incoming and outgoing solar radiation precipitation and soil heat flux every hour 2 4 calculation of eec to differentiate partition between soil evaporation and tree transpiration the study area was divided into bare soil area and tree canopy area the latter assumed as equal to ground projection of tree canopy area the ec tower footprint shape and position was calculated for each 30 min time interval so that it was known when the tree canopies were measured by the ec tower the tree transpiration was estimated by upscaling sap flow measurements following the methodology proposed by reyes acosta and lubczynski 2013 this allowed the authors to estimate the total tree transpiration 6 of the total evapotranspiration measured by ec tower and to eliminate it from the evapotranspiration dataset obtaining an estimate of bare soil evaporation measured by the ec tower eec additional information on the evapotranspiration partitioning are included in balugani et al 2017 2 5 soil measurements to design and calibrate the nsre conceptual model and investigate the water potentials and temperatures of the dsl we set up three monitoring soil profiles in the study area the profiles were equipped with soil moisture and temperature sensors hydraprobe stevens usa at four depths 25 50 75 and 100 cm b g s and matric potential sensors decagon mps1 usa measuring range 0 to 0 5 mpa at three depths 15 25 and 75 cm b g s due to the very dry conditions of the top soil two polymer tensiometers pots bakker et al 2007 measuring range 0 to 1 6 mpa were also installed both at 15 cm b g s at the two different locations next to two soil moisture profiles all soil measurements were recorded every hour by a campbell cr1000 data logger campbell scientific usa the pots sensors have wider measuring range than most tensiometers and were used to determine the formation and presence of the dsl in conjunction with manual measurements performed with soil ring sampling and a wp4 dew point potentiometer decagon devices usa in the context of this study the dsl is defined as a soil layer with matric potential 1 5 mpa the lowest measurable with the pot sensor moreover when taking the soil samples locations shown in fig 2 we measured soil moisture manually in the soil at different depth using a portable theta probe delta t devices uk these manual measurements were taken in september 2011 a ponding experiment was performed on one of the three soil profiles in order to inverse calibrate the hydrus1d model 3 conceptual models and methods 3 1 testing da conceptual model assumption the main assumptions of the da conceptual model are that 1 even if the evaporation through a dsl is a complex vapour flow phenomenon when averaged over a day it can be calculated as the upward isothermal liquid water flow driven by pressure gradients with negligible effect of gravity 2 the evaporation process affects only the water in the topmost layer above the zero flux plane of the soil brutsaert 2014 the assumption 1 is based on the idea that most processes in a daily evaporation cycle either cancel each other e g thermally driven fluxes zeng et al 2009 night time wetting from below idso et al 1979 or enhance water vapour transport through the dsl to equal the liquid water transport up to the vaporization plane e g atmospheric turbulence ishihara et al 1992 when these processes are taken into account in the dynamic nature of the dsl the water vapour transport through this dry layer is significantly larger than expected when assuming only fick s diffusion as found for example by parlange et al 1998 due to an abundant evidence from field studies reviewed in brutsaert 2014 the dsl effect as an evaporation rate limiting factor is considered relatively small again when averaged over a day and the main factor controlling the evaporation rate is the capillary rise of liquid water to the vaporization plane the assumption 2 is that a zero flux plane exists below the vaporization plane fig 1b at a fixed depth d where capillary and gravity forces acting on liquid water are at equilibrium above the zero flux plane water moves upward due to hydraulic head gradients while below water moves downward by gravity forces daamen et al 1993 jackson et al 1973 khalil et al 2003 payne et al 1990 tsujimura et al 2001 villegas and morris 1990 therefore only water above the depth d evaporates the solution of the linearized richards equation leads to two possible equations one for short term evaporation where e l t 1 decreases with the square root inverse of time t 1 2 and the other for long term evaporation where e decreases following an exponential decay formulation the assumptions for the linearization and solution of the richards equation are that i the initial volumetric water content is uniform throughout the soil profile θ i dimensionless ii as soon as the evaporation process starts the volumetric water content at the soil surface is air dry θ 0 dimensionless iii the zero flux plane depth d l calculated as in equation 9 of brutsaert 2014 is constant the evaporative flux at the surface following brutsaert 2014 is 1 e d e 0 n 1 2 e x p 2 n 1 2 t κ where 2 e 0 2 d θ i θ 0 d 3 κ 4 d 2 π 2 d where e 0 is in l t 1 mm d 1 in this study d is the liquid saturation weighted mean diffusivity of air in soil l2t 1 mm2 d 1 in this study dependent on soil saturation see brutsaert 2014 eq 4 t is time t and κ is the characteristic timescale of soil drying brutsaert 2014 appendix a all defined in eqs 4 6 of brutsaert 2014 for large t the series in equation 1 converges to brutsaert 2014 4 e d e 0 exp t κ while the limiting case for small t is 1 2 d e 0 t 1 2 where d e 0 is the desorptivity defined in eq 12 of brutsaert 2014 we identified all the drying periods after precipitation in summers 2009 and 2010 and split these periods into two subsets a calibration set when a dsl was not yet formed in the soil mid april to july and a validation set when a dsl was reported august september then we used the first subset to calibrate the model i e fit eq 4 and the second to validate the model we are interested in the long term solution eq 4 to calculate the evaporation values for a long drying event after a precipitation when a dsl is usually formed brutsaert 2014 shows a practical method to determine e 0 and κ directly from evaporation data this can be done by fitting a linear function to a semi log plot of evaporation values in time we fitted eq 4 to the semi log plots of evapotranspiration during the drying events of the first half of the dry season calibration to determine e 0 and κ and then we compared the predicted evaporation rates with the measured ones for the validation dataset note that due to the second assumption of this conceptual model the soil moisture below the zero flux plane is not relevant in the evaporation process so the wtd has no impact on the estimated evaporation 3 2 testing nsre conceptual model assumption the main assumption of the nsre conceptual model is that a proper modelling of the liquid phase discontinuity in the dsl is not needed to estimate the evaporation rates from a dry soil the nsre cannot model liquid phase discontinuity in the soil profile phase dijkema et al 2017 with this assumption however it can be used even when such discontinuity is clearly reported in the field assouline et al 2013 the water vapour diffusion is taken into account the dsl is approximated as a pseudo dsl a soil layer where the water vapour diffusion is larger than the liquid water flow even if the liquid water continuity is not lost we applied the nsre conceptual model in the study area by simulating the bare soil evaporation using the hydrus1d numerical model version 4 14 with coupled heat liquid and water vapour flow described in simunek et al 2005 and saito et al 2006 the model simulates the liquid flow of water through a porous media by darcian flow while water vapour is simulated by the diffusion flow only we used the van genuchten 1980 expression for the water retention curve wrc a 1d model was chosen because i the focus was only on the evaporation process ii the model is widely used in the literature for similar studies iii the topographical gradients involved are relatively small hydrus1d has been already shown to be able to model evaporation of water from a soil with a 5 cm thick dsl even with the van genuchten 1980 wrc assouline et al 2013 we used field and laboratory measurements to determine the boundary conditions and the soil hydraulic properties of the hydrus1d model the soil hydraulic properties were estimated by laboratory analysis of the soil samples collected in the area together with the data from the double ring infiltrometer tests conducted at 7 locations these were used as a starting point for inverse calibration using the data of the ponding experiment performed at the end of september 2011 see section 2 2 the micrometeorological measurements collected every 30 min were used as the top model boundary condition the bottom boundary was set as the wtd extracted from the groundwater model of francés et al 2015 for years 2009 and 2010 the hydrus1d model was calibrated using the dataset collected in the three soil monitoring profiles fig 2 balugani et al 2017 the depth of soil profiles was 2 m b g s the temperature at the soil surface was monitored by an infrared radiometer ir100 from campbell scientific and the wtd in piezometers by 3 water level recorders keller dcx 22 switzerland and by manual measurements uniform temperature and soil moisture at field capacity over the whole profile were set as the initial condition of the 2 years simulation the simulation started 2 months before the setup and initialization of the ec tower measurements wtd and meteorological measurements from the 2 m high weather station are available for that period to compare the hydrus1d model evaporation with the ec tower measurements the hydrus1d evaporation was upscaled over the whole bare soil area using maps of wtd obtained from francés et al 2015 and compared to eec using the ec tower footprint calculation for that purpose the study area was divided into pixels of 1 m2 in every pixel representing bare soil the hydrus1d models were run with known wtd obtained from francés et al 2015 in this way we obtained hydrus1d modelled evaporation at 30 minute temporal and 1 m2 spatial resolution we then multiplied these maps of hydrus1d evaporation by the ec tower footprint a probability density map in order to calculate the evaporation modelled by hydrus1d in the footprint sampled by the ec tower we call this hydrus1d simulated footprint evaporation ef this upscaling method is described in more detail in balugani et al 2014 2017 3 3 testing the applicability of the ps conceptual model the ps conceptual model is based on laboratory experiments of soil evaporation where an air dry dsl develops at the beginning of s2 evaporation with z dsl determined by the soil hydraulic properties of the soil the formation of an air dry dsl was observed in numerous laboratory experiments where initially saturated soils were left to evaporate under stable evaporative conditions lehmann et al 2008a 2008b or et al 2013 shokri and salvucci 2011 the saturation conditions as observed in the laboratory studies in the soil profile during s2 evaporation is schematically shown in fig 1a shokri et al 2009 yiotis et al 2003 the soil profile consists of three zones a saturated zone an intermediary unsaturated zone called film region by lehmann et al 2008a 2008b where water moves upward by capillary flow and an upper dsl zone where liquid water continuity is lost and water moves only as vapour lehmann et al 2008a 2008b define the thickness of the intermediary zone by a characteristic length lc which is the height of the hydraulically connected region between the receding drying front the saturated zone and the vaporization plane fig 1a if the evaporation rates are low which is often the case during s2 the liquid phase above the drying front is close to hydrostatic equilibrium in the case of hydrostatic equilibrium the lc can be calculated by linearization of the water retention curve for the soil material fig 1a shokri and salvucci 2011 or et al 2013 which implies that the depth of the drying front at the onset of s2 depends only on the hydraulic properties of the soil we implemented the ps conceptual model based on the theoretical model presented in shokri and salvucci 2011 and or et al 2013 using an approach similar to that of assouline et al 2013 the main elements of the ps conceptual model for s2 evaporation from soil columns are a evaporation rate through a dsl layer is restricted to fick s water vapour diffusion rate so no liquid water flow takes place and b lc determined by the soil material properties only represents the maximum height of continuity in the liquid water above the saturated zone assouline et al 2013 applied that ps conceptual model to calculate the evaporation flow from a lysimeter with a reported air dry soil layer at the top this was done by assuming only fick s diffusion flow for water vapour in the 0 04 m thick top dsl and using soil moisture content and temperature information at the top and bottom of the dsl as boundary conditions to calculate the diffusion we followed the method of assouline et al 2013 the equation for the water vapour diffusion e diff becomes then 5 e diff d soil v δ c v z dsl where d soil v is the diffusion coefficient for water vapour in the soil defined as in millington and quirk 1960 and δ c v is the difference between vapour concentration at the vaporization plane and at the soil surface both quantities d soil v and δ c v are dependent on soil and atmospheric concentrations as detailed in assouline et al 2013 the identification of the initial z dsl as equal to the characteristic length lc is applicable in laboratory conditions and with initially saturated bare soils but it is problematic in field conditions where random precipitation events changing wtd conditions and variable evaporative conditions result in a more complex soil moisture profile when the original concept of lc is taken into account z dsl depends on wtd e g fig 1a as z dsl w t d l c with lc calculated by linearization of the van genuchten wrc this differs from the field observations where a mostly constant z dsl 0 25 m b g s was observed through direct measurements and pot dataloggers section 2 5 over the whole area despite different wtd therefore we implemented two versions of the ps model i the first called evz model incorporating the lc concept with a z dsl dependent on both wtd and lc determined by soil material properties and ii the second called ecz model more representative of field observations with a spatially and temporally constant z dsl 0 25 m over the whole area with a set up similar to the soil profile in fig 1b the ps model was developed to explain stable evaporation in laboratory experiments so its applicability to field studies where evaporative conditions can change dramatically at different time scales can be problematic in shokri and salvucci 2011 the ps conceptual model was tested in laboratory experiments with potential evaporation rates of 10 mm d 1 and initially saturated soil columns of 60 cm height in our study area evaporation rates were 3 mm d 1 during the afternoon the wtd was 10 m b g s in the higher elevated parts of the catchment and changes in evaporative conditions between day and night were large ranging from 20 mm d 1 during a day to condensation during a night fick s diffusion flow was calculated as in assouline et al 2013 knowing the air relative humidity the soil relative humidity the temperature at the vaporization plane and using millington and quirk 1960 for the diffusion coefficient in order to meet the assumptions and to apply the ps conceptual model in our study we limited the analysis to afternoon periods of the day when the evaporative conditions were the most stable we used three criteria to select assessment days from the available time series i a dsl was observed by the pot measurements ii withered grasses occurred in the whole area i e only bare soil present iii no precipitation was recorded in the preceding week and in analysed days the decision to calculate the bare soil evaporation only during the afternoon from 14 00 to 19 00 local time appr 13 00 18 00 solar time was taken to exclude the possible evaporation of condensation water in the dsl in the morning and because the temperature gradient in the soil the air temperature the relative humidity and the net radiation did not change much during that period of the day in this way the calculations were performed for relatively stable evaporative conditions when the presence and dryness of the dsl was confirmed and the soil moisture profile below the vaporization plane was relatively close to equilibrium the analysis for the ps conceptual model was carried out for the following days 11 august and 26 september of 2009 29 june 13 and 14 july 21 august and 26 september of 2010 3 4 comparison of the three conceptual models we evaluated the three conceptual models based on their ability to estimate the eec measurements the three conceptual models estimate soil evaporation at different time frames i the da conceptual model estimates the daily cumulative evaporation ii the nsre estimates the evaporation rate for each time step in this case every 30 min iii the ps model estimates the soil evaporation every hour during the stable conditions period of the day 14 00 to 19 00 local time see section 3 3 the eec measurements are taken every 30 min we compared the daily values of evaporation measured by the ec tower with those estimated by the da and by the nsre conceptual models by integrating the eec and nsre evaporation over a day then we compared the ps evaporation estimates with the eec and nsre evaporation for the same period of the day finally we calculated the cumulative water vapour diffusion through the dsl over a whole day to obtain daily values however this is a stretch of the ps model assumptions and it is possible that water transport processes are missed in doing so 4 results 4 1 field measurements the results of the ec measuring campaign together with the corresponding rainfall data are presented in fig 4 the acquired data show that the year 2009 300 mm y 1 early 2009 not shown was much drier than 2010 700 mm y 1 consequently water table was deeper and soil moisture was lower at the beginning of the dry season in 2009 than in the same period of 2010 during the wet winter of 2009 2010 with low potential evapotranspiration and frequent rain events the eec did not show drying trends but increased steadily until april mid spring after april weather conditions started to change with fewer rain events every 2 weeks and higher potential evaporation and some drying spells appeared marked by daily decreases of eec between one precipitation event and another the eec was the largest at the beginning of the dry season of the wetter year 2010 3 5 mm d 1 in june 2010 when pet and soil moisture were high and then steadily declined throughout the dry season down to 2 mm d 1 in september 2010 the lowest eec 1 mm d 1 were recorded at the end of the dry season in the drier year 2009 the eec in june 2010 was three times larger than in september 2009 for more details see balugani et al 2017 the eec magnitude in the study area as analysed by different ec tower footprint orientations shows no eec dependence on wind direction during the dry season despite large differences in wtd ranging from 0 5 m b g s along sardón valley to 10 m at the eastern side of the study area see appendix a this is to be expected when a dsl develops in the whole area or et al 2013 and neriah et al 2014 show that s2 rates are very similar even if boundary conditions vary during the dry season summer i the water in the river fig 2 stops flowing and the river itself breaks up into many elongated ponds hydraulically linked with groundwater fig 3 ii the grasses wither and are eaten by the cattle fig 3 and iii a dsl enhanced by the large vapour pressure deficit vpd and transpiration of grasses quickly forms up to a depth exceeding the root depth of the grass synoptic weather measurements taken at 2 m height fig 2 show that the relative humidity drops below 20 during a day in dry season while the air temperature may vary from 12 c during night to 37 c during the day the soil surface temperature ranges from 8 to 50 c and the precipitation events are short and rare the pot measurements fig 5 the direct observation during the soil sampling and the presence of withered grass prove that a dsl 0 25 m thick was present in the investigated area during most of the drying season particularly after grass senescence may to the first heavy precipitation events around mid september 4 2 testing da conceptual model assumption the da model calibrated using the drying events from the first half of the dry summer 2010 shows a consistent error when validated on the drying events from the second half of the dry summer not shown we first identified all the drying events in the dataset beginning from the last day of rain and recording duration in days and cumulative daily eec until the next rain then looking at soil moisture data we divided it into two subsets the drying events relative to moister soils beginning of the dry summer may june 2010 and drying events relative to soils with a dsl end of summer july september 2009 and 2010 fig 6 we used the first subset to calibrate the da model by linear regression of ln e ec against duration t days in this way we obtained the two parameters e 0 2 88 mm d 1 and κ 26 9 days with a r2 0 76 rmse 0 36 mm d 1 however when applied to the validation dataset the da model predicted daily evaporation rates with a rmse 1 04 mm d 1 the consistent error in the evaporation rate predictions is due to the fact that the drying events in the three periods analysed fig 6 are described by significantly different sets of e 0 and κ parameters looking at the semilog plot in fig 6 it seems reasonable to infer that the calibration dataset and the validation dataset have different sets of parameters for eq 4 this means that the linear model fitted to the calibration data is significantly different from the linear model fitted to the validation dataset to test this hypothesis we i divided the validation dataset further into the second half of summer 2009 and the second half of summer 2010 ii fitted a linear model to each of the three subsets second half of dry summer 2009 first half of dry summer 2010 and second half of dry summer 2010 referred from here on as sh2009 fh2010 and sh2010 iii tested the hypothesis that the linear models are the same with an anova test the test showed that all the linear models are significantly different with very low p values for the comparisons between sh2009 and fh2010 model and sh2010 and fh2010 models and p 0 028 for the comparison between sh2009 and sh2010 models the e 0 and κ parameters for the models fitted to the subsets are respectively 0 64 mm d 1 and 17 0 days for the sh2009 model and 1 81 mm d 1 and 14 7 days for the sh2010 model 4 3 testing nsre conceptual model assumption the evaporation estimated by hydrus1d for the ec tower footprint ef differs from the eec in daily averages fig 7 balugani et al 2017 and in 30 minute estimates fig 7 these differences are mainly due to the wind dependent footprint position influencing hydrus1d estimates as explained in section 2 3 hydrus1d modelled the formation of a very thin pseudo dsl 1 3 cm thick only during the driest period the hydrus1d estimates for the daily evaporation rates are presented and discussed in detail in balugani et al 2017 here it is important to note that although during wet periods autumn to mid spring ef is a good estimate of eec balugani et al 2017 during late spring and dry season ef is larger than eec right after a precipitation event later on ef drops quickly to nearly steady state while the eec shows a continuous slow decline fig 7 in balugani et al 2017 ef strongly depends on the footprint position it predicts high ef rates for shallow water tables close to the sardón river wtd 0 5 2 m b g s and low for the higher terrain where wtd is deeper 7 10 m b g s eec instead shows no dependence on the wind speed and wind direction dependent footprint position see section 3 1 and appendix a so there is no significant difference in eec between the river valley and the higher terrain footprints therefore the error of the evaporation prediction from hydrus1d is related to the wtd and therefore to the footprint position as affected by wind direction the absolute and relative errors in the north east south and west quadrants are respectively 0 01 mm d 1 0 21 0 05 mm d 1 1 00 0 008 mm d 1 0 16 and 0 11 mm d 1 2 20 where the absolute error is ef eec and the relative error is the ratio of the absolute error to the average eec fig 8 shows the absolute error depending on wind direction ec footprint position when the results are averaged for the whole area the relative error becomes 1 16 mm d 1 4 4 testing the applicability of the ps conceptual model the evaporation fluxes calculated applying the pore scale conceptual model with a constant zdsl ecz and with a variable zdsl evz calculated as zdsl w t d l c during the stable conditions period and for the whole day are reported in table 2 ecz calculated for the stable part of the day show the same order of magnitude as the eec measurements however the relative error e cz e ec e ec fluctuates between 889 and 6 average 1 19 with the highest relative error reported in augusts of both years evz has the same order of magnitude as ecz but it tends to underestimate eec with an average relative error of 0 82 the daily values of ecz and evz have also the same order of magnitude of the daily eec with an average associated relative error of 0 85 and 0 91 respectively the daily estimates of evz always underestimate the measured eec 4 5 comparison of the three conceptual models the conceptual model with the lowest overall relative error is the nsre model for the whole period dry summers 2009 2010 and for the daily values however the pore scale model has the lowest relative error during the stable conditions period the average relative error for the daily average model for the validation period dry summer 2010 is 1 44 the average relative error for the same period for the nsre model is 0 53 the average relative error for the daily values of the pore scale models are 0 85 and 0 91 for the ecz and evz respectively the average relative error for the same period for the nsre model is 0 67 the average relative error for the stable conditions period of the pore scale models are 1 19 and 0 82 for the ecz and evz respectively the average relative error for the same period for the nsre model is 2 3 5 discussion 5 1 testing daily average conceptual model assumption the differences in e 0 between the three daily average fitted models 2 88 mm d 1 0 64 mm d 1 and 1 81 mm d 1 for fh2010 sh2009 and sh2010 models respectively are probably due to the presence of a dsl eq 2 shows that e 0 depends on two things the initial soil saturation from soil surface to depth d and the soil diffusivity itself dependent on soil saturation the assumption of a quick redistribution of infiltrated water after a precipitation event can be invalid when a dsl is present in the topsoil if the precipitation event is relatively short it infiltrates only the first centimetres of soil and then evaporates completely with no effect on the lower dry topsoil as in sun et al 2016in table 1 a typical dry summer rain event in the sardón study area 5 18 mm in 1 h infiltrates only the first centimetres of soil with no effect on soil dryness at a depth of 15 cm see fig 5 this means that the assumption of initially homogeneous soil moisture brutsaert 2014 after a precipitation event is not correct whenever the depth of water infiltration from such event is smaller than zdsl typically 5 cm this behaviour have been reported in other arid and semi arid areas see the precipitation events in zeng et al 2011a 2011b and sun et al 2016 table 1 and confirms the finding by wang 2015 table 1 the different values for the characteristic timescale of soil drying κ 26 9 17 0 and 14 7 days for fh2010 sh2009 and sh2010 models respectively show that this parameter is also affected by the dryness of the system κ depends on the depth of the zero flux plane and on the soil diffusivity eq 3 as seen before the fact that the soil diffusivity depends itself on soil moisture saturation is problematic whenever a dsl is present in the topsoil moreover neriah et al 2014 table 1 reported that the effect of temperature on the soil material hydraulic properties has a significant effect on the transition between s1 and s2 especially on lc which decreases linearly with temperature lc and d depth of the zero flux plane are similar as both depend on the balance between the capillary viscous and gravity forces so potentially d is also affected by soil temperature during s2 finally using satellite data of soil moisture nasa smap for the whole earth mccoll et al 2017 showed recently that κ depends on climatic conditions in fact κ decreases not only due to an increase in soil sand fraction but also with an increase in the aridity index 5 2 testing nsre conceptual model assumption the proper way to use the richards equation to model water transport in dry soils is a controversial topic numerous field studies showed that in dry soil field conditions water vapour diffusion alone cannot explain the observed evaporation rates usually larger than the predicted ones to model such water transport different approaches have been proposed the inclusion of an enhancement factor philip and de vries 1957 analysed in webb and ho 1998 the effects of air advection in the soil rose 1968a 1968b zeng et al 2011a the night time condensation of water in the dsl wang 2015 table 1 the daily cycle of soil water redistribution idso et al 1979 the effects of atmospheric turbulence on the first cm of soil ishihara et al 1992 the proper simulation of the soil water distributed as thin films covering the soil grains tuller and or 2001 however there is no agreement yet on which of these approaches is the right one even the assumption that an approximation of the dsl is enough to estimate soil evaporation rates is problematic and different levels of approximation of the dsl conditions can be found in literature assouline et al 2013 table 1 obtained good evaporation estimates using the standard van genuchten 1980 wrc for zdsl between 1 and 5 cm sakai et al 2009 used a modified wrc for low water contents fayer and simmons 1995 for zdsl 3 cm sakai et al 2011 table 1 dijkema et al 2017 table 1 pointed out that the best option is to enable liquid phase discontinuities in the soil profile so they used the bimodal durner wrc durner 1994 with hydrus1d to model a lysimeter experiment in las vegas nv usa there was no direct observation of an air dry dsl but the measurements showed very dry soil conditions from soil surface to a depth of 0 25 m interestingly dijkema et al 2017 showed that the model was not able to simulate the very low soil moisture in the topsoil fig 6 of that article and had trouble simulating evaporation in drying conditions with a dry soil surface the differences between ef and eec fig 8 are due to the difficulty of the nsre conceptual model to properly approximate the effects of a dsl as a consequence the ef estimates are reliable only when a dsl is absent i e in the wet seasons but are unreliable in dry seasons when the dsl thickness is substantial the presence of a dsl in an area such as observed in this study would limit the ef rates even with a shallow water table making the ef rates almost independent from wtd the fact that ef is smaller than eec in higher terrain figs 7 8 between 50 and 100 cannot be due to the hydrus1d difficulty in simulating a dsl in fact the proper simulation of a diffusion only layer would result in even smaller ef rates a possible explanation for the eec ef in higher terrain is beyond the scope of this study and it is discussed in section 5 5 5 3 testing the applicability of the pore scale conceptual model the main reason for the difference between ecz and evz values is in the calculation of the distance the water vapour must travel from the vaporization plane to the soil surface i e zdsl the two implementations of the pore scale conceptual model show completely different values and patterns among each other showing the importance of the definition of zdsl in determining the calculation of the vapour fluxes in the ecz implementation a constant zdsl results in evaporation rates dependent only on evaporative conditions in the case of evz instead the evaporation rates depend mostly on changes in wtd these two different patterns remain the same in the calculation of the daily values from here on only the calculation for the stable conditions period is discussed the results for the daily calculations are discussed in section 5 4 a spatially constant zdsl is to be expected in sardón study area during summer due to spatially homogeneous soil properties and the presence of grass that depletes the soil water in the root zone up to wilting point before senesce at the beginning of the dry season the ecz implementation is therefore even if not perfect a better representation of the conditions observed in the field than the evz method as it assumes a spatially constant dsl thickness around the ec tower as corroborated by field observations sections 2 5 and 3 3 ecz shows a different behaviour than eec it changes depending mostly on the temperature at the bottom of the dsl which has the highest daily variation between mid august to mid september see support material the ecz depends only on the difference in water vapour concentration between the soil surface and the bottom of the dsl the water vapour concentration at the soil surface due to very high temperatures and low relative humidity during the day as considered in this analysis is usually very low and does not change much the water vapour concentration at the bottom of the dsl instead given that the soil moisture content at that depth is mostly constant varies with soil temperature therefore a change in soil temperature at the bottom boundary of the dsl 0 25 m b g s can result in a change of ecz of an order of magnitude ecz shows larger negative relative errors in september of both years due to a combination of relatively low air temperature 21 c and high relative humidity 46 resulting in a ecz lower than the measured eec the reason for the overestimation of ecz in august instead is not apparent in this study defining the zdsl w t d l c resulted in very thick dsls for the evz calculations so thick that the water vapour flow through them was one to two order of magnitude smaller than the eec the lc calculated by linearization of the van genuchten retention curve based on the field measured soil material properties is lc 0 25 m this means that in the evz method the dsl thickness can go from 0 25 m in the river valley where water table is 0 5 m b g s to 9 75 m in the higher terrain where wtd reaches 10 m b g s the evz rates are inversely proportional to dsl thickness so to wtd this means that the assumption of zdsl w t d l c is not valid at least in the case studied where the eec shows no clear relation to wtd this was expected as the definition of lc is based on controlled experiments with initially saturated soil columns which continuously and homogeneously dries over constant evaporative conditions in the field the soil is exposed to a variety of evaporative conditions presence of grass and cyclical rewetting due to precipitation events 5 4 comparison of the three conceptual models the two main sources of errors in the soil evaporation estimates when applying the three conceptual models are i how soil evaporation is related to wtd and ii how the changes in soil moisture content of the topsoil in s2 evaporation are modelled the performances of the conceptual models in predicting evaporation rates in this study are mainly related to how sensitive they are to wtd while the eec measurements show little relationship with wtd or wind direction appendix a note that the effects of topography on ec measurements are discussed in appendix b whereas the quality of the etec measurements in appendix c it appears that the best predicting conceptual models are those in which the sensitivity of evaporation to wtd is small at least at the same zdsl conditions these are the da conceptual model and the ecz implementation of the ps conceptual model however the rigidity of their dsl related assumptions is problematic in semi arid areas due to the high inter and intra annual variation in atmospheric conditions wet and dry years wet and dry seasons the main source of error in the hydrus1d estimates of evaporation comes from the wrc used to model the soil hydraulic properties the wrc has an effect on both the properties of the developed pseudo dsl residual water content soil vapour diffusion coefficient zdsl and on the relation between evaporation rates and wtd this is especially true for sandy materials which have a steeper wrc resulting in larger matric potential gradients in the soil profile the relative error of the hydrus1d model is low when averaged over the whole area due to the balance between overestimation of evaporation in shallow wtd conditions and underestimation in deep wtd conditions the mean root square relative error is in fact three times the evaporation estimates and fig 7 shows how different the nsre evaporation estimates can be with respect to eec the pore scale conceptual model when applied to the stable conditions period shows low relative errors for the ecz implementation however the relative errors are much larger when the model is applied to a whole day due to the obvious limitations related to unstable evaporative conditions throughout a day this makes the pore scale conceptual model impractical for field studies especially in semi arid areas where evaporative conditions change widely within a day and within a year for example in the sardón study area only 16 of the total precipitation takes place during the dry summer while the pet is 10 times larger during summer than during winter also soil surface temperature and relative humidity in the dry summer can change from 8 c and 100 during the early morning to 50 c and 20 during the afternoon brutsaert 2014 table 1 disregards wtd in his daily average conceptual model for evaporation in dry conditions as a consequence of the assumption that the evaporation process affects only water above a zero flux plane the latter according to literature remains in the first few tens of cm of soil the da conceptual model also allows another interesting observation the effect of the dsl on the evaporation process seems related to the history and the conditions of a specific dry spell these conditions are related to the soil moisture content in the soil at the beginning of the dry spell considered to the strength of the evaporative conditions and to the presence of grasses that quickly deplete the soil moisture from a certain soil layer a possible indicator of the history of the system is the zdsl thickness at the beginning of the drying spell assouline et al 2013 table 1 for example applied the ps and the nsre conceptual models to the lysimeter data from their study and found that the 4 cm thick dsl had a negligible effect on the evaporation rates similarly wang 2015 table 1 shows that in semi arid and arid conditions and with sandy soils the effects of a dsl on the soil evaporation become large when zdsl 5 cm therefore it is important to find a way to quantify the dryness of a system for example through the dsl thickness which largely constrains the evaporation process 5 5 potential causes of ef eec in elevated terrain with deep water table according to shah et al 2007 for the soil material considered in this study the extinction depth the wtd at which evaporation by liquid flow ceases is 4 75 m with the water table deeper than 4 75 m and sandy loam soil material the hydrus1d ef was very low 0 2 mm d 1 in contrast to eec that was large 2 mm d 1 fig 7b a number of possible processes not included in hydrus1d might be relevant resulting in underestimation of ef from a wtd 4 75 m these processes could be mechanical dispersion air advection in the dry unsaturated zone natural convection in a sloping dry unsaturated zone preferential evaporation flow abrupt pressure and temperature changes because of strong eddies formation on the soil surface a constitutive liquid hydraulic conductivity function which is incorrect in dry conditions first the mechanical dispersion process of water vapour in the unsaturated zone has been studied by grifoll et al 2005 who recognized grifoll 2011 that the dispersivity mechanism can be relevant only in case of a stefan flow flow induced by the production or removal of a chemical species at a certain interface the lack of stefan flow in the case studied means that the process of mechanical dispersion is likely not relevant in our case second the air advection has been already analysed by liu et al 2005 for highland marshes and zeng et al 2011a for drier conditions when the gas pressure gradients in the unsaturated zone are strong enough and the pores filled with gas are well connected as in the case of a dry unsaturated zone then the gas can move by advection flow zeng et al 2011a found that advection of air does play a role albeit small in the evaporation process for a very dry top unsaturated zone the presence of a dry unsaturated zone layer where water moves only as water vapour by advection flow may explain a rate of soil evaporation independent of wtd as measured by the ec tower with a deep wtd the advection flow could result in direct water vapour transport from the saturated zone to the soil surface this process not included in hydrus1d can be present in our case and could be a cause of the hydrus1d underestimation of ef third natural convection according to schery and petschek 1983 usually does not take place in the unsaturated zone it occurs when the rayleigh dimensionless number associated to the free convection flow exceeds a critical value i e when the heat transfer for the fluid switches from conduction to convection the rayleigh number calculated for very permeable materials high temperature gradients and big length scales is below the critical value the loss of air s heat in the unsaturated zone by conduction is faster than by convection to colder areas of the profile rose and guo 1995 however show how taking into account temperature inversion in a sloping soil profile results in a higher rayleigh number potentially leading to convection processes during the night because of the inverse temperature gradient in the soil the convection of air in sloping porous material was also observed by antoine et al 2009 it is important to note that even if convection of air in sloping soil took place during night this would not be measured by the ec method which does not work in such stable conditions fisher et al 2007 when flux occurs below the measurement height and does not reach the sensor this means that although this process might be relevant for the calculation of the overall modelling of evaporation from bare soil it cannot be the cause of the mismatch between the evaporation calculated by hydrus1d and the ec tower measurements as both did not account for it fourth papafotiou et al 2010 studied the effect of preferential evaporation patterns in porous material with both numerical modelling and laboratory experiments preferential evaporation in soils originates from heterogeneities in the soil texture structure and compaction the soil in the study area is fairly homogeneous in texture and structure the only possible source of heterogeneity could have been originated by animal trampling resulting in soil compaction this was not observed in the field as animals graze everywhere with some preference for the area close to the river fifth the bare soil as already explained experiences large diurnal changes in temperature with very high temperatures in the afternoon these conditions lead to the formation of air turbulences in the form of eddies and even dust devils observed resulting in abrupt changes in the pressure and temperature at the soil surface which can trigger advective flows of vapour in the dry unsaturated zone this possibility was studied for gas exchanges between unsaturated zone and atmosphere in the work by poulsen 2006 they concluded that higher amplitudes and frequencies of pressure variations result in higher values of diffusion dispersion coefficients and also in a larger e contribution maier et al 2011 arrived at a similar conclusion for forest soils this process is not accounted for in hydrus1d but it would influence the eec measurements therefore it could contribute to the mismatch between the hydrus1d ef and eec sixth the majority of the constitutive relationships for the hydraulic properties of the soil materials also in hydrus1d are optimized for relatively wet conditions therefore the same properties may be poorly characterized in the very dry conditions observed in the top unsaturated zone during this study this problem cannot be eliminated a priori as a possible cause of the hydrus1d simulation errors the amount of possibly unaccounted processes the amount of variables playing a role in the field conditions and the small magnitudes of the fluxes in summertime semi arid and arid conditions make it difficult to point out the cause of the mismatch between ef and eec the only way to identify the unaccounted process or processes is to systematically analyse them using both laboratory and field experiments this can be done dividing the possible suspects into categories depending on the possibility to eliminate them the advection flow cannot be eliminated only reduced the turbulence is related to specific conditions at the soil surface and can be controlled in laboratory the other factors depend on soil materials and geometry and can be controlled in the field designing a series of lab and field experiments slowly adding complexity at each step should allow to find which is the process or processes overlooked in the hydrus1d assessment of groundwater evaporation in very dry conditions with relatively deep water table with well developed dsl 6 conclusions the present study tested the performance of three different conceptual models the daily average the nsre and the pore scale for modelling soil evaporation in the presence of a dsl in a semi arid area during two dry seasons 2009 drier and 2010 wetter the results suggest that among the three conceptual models tested the daily average conceptual model is the most practical for field conditions as it is designed based on field studies with few input data available however its assumption of negligible dsl effect on the evaporation process seems not appropriate for very dry conditions when the dsl thickness increases in time and the initial soil moisture profile after a precipitation event is not uniform under such conditions the assumption of area specific e 0 and κ parameters is problematic the performance of this conceptual model therefore needs to be corrected for the history of the drying area related to soil moisture contents and evaporative conditions the nsre conceptual model represented by hydrus1d had the lowest overall relative error when averaged over the whole area and in the whole period however this masks the overestimation of evaporation rates during drying periods especially for shallow water tables and underestimation of evaporation rates from deep water table conditions also it could not properly simulate a dsl which confirms the findings of assouline et al 2013 and dijkema et al 2017 this seems not to affect seriously the evaporation flux calculation when the dsl is thin e g 3 cm as in assouline et al 2013 even if the soil moisture profile simulated departs considerably from the observed one however when the topsoil is drier the simulation of drying events is more problematic dijkema et al 2017 in this study where the dsl thickness is 0 25 m the hydrus1d model using the van genuchten soil moisture water pressure relationship could not properly simulate the evaporation rates the pore scale conceptual model modified in order to adapt it to field conditions performed well in the prediction of evaporative rates both the evz and ecz method at least for the part of the day with more stable evaporative conditions mid day to late afternoon the model shows a strong dependence on temperature at the bottom of the dsl which is not evident in the eec dataset due to the assumption of stable evaporative conditions the model was not able to properly estimate the daily evaporation rates because of this the model is no applicable to field conditions this study indicates possible future directions for the improvement of modelling of soil evaporation in very dry conditions i e arid and semi arid areas during dry season when a dsl affects evaporation it is still unclear for example when exactly a dsl starts to affect the evaporation process in field conditions this could depend on the thickness of the dsl which in turn depends on soil characteristics and duration of the drying event and or on the drying history of the system another research direction could be to adapt the pore scale model to arid and semi arid field conditions this would help understanding the physical processes influencing the movement of water in a dsl under field conditions e g atmospheric turbulence variation in the temperature pressure and vapour concentration gradients acknowledgments this research was funded by the international institute for geo information science and earth observation itc faculty of twente university the netherlands we thank the four anonymous reviewers and the journal of hydrology editorial team tim r mcvicar yuting yang and corrado corradini for the constructive and helpful comments appendix a etec dependence on wind direction we tested the hypothesis that there is a relation between wind direction and etec magnitude and more specifically that in our study area the higher etec is associated with the wind from the western side with shallow wtd than the wind from the eastern side where wtd is deeper before analysing etec directly we analysed the directionality of the surface roughness which influences etec readings in order to do so we first analysed roughness length z 0 in all cardinal directions around the flux tower from the measurements of the wind speed and friction velocity of the sonic anemometer installed at 10 m height then analysed the changes of roughness length for momentum z 0 m with respect to wind direction following van der tol et al 2003 we grouped the ec data into classes of wind direction of 30 rejecting data with an absolute difference between wind direction measured by csat3 and the vaisala 25 for each of these 30 classes of wind direction z 0 m was calculated from friction velocity u and wind speed u both estimated from measurements of the 3d sonic anemometer a logarithmic wind profile was assumed as a1 u u k k ln z z 0 m ψ m where k k 0 41 is von kármán constant and ψ m is a correction for stability we used the equation of paulson 1970 for stable and unstable conditions to calculate ψ m per half hour the parameter z 0 m was estimated by minimizing the root square difference between measured and modeled eq a 1 wind speed the roughness length for heat z 0 h can only be calculated if a surface temperature is defined we used the radiometrically derived surface temperature t rad calculated from the longwave radiation measured at the station to estimate the roughness length for heat in a similar way to the roughness length for momentum 2a t air t rad t k k ln z z 0 h ψ h where t h ρ air c p u h is sensible heat flux derived from the sonic anemometer data directly ρ air is the specific mass of the air kg m 3 c p the heat capacity j kg t air the air temperature measured at the station the parameter z 0 h was estimated by minimizing the root square difference between measured and modelled t rad this resulted in a value of z 0 h as low as 2 4 10 4 m similar values have been reported before in dry sparsely vegetated areas verhoef et al 1997 gökmen et al 2012 ψ h is calculated i for unstable conditions with the formulation of paulson 1970 ii considered zero for stable and neutral conditions see also eq b13 in van der tol et al 2003 we found that the ratio of friction velocity over wind speed and thus z 0 m was rather constant over cardinal directions except for the z 0 m of 0 9 m in north east direction vs 0 2 m in other directions the different values in the north and east directions was due to the position of the sonic anemometer with the tower and the gas analyser blocking the wind coming from north east and not due to differences in soil roughness therefore we decided to assign a constant value to z 0 m 0 2 m for all directions i e we found no directionality for the soil roughness to analyse the directionality of the evapotranspiration measured by the eddy covariance tower we could not use the actual values of etec given wind direction because both wind and etec might have been related to other climatic processes e g if wind after rainfall is frequently coming from the west then the west will show a higher evapotranspiration value which does not strictly depend on wtd difference with respect to the eastern part indeed the wind direction was unevenly distributed both over the daytime and the seasons which means that simply correlating wind direction and etec would be meaningless however both diurnal and seasonal periodicity can be removed by normalizing etec with the priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration et 0 as 3a et norm et ec et 0 where et norm is the normalised evapotranspiration etec is the evapotranspiration measured by the ec tower with a frequency of 30 min et 0 is the potential evapotranspiration calculated with priestley taylor also with the same synchronized frequency of 30 min the analysis of the et norm dependence upon wind direction is presented in fig 9 a together with associated standard error bars for the year 2010 et norm does not show any significant relation to wind direction for the year 2009 et norm shows some variation depending on wind direction but the low amount of data results in wide error bars the higher et norm measured in year 2009 are recorded when wind is coming from the higher terrain area where water table is deep wind direction 30 120 north east therefore no clear relationships between et norm and wind direction is apparent appendix b etec dependence on topography a question arises regarding the validity of the etec measurements in a terrain not completely flat as with the gentle hills in sardón study area for clarity we separate the discussion of the effects of the complexity of the terrain upon the accuracy of the etec measurements into two parts i the effects on the wind field and the fluxes and ii the suitability of the measurement technique raupach and finnigan 1997 reviewed topographical effects on the meteorology they distinguished direct effects of topography on irradiance and the wind field from indirect effects related to variation in soil and vegetation that correlate with topography with a wind tunnel experiment they showed that hills modify the direction of the wind creating revers flow and wakes in a way that affects the ec measurements resulting in changes in the order of 40 of the stanton number raupach and finnigan 1997 near the hill top in our study area the effect of the rugged terrain on wind could have some effects on the representativeness of the measurements and the validity of the footprint model however the obstacles in our study area are very gentle as their height to length ratio of 1 50 is five times lower than the lower of the two hills studied by raupach and finnigan 1997 moreover the eddy covariance tower is not located near the top or the foot of a hill for these reasons we do not expect significant direct effects of the topography on the turbulence the topography clearly affects the soils and the vegetation in our dry study area there is a large contrast in surface temperature and in roughness between the patches of trees and bare soil however the footprint model holds for a surface with a spatially constant roughness length as in our case see appendix a although it has not been designed for sparse vegetation areas more complicated footprint models are not necessarily better unless sufficient data are available for parameterization and validation in our study we know that the wind direction is correct and we assessed the sensitivity of the footprint shape upon the surface roughness in order to get an idea of the uncertainty of the footprint in order to test whether the rugged terrain and the distribution of the trees affected the wind field we analysed the tilt of the average wind field i e the roll and pitch of the wind vector from different directions this analysis was carried out with the software alteddy version 3 71 as well as manually using matlab for a 10 days in row period of 2010 when the etec was about 2 mm d 1 it appeared that depending on the wind direction there was a mild roll of between 0 and 5 and a pitch between 0 and 6 of the wind vector the tilt of the wind field was not larger than at other flux sites we carried out several other tests on the ec data to check the suitability of the measurement technique for our study area conditions a potential problem was the strong buoyancy in the area that might cause strong vertical winds van der molen et al 2004 evaluated the effect of the angle of attack on the measurement accuracy of the wind speed for two brands of sonic anemometers both similar in design to the one used by us and found a correction method for it we followed that method and plotted on a histogram the ratio of the vertical and the horizontal wind speed not shown and found that the absolute value of this ratio was smaller than 0 5 in 95 4 of the cases indicating that correction for angle attack was not necessary appendix c etec measurements quality and related error out of the four components of the energy balance the etec probably had the largest relative error as being the smallest of the fluxes during the dry period and as derived from two sensors a sonic anemometer and a gas analyser the values of etec were between 0 04 mm d 1 and 4 00 mm d 1 the value of 0 04 mm d 1 was extremely low and only occurred for 12 22 26 and 28 september 2009 it is widely accepted that the error in etec is around 20 e g goulden et al 1996 but it can be even higher when the gas fluxes are low as in very dry conditions however that accuracy can be improved by comparing etec to water balance estimates as found by scott 2010 for savannah landscape we found that in the very dry periods the vapour pressure deficit was 10 hpa and the standard deviation of the 10 hz vapour pressure measurements was about half of the one during the wet period because the fluctuations in vapour pressure and vertical wind speed are of the same order of magnitude in both the wet and dry season we assume that the error associated with the etec measurements is also similar in the wet and the dry season approximately 20 as such there is no reason to assume that the accuracy of the measurements of gas concentrations and of wind speed changed between dry and wet period in absolute sense physical limitations of the instruments such as the separation of the responses of the anemometer and of the gas analyser the size of the eddies that can be sampled and the terrain effects non horizontal mean wind at the tower height play a role in our case we investigated this by means of a sensitivity analysis of alteddy by switching on and off corrections type of axis rotation spectral fitting and deliberately entering a smaller or larger distance between anemometer and gas analyser i e changing the planar fit method which resulted in changes in etec of only a few percent the effects of changing the planar fit method were in absolute sense smaller than in the wet period 0 5 w m 2 in the dry period versus 0 7 w m 2 in a wet period but larger in relative sense appendix d supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016

6897,bare soils and grasslands in arid and semi arid conditions constitute a large portion of the earth surface evaporation which is the main component of the water balance in these conditions often takes place through a dry soil layer dsl there is no scientific agreement yet on the dsl effects on evaporation rates the implementations of three conceptual models of dsl evaporation were tested for the simulation of evaporation rates in a semi arid study area in central spain i the daily average model based on the assumption that the daily average vapour transport in a dsl can be represented in analogy to isothermal liquid flow ii the numerical model solving the richards equation in this case hydrus1d was used and iii the pore scale model based on soil column experiments in laboratory conditions the evaporation rates estimated by the three conceptual models for semi arid field conditions were compared with the evaporation rates measured by an eddy covariance tower in the same area the results indicate that the daily average conceptual model assumption in which the dsl has no effects on evaporation does not hold in very dry conditions the numerical model solving the richards equation was not able to simulate the effects of the dsl on evaporation rates the evaporation estimates obtained by the pore scale conceptual model were closest to the eddy covariance measurements during the dry season however this model was applicable only to the relatively steady evaporation conditions during afternoons and only assuming spatially constant dsl thickness keywords dry soil layer soil evaporation semi arid arid water vapour flow 1 introduction evaporation from bare soils and grasslands is the most important component of the hydrological balance in semi arid and arid areas lawrence et al 2006 wang 2015 such areas cover a significant part of the earth surface and can be found in all continents peel et al 2007 they are particularly vulnerable to desertification processes following changes in their hydrological balances badreldin et al 2017 the grass in these areas typically transpires only during short rainy seasons while in rest of the time tend to become dormant senesce or die converting to bare soil therefore evaporation from the bare soil becomes the main water flux in the water budget in semi arid and arid areas brutsaert 2014 in this study the soil is defined as the porous unconsolidated material covering an underlying bedrock regardless of its water content the soil evaporation process is strongly dependent on the hydraulic connection between the soil surface and the saturated zone good et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 gardner and fireman 1958 studied the steady state evaporation from a water table in soil columns laboratory experiments calculating the upward liquid flow with the buckingham darcy law they found that the bare soil evaporation shows an exponential decay with increasing water table depth shah et al 2007 simulated the steady state evaporation from a bare soil as dependent on water table depth using a variable saturation one dimensional flow model hydrus1d based on the numerical solution of the richards equation simunek et al 2005 this type of model requires a continuous liquid connection between the saturated zone and the soil surface which is a valid assumption for a shallow water table with mild evaporative conditions lehmann et al 2008a 2008b but questionable for arid and semi arid conditions and or a deep water table at a certain water table depth wtd the gravity forces become stronger than the capillary forces and liquid continuity is disrupted shokri and salvucci 2011 when the liquid continuity through a soil profile is lost a dry soil layer dsl is formed in the topsoil first few decimetres of soil below the surface where water transport is mainly in the gas phase as water vapour or et al 2013 this is often the case in semi arid and arid areas wang 2015 the bare soil evaporation process have been divided into two lehmann et al 2008a 2008b three idso et al 1979 or four stages zhang et al 2015 here we describe the two stages conceptualization during the first stage of evaporation s1 there is liquid continuity between the saturated zone and the soil surface the evaporation of water takes place at the vaporization plane fig 1 which at the beginning of an evaporation cycle is at the soil surface as the evaporation progresses the liquid water moves upward due to capillary flow driven by the water pressure gradient while the depth of the drying front which marks the transition between saturated and unsaturated zone increases here the unsaturated zone is defined as the part of the soil not saturated by gas or liquid where the water moves mainly by liquid flow the soil surface gradually dries as the drying front and the water table move down at a certain wtd dependent on soil hydraulic properties the capillary forces becomes too small to ensure liquid continuity between water table and soil surface and a layer of soil not hydraulically connected to the water table develops lehmann et al 2008a 2008b this is the beginning of the second stage of evaporation s2 fig 1a when water evaporates from a vaporization plane below the soil surface and then moves through the dsl according to shokri and salvucci 2011 mainly by vapour diffusion in an unsaturated soil profile the process of dsl formation is similar in this case the depletion of the water stored close to the soil surface results in a very dry upper soil fig 1b some authors e g hillel 1998 prefer to divide the evaporation into three stages depending on evaporation rates which are equal to potential values during stage i dependent on the hydraulic properties of the soil material during stage ii and dependent on vapour diffusion during stage iii the evaporation rates from bare soils drop significantly when a dsl develops i e between s1 and s2 or et al 2013 with s2 evaporation rates so small that they are usually neglected in field studies balugani et al 2017 the transition between s1 and s2 evaporation depends on soil material properties and also on soil temperature which has recently been found by neriah et al 2014 laboratory experiments show that s2 evaporation rates are independent from s1 rates and do not vary much over a wide range of soil materials and boundary conditions or et al 2013 this means that s2 evaporation rates are mostly similar in different evaporative conditions the small s2 evaporation rates 1 mm d 1 are often neglected in field studies when either the soil surface is dry or the water table is considered to be deep enough shah et al 2007 for example miller et al 2010 neglected groundwater evaporation in an area with wtd between 7 and 12 m b g s below ground surface while paço et al 2009 neglected soil evaporation when pasture was dry with a wtd between 4 and 6 m b g s however the bare soil evaporation can be an important component in a hydrological balance in both dry deserted lands wang 2015 and during dry seasons in mediterranean climates as confirmed by balugani et al 2017 in a study area characterized by an open woodland ecosystem and wtd between 1 and 10 m b g s moreover evaporation in arid conditions was documented even at wtd 100 m b g s by li et al 2014 scanlon 2000 walvoord et al 2002a and walvoord et al 2002b the presence of a dsl has been attested both in laboratory and field studies but its effects on bare soil evaporation are controversial the dsl observed in laboratory conditions consists of an air dry layer between the soil surface and the vaporization plane fig 1a and b water in the dsl is present only in vapour form the soil is completely saturated by the gaseous phase that has therefore higher mobility than in the remaining part of unsaturated zone the thickness of the observed dsl zdsl goes from few mm deol et al 2014 to more than 50 cm sun et al 2016 in the laboratory experiments typically under steady state conditions water transport from the vaporization plane to the soil surface can be explained by vapour diffusion alone and the formation of a dsl results in a strong decrease of evaporation rates or et al 2013 in field studies however the dsl is more dynamic due to daily changes in evaporative condition i zdsl can change due to redistribution of soil moisture when the driving solar radiation is absent during night idso et al 1979 water vapour can condense in the dsl due to temperature profile changes and evaporate from it in the morning assouline et al 2013 deol et al 2014 ii air turbulence in the atmosphere can enhance the vapour transport in the first 2 4 cm of the dsl ishihara et al 1992 these processes can greatly increase the transport of water vapour through the dsl which can be as high as the upward flow of liquid water from the deeper soil to the vaporization plane brutsaert 2014 the three main approaches to modelling the evaporation from a soil with a dsl are to i assume that the dsl has no real effect on the daily cumulative soil evaporation ii assume that the dsl can be modelled as if the liquid water continuity through the profile is maintained iii use the dsl model developed from laboratory experiments observations we call these three conceptual models respectively i the daily average da conceptual model ii the numerical solution to the richards equation nsre conceptual model and iii the pore scale ps conceptual model table 1 shows a collection of studies about soil evaporation in the presence of a dsl the conceptual models used and the type of experiment field laboratory and numeric for more studies of dsl soil evaporation see wang 2015 the da conceptual model is based on the assumption that the limiting factor for the daily averaged soil evaporation during s2 is the upward isothermal flow of liquid water to the vaporization plane in other words the complex vapour transport processes in the dsl can be simplified when integrated through a daily cycle resulting in a negligible effect of the dsl on the daily soil evaporation rates therefore the soil evaporation can be calculated as isothermal liquid water flow to the soil surface with an exponential evaporation decay behaviour brutsaert 2014 however the exponential behaviour seems dependent on climatic conditions as well as on soil material mccoll et al 2017 the nsre conceptual model is based on the assumption that the numerical solution to richards equation can properly model evaporation from a soil even in the presence of a dsl however the nsre conceptual model cannot properly model an air dry dsl because it does not permit discontinuity in the liquid phase dijkema et al 2017 instead a pseudo dsl can be modelled defined as a soil layer where soil moisture is almost at residual state and water vapour flow is larger than liquid water flow the idea is that the pseudo dsl can properly model the soil evaporation rates albeit not the soil moisture profile assouline et al 2013 however recent publications have shown that this approach leads to wrong evaporation rates estimates especially in arid and semi arid conditions fetzer et al 2017 dijkema et al 2017 probably due to the imperfect modelling of the evaporation process in the dsl the ps conceptual model is based on the laboratory observations reviewed in or et al 2013 this conceptual model first predicts the depth of the drying front at the end of the s1 evaporation as dependent on soil material properties then calculates water vapour flow using fick s equation an analytical solution for bare soil evaporation under steady state conditions with a dsl layer in which water can move only by vapour diffusion has been elaborated by sadeghi et al 2012 a limitation of this approach is that it assumes hydrostatic equilibrium above the drying front and stable evaporative conditions neither of these conditions are met in the field moreover several field studies reported water vapour flow larger than estimated by vapour diffusion alone and the cause is still debated webb and ho 1998 zeng et al 2011b assouline et al 2013 the main objectives of this study are to test in a semi arid area with a reported 0 25 m thick dsl the assumption of the da conceptual model that the dsl has a negligible effect on soil evaporation the assumption of the nsre conceptual model that it is possible to predict the soil evaporation rates by modelling a pseudo dsl the ability of the ps conceptual model to explain the observed evaporation rates in the area these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussion sections 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the selected study site is a 2 2 km area with the central point latitude 41 1172 and longitude 6 1471 located within the 80 km2 sardón catchment in salamanca province spain fig 2 the study area is characterized by semi arid climate very sparse vegetation cover and a shallow groundwater the morphology is typical of spanish meseta landscape with gentle hills mean slope of 2 6 with sardón river valley crossing the area in the centre from south to north and ground surface elevation gently rising from the river valley to west and east the average elevation of the area is 790 m a s l the elevation difference between the river and the highest point in the east is 30 m the area experiences large differences in meteorological conditions between winter and summer winters are cold 5 c mean air temperature with frequent mild precipitation 100 mm month 1 while summers are warm and dry 20 c mean air temperature with rare rainfall showers 20 mm month 1 the vegetation in the study area consists of scattered oak trees 7 canopy coverage and sparse annual grasses which are continuously grazed by cattle the sardón study area has already been studied extensively lubczynski and gurwin 2005 setup first groundwater model of the study area lubczynski 2009 lubczynski et al 2011 reyes acosta et al 2012 and reyes acosta and lubczynski 2013 2014 studied the oak trees transpiration using sap flow techniques mahmoudzadeh et al 2012 investigated spatial variability of water table depth with ground penetrating radar francés et al 2014 used various geophysical techniques to develop a new hydrogeological conceptual model of the catchment francés et al 2015 and hassan et al 2014 modelled the groundwater surface interactions and balugani et al 2017 performed a partitioning and sourcing evapotranspiration study with an eddy covariance tower sap flow measurements and hydrus1d modelling the soil in the study area is spatially homogeneous with texture between sandy loam and loamy sand it is formed by weathering of the underlying fractured granite rock extensive soil sampling was conducted in the study area to determine top soil water content soil hydraulic properties soil texture and depth to bedrock double ring infiltrometer tests were used to determine vertical hydraulic conductivity fig 2 2 2 groundwater measurement and modelling the shallow groundwater shows a change of wtd ranging from 0 5 m b g s in the west close to the river to 10 m b g s in the east in the higher terrain fig 2 we installed several piezometers in the western part in the sloping terrain recording wtd every hour while in the eastern part the presence of shallow granite prevented the installation of piezometers however we monitored a deep well further east just outside of the study area the typical yearly changes of the wtd range from the shallowest at the end of spring march april to the deepest at the end of summer october with amplitude of 2 m the spatio temporal water table dynamics for the years 2009 2010 were modelled by francés et al 2015 2 3 micrometeorological measurements an ec tower was installed in the study area to measure the actual evapotranspiration etec every 30 min balugani et al 2017 the 10 m high tower average trees height is 4 5 m was equipped with a cnr1 four components radiometer kipp and zonen delft the netherlands a csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc utah usa a li7500 gas analyzer licor biosciences nebraska usa and a wxt520 multi weather sensor for measurements of wind speed direction air temperature and air humidity vaisala oyj helsinki finland the ec tower was positioned on a gently sloping terrain about 300 m from the river fig 2 additional equipment consisted of two soil heat flux plates hukseflux and 19 temperature sensors placed on a vertical profile from below to above the soil surface used for the assessment of energy balance the data collected for a total duration of 2 years 2009 2010 was then processed with the software alteddy wageningen university and research the netherlands the footprint of the ec tower was calculated using the analytical model by hsieh et al 2000 for the main wind direction with the modification by detto et al 2006 for the inclusion of the lateral dispersion a 2 m high weather station was also available in the area at 100 m from the ec tower which measured continuously wind speed relative humidity air temperature incoming and outgoing solar radiation precipitation and soil heat flux every hour 2 4 calculation of eec to differentiate partition between soil evaporation and tree transpiration the study area was divided into bare soil area and tree canopy area the latter assumed as equal to ground projection of tree canopy area the ec tower footprint shape and position was calculated for each 30 min time interval so that it was known when the tree canopies were measured by the ec tower the tree transpiration was estimated by upscaling sap flow measurements following the methodology proposed by reyes acosta and lubczynski 2013 this allowed the authors to estimate the total tree transpiration 6 of the total evapotranspiration measured by ec tower and to eliminate it from the evapotranspiration dataset obtaining an estimate of bare soil evaporation measured by the ec tower eec additional information on the evapotranspiration partitioning are included in balugani et al 2017 2 5 soil measurements to design and calibrate the nsre conceptual model and investigate the water potentials and temperatures of the dsl we set up three monitoring soil profiles in the study area the profiles were equipped with soil moisture and temperature sensors hydraprobe stevens usa at four depths 25 50 75 and 100 cm b g s and matric potential sensors decagon mps1 usa measuring range 0 to 0 5 mpa at three depths 15 25 and 75 cm b g s due to the very dry conditions of the top soil two polymer tensiometers pots bakker et al 2007 measuring range 0 to 1 6 mpa were also installed both at 15 cm b g s at the two different locations next to two soil moisture profiles all soil measurements were recorded every hour by a campbell cr1000 data logger campbell scientific usa the pots sensors have wider measuring range than most tensiometers and were used to determine the formation and presence of the dsl in conjunction with manual measurements performed with soil ring sampling and a wp4 dew point potentiometer decagon devices usa in the context of this study the dsl is defined as a soil layer with matric potential 1 5 mpa the lowest measurable with the pot sensor moreover when taking the soil samples locations shown in fig 2 we measured soil moisture manually in the soil at different depth using a portable theta probe delta t devices uk these manual measurements were taken in september 2011 a ponding experiment was performed on one of the three soil profiles in order to inverse calibrate the hydrus1d model 3 conceptual models and methods 3 1 testing da conceptual model assumption the main assumptions of the da conceptual model are that 1 even if the evaporation through a dsl is a complex vapour flow phenomenon when averaged over a day it can be calculated as the upward isothermal liquid water flow driven by pressure gradients with negligible effect of gravity 2 the evaporation process affects only the water in the topmost layer above the zero flux plane of the soil brutsaert 2014 the assumption 1 is based on the idea that most processes in a daily evaporation cycle either cancel each other e g thermally driven fluxes zeng et al 2009 night time wetting from below idso et al 1979 or enhance water vapour transport through the dsl to equal the liquid water transport up to the vaporization plane e g atmospheric turbulence ishihara et al 1992 when these processes are taken into account in the dynamic nature of the dsl the water vapour transport through this dry layer is significantly larger than expected when assuming only fick s diffusion as found for example by parlange et al 1998 due to an abundant evidence from field studies reviewed in brutsaert 2014 the dsl effect as an evaporation rate limiting factor is considered relatively small again when averaged over a day and the main factor controlling the evaporation rate is the capillary rise of liquid water to the vaporization plane the assumption 2 is that a zero flux plane exists below the vaporization plane fig 1b at a fixed depth d where capillary and gravity forces acting on liquid water are at equilibrium above the zero flux plane water moves upward due to hydraulic head gradients while below water moves downward by gravity forces daamen et al 1993 jackson et al 1973 khalil et al 2003 payne et al 1990 tsujimura et al 2001 villegas and morris 1990 therefore only water above the depth d evaporates the solution of the linearized richards equation leads to two possible equations one for short term evaporation where e l t 1 decreases with the square root inverse of time t 1 2 and the other for long term evaporation where e decreases following an exponential decay formulation the assumptions for the linearization and solution of the richards equation are that i the initial volumetric water content is uniform throughout the soil profile θ i dimensionless ii as soon as the evaporation process starts the volumetric water content at the soil surface is air dry θ 0 dimensionless iii the zero flux plane depth d l calculated as in equation 9 of brutsaert 2014 is constant the evaporative flux at the surface following brutsaert 2014 is 1 e d e 0 n 1 2 e x p 2 n 1 2 t κ where 2 e 0 2 d θ i θ 0 d 3 κ 4 d 2 π 2 d where e 0 is in l t 1 mm d 1 in this study d is the liquid saturation weighted mean diffusivity of air in soil l2t 1 mm2 d 1 in this study dependent on soil saturation see brutsaert 2014 eq 4 t is time t and κ is the characteristic timescale of soil drying brutsaert 2014 appendix a all defined in eqs 4 6 of brutsaert 2014 for large t the series in equation 1 converges to brutsaert 2014 4 e d e 0 exp t κ while the limiting case for small t is 1 2 d e 0 t 1 2 where d e 0 is the desorptivity defined in eq 12 of brutsaert 2014 we identified all the drying periods after precipitation in summers 2009 and 2010 and split these periods into two subsets a calibration set when a dsl was not yet formed in the soil mid april to july and a validation set when a dsl was reported august september then we used the first subset to calibrate the model i e fit eq 4 and the second to validate the model we are interested in the long term solution eq 4 to calculate the evaporation values for a long drying event after a precipitation when a dsl is usually formed brutsaert 2014 shows a practical method to determine e 0 and κ directly from evaporation data this can be done by fitting a linear function to a semi log plot of evaporation values in time we fitted eq 4 to the semi log plots of evapotranspiration during the drying events of the first half of the dry season calibration to determine e 0 and κ and then we compared the predicted evaporation rates with the measured ones for the validation dataset note that due to the second assumption of this conceptual model the soil moisture below the zero flux plane is not relevant in the evaporation process so the wtd has no impact on the estimated evaporation 3 2 testing nsre conceptual model assumption the main assumption of the nsre conceptual model is that a proper modelling of the liquid phase discontinuity in the dsl is not needed to estimate the evaporation rates from a dry soil the nsre cannot model liquid phase discontinuity in the soil profile phase dijkema et al 2017 with this assumption however it can be used even when such discontinuity is clearly reported in the field assouline et al 2013 the water vapour diffusion is taken into account the dsl is approximated as a pseudo dsl a soil layer where the water vapour diffusion is larger than the liquid water flow even if the liquid water continuity is not lost we applied the nsre conceptual model in the study area by simulating the bare soil evaporation using the hydrus1d numerical model version 4 14 with coupled heat liquid and water vapour flow described in simunek et al 2005 and saito et al 2006 the model simulates the liquid flow of water through a porous media by darcian flow while water vapour is simulated by the diffusion flow only we used the van genuchten 1980 expression for the water retention curve wrc a 1d model was chosen because i the focus was only on the evaporation process ii the model is widely used in the literature for similar studies iii the topographical gradients involved are relatively small hydrus1d has been already shown to be able to model evaporation of water from a soil with a 5 cm thick dsl even with the van genuchten 1980 wrc assouline et al 2013 we used field and laboratory measurements to determine the boundary conditions and the soil hydraulic properties of the hydrus1d model the soil hydraulic properties were estimated by laboratory analysis of the soil samples collected in the area together with the data from the double ring infiltrometer tests conducted at 7 locations these were used as a starting point for inverse calibration using the data of the ponding experiment performed at the end of september 2011 see section 2 2 the micrometeorological measurements collected every 30 min were used as the top model boundary condition the bottom boundary was set as the wtd extracted from the groundwater model of francés et al 2015 for years 2009 and 2010 the hydrus1d model was calibrated using the dataset collected in the three soil monitoring profiles fig 2 balugani et al 2017 the depth of soil profiles was 2 m b g s the temperature at the soil surface was monitored by an infrared radiometer ir100 from campbell scientific and the wtd in piezometers by 3 water level recorders keller dcx 22 switzerland and by manual measurements uniform temperature and soil moisture at field capacity over the whole profile were set as the initial condition of the 2 years simulation the simulation started 2 months before the setup and initialization of the ec tower measurements wtd and meteorological measurements from the 2 m high weather station are available for that period to compare the hydrus1d model evaporation with the ec tower measurements the hydrus1d evaporation was upscaled over the whole bare soil area using maps of wtd obtained from francés et al 2015 and compared to eec using the ec tower footprint calculation for that purpose the study area was divided into pixels of 1 m2 in every pixel representing bare soil the hydrus1d models were run with known wtd obtained from francés et al 2015 in this way we obtained hydrus1d modelled evaporation at 30 minute temporal and 1 m2 spatial resolution we then multiplied these maps of hydrus1d evaporation by the ec tower footprint a probability density map in order to calculate the evaporation modelled by hydrus1d in the footprint sampled by the ec tower we call this hydrus1d simulated footprint evaporation ef this upscaling method is described in more detail in balugani et al 2014 2017 3 3 testing the applicability of the ps conceptual model the ps conceptual model is based on laboratory experiments of soil evaporation where an air dry dsl develops at the beginning of s2 evaporation with z dsl determined by the soil hydraulic properties of the soil the formation of an air dry dsl was observed in numerous laboratory experiments where initially saturated soils were left to evaporate under stable evaporative conditions lehmann et al 2008a 2008b or et al 2013 shokri and salvucci 2011 the saturation conditions as observed in the laboratory studies in the soil profile during s2 evaporation is schematically shown in fig 1a shokri et al 2009 yiotis et al 2003 the soil profile consists of three zones a saturated zone an intermediary unsaturated zone called film region by lehmann et al 2008a 2008b where water moves upward by capillary flow and an upper dsl zone where liquid water continuity is lost and water moves only as vapour lehmann et al 2008a 2008b define the thickness of the intermediary zone by a characteristic length lc which is the height of the hydraulically connected region between the receding drying front the saturated zone and the vaporization plane fig 1a if the evaporation rates are low which is often the case during s2 the liquid phase above the drying front is close to hydrostatic equilibrium in the case of hydrostatic equilibrium the lc can be calculated by linearization of the water retention curve for the soil material fig 1a shokri and salvucci 2011 or et al 2013 which implies that the depth of the drying front at the onset of s2 depends only on the hydraulic properties of the soil we implemented the ps conceptual model based on the theoretical model presented in shokri and salvucci 2011 and or et al 2013 using an approach similar to that of assouline et al 2013 the main elements of the ps conceptual model for s2 evaporation from soil columns are a evaporation rate through a dsl layer is restricted to fick s water vapour diffusion rate so no liquid water flow takes place and b lc determined by the soil material properties only represents the maximum height of continuity in the liquid water above the saturated zone assouline et al 2013 applied that ps conceptual model to calculate the evaporation flow from a lysimeter with a reported air dry soil layer at the top this was done by assuming only fick s diffusion flow for water vapour in the 0 04 m thick top dsl and using soil moisture content and temperature information at the top and bottom of the dsl as boundary conditions to calculate the diffusion we followed the method of assouline et al 2013 the equation for the water vapour diffusion e diff becomes then 5 e diff d soil v δ c v z dsl where d soil v is the diffusion coefficient for water vapour in the soil defined as in millington and quirk 1960 and δ c v is the difference between vapour concentration at the vaporization plane and at the soil surface both quantities d soil v and δ c v are dependent on soil and atmospheric concentrations as detailed in assouline et al 2013 the identification of the initial z dsl as equal to the characteristic length lc is applicable in laboratory conditions and with initially saturated bare soils but it is problematic in field conditions where random precipitation events changing wtd conditions and variable evaporative conditions result in a more complex soil moisture profile when the original concept of lc is taken into account z dsl depends on wtd e g fig 1a as z dsl w t d l c with lc calculated by linearization of the van genuchten wrc this differs from the field observations where a mostly constant z dsl 0 25 m b g s was observed through direct measurements and pot dataloggers section 2 5 over the whole area despite different wtd therefore we implemented two versions of the ps model i the first called evz model incorporating the lc concept with a z dsl dependent on both wtd and lc determined by soil material properties and ii the second called ecz model more representative of field observations with a spatially and temporally constant z dsl 0 25 m over the whole area with a set up similar to the soil profile in fig 1b the ps model was developed to explain stable evaporation in laboratory experiments so its applicability to field studies where evaporative conditions can change dramatically at different time scales can be problematic in shokri and salvucci 2011 the ps conceptual model was tested in laboratory experiments with potential evaporation rates of 10 mm d 1 and initially saturated soil columns of 60 cm height in our study area evaporation rates were 3 mm d 1 during the afternoon the wtd was 10 m b g s in the higher elevated parts of the catchment and changes in evaporative conditions between day and night were large ranging from 20 mm d 1 during a day to condensation during a night fick s diffusion flow was calculated as in assouline et al 2013 knowing the air relative humidity the soil relative humidity the temperature at the vaporization plane and using millington and quirk 1960 for the diffusion coefficient in order to meet the assumptions and to apply the ps conceptual model in our study we limited the analysis to afternoon periods of the day when the evaporative conditions were the most stable we used three criteria to select assessment days from the available time series i a dsl was observed by the pot measurements ii withered grasses occurred in the whole area i e only bare soil present iii no precipitation was recorded in the preceding week and in analysed days the decision to calculate the bare soil evaporation only during the afternoon from 14 00 to 19 00 local time appr 13 00 18 00 solar time was taken to exclude the possible evaporation of condensation water in the dsl in the morning and because the temperature gradient in the soil the air temperature the relative humidity and the net radiation did not change much during that period of the day in this way the calculations were performed for relatively stable evaporative conditions when the presence and dryness of the dsl was confirmed and the soil moisture profile below the vaporization plane was relatively close to equilibrium the analysis for the ps conceptual model was carried out for the following days 11 august and 26 september of 2009 29 june 13 and 14 july 21 august and 26 september of 2010 3 4 comparison of the three conceptual models we evaluated the three conceptual models based on their ability to estimate the eec measurements the three conceptual models estimate soil evaporation at different time frames i the da conceptual model estimates the daily cumulative evaporation ii the nsre estimates the evaporation rate for each time step in this case every 30 min iii the ps model estimates the soil evaporation every hour during the stable conditions period of the day 14 00 to 19 00 local time see section 3 3 the eec measurements are taken every 30 min we compared the daily values of evaporation measured by the ec tower with those estimated by the da and by the nsre conceptual models by integrating the eec and nsre evaporation over a day then we compared the ps evaporation estimates with the eec and nsre evaporation for the same period of the day finally we calculated the cumulative water vapour diffusion through the dsl over a whole day to obtain daily values however this is a stretch of the ps model assumptions and it is possible that water transport processes are missed in doing so 4 results 4 1 field measurements the results of the ec measuring campaign together with the corresponding rainfall data are presented in fig 4 the acquired data show that the year 2009 300 mm y 1 early 2009 not shown was much drier than 2010 700 mm y 1 consequently water table was deeper and soil moisture was lower at the beginning of the dry season in 2009 than in the same period of 2010 during the wet winter of 2009 2010 with low potential evapotranspiration and frequent rain events the eec did not show drying trends but increased steadily until april mid spring after april weather conditions started to change with fewer rain events every 2 weeks and higher potential evaporation and some drying spells appeared marked by daily decreases of eec between one precipitation event and another the eec was the largest at the beginning of the dry season of the wetter year 2010 3 5 mm d 1 in june 2010 when pet and soil moisture were high and then steadily declined throughout the dry season down to 2 mm d 1 in september 2010 the lowest eec 1 mm d 1 were recorded at the end of the dry season in the drier year 2009 the eec in june 2010 was three times larger than in september 2009 for more details see balugani et al 2017 the eec magnitude in the study area as analysed by different ec tower footprint orientations shows no eec dependence on wind direction during the dry season despite large differences in wtd ranging from 0 5 m b g s along sardón valley to 10 m at the eastern side of the study area see appendix a this is to be expected when a dsl develops in the whole area or et al 2013 and neriah et al 2014 show that s2 rates are very similar even if boundary conditions vary during the dry season summer i the water in the river fig 2 stops flowing and the river itself breaks up into many elongated ponds hydraulically linked with groundwater fig 3 ii the grasses wither and are eaten by the cattle fig 3 and iii a dsl enhanced by the large vapour pressure deficit vpd and transpiration of grasses quickly forms up to a depth exceeding the root depth of the grass synoptic weather measurements taken at 2 m height fig 2 show that the relative humidity drops below 20 during a day in dry season while the air temperature may vary from 12 c during night to 37 c during the day the soil surface temperature ranges from 8 to 50 c and the precipitation events are short and rare the pot measurements fig 5 the direct observation during the soil sampling and the presence of withered grass prove that a dsl 0 25 m thick was present in the investigated area during most of the drying season particularly after grass senescence may to the first heavy precipitation events around mid september 4 2 testing da conceptual model assumption the da model calibrated using the drying events from the first half of the dry summer 2010 shows a consistent error when validated on the drying events from the second half of the dry summer not shown we first identified all the drying events in the dataset beginning from the last day of rain and recording duration in days and cumulative daily eec until the next rain then looking at soil moisture data we divided it into two subsets the drying events relative to moister soils beginning of the dry summer may june 2010 and drying events relative to soils with a dsl end of summer july september 2009 and 2010 fig 6 we used the first subset to calibrate the da model by linear regression of ln e ec against duration t days in this way we obtained the two parameters e 0 2 88 mm d 1 and κ 26 9 days with a r2 0 76 rmse 0 36 mm d 1 however when applied to the validation dataset the da model predicted daily evaporation rates with a rmse 1 04 mm d 1 the consistent error in the evaporation rate predictions is due to the fact that the drying events in the three periods analysed fig 6 are described by significantly different sets of e 0 and κ parameters looking at the semilog plot in fig 6 it seems reasonable to infer that the calibration dataset and the validation dataset have different sets of parameters for eq 4 this means that the linear model fitted to the calibration data is significantly different from the linear model fitted to the validation dataset to test this hypothesis we i divided the validation dataset further into the second half of summer 2009 and the second half of summer 2010 ii fitted a linear model to each of the three subsets second half of dry summer 2009 first half of dry summer 2010 and second half of dry summer 2010 referred from here on as sh2009 fh2010 and sh2010 iii tested the hypothesis that the linear models are the same with an anova test the test showed that all the linear models are significantly different with very low p values for the comparisons between sh2009 and fh2010 model and sh2010 and fh2010 models and p 0 028 for the comparison between sh2009 and sh2010 models the e 0 and κ parameters for the models fitted to the subsets are respectively 0 64 mm d 1 and 17 0 days for the sh2009 model and 1 81 mm d 1 and 14 7 days for the sh2010 model 4 3 testing nsre conceptual model assumption the evaporation estimated by hydrus1d for the ec tower footprint ef differs from the eec in daily averages fig 7 balugani et al 2017 and in 30 minute estimates fig 7 these differences are mainly due to the wind dependent footprint position influencing hydrus1d estimates as explained in section 2 3 hydrus1d modelled the formation of a very thin pseudo dsl 1 3 cm thick only during the driest period the hydrus1d estimates for the daily evaporation rates are presented and discussed in detail in balugani et al 2017 here it is important to note that although during wet periods autumn to mid spring ef is a good estimate of eec balugani et al 2017 during late spring and dry season ef is larger than eec right after a precipitation event later on ef drops quickly to nearly steady state while the eec shows a continuous slow decline fig 7 in balugani et al 2017 ef strongly depends on the footprint position it predicts high ef rates for shallow water tables close to the sardón river wtd 0 5 2 m b g s and low for the higher terrain where wtd is deeper 7 10 m b g s eec instead shows no dependence on the wind speed and wind direction dependent footprint position see section 3 1 and appendix a so there is no significant difference in eec between the river valley and the higher terrain footprints therefore the error of the evaporation prediction from hydrus1d is related to the wtd and therefore to the footprint position as affected by wind direction the absolute and relative errors in the north east south and west quadrants are respectively 0 01 mm d 1 0 21 0 05 mm d 1 1 00 0 008 mm d 1 0 16 and 0 11 mm d 1 2 20 where the absolute error is ef eec and the relative error is the ratio of the absolute error to the average eec fig 8 shows the absolute error depending on wind direction ec footprint position when the results are averaged for the whole area the relative error becomes 1 16 mm d 1 4 4 testing the applicability of the ps conceptual model the evaporation fluxes calculated applying the pore scale conceptual model with a constant zdsl ecz and with a variable zdsl evz calculated as zdsl w t d l c during the stable conditions period and for the whole day are reported in table 2 ecz calculated for the stable part of the day show the same order of magnitude as the eec measurements however the relative error e cz e ec e ec fluctuates between 889 and 6 average 1 19 with the highest relative error reported in augusts of both years evz has the same order of magnitude as ecz but it tends to underestimate eec with an average relative error of 0 82 the daily values of ecz and evz have also the same order of magnitude of the daily eec with an average associated relative error of 0 85 and 0 91 respectively the daily estimates of evz always underestimate the measured eec 4 5 comparison of the three conceptual models the conceptual model with the lowest overall relative error is the nsre model for the whole period dry summers 2009 2010 and for the daily values however the pore scale model has the lowest relative error during the stable conditions period the average relative error for the daily average model for the validation period dry summer 2010 is 1 44 the average relative error for the same period for the nsre model is 0 53 the average relative error for the daily values of the pore scale models are 0 85 and 0 91 for the ecz and evz respectively the average relative error for the same period for the nsre model is 0 67 the average relative error for the stable conditions period of the pore scale models are 1 19 and 0 82 for the ecz and evz respectively the average relative error for the same period for the nsre model is 2 3 5 discussion 5 1 testing daily average conceptual model assumption the differences in e 0 between the three daily average fitted models 2 88 mm d 1 0 64 mm d 1 and 1 81 mm d 1 for fh2010 sh2009 and sh2010 models respectively are probably due to the presence of a dsl eq 2 shows that e 0 depends on two things the initial soil saturation from soil surface to depth d and the soil diffusivity itself dependent on soil saturation the assumption of a quick redistribution of infiltrated water after a precipitation event can be invalid when a dsl is present in the topsoil if the precipitation event is relatively short it infiltrates only the first centimetres of soil and then evaporates completely with no effect on the lower dry topsoil as in sun et al 2016in table 1 a typical dry summer rain event in the sardón study area 5 18 mm in 1 h infiltrates only the first centimetres of soil with no effect on soil dryness at a depth of 15 cm see fig 5 this means that the assumption of initially homogeneous soil moisture brutsaert 2014 after a precipitation event is not correct whenever the depth of water infiltration from such event is smaller than zdsl typically 5 cm this behaviour have been reported in other arid and semi arid areas see the precipitation events in zeng et al 2011a 2011b and sun et al 2016 table 1 and confirms the finding by wang 2015 table 1 the different values for the characteristic timescale of soil drying κ 26 9 17 0 and 14 7 days for fh2010 sh2009 and sh2010 models respectively show that this parameter is also affected by the dryness of the system κ depends on the depth of the zero flux plane and on the soil diffusivity eq 3 as seen before the fact that the soil diffusivity depends itself on soil moisture saturation is problematic whenever a dsl is present in the topsoil moreover neriah et al 2014 table 1 reported that the effect of temperature on the soil material hydraulic properties has a significant effect on the transition between s1 and s2 especially on lc which decreases linearly with temperature lc and d depth of the zero flux plane are similar as both depend on the balance between the capillary viscous and gravity forces so potentially d is also affected by soil temperature during s2 finally using satellite data of soil moisture nasa smap for the whole earth mccoll et al 2017 showed recently that κ depends on climatic conditions in fact κ decreases not only due to an increase in soil sand fraction but also with an increase in the aridity index 5 2 testing nsre conceptual model assumption the proper way to use the richards equation to model water transport in dry soils is a controversial topic numerous field studies showed that in dry soil field conditions water vapour diffusion alone cannot explain the observed evaporation rates usually larger than the predicted ones to model such water transport different approaches have been proposed the inclusion of an enhancement factor philip and de vries 1957 analysed in webb and ho 1998 the effects of air advection in the soil rose 1968a 1968b zeng et al 2011a the night time condensation of water in the dsl wang 2015 table 1 the daily cycle of soil water redistribution idso et al 1979 the effects of atmospheric turbulence on the first cm of soil ishihara et al 1992 the proper simulation of the soil water distributed as thin films covering the soil grains tuller and or 2001 however there is no agreement yet on which of these approaches is the right one even the assumption that an approximation of the dsl is enough to estimate soil evaporation rates is problematic and different levels of approximation of the dsl conditions can be found in literature assouline et al 2013 table 1 obtained good evaporation estimates using the standard van genuchten 1980 wrc for zdsl between 1 and 5 cm sakai et al 2009 used a modified wrc for low water contents fayer and simmons 1995 for zdsl 3 cm sakai et al 2011 table 1 dijkema et al 2017 table 1 pointed out that the best option is to enable liquid phase discontinuities in the soil profile so they used the bimodal durner wrc durner 1994 with hydrus1d to model a lysimeter experiment in las vegas nv usa there was no direct observation of an air dry dsl but the measurements showed very dry soil conditions from soil surface to a depth of 0 25 m interestingly dijkema et al 2017 showed that the model was not able to simulate the very low soil moisture in the topsoil fig 6 of that article and had trouble simulating evaporation in drying conditions with a dry soil surface the differences between ef and eec fig 8 are due to the difficulty of the nsre conceptual model to properly approximate the effects of a dsl as a consequence the ef estimates are reliable only when a dsl is absent i e in the wet seasons but are unreliable in dry seasons when the dsl thickness is substantial the presence of a dsl in an area such as observed in this study would limit the ef rates even with a shallow water table making the ef rates almost independent from wtd the fact that ef is smaller than eec in higher terrain figs 7 8 between 50 and 100 cannot be due to the hydrus1d difficulty in simulating a dsl in fact the proper simulation of a diffusion only layer would result in even smaller ef rates a possible explanation for the eec ef in higher terrain is beyond the scope of this study and it is discussed in section 5 5 5 3 testing the applicability of the pore scale conceptual model the main reason for the difference between ecz and evz values is in the calculation of the distance the water vapour must travel from the vaporization plane to the soil surface i e zdsl the two implementations of the pore scale conceptual model show completely different values and patterns among each other showing the importance of the definition of zdsl in determining the calculation of the vapour fluxes in the ecz implementation a constant zdsl results in evaporation rates dependent only on evaporative conditions in the case of evz instead the evaporation rates depend mostly on changes in wtd these two different patterns remain the same in the calculation of the daily values from here on only the calculation for the stable conditions period is discussed the results for the daily calculations are discussed in section 5 4 a spatially constant zdsl is to be expected in sardón study area during summer due to spatially homogeneous soil properties and the presence of grass that depletes the soil water in the root zone up to wilting point before senesce at the beginning of the dry season the ecz implementation is therefore even if not perfect a better representation of the conditions observed in the field than the evz method as it assumes a spatially constant dsl thickness around the ec tower as corroborated by field observations sections 2 5 and 3 3 ecz shows a different behaviour than eec it changes depending mostly on the temperature at the bottom of the dsl which has the highest daily variation between mid august to mid september see support material the ecz depends only on the difference in water vapour concentration between the soil surface and the bottom of the dsl the water vapour concentration at the soil surface due to very high temperatures and low relative humidity during the day as considered in this analysis is usually very low and does not change much the water vapour concentration at the bottom of the dsl instead given that the soil moisture content at that depth is mostly constant varies with soil temperature therefore a change in soil temperature at the bottom boundary of the dsl 0 25 m b g s can result in a change of ecz of an order of magnitude ecz shows larger negative relative errors in september of both years due to a combination of relatively low air temperature 21 c and high relative humidity 46 resulting in a ecz lower than the measured eec the reason for the overestimation of ecz in august instead is not apparent in this study defining the zdsl w t d l c resulted in very thick dsls for the evz calculations so thick that the water vapour flow through them was one to two order of magnitude smaller than the eec the lc calculated by linearization of the van genuchten retention curve based on the field measured soil material properties is lc 0 25 m this means that in the evz method the dsl thickness can go from 0 25 m in the river valley where water table is 0 5 m b g s to 9 75 m in the higher terrain where wtd reaches 10 m b g s the evz rates are inversely proportional to dsl thickness so to wtd this means that the assumption of zdsl w t d l c is not valid at least in the case studied where the eec shows no clear relation to wtd this was expected as the definition of lc is based on controlled experiments with initially saturated soil columns which continuously and homogeneously dries over constant evaporative conditions in the field the soil is exposed to a variety of evaporative conditions presence of grass and cyclical rewetting due to precipitation events 5 4 comparison of the three conceptual models the two main sources of errors in the soil evaporation estimates when applying the three conceptual models are i how soil evaporation is related to wtd and ii how the changes in soil moisture content of the topsoil in s2 evaporation are modelled the performances of the conceptual models in predicting evaporation rates in this study are mainly related to how sensitive they are to wtd while the eec measurements show little relationship with wtd or wind direction appendix a note that the effects of topography on ec measurements are discussed in appendix b whereas the quality of the etec measurements in appendix c it appears that the best predicting conceptual models are those in which the sensitivity of evaporation to wtd is small at least at the same zdsl conditions these are the da conceptual model and the ecz implementation of the ps conceptual model however the rigidity of their dsl related assumptions is problematic in semi arid areas due to the high inter and intra annual variation in atmospheric conditions wet and dry years wet and dry seasons the main source of error in the hydrus1d estimates of evaporation comes from the wrc used to model the soil hydraulic properties the wrc has an effect on both the properties of the developed pseudo dsl residual water content soil vapour diffusion coefficient zdsl and on the relation between evaporation rates and wtd this is especially true for sandy materials which have a steeper wrc resulting in larger matric potential gradients in the soil profile the relative error of the hydrus1d model is low when averaged over the whole area due to the balance between overestimation of evaporation in shallow wtd conditions and underestimation in deep wtd conditions the mean root square relative error is in fact three times the evaporation estimates and fig 7 shows how different the nsre evaporation estimates can be with respect to eec the pore scale conceptual model when applied to the stable conditions period shows low relative errors for the ecz implementation however the relative errors are much larger when the model is applied to a whole day due to the obvious limitations related to unstable evaporative conditions throughout a day this makes the pore scale conceptual model impractical for field studies especially in semi arid areas where evaporative conditions change widely within a day and within a year for example in the sardón study area only 16 of the total precipitation takes place during the dry summer while the pet is 10 times larger during summer than during winter also soil surface temperature and relative humidity in the dry summer can change from 8 c and 100 during the early morning to 50 c and 20 during the afternoon brutsaert 2014 table 1 disregards wtd in his daily average conceptual model for evaporation in dry conditions as a consequence of the assumption that the evaporation process affects only water above a zero flux plane the latter according to literature remains in the first few tens of cm of soil the da conceptual model also allows another interesting observation the effect of the dsl on the evaporation process seems related to the history and the conditions of a specific dry spell these conditions are related to the soil moisture content in the soil at the beginning of the dry spell considered to the strength of the evaporative conditions and to the presence of grasses that quickly deplete the soil moisture from a certain soil layer a possible indicator of the history of the system is the zdsl thickness at the beginning of the drying spell assouline et al 2013 table 1 for example applied the ps and the nsre conceptual models to the lysimeter data from their study and found that the 4 cm thick dsl had a negligible effect on the evaporation rates similarly wang 2015 table 1 shows that in semi arid and arid conditions and with sandy soils the effects of a dsl on the soil evaporation become large when zdsl 5 cm therefore it is important to find a way to quantify the dryness of a system for example through the dsl thickness which largely constrains the evaporation process 5 5 potential causes of ef eec in elevated terrain with deep water table according to shah et al 2007 for the soil material considered in this study the extinction depth the wtd at which evaporation by liquid flow ceases is 4 75 m with the water table deeper than 4 75 m and sandy loam soil material the hydrus1d ef was very low 0 2 mm d 1 in contrast to eec that was large 2 mm d 1 fig 7b a number of possible processes not included in hydrus1d might be relevant resulting in underestimation of ef from a wtd 4 75 m these processes could be mechanical dispersion air advection in the dry unsaturated zone natural convection in a sloping dry unsaturated zone preferential evaporation flow abrupt pressure and temperature changes because of strong eddies formation on the soil surface a constitutive liquid hydraulic conductivity function which is incorrect in dry conditions first the mechanical dispersion process of water vapour in the unsaturated zone has been studied by grifoll et al 2005 who recognized grifoll 2011 that the dispersivity mechanism can be relevant only in case of a stefan flow flow induced by the production or removal of a chemical species at a certain interface the lack of stefan flow in the case studied means that the process of mechanical dispersion is likely not relevant in our case second the air advection has been already analysed by liu et al 2005 for highland marshes and zeng et al 2011a for drier conditions when the gas pressure gradients in the unsaturated zone are strong enough and the pores filled with gas are well connected as in the case of a dry unsaturated zone then the gas can move by advection flow zeng et al 2011a found that advection of air does play a role albeit small in the evaporation process for a very dry top unsaturated zone the presence of a dry unsaturated zone layer where water moves only as water vapour by advection flow may explain a rate of soil evaporation independent of wtd as measured by the ec tower with a deep wtd the advection flow could result in direct water vapour transport from the saturated zone to the soil surface this process not included in hydrus1d can be present in our case and could be a cause of the hydrus1d underestimation of ef third natural convection according to schery and petschek 1983 usually does not take place in the unsaturated zone it occurs when the rayleigh dimensionless number associated to the free convection flow exceeds a critical value i e when the heat transfer for the fluid switches from conduction to convection the rayleigh number calculated for very permeable materials high temperature gradients and big length scales is below the critical value the loss of air s heat in the unsaturated zone by conduction is faster than by convection to colder areas of the profile rose and guo 1995 however show how taking into account temperature inversion in a sloping soil profile results in a higher rayleigh number potentially leading to convection processes during the night because of the inverse temperature gradient in the soil the convection of air in sloping porous material was also observed by antoine et al 2009 it is important to note that even if convection of air in sloping soil took place during night this would not be measured by the ec method which does not work in such stable conditions fisher et al 2007 when flux occurs below the measurement height and does not reach the sensor this means that although this process might be relevant for the calculation of the overall modelling of evaporation from bare soil it cannot be the cause of the mismatch between the evaporation calculated by hydrus1d and the ec tower measurements as both did not account for it fourth papafotiou et al 2010 studied the effect of preferential evaporation patterns in porous material with both numerical modelling and laboratory experiments preferential evaporation in soils originates from heterogeneities in the soil texture structure and compaction the soil in the study area is fairly homogeneous in texture and structure the only possible source of heterogeneity could have been originated by animal trampling resulting in soil compaction this was not observed in the field as animals graze everywhere with some preference for the area close to the river fifth the bare soil as already explained experiences large diurnal changes in temperature with very high temperatures in the afternoon these conditions lead to the formation of air turbulences in the form of eddies and even dust devils observed resulting in abrupt changes in the pressure and temperature at the soil surface which can trigger advective flows of vapour in the dry unsaturated zone this possibility was studied for gas exchanges between unsaturated zone and atmosphere in the work by poulsen 2006 they concluded that higher amplitudes and frequencies of pressure variations result in higher values of diffusion dispersion coefficients and also in a larger e contribution maier et al 2011 arrived at a similar conclusion for forest soils this process is not accounted for in hydrus1d but it would influence the eec measurements therefore it could contribute to the mismatch between the hydrus1d ef and eec sixth the majority of the constitutive relationships for the hydraulic properties of the soil materials also in hydrus1d are optimized for relatively wet conditions therefore the same properties may be poorly characterized in the very dry conditions observed in the top unsaturated zone during this study this problem cannot be eliminated a priori as a possible cause of the hydrus1d simulation errors the amount of possibly unaccounted processes the amount of variables playing a role in the field conditions and the small magnitudes of the fluxes in summertime semi arid and arid conditions make it difficult to point out the cause of the mismatch between ef and eec the only way to identify the unaccounted process or processes is to systematically analyse them using both laboratory and field experiments this can be done dividing the possible suspects into categories depending on the possibility to eliminate them the advection flow cannot be eliminated only reduced the turbulence is related to specific conditions at the soil surface and can be controlled in laboratory the other factors depend on soil materials and geometry and can be controlled in the field designing a series of lab and field experiments slowly adding complexity at each step should allow to find which is the process or processes overlooked in the hydrus1d assessment of groundwater evaporation in very dry conditions with relatively deep water table with well developed dsl 6 conclusions the present study tested the performance of three different conceptual models the daily average the nsre and the pore scale for modelling soil evaporation in the presence of a dsl in a semi arid area during two dry seasons 2009 drier and 2010 wetter the results suggest that among the three conceptual models tested the daily average conceptual model is the most practical for field conditions as it is designed based on field studies with few input data available however its assumption of negligible dsl effect on the evaporation process seems not appropriate for very dry conditions when the dsl thickness increases in time and the initial soil moisture profile after a precipitation event is not uniform under such conditions the assumption of area specific e 0 and κ parameters is problematic the performance of this conceptual model therefore needs to be corrected for the history of the drying area related to soil moisture contents and evaporative conditions the nsre conceptual model represented by hydrus1d had the lowest overall relative error when averaged over the whole area and in the whole period however this masks the overestimation of evaporation rates during drying periods especially for shallow water tables and underestimation of evaporation rates from deep water table conditions also it could not properly simulate a dsl which confirms the findings of assouline et al 2013 and dijkema et al 2017 this seems not to affect seriously the evaporation flux calculation when the dsl is thin e g 3 cm as in assouline et al 2013 even if the soil moisture profile simulated departs considerably from the observed one however when the topsoil is drier the simulation of drying events is more problematic dijkema et al 2017 in this study where the dsl thickness is 0 25 m the hydrus1d model using the van genuchten soil moisture water pressure relationship could not properly simulate the evaporation rates the pore scale conceptual model modified in order to adapt it to field conditions performed well in the prediction of evaporative rates both the evz and ecz method at least for the part of the day with more stable evaporative conditions mid day to late afternoon the model shows a strong dependence on temperature at the bottom of the dsl which is not evident in the eec dataset due to the assumption of stable evaporative conditions the model was not able to properly estimate the daily evaporation rates because of this the model is no applicable to field conditions this study indicates possible future directions for the improvement of modelling of soil evaporation in very dry conditions i e arid and semi arid areas during dry season when a dsl affects evaporation it is still unclear for example when exactly a dsl starts to affect the evaporation process in field conditions this could depend on the thickness of the dsl which in turn depends on soil characteristics and duration of the drying event and or on the drying history of the system another research direction could be to adapt the pore scale model to arid and semi arid field conditions this would help understanding the physical processes influencing the movement of water in a dsl under field conditions e g atmospheric turbulence variation in the temperature pressure and vapour concentration gradients acknowledgments this research was funded by the international institute for geo information science and earth observation itc faculty of twente university the netherlands we thank the four anonymous reviewers and the journal of hydrology editorial team tim r mcvicar yuting yang and corrado corradini for the constructive and helpful comments appendix a etec dependence on wind direction we tested the hypothesis that there is a relation between wind direction and etec magnitude and more specifically that in our study area the higher etec is associated with the wind from the western side with shallow wtd than the wind from the eastern side where wtd is deeper before analysing etec directly we analysed the directionality of the surface roughness which influences etec readings in order to do so we first analysed roughness length z 0 in all cardinal directions around the flux tower from the measurements of the wind speed and friction velocity of the sonic anemometer installed at 10 m height then analysed the changes of roughness length for momentum z 0 m with respect to wind direction following van der tol et al 2003 we grouped the ec data into classes of wind direction of 30 rejecting data with an absolute difference between wind direction measured by csat3 and the vaisala 25 for each of these 30 classes of wind direction z 0 m was calculated from friction velocity u and wind speed u both estimated from measurements of the 3d sonic anemometer a logarithmic wind profile was assumed as a1 u u k k ln z z 0 m ψ m where k k 0 41 is von kármán constant and ψ m is a correction for stability we used the equation of paulson 1970 for stable and unstable conditions to calculate ψ m per half hour the parameter z 0 m was estimated by minimizing the root square difference between measured and modeled eq a 1 wind speed the roughness length for heat z 0 h can only be calculated if a surface temperature is defined we used the radiometrically derived surface temperature t rad calculated from the longwave radiation measured at the station to estimate the roughness length for heat in a similar way to the roughness length for momentum 2a t air t rad t k k ln z z 0 h ψ h where t h ρ air c p u h is sensible heat flux derived from the sonic anemometer data directly ρ air is the specific mass of the air kg m 3 c p the heat capacity j kg t air the air temperature measured at the station the parameter z 0 h was estimated by minimizing the root square difference between measured and modelled t rad this resulted in a value of z 0 h as low as 2 4 10 4 m similar values have been reported before in dry sparsely vegetated areas verhoef et al 1997 gökmen et al 2012 ψ h is calculated i for unstable conditions with the formulation of paulson 1970 ii considered zero for stable and neutral conditions see also eq b13 in van der tol et al 2003 we found that the ratio of friction velocity over wind speed and thus z 0 m was rather constant over cardinal directions except for the z 0 m of 0 9 m in north east direction vs 0 2 m in other directions the different values in the north and east directions was due to the position of the sonic anemometer with the tower and the gas analyser blocking the wind coming from north east and not due to differences in soil roughness therefore we decided to assign a constant value to z 0 m 0 2 m for all directions i e we found no directionality for the soil roughness to analyse the directionality of the evapotranspiration measured by the eddy covariance tower we could not use the actual values of etec given wind direction because both wind and etec might have been related to other climatic processes e g if wind after rainfall is frequently coming from the west then the west will show a higher evapotranspiration value which does not strictly depend on wtd difference with respect to the eastern part indeed the wind direction was unevenly distributed both over the daytime and the seasons which means that simply correlating wind direction and etec would be meaningless however both diurnal and seasonal periodicity can be removed by normalizing etec with the priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration et 0 as 3a et norm et ec et 0 where et norm is the normalised evapotranspiration etec is the evapotranspiration measured by the ec tower with a frequency of 30 min et 0 is the potential evapotranspiration calculated with priestley taylor also with the same synchronized frequency of 30 min the analysis of the et norm dependence upon wind direction is presented in fig 9 a together with associated standard error bars for the year 2010 et norm does not show any significant relation to wind direction for the year 2009 et norm shows some variation depending on wind direction but the low amount of data results in wide error bars the higher et norm measured in year 2009 are recorded when wind is coming from the higher terrain area where water table is deep wind direction 30 120 north east therefore no clear relationships between et norm and wind direction is apparent appendix b etec dependence on topography a question arises regarding the validity of the etec measurements in a terrain not completely flat as with the gentle hills in sardón study area for clarity we separate the discussion of the effects of the complexity of the terrain upon the accuracy of the etec measurements into two parts i the effects on the wind field and the fluxes and ii the suitability of the measurement technique raupach and finnigan 1997 reviewed topographical effects on the meteorology they distinguished direct effects of topography on irradiance and the wind field from indirect effects related to variation in soil and vegetation that correlate with topography with a wind tunnel experiment they showed that hills modify the direction of the wind creating revers flow and wakes in a way that affects the ec measurements resulting in changes in the order of 40 of the stanton number raupach and finnigan 1997 near the hill top in our study area the effect of the rugged terrain on wind could have some effects on the representativeness of the measurements and the validity of the footprint model however the obstacles in our study area are very gentle as their height to length ratio of 1 50 is five times lower than the lower of the two hills studied by raupach and finnigan 1997 moreover the eddy covariance tower is not located near the top or the foot of a hill for these reasons we do not expect significant direct effects of the topography on the turbulence the topography clearly affects the soils and the vegetation in our dry study area there is a large contrast in surface temperature and in roughness between the patches of trees and bare soil however the footprint model holds for a surface with a spatially constant roughness length as in our case see appendix a although it has not been designed for sparse vegetation areas more complicated footprint models are not necessarily better unless sufficient data are available for parameterization and validation in our study we know that the wind direction is correct and we assessed the sensitivity of the footprint shape upon the surface roughness in order to get an idea of the uncertainty of the footprint in order to test whether the rugged terrain and the distribution of the trees affected the wind field we analysed the tilt of the average wind field i e the roll and pitch of the wind vector from different directions this analysis was carried out with the software alteddy version 3 71 as well as manually using matlab for a 10 days in row period of 2010 when the etec was about 2 mm d 1 it appeared that depending on the wind direction there was a mild roll of between 0 and 5 and a pitch between 0 and 6 of the wind vector the tilt of the wind field was not larger than at other flux sites we carried out several other tests on the ec data to check the suitability of the measurement technique for our study area conditions a potential problem was the strong buoyancy in the area that might cause strong vertical winds van der molen et al 2004 evaluated the effect of the angle of attack on the measurement accuracy of the wind speed for two brands of sonic anemometers both similar in design to the one used by us and found a correction method for it we followed that method and plotted on a histogram the ratio of the vertical and the horizontal wind speed not shown and found that the absolute value of this ratio was smaller than 0 5 in 95 4 of the cases indicating that correction for angle attack was not necessary appendix c etec measurements quality and related error out of the four components of the energy balance the etec probably had the largest relative error as being the smallest of the fluxes during the dry period and as derived from two sensors a sonic anemometer and a gas analyser the values of etec were between 0 04 mm d 1 and 4 00 mm d 1 the value of 0 04 mm d 1 was extremely low and only occurred for 12 22 26 and 28 september 2009 it is widely accepted that the error in etec is around 20 e g goulden et al 1996 but it can be even higher when the gas fluxes are low as in very dry conditions however that accuracy can be improved by comparing etec to water balance estimates as found by scott 2010 for savannah landscape we found that in the very dry periods the vapour pressure deficit was 10 hpa and the standard deviation of the 10 hz vapour pressure measurements was about half of the one during the wet period because the fluctuations in vapour pressure and vertical wind speed are of the same order of magnitude in both the wet and dry season we assume that the error associated with the etec measurements is also similar in the wet and the dry season approximately 20 as such there is no reason to assume that the accuracy of the measurements of gas concentrations and of wind speed changed between dry and wet period in absolute sense physical limitations of the instruments such as the separation of the responses of the anemometer and of the gas analyser the size of the eddies that can be sampled and the terrain effects non horizontal mean wind at the tower height play a role in our case we investigated this by means of a sensitivity analysis of alteddy by switching on and off corrections type of axis rotation spectral fitting and deliberately entering a smaller or larger distance between anemometer and gas analyser i e changing the planar fit method which resulted in changes in etec of only a few percent the effects of changing the planar fit method were in absolute sense smaller than in the wet period 0 5 w m 2 in the dry period versus 0 7 w m 2 in a wet period but larger in relative sense appendix d supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016

6898,quantifying the potential influence of climate change on future landslide hazard requires methodologies that allow to properly take into account nonstationarities in the hydro meteorological causes in this paper we provide a methodology for estimating return period of landslide triggering under climate change the methodology capitalizes on the combined use of a stochastic rainfall generator and a hydrological and slope stability model the stochastic rainfall generator takes into account the statistical dependency between rainfall event duration and intensity through copulas the hydrological model is based on an analytical solution of a simplified version of the richards vertical infiltration equation and slope stability is assessed by the infinite slope model the combined model enables to estimate landslide probability through monte carlo simulations climate change is then introduced by perturbing the parameters of the rainfall stochastic generator based on factors of change derived from the comparison of future scenarios and the baseline climate as simulated by regional climate models rcms the monte carlo simulations are conducted sequentially on a future moving time window to derive a yearly series of future landslide triggering probability this series is then used to compute landslide return period by formulas suitable under nonstationary conditions an application to the landslide prone region of the peloritani mountains southern italy is carried out to demonstrate the proposed approach for the application climate change projections of three rcms of the med cordex initiative are used and a preliminary assessment of the impacts of intermediate and high emission representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 is carried out keywords landslides stochastic models climate change monte carlo simulation regional climate models 1 introduction landslides are a natural phenomenon shaping the earth s surface and a hazard globally provoking hundreds of deaths every year sidle and ochiai 2006 froude and petley 2018 landslide processes are typically nonstationary at both intra annual seasonality and inter annual time scales sidle and ochiai 2006 describe most of nonstationary processes of interest in the study of landslides which include reactivation processes land use modifications and climatic changes the latter are expected to modify meteorological conditions and to have significant impacts on landslides and other hydrological hazards ipcc 2014 since the late 1990s an increasing number of papers focused on the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on landslide phenomena based on three distinct approaches gariano and guzzetti 2016 and references therein modeling approaches historical analyses and identification of paleo landslide evidences the first consist in assessing the impacts of climate change on a given phenomenon based on climate projections from global circulation models gcms and derived downscaled climatic products gcms simulate the effects on climate of emission scenarios defined by international programs taylor et al 2012 and better known as representative concentration pathways rcps briefly scenarios in the ensuing text regional climate models rcms provide higher resolution data up to 10 20 km or less as a result of dynamical downscaling of gcm data having a coarser resolution 250 600 km commonly modeling approaches couple these climate model simulations with empirical or physically based models providing triggering conditions as a more or less explicit function of climatic variables mainly precipitation ciabatta et al 2016 rianna et al 2016 gariano et al 2017 alvioli et al 2018 climate change studies led to contrasting conclusions on whether an increase or a decrease should be expected in landslide frequency in the future crozier 2010 coe and godt 2012 the high level of uncertainty is substantially confirmed by ipcc special report of seneviratne et al 2012 which indicates a variable level of confidence for an increase of landslide activity in the future opening an implicit request for further studies notwithstanding an increasing literature focused on the assessment of climate change impacts on landslides there is a lack of studies focusing on the possible changes on landslide return period a widely used metric to express landslide hazard useful in designing mitigation infrastructures borga et al 2002 d odorico et al 2005 rosso et al 2006 simoni et al 2008 salciarini et al 2008 tarolli et al 2011 peres and cancelliere 2016 the need to address this aim derives also from the fact that the concept of return period has been recently revisited to take into account nonstationary processes salas and obeysekera 2014 obeysekera and salas 2016 cancelliere 2017 which change the way return period is estimated because landslide probability varies in time this paper aims at addressing this issue proposing a modeling approach for estimating return period of landslide triggering under a changing climate taking into account the induced nonstationarities in precipitation to this aim we use rcm products within a monte carlo simulation approach peres and cancelliere 2014 peres and cancelliere 2016 the monte carlo simulation scheme is herein based on the combined use of a stochastic rainfall generator and a hydrological and slope stability model a single monte carlo simulation yields an estimate of landslide probability for a given climate by perturbing the stochastic rainfall model based on rcm projections a series of future landslide probabilities can be derived perturbation is here based factor of changes of rainfall event statistical properties kilsby et al 2007 anandhi et al 2011 fatichi et al 2011 maraun et al 2010 teutschbein and seibert 2012 ehret et al 2012 finally return period is computed as a function of the estimated future landslide probability series according to nonstationary formulations provided by salas and obeysekera 2014 the stochastic rainfall generator we devise takes into account of the statistical dependence between rainfall event duration and intensity thanks to a copula approach the hydrological and slope stability model is based on the diffusive infiltration model introduced by iverson 2000 extended to a finite soil depth baum et al 2002 and simplified to the computation of peak pressure head response to rainfall events allowing a more efficient application than other software implementations baum et al 2010 alvioli and baum 2016 that constrain the user to compute the complete response to rainfall time series an application of the methodology is carried out with reference to the peloritani mountains in sicily an area that has experienced several landslides in the recent decades the application exercise allows to test the suitability of the methodology in real world situations the specific results obtained also offer a preliminary assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on landslide activity in this area the application is conduced for three different rcm products of the med cordex initiative so a measure of the spread related to rcm uncertainties is also provided 2 methodology 2 1 return period in a nonstationary context return period can be rigorously defined by introducing random variate y as the time at which a given critical event slope instability in our case occurs for the first time in the stationary case probability of the phenomena is constant in time say equal to p 0 it can be shown that the probability that a critical event occurs for the first time at year y is given by the geometric distribution law mood et al 1974 1 f y 1 p 0 y 1 p 0 y 1 2 thus return period t 0 which can be defined as the mean number of years that will take for the first occurrence of a critical event is given by the well known formula chow et al 1988 2 t 0 e y 1 p 0 in the nonstationary case critical event probability varies in time if we denote as p y that probability at time y it has been shown by salas and obeysekera 2014 that 3 f y p y t 1 y 1 1 p t with y 1 2 thus return period becomes 4 t 0 e y y 1 yf y y 1 yp y t 1 y 1 1 p t this equation can be generalized to compute return period at a given time by introducing an additional time variate ν which is the time at which one desires to estimate return period 5 t ν y 1 yp ν y 1 t 1 y 1 1 p ν t 1 all formulas above require just the estimation of the landslide probability series which is here carried out via monte carlo simulations 2 2 computation of landslide probability in our approach each monte carlo simulation allows to compute landslide probability for a given climate as already mentioned the simulation consist in the combination a stochastic rainfall generator and a physically based model by which a long virtual synthetic series of rainfall and landslide response can be obtained let us denote with m the length of a monte carlo simulation in virtual years provided that m is sufficiently large landslide probability can be estimated frequentistically as 6 p 1 m m 1 m i m where 7 i m 1 if in virtual year m at least a landslide occurred 0 otherwise in the monte carlo modeling we assume that a landslide occurs each time the factor of safety f s for slope stability drops down to 1 here we work under the assumption of an infinite slope for which 8 f s tan ϕ tan δ c ψ d lz t p γ w tan ϕ γ s d lz sin δ cos δ where ϕ is friction angle c is soil cohesion δ is terrain slope γ w 9800 n m3 is the unit weight of water γ s the unit weight of soil d lz is soil depth ψ t p d lz is pressure head at the peak time t p measured from rainfall event start see section 2 4 and at soil depth z d lz this is equivalent to comparing peak pressure head with a critical value ψ cr which is obtained by rearranging the above equation and letting f s 1 9 ψ cr c γ w tan ϕ γ s d lz sin δ cos δ γ w tan ϕ 1 tan ϕ tan δ though more sophisticated and accurate three dimensional slope stability models have been recently proposed lehmann and or 2012 milledge et al 2014 bellugi et al 2015 reid et al 2015 the infinite slope stability analysis remains still reliable for a first stage assessment of landslide triggering hazard baum et al 2010 arnone et al 2011 raia et al 2014 capparelli and versace 2014 pressure head needed to be compared with ψ cr can be estimated from any suitable hydrological model herein we use a model based on the diffusive infiltration model proposed by iverson 2000 extended for a finite soil depth baum et al 2002 and a linear reservoir drainage model that acts within dry intervals peres and cancelliere 2014 as described more in detail in section 2 4 we proceed in a lumped fashion i e model the response of the area of interest by a single set of geomorphological hydrological and geotechnical parameters which are globally representative of slopes subject to landslides in the area of interest to test the suitability of the lumped model in the given region of interest it is checked if it reproduces landslides occurrence dates in the region for the period covered by the observed record see section 3 in this sense this lumped approach is similar to empirical landslide triggering thresholds caine 1980 guzzetti et al 2008 greco et al 2013 peruccacci et al 2017 peres et al 2018 where a single relationship is used to establish whether or not a given rainfall event will trigger landslides in a region here instead of using an empirical relationship we use a lumped approach that has a physically based rationale following recent perspectives on landslide research bogaard and greco 2018 the input to the hydrological model is provided by the stochastic rainfall model which is also able to take into account climatic changes stochastic rainfall generators can be of a very wide degree of complexity and are mostly all suitable to take into account climate change scenarios as simulated by rcms by means of a factor of changes approach fatichi et al 2011 kilsby et al 2007 for our purpose we have devised a specific rainfall event sequences generator based on copulas described more in detail in section 2 3 we just anticipate here that respect to other stochastic models presented in the literature the one we propose here has the advantage to allow parameter adjustment simply from the statistical moments of rainfall characteristics namely event duration t total depth h and the no rain time separating one event from another interarrival time u in a climate change context a control and a future period are distinguished for the control period both the historical rcm simulation and observed data may be available while only the former is for the future climate referred to year ν if m c rcm and m ν rcm are the statistical moments computed from rcm in the control and future period respectively then the factor of change for moment m is given by the ratio 10 f ν m ν rcm m c rcm the factor of change can be used to estimate the future value of the moment m ν by multiplication to the observed moment in the control period m c obs 11 m ν m c obs f ν the moments obtained from eq 11 are then plugged into the method of moments parameter estimators mme by which the corrected parameters of the stochastic model for future periods are obtained in order to apply eqs 10 and 11 the spatial inconsistency between rcm data and observations should be resolved for instance by interpolation to this aim we have interpreted the rcm data as relative to the center of the grid cells thus the interpolation averages the rcm data as a function of the distance of the grid cell centers to the observation point rain gauge this way to proceed preserves the temporal structure of the observed rainfall time series landslide return period for the control period is obtained by monte carlo simulation with the stochastic model calibrated on observed rainfall data and application of eqs 6 7 and 2 rcms provide scenarios for the years 2005 2100 within this period we define on a yearly moving time window sixty one climatic periods thirty years long first period ν 1 corresponds to years 2011 2040 ν 2 to years 2012 2041 and so on until the last period 2061 2100 ν 61 is reached hence for each future scenario landslide probability p ν can be computed ν 1 2 61 this series of probabilities is then plugged in eq 5 to compute the return period sequence for this purpose we assume that for ν 61 p ν p 61 fig 1 summarizes the main steps and features of the proposed methodology 2 3 stochastic point rainfall event generator based on copulas stochastic rainfall point models allow simulation of rainfall time series at a given location salas 1993 the resulting generated rainfall sequences reproduce the statistical features of the observed series which are significant for the problem at hand the main advantage of using a stochastic model is that synthetic series can have a virtually unlimited length allowing to estimate landslide probability based on the frequentist definition see eqs 6 and 7 here we devise a specific point stochastic model for the generation of sequences of rectangular rainfall events with statistical dependence between their total depth h and duration t modeled through copula functions nelsen 2007 the importance to take into account such dependence has been highlighted by different studies e g de michele et al 2003 evin and favre 2008 vernieuwe et al 2015 and it is desirable within landslide modeling given the high number of studies linking the occurrence of this phenomenon to event rainfall duration and mean intensity sidle and ochiai 2006 guzzetti et al 2007 peruccacci et al 2017 specifically the model is structured as follows see fig 2 event duration t and rainfall depth h are generated by a suitable bivariate model to take into account their statistical dependence the bivariate model is built using copula functions that allow almost unconstrained choice of marginal distributions f t and f h of the two variables under investigation rainfall events are separated by dry intervals these intervals are generated according to a suitable continuous probability distribution f u in order to calibrate the model given an observed time series rainfall events have to be isolated with some criterion here a part of the rainfall time series is assumed to be a rainfall event when bounded by zero rain dry periods of at least u min hours long the same procedure is applied to the rcm series as well the choice of u min may depend on the climatic features of the investigated area vessia et al 2014 melillo et al 2015 melillo et al 2018 we then fit marginal distributions to the series of observed rainfall events by using method of moments estimators mme of the distribution parameters mme has the advantage to allow for easy adjustment of the stochastic model parameters since change factors of only few moments of the rcm derived rainfall event series are needed the choice of marginal distributions can be guided by statistical hypothesis testing d agostino and stephens 1986 we apply the factor of changes adjustment for generation of rainfall sequences in the climate change scenarios only to the marginal distributions the h t dependence copula parameters are not adjusted for the scenario periods this has the advantage of model simplicity since otherwise with a changing dependence structure the specific parametric copulas suitable for the observational period may not be valid for the future periods nevertheless changing marginals induce by themselves a modification of the h t bivariate distribution even if analytical goodness of fit tests are available in the literature genest et al 2009 a simple and reliable method to check the suitability of a copula model is to compare the observed pairs with those randomly generated from the fitted copula genest and favre 2007 this approach is followed in several studies e g gyasi agyei and melching 2012 callau poduje and haberlandt 2017 and in this work as well see section 3 2 2 4 hydrological model of infiltration and drainage the hydrological infiltration model we adopt is based on the model presented by iverson 2000 extended to the case of a finite soil depth baum et al 2002 and integrated with a water table recession model to compute the initial conditions at each rainfall event as an implicit function of antecedent rainfall as introduced in our previous work peres and cancelliere 2014 the model which we briefly describe below is partially implemented within the trigrs software from the first version baum et al 2002 to its updates baum et al 2008 alvioli and baum 2016 we have coded in matlab an ad hoc simplified implementation of this model the simplification consists in the direct computation of the peak pressure head response to precipitation events without calculation of the entire pressure head time history which in the case of uniform hyetographs is not necessary to determine whether or not a given event triggers a landslide thus this allows a more efficient application than other implementations because it avoids operations unnecessary for the purpose of this paper that cannot be bypassed if the above cited programs are used the model conceptualizes the hillslope as a single layered permeable strata overlaying a perfectly impermeable bedrock fig 3 as rainfall infiltrates a saturated area develops above the regolith bedrock interface yielding an increase in pressure head which negatively affects slope stability according to eq 8 within this scheme pressure head is maximum at the base of the soil strata which thus coincides with the failure plane hence the aim of the hydrological model is to compute pressure head at the basal boundary z d lz and its local peak occurring at time t p from the beginning of any rainfall event total pressure head ψ i that builds in response at the i th rainfall event is the sum of a transient ψ 1 i and an initial component ψ 0 i 12 ψ i ψ 1 i ψ 0 i the first part is modeled as a function of rainfall duration t and intensity i while the initial pressure head for the i th rainfall event depends on antecedent rainfall events specifically it is taken as function of the dry time interval before the event and the peak total pressure head of the preceding event i 1 the transient response is computed from the simplified form of the richards equation treated by iverson 2000 which basically assumes that with respect to the infiltration process the unsaturated soil has the same hydrological properties of the saturated one tension saturated soil under these hypothesis event pressure head component is given by baum et al 2002 2008 13 ψ 1 d lz t d lz i k s r t p r t p t the response function r x appearing in the above equation is given by a series of integral complementary error functions ierfc 14 r x 2 m 1 ierfc 2 m 1 x where 15 ierfc x 1 π exp x 2 x erfc x in the above equations i and t are respectively rainfall event mean intensity and duration k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity d 0 is the soil saturated diffusivity x is a dummy variate and erfc is the complementary error function abramowitz and stegun 1964 in applying eq 13 two constraints have to be considered first the ratio i k s has to be truncated at 1 if greater since k s represents for the model assumptions the maximum possible value of the vertical infiltration rate second the so called beta line limitation that ψ d lz d lz cos 2 δ applies which is pressure head cannot exceed the value corresponding to an hydrostatic profile with water table located at the ground surface iverson 2000 dimensionless quantities in eq 13 are defined as follows 16 t t t d t t t d t d d lz 2 d d 4 d 0 cos 2 δ the dimensionless peak time t p shown in fig 4 as a function of dimensionless rainfall event duration t can be obtained from numerical investigation of eqs 13 and 14 cf d odorico et al 2005 initial pressure head is here computed by the following equation see peres and cancelliere 2014 17 ψ 0 i ψ p i 1 exp u i τ m where ψ p i 1 is total pressure head at the peak time of t p of preceding event i 1 and u i denotes the dry interval preceding current event i see fig 2 the recession constant τ m is here expressed as a function of a topographic wetness index soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and porosity taken as the difference between saturated and residual soil water contents θ s θ r 18 τ m a b θ s θ r k s sin δ where a b is the specific upslope contributing area i e the ratio between the upslope contributing area a and contour length b a b can be computed according to various flow direction algorithms here the simple d8 method of o callaghan and mark 1984 is used eq 17 is a recursive equation that implicitly links initial pressure head to antecedent rainfall 3 application 3 1 case study region peloritani mountains sicily italy an application of the proposed methodology has been carried out with reference to the peloritani mountains region located in northeastern sicily italy and represented in fig 5 a this highly landslide prone area has experienced several regional shallow landslide events recent episodes are 15 september 2006 25 october 2007 24 september 2009 and 1 october 2009 see pictures in fig 5b e the latter event has caused severe damage and fatalities 37 deaths and thousands of evacuated people and it has been described in several studies aronica et al 2012 peres and cancelliere 2012 2014 de guidi and scudero 2013 lombardo et al 2014 cama et al 2015 schilirò et al 2015 2016 stancanelli et al 2017 representative data for the peloritani mountains are shown in table 1 the use of a single set of soil properties for the peloritani mountains area is an approximation as these vary from point to point the values used here are within the range of those obtained from some surveys in the area and have proven to be among the ones leading to a reasonable reproduction of the spatial distribution of landslides occurred on 1 october 2009 stancanelli et al 2017 spatial distribution and uncertainty of soil characteristics can play a crucial role on the model predictive ability anagnostopoulos et al 2015 but modeling their impact is beyond the scope of this paper for calibration and validation of the stochastic rainfall model in the observational period the hourly rainfall series of fiumedinisi rain gauge has been used location is shown in fig 5a the series covers the period from 5 january 2002 to 23 february 2011 about nine years this period can be considered to be homogeneous to the control period 1971 2000 as several studies have shown the absence of significant trends in rainfall records covering a long period from late 1920s to 2013 for both extreme and daily rainfall bonaccorso et al 2005 arnone et al 2013 bonaccorso and aronica 2016 the following three rcm data sets of daily precipitation from the med cordex

calibrations for statistically homogeneous periods of the year which have been identified based on the mean and standard deviation of monthly rainfall see fig 6 based on the plots the following periods have been considered i january april jfma ii may august mjja and iii september december sond the observed rainfall hourly series has been then pre processed to extract the rainfall events which have been approximated as a constant intensity hyetograph see fig 2 a minimum event separation time interval u min 24 h has been chosen following our previous studies peres and cancelliere 2014 2016 other researchers confirm the suitability of this value as it has been used in determining landslide thresholds in sicily caracciolo et al 2017 and in italy in general brunetti et al 2010 among several tested distributions exponential weibull lognormal and gamma the gamma resulted the most suitable for event duration while a two parameter lognormal was suitable for both event depth and adjusted interarrival time u u u min this last distribution is equivalent to a three parameter lognormal distribution with lower limit u min matalas 1963 sangal and biswas 1970 separate marginals have been fitted to the sub datasets of each season formulas for parameter estimation by the mme for the specific marginal distributions used here are recalled for completeness in appendix a fig 7 shows a good fitting of the chosen marginals distributions in a q q plot comparison between observed and theoretical distribution based quantiles the goodness of fit was also assessed by the anderson darling statistical test e g kottegoda and rosso 2008 whose results are shown in table 2 in terms of p values together with the estimated parameter values p values are defined as the probability that the test statistic could have been as extreme or more extreme than observed if the null hypothesis h 0 sample drawn from the fitted distribution were true cf upton and cook 2008 as can be seen from the table the null hypothesis is not rejected with a level of significance greater than 5 for all variables and seasons with the exception of rainfall duration in season mjja for which the test is accepted with a 4 significance level however such a lower degree of fit for the mjja season has minor consequences in assessing impacts of climate change on landslides as in this season it is very unlikely for landslides to occur for modeling the dependence between rainfall event duration and total depth in each season the best fitting copula has been searched among the elliptical gaussian and student s t and archimedean clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 families and the 90 180 and 270 degrees rotated versions for a total of 32 copulas which also include the independence one the vinecopula r software has been used brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 which allows for selection of the most suitable copula among various hypothesized ones based on akaike information criteria aic or bayesian information criteria bic some additional details are summarized in appendix a the following copulas resulted as the most suitable gaussian jfma bb7 mjja and survival gumbel sond for which essential details are given in appendix a fig 8 shows the comparison between observed and generated h t pairs as well as the parameters of the fitted copulas a good agreement can be seen also in terms of the duration intensity pair 3 3 model testing in fig 9 a validation of the stochastic rainfall model based on the comparison of observed and simulated yearly cumulative rainfall series is shown the similarity in a statistical sense between the observed and simulated rainfall demonstrates the suitability of the stochastic rainfall model the suitability of the landslide model has been tested by checking its ability in spotting the dates of historical landslides when the observed rainfall series is given in input to it the model indicates all and only the observed four landslides fig 10 occurred on dates 15 september 2006 25 october 2007 24 september 2009 and 1 october 2009 we have also performed a sensitivity analysis relative to the choice of u min varying its value to 6 12 24 and 48 h except for the adopted value of 24 h in all cases the test performed worse in the sense that some landslide dates where not correctly spotted and the count of critical pressure head exceedance was different from the number of observed landslides this further validates the choice of u min 24 h an additional validation test has been conducted to check if the whole monte carlo modeling chain rainfall plus hydrological and slope stability model produces acceptable results for the purposes under study to this aim we have compared the number of landslides within the record with those given by the modeling chain on periods of the same length 9 years this comparison cannot be done deterministically because of sampling variability thus 30 simulations have been carried out as can be seen from the boxplot of the results of these simulations the model provides reasonable results as a number of 4 landslides in nine years is within the interquartile range of the outcome of monte carlo simulations see fig 11 another point concerns the length of monte carlo simulations that has to be sufficiently large to provide probability estimations of acceptable uncertainty below a given tolerance say 5 a general overview of this problem is given in kottegoda and rosso 2008 here we conduct sample variability in estimating landslide probability for the observed current climate see fig 12 for every hypothetical value of the simulation length m landslide probability has been computed 30 times using the stochastic model calibrated on the observed series operating a resampling from the generated events this has enabled to compute the relative error in estimating landslide probability for each simulation length more precisely the relative error for a given simulation length is in this context defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of the landslide probability values obtained from the 30 samples we have chosen a value of m 3000 as it corresponds to a relative error in estimating landslide probability that is less than 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes in characteristics of rainfall events factors of changes for the moments of rainfall event characteristics t h and u used to compute the adjusted rainfall generator parameters for years 2040 2100 are shown in fig 13 the following changes grouped per variable may be inferred from the plots changes in duration t fig 13a and b in the rcp 4 5 scenario changes of mean duration of events are quite low either in the jfma and the sond season while some significant changes are indicated in the mjja season by the lmd projections for the period 2040 2060 changes of standard deviation follow a very similar trajectory to those of the mean in the rcp 8 5 scenario changes are more accentuated compared to those in the rcp 4 5 and for the jfma and sond seasons projections indicate a slight decrease of event duration which tends to become increasingly significant as the end of century is approached however these changes are quite limited factor of change not less than 0 8 again changes of the standard deviation of rainfall event duration are similar though greater that those of the mean relatively high changes are projected for the mjja season factors of change approaching 2 lmd or 0 5 guf though these may have a low impact on landslide triggering probability for the quite low intensities and durations of this season changes for rainfall event depth h fig 13c and d relatively to the rcp 4 5 factor of changes of mean rainfall event depth are comprised between 0 85 and 1 2 in the jfma season but centered around the no change line while in the sond season changes are more significant with a prevailing indication of a decrease similarly to duration in the mjja season projected changes are more significant than in the other seasons ranging from 0 7 to 1 5 but are quite unstable changes of standard deviation are again more significant than those of the mean and prevalently indicate an increase of variability for rainfall event depth in the jfma season and an decrease in the sond for the rcp 8 5 scenario changes are qualitatively similar than the rcp 4 5 but the factor of changes are in some cases more significant and unstable cf mjja season changes in interarrival time u fig 13e and f models concordantly indicate that the magnitude and variability of storm interarrival will tend to increase with time a clear upward trend is predicted for the rcp 8 5 scenario and factors of change can exceed 2 at the year 2100 in general with reference to rainfall duration and depth the three considered rcms provide indications that differ significantly from one to another sometimes in opposite directions on the other hand models agree in predicting an increase of storm interarrival times both in magnitude mean and variability standard deviation that becomes more significant moving forward in time also all models predict some significant future changes of rainfall event depth mean and standard deviation in the sond season prevalently a decrease of both the one where landslides have been more recurrent in the past see section 3 1 4 2 changes in pressure head components and landslide return period the obtained factors of changes have enabled us to perform monte carlo simulations for each future period fig 14 shows the resulting factors of changes for the mean of initial ψ 0 and transient pressure head ψ 1 series cf eq 12 as illustrated on section 2 4 the first component is indirectly related to antecedent precipitation crozier 1999 while the second is strictly dependent on the rainfall event intensity and duration characteristics in the rcp 4 5 scenario there is an overall tendency for a decrease of initial pressure head only one rcm the cmcc indicates a possible slight increase in the period 2040 2060 with a factor of change not greater than 1 14 also for the mean transient pressure head rcms indicate prevalently a decrease for the rcp 8 5 all rcm are concordant in indicating a negative trend of the changes of initial pressure head mean though they remain positive until 2080 lmd ca 2090 guf or on all the entire future period considered cmcc changes of the mean transient pressure head are in this case very small and can be deemed not significant factor of change in the range 0 88 1 13 the series of changes in landslide probability and return period are shown in fig 15 for the rcp 4 5 scenario the models indicate in general a decrease of the probability of landslide triggering in particular models guf and lmd show a decrease down to 1 4 respect to the baseline period the cmcc model indicates an increase in the period 2040 2065 which is however quite small less than 1 5 for the rcp 8 5 all three rcms indicate a decrease of landslide probability which is higher than for the previous scenario being the factor of change 1 4 in periods 2040 2050 and 2060 2100 lmd model changes in the return period are smoother than those in landslide probability since eq 4 averages among the probabilities after any year at which return period is referred to return period has the opposite meaning of probability thus for rcp 4 5 models prevalently indicate a increase with factors of change greater than 2 for the lmd and guf models while for the cmcc a slight decrease 0 70 is predicted in the initial period 2040 2060 for the rcp 8 5 the return period is projected to possibly increase to a greater factor than for rcp 4 5 with the highest values in period 2085 2100 where return period can be more than 3 times the current value model lmd 5 conclusion estimation of landslide hazard is of key importance for land use planning and preparatory for landslide mitigation as climate change is being claimed to potentially increase landslide activity researchers and practitioners are nowadays asked to quantitatively assess the induced hazard changes in our paper we have provided tested and demonstrated a modeling chain methodology that allows the computation of future landslide return periods taking into account of the nonstationarities in rainfall event characteristics induced by climate change in particular by sequential monte carlo simulations the approach allows the estimation of the necessary sequence of landslide probabilities to apply formulas proposed by salas and obeysekera 2014 to compute return period under nonstationary climate conditions the tests and the application exercise conducted with reference to the peloritani mountains area has demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed modeling approach allowing also for a preliminary assessment of the possible future impacts of climate change on landslide hazard according to the ensemble of the three med cordex rcms considered there will be a general tendency for a decrease of landslide hazard in the area with return periods that can increase up to a factor of 2 5 or 3 5 respectively for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 these results are a consequence of the projected increase of the interarrival time between rainfall events combined with a prevalent decrease of rainfall event duration and depth only one model the cmcc projects in certain periods some slight increases of these rainfall event characteristics and thus a decrease of return periods nevertheless the relatively high spread of the results due to climate modeling uncertainty indicates the need for further research to confirm the specific results here obtained relatively to climate change impacts this will be partially addressed in further research oriented to the use of a wider ensemble of rcm products such as those provided under the euro cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 as well as additional ones made available from the med cordex also taking into account of their reliability by advanced ensemble averaging techniques christensen et al 2010 mascaro et al 2018 furthermore the proposed approach is in principle suitable for many other areas with similar climatic hydrological and geological conditions the authors are willing to share the developed software tools with anyone interested to test the suitability of the modeling approach

6898,quantifying the potential influence of climate change on future landslide hazard requires methodologies that allow to properly take into account nonstationarities in the hydro meteorological causes in this paper we provide a methodology for estimating return period of landslide triggering under climate change the methodology capitalizes on the combined use of a stochastic rainfall generator and a hydrological and slope stability model the stochastic rainfall generator takes into account the statistical dependency between rainfall event duration and intensity through copulas the hydrological model is based on an analytical solution of a simplified version of the richards vertical infiltration equation and slope stability is assessed by the infinite slope model the combined model enables to estimate landslide probability through monte carlo simulations climate change is then introduced by perturbing the parameters of the rainfall stochastic generator based on factors of change derived from the comparison of future scenarios and the baseline climate as simulated by regional climate models rcms the monte carlo simulations are conducted sequentially on a future moving time window to derive a yearly series of future landslide triggering probability this series is then used to compute landslide return period by formulas suitable under nonstationary conditions an application to the landslide prone region of the peloritani mountains southern italy is carried out to demonstrate the proposed approach for the application climate change projections of three rcms of the med cordex initiative are used and a preliminary assessment of the impacts of intermediate and high emission representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 is carried out keywords landslides stochastic models climate change monte carlo simulation regional climate models 1 introduction landslides are a natural phenomenon shaping the earth s surface and a hazard globally provoking hundreds of deaths every year sidle and ochiai 2006 froude and petley 2018 landslide processes are typically nonstationary at both intra annual seasonality and inter annual time scales sidle and ochiai 2006 describe most of nonstationary processes of interest in the study of landslides which include reactivation processes land use modifications and climatic changes the latter are expected to modify meteorological conditions and to have significant impacts on landslides and other hydrological hazards ipcc 2014 since the late 1990s an increasing number of papers focused on the assessment of the potential effects of climate change on landslide phenomena based on three distinct approaches gariano and guzzetti 2016 and references therein modeling approaches historical analyses and identification of paleo landslide evidences the first consist in assessing the impacts of climate change on a given phenomenon based on climate projections from global circulation models gcms and derived downscaled climatic products gcms simulate the effects on climate of emission scenarios defined by international programs taylor et al 2012 and better known as representative concentration pathways rcps briefly scenarios in the ensuing text regional climate models rcms provide higher resolution data up to 10 20 km or less as a result of dynamical downscaling of gcm data having a coarser resolution 250 600 km commonly modeling approaches couple these climate model simulations with empirical or physically based models providing triggering conditions as a more or less explicit function of climatic variables mainly precipitation ciabatta et al 2016 rianna et al 2016 gariano et al 2017 alvioli et al 2018 climate change studies led to contrasting conclusions on whether an increase or a decrease should be expected in landslide frequency in the future crozier 2010 coe and godt 2012 the high level of uncertainty is substantially confirmed by ipcc special report of seneviratne et al 2012 which indicates a variable level of confidence for an increase of landslide activity in the future opening an implicit request for further studies notwithstanding an increasing literature focused on the assessment of climate change impacts on landslides there is a lack of studies focusing on the possible changes on landslide return period a widely used metric to express landslide hazard useful in designing mitigation infrastructures borga et al 2002 d odorico et al 2005 rosso et al 2006 simoni et al 2008 salciarini et al 2008 tarolli et al 2011 peres and cancelliere 2016 the need to address this aim derives also from the fact that the concept of return period has been recently revisited to take into account nonstationary processes salas and obeysekera 2014 obeysekera and salas 2016 cancelliere 2017 which change the way return period is estimated because landslide probability varies in time this paper aims at addressing this issue proposing a modeling approach for estimating return period of landslide triggering under a changing climate taking into account the induced nonstationarities in precipitation to this aim we use rcm products within a monte carlo simulation approach peres and cancelliere 2014 peres and cancelliere 2016 the monte carlo simulation scheme is herein based on the combined use of a stochastic rainfall generator and a hydrological and slope stability model a single monte carlo simulation yields an estimate of landslide probability for a given climate by perturbing the stochastic rainfall model based on rcm projections a series of future landslide probabilities can be derived perturbation is here based factor of changes of rainfall event statistical properties kilsby et al 2007 anandhi et al 2011 fatichi et al 2011 maraun et al 2010 teutschbein and seibert 2012 ehret et al 2012 finally return period is computed as a function of the estimated future landslide probability series according to nonstationary formulations provided by salas and obeysekera 2014 the stochastic rainfall generator we devise takes into account of the statistical dependence between rainfall event duration and intensity thanks to a copula approach the hydrological and slope stability model is based on the diffusive infiltration model introduced by iverson 2000 extended to a finite soil depth baum et al 2002 and simplified to the computation of peak pressure head response to rainfall events allowing a more efficient application than other software implementations baum et al 2010 alvioli and baum 2016 that constrain the user to compute the complete response to rainfall time series an application of the methodology is carried out with reference to the peloritani mountains in sicily an area that has experienced several landslides in the recent decades the application exercise allows to test the suitability of the methodology in real world situations the specific results obtained also offer a preliminary assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on landslide activity in this area the application is conduced for three different rcm products of the med cordex initiative so a measure of the spread related to rcm uncertainties is also provided 2 methodology 2 1 return period in a nonstationary context return period can be rigorously defined by introducing random variate y as the time at which a given critical event slope instability in our case occurs for the first time in the stationary case probability of the phenomena is constant in time say equal to p 0 it can be shown that the probability that a critical event occurs for the first time at year y is given by the geometric distribution law mood et al 1974 1 f y 1 p 0 y 1 p 0 y 1 2 thus return period t 0 which can be defined as the mean number of years that will take for the first occurrence of a critical event is given by the well known formula chow et al 1988 2 t 0 e y 1 p 0 in the nonstationary case critical event probability varies in time if we denote as p y that probability at time y it has been shown by salas and obeysekera 2014 that 3 f y p y t 1 y 1 1 p t with y 1 2 thus return period becomes 4 t 0 e y y 1 yf y y 1 yp y t 1 y 1 1 p t this equation can be generalized to compute return period at a given time by introducing an additional time variate ν which is the time at which one desires to estimate return period 5 t ν y 1 yp ν y 1 t 1 y 1 1 p ν t 1 all formulas above require just the estimation of the landslide probability series which is here carried out via monte carlo simulations 2 2 computation of landslide probability in our approach each monte carlo simulation allows to compute landslide probability for a given climate as already mentioned the simulation consist in the combination a stochastic rainfall generator and a physically based model by which a long virtual synthetic series of rainfall and landslide response can be obtained let us denote with m the length of a monte carlo simulation in virtual years provided that m is sufficiently large landslide probability can be estimated frequentistically as 6 p 1 m m 1 m i m where 7 i m 1 if in virtual year m at least a landslide occurred 0 otherwise in the monte carlo modeling we assume that a landslide occurs each time the factor of safety f s for slope stability drops down to 1 here we work under the assumption of an infinite slope for which 8 f s tan ϕ tan δ c ψ d lz t p γ w tan ϕ γ s d lz sin δ cos δ where ϕ is friction angle c is soil cohesion δ is terrain slope γ w 9800 n m3 is the unit weight of water γ s the unit weight of soil d lz is soil depth ψ t p d lz is pressure head at the peak time t p measured from rainfall event start see section 2 4 and at soil depth z d lz this is equivalent to comparing peak pressure head with a critical value ψ cr which is obtained by rearranging the above equation and letting f s 1 9 ψ cr c γ w tan ϕ γ s d lz sin δ cos δ γ w tan ϕ 1 tan ϕ tan δ though more sophisticated and accurate three dimensional slope stability models have been recently proposed lehmann and or 2012 milledge et al 2014 bellugi et al 2015 reid et al 2015 the infinite slope stability analysis remains still reliable for a first stage assessment of landslide triggering hazard baum et al 2010 arnone et al 2011 raia et al 2014 capparelli and versace 2014 pressure head needed to be compared with ψ cr can be estimated from any suitable hydrological model herein we use a model based on the diffusive infiltration model proposed by iverson 2000 extended for a finite soil depth baum et al 2002 and a linear reservoir drainage model that acts within dry intervals peres and cancelliere 2014 as described more in detail in section 2 4 we proceed in a lumped fashion i e model the response of the area of interest by a single set of geomorphological hydrological and geotechnical parameters which are globally representative of slopes subject to landslides in the area of interest to test the suitability of the lumped model in the given region of interest it is checked if it reproduces landslides occurrence dates in the region for the period covered by the observed record see section 3 in this sense this lumped approach is similar to empirical landslide triggering thresholds caine 1980 guzzetti et al 2008 greco et al 2013 peruccacci et al 2017 peres et al 2018 where a single relationship is used to establish whether or not a given rainfall event will trigger landslides in a region here instead of using an empirical relationship we use a lumped approach that has a physically based rationale following recent perspectives on landslide research bogaard and greco 2018 the input to the hydrological model is provided by the stochastic rainfall model which is also able to take into account climatic changes stochastic rainfall generators can be of a very wide degree of complexity and are mostly all suitable to take into account climate change scenarios as simulated by rcms by means of a factor of changes approach fatichi et al 2011 kilsby et al 2007 for our purpose we have devised a specific rainfall event sequences generator based on copulas described more in detail in section 2 3 we just anticipate here that respect to other stochastic models presented in the literature the one we propose here has the advantage to allow parameter adjustment simply from the statistical moments of rainfall characteristics namely event duration t total depth h and the no rain time separating one event from another interarrival time u in a climate change context a control and a future period are distinguished for the control period both the historical rcm simulation and observed data may be available while only the former is for the future climate referred to year ν if m c rcm and m ν rcm are the statistical moments computed from rcm in the control and future period respectively then the factor of change for moment m is given by the ratio 10 f ν m ν rcm m c rcm the factor of change can be used to estimate the future value of the moment m ν by multiplication to the observed moment in the control period m c obs 11 m ν m c obs f ν the moments obtained from eq 11 are then plugged into the method of moments parameter estimators mme by which the corrected parameters of the stochastic model for future periods are obtained in order to apply eqs 10 and 11 the spatial inconsistency between rcm data and observations should be resolved for instance by interpolation to this aim we have interpreted the rcm data as relative to the center of the grid cells thus the interpolation averages the rcm data as a function of the distance of the grid cell centers to the observation point rain gauge this way to proceed preserves the temporal structure of the observed rainfall time series landslide return period for the control period is obtained by monte carlo simulation with the stochastic model calibrated on observed rainfall data and application of eqs 6 7 and 2 rcms provide scenarios for the years 2005 2100 within this period we define on a yearly moving time window sixty one climatic periods thirty years long first period ν 1 corresponds to years 2011 2040 ν 2 to years 2012 2041 and so on until the last period 2061 2100 ν 61 is reached hence for each future scenario landslide probability p ν can be computed ν 1 2 61 this series of probabilities is then plugged in eq 5 to compute the return period sequence for this purpose we assume that for ν 61 p ν p 61 fig 1 summarizes the main steps and features of the proposed methodology 2 3 stochastic point rainfall event generator based on copulas stochastic rainfall point models allow simulation of rainfall time series at a given location salas 1993 the resulting generated rainfall sequences reproduce the statistical features of the observed series which are significant for the problem at hand the main advantage of using a stochastic model is that synthetic series can have a virtually unlimited length allowing to estimate landslide probability based on the frequentist definition see eqs 6 and 7 here we devise a specific point stochastic model for the generation of sequences of rectangular rainfall events with statistical dependence between their total depth h and duration t modeled through copula functions nelsen 2007 the importance to take into account such dependence has been highlighted by different studies e g de michele et al 2003 evin and favre 2008 vernieuwe et al 2015 and it is desirable within landslide modeling given the high number of studies linking the occurrence of this phenomenon to event rainfall duration and mean intensity sidle and ochiai 2006 guzzetti et al 2007 peruccacci et al 2017 specifically the model is structured as follows see fig 2 event duration t and rainfall depth h are generated by a suitable bivariate model to take into account their statistical dependence the bivariate model is built using copula functions that allow almost unconstrained choice of marginal distributions f t and f h of the two variables under investigation rainfall events are separated by dry intervals these intervals are generated according to a suitable continuous probability distribution f u in order to calibrate the model given an observed time series rainfall events have to be isolated with some criterion here a part of the rainfall time series is assumed to be a rainfall event when bounded by zero rain dry periods of at least u min hours long the same procedure is applied to the rcm series as well the choice of u min may depend on the climatic features of the investigated area vessia et al 2014 melillo et al 2015 melillo et al 2018 we then fit marginal distributions to the series of observed rainfall events by using method of moments estimators mme of the distribution parameters mme has the advantage to allow for easy adjustment of the stochastic model parameters since change factors of only few moments of the rcm derived rainfall event series are needed the choice of marginal distributions can be guided by statistical hypothesis testing d agostino and stephens 1986 we apply the factor of changes adjustment for generation of rainfall sequences in the climate change scenarios only to the marginal distributions the h t dependence copula parameters are not adjusted for the scenario periods this has the advantage of model simplicity since otherwise with a changing dependence structure the specific parametric copulas suitable for the observational period may not be valid for the future periods nevertheless changing marginals induce by themselves a modification of the h t bivariate distribution even if analytical goodness of fit tests are available in the literature genest et al 2009 a simple and reliable method to check the suitability of a copula model is to compare the observed pairs with those randomly generated from the fitted copula genest and favre 2007 this approach is followed in several studies e g gyasi agyei and melching 2012 callau poduje and haberlandt 2017 and in this work as well see section 3 2 2 4 hydrological model of infiltration and drainage the hydrological infiltration model we adopt is based on the model presented by iverson 2000 extended to the case of a finite soil depth baum et al 2002 and integrated with a water table recession model to compute the initial conditions at each rainfall event as an implicit function of antecedent rainfall as introduced in our previous work peres and cancelliere 2014 the model which we briefly describe below is partially implemented within the trigrs software from the first version baum et al 2002 to its updates baum et al 2008 alvioli and baum 2016 we have coded in matlab an ad hoc simplified implementation of this model the simplification consists in the direct computation of the peak pressure head response to precipitation events without calculation of the entire pressure head time history which in the case of uniform hyetographs is not necessary to determine whether or not a given event triggers a landslide thus this allows a more efficient application than other implementations because it avoids operations unnecessary for the purpose of this paper that cannot be bypassed if the above cited programs are used the model conceptualizes the hillslope as a single layered permeable strata overlaying a perfectly impermeable bedrock fig 3 as rainfall infiltrates a saturated area develops above the regolith bedrock interface yielding an increase in pressure head which negatively affects slope stability according to eq 8 within this scheme pressure head is maximum at the base of the soil strata which thus coincides with the failure plane hence the aim of the hydrological model is to compute pressure head at the basal boundary z d lz and its local peak occurring at time t p from the beginning of any rainfall event total pressure head ψ i that builds in response at the i th rainfall event is the sum of a transient ψ 1 i and an initial component ψ 0 i 12 ψ i ψ 1 i ψ 0 i the first part is modeled as a function of rainfall duration t and intensity i while the initial pressure head for the i th rainfall event depends on antecedent rainfall events specifically it is taken as function of the dry time interval before the event and the peak total pressure head of the preceding event i 1 the transient response is computed from the simplified form of the richards equation treated by iverson 2000 which basically assumes that with respect to the infiltration process the unsaturated soil has the same hydrological properties of the saturated one tension saturated soil under these hypothesis event pressure head component is given by baum et al 2002 2008 13 ψ 1 d lz t d lz i k s r t p r t p t the response function r x appearing in the above equation is given by a series of integral complementary error functions ierfc 14 r x 2 m 1 ierfc 2 m 1 x where 15 ierfc x 1 π exp x 2 x erfc x in the above equations i and t are respectively rainfall event mean intensity and duration k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity d 0 is the soil saturated diffusivity x is a dummy variate and erfc is the complementary error function abramowitz and stegun 1964 in applying eq 13 two constraints have to be considered first the ratio i k s has to be truncated at 1 if greater since k s represents for the model assumptions the maximum possible value of the vertical infiltration rate second the so called beta line limitation that ψ d lz d lz cos 2 δ applies which is pressure head cannot exceed the value corresponding to an hydrostatic profile with water table located at the ground surface iverson 2000 dimensionless quantities in eq 13 are defined as follows 16 t t t d t t t d t d d lz 2 d d 4 d 0 cos 2 δ the dimensionless peak time t p shown in fig 4 as a function of dimensionless rainfall event duration t can be obtained from numerical investigation of eqs 13 and 14 cf d odorico et al 2005 initial pressure head is here computed by the following equation see peres and cancelliere 2014 17 ψ 0 i ψ p i 1 exp u i τ m where ψ p i 1 is total pressure head at the peak time of t p of preceding event i 1 and u i denotes the dry interval preceding current event i see fig 2 the recession constant τ m is here expressed as a function of a topographic wetness index soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and porosity taken as the difference between saturated and residual soil water contents θ s θ r 18 τ m a b θ s θ r k s sin δ where a b is the specific upslope contributing area i e the ratio between the upslope contributing area a and contour length b a b can be computed according to various flow direction algorithms here the simple d8 method of o callaghan and mark 1984 is used eq 17 is a recursive equation that implicitly links initial pressure head to antecedent rainfall 3 application 3 1 case study region peloritani mountains sicily italy an application of the proposed methodology has been carried out with reference to the peloritani mountains region located in northeastern sicily italy and represented in fig 5 a this highly landslide prone area has experienced several regional shallow landslide events recent episodes are 15 september 2006 25 october 2007 24 september 2009 and 1 october 2009 see pictures in fig 5b e the latter event has caused severe damage and fatalities 37 deaths and thousands of evacuated people and it has been described in several studies aronica et al 2012 peres and cancelliere 2012 2014 de guidi and scudero 2013 lombardo et al 2014 cama et al 2015 schilirò et al 2015 2016 stancanelli et al 2017 representative data for the peloritani mountains are shown in table 1 the use of a single set of soil properties for the peloritani mountains area is an approximation as these vary from point to point the values used here are within the range of those obtained from some surveys in the area and have proven to be among the ones leading to a reasonable reproduction of the spatial distribution of landslides occurred on 1 october 2009 stancanelli et al 2017 spatial distribution and uncertainty of soil characteristics can play a crucial role on the model predictive ability anagnostopoulos et al 2015 but modeling their impact is beyond the scope of this paper for calibration and validation of the stochastic rainfall model in the observational period the hourly rainfall series of fiumedinisi rain gauge has been used location is shown in fig 5a the series covers the period from 5 january 2002 to 23 february 2011 about nine years this period can be considered to be homogeneous to the control period 1971 2000 as several studies have shown the absence of significant trends in rainfall records covering a long period from late 1920s to 2013 for both extreme and daily rainfall bonaccorso et al 2005 arnone et al 2013 bonaccorso and aronica 2016 the following three rcm data sets of daily precipitation from the med cordex project www med cordex eu having a spatial resolution of 0 44 about 50 km have been considered a cmcc developed at the mediterranean centre for climate change italy it is based on cmcc cclm4 8 19 rcm applied to the cmcc cm gcm b guf developed ad the goethe university frankfurt germany it is based on guf cclm4 8 18 rcm applied to mpi esm lr gcm and c lmd developed at the laboratoire de météorologie dynamique france it is based on lmd lmdz4 nemomed8 rcm applied to the ipsl cm5a mr gcm spatial linear interpolation has been performed on the rcm data to derive the precipitation at the location of the fiumedinisi rain gauge as anticipated on section 2 2 3 2 rainfall model calibration the stochastic model takes into account seasonality of rainfall event characteristics through separate calibrations for statistically homogeneous periods of the year which have been identified based on the mean and standard deviation of monthly rainfall see fig 6 based on the plots the following periods have been considered i january april jfma ii may august mjja and iii september december sond the observed rainfall hourly series has been then pre processed to extract the rainfall events which have been approximated as a constant intensity hyetograph see fig 2 a minimum event separation time interval u min 24 h has been chosen following our previous studies peres and cancelliere 2014 2016 other researchers confirm the suitability of this value as it has been used in determining landslide thresholds in sicily caracciolo et al 2017 and in italy in general brunetti et al 2010 among several tested distributions exponential weibull lognormal and gamma the gamma resulted the most suitable for event duration while a two parameter lognormal was suitable for both event depth and adjusted interarrival time u u u min this last distribution is equivalent to a three parameter lognormal distribution with lower limit u min matalas 1963 sangal and biswas 1970 separate marginals have been fitted to the sub datasets of each season formulas for parameter estimation by the mme for the specific marginal distributions used here are recalled for completeness in appendix a fig 7 shows a good fitting of the chosen marginals distributions in a q q plot comparison between observed and theoretical distribution based quantiles the goodness of fit was also assessed by the anderson darling statistical test e g kottegoda and rosso 2008 whose results are shown in table 2 in terms of p values together with the estimated parameter values p values are defined as the probability that the test statistic could have been as extreme or more extreme than observed if the null hypothesis h 0 sample drawn from the fitted distribution were true cf upton and cook 2008 as can be seen from the table the null hypothesis is not rejected with a level of significance greater than 5 for all variables and seasons with the exception of rainfall duration in season mjja for which the test is accepted with a 4 significance level however such a lower degree of fit for the mjja season has minor consequences in assessing impacts of climate change on landslides as in this season it is very unlikely for landslides to occur for modeling the dependence between rainfall event duration and total depth in each season the best fitting copula has been searched among the elliptical gaussian and student s t and archimedean clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 and bb8 families and the 90 180 and 270 degrees rotated versions for a total of 32 copulas which also include the independence one the vinecopula r software has been used brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 which allows for selection of the most suitable copula among various hypothesized ones based on akaike information criteria aic or bayesian information criteria bic some additional details are summarized in appendix a the following copulas resulted as the most suitable gaussian jfma bb7 mjja and survival gumbel sond for which essential details are given in appendix a fig 8 shows the comparison between observed and generated h t pairs as well as the parameters of the fitted copulas a good agreement can be seen also in terms of the duration intensity pair 3 3 model testing in fig 9 a validation of the stochastic rainfall model based on the comparison of observed and simulated yearly cumulative rainfall series is shown the similarity in a statistical sense between the observed and simulated rainfall demonstrates the suitability of the stochastic rainfall model the suitability of the landslide model has been tested by checking its ability in spotting the dates of historical landslides when the observed rainfall series is given in input to it the model indicates all and only the observed four landslides fig 10 occurred on dates 15 september 2006 25 october 2007 24 september 2009 and 1 october 2009 we have also performed a sensitivity analysis relative to the choice of u min varying its value to 6 12 24 and 48 h except for the adopted value of 24 h in all cases the test performed worse in the sense that some landslide dates where not correctly spotted and the count of critical pressure head exceedance was different from the number of observed landslides this further validates the choice of u min 24 h an additional validation test has been conducted to check if the whole monte carlo modeling chain rainfall plus hydrological and slope stability model produces acceptable results for the purposes under study to this aim we have compared the number of landslides within the record with those given by the modeling chain on periods of the same length 9 years this comparison cannot be done deterministically because of sampling variability thus 30 simulations have been carried out as can be seen from the boxplot of the results of these simulations the model provides reasonable results as a number of 4 landslides in nine years is within the interquartile range of the outcome of monte carlo simulations see fig 11 another point concerns the length of monte carlo simulations that has to be sufficiently large to provide probability estimations of acceptable uncertainty below a given tolerance say 5 a general overview of this problem is given in kottegoda and rosso 2008 here we conduct sample variability in estimating landslide probability for the observed current climate see fig 12 for every hypothetical value of the simulation length m landslide probability has been computed 30 times using the stochastic model calibrated on the observed series operating a resampling from the generated events this has enabled to compute the relative error in estimating landslide probability for each simulation length more precisely the relative error for a given simulation length is in this context defined as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of the landslide probability values obtained from the 30 samples we have chosen a value of m 3000 as it corresponds to a relative error in estimating landslide probability that is less than 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes in characteristics of rainfall events factors of changes for the moments of rainfall event characteristics t h and u used to compute the adjusted rainfall generator parameters for years 2040 2100 are shown in fig 13 the following changes grouped per variable may be inferred from the plots changes in duration t fig 13a and b in the rcp 4 5 scenario changes of mean duration of events are quite low either in the jfma and the sond season while some significant changes are indicated in the mjja season by the lmd projections for the period 2040 2060 changes of standard deviation follow a very similar trajectory to those of the mean in the rcp 8 5 scenario changes are more accentuated compared to those in the rcp 4 5 and for the jfma and sond seasons projections indicate a slight decrease of event duration which tends to become increasingly significant as the end of century is approached however these changes are quite limited factor of change not less than 0 8 again changes of the standard deviation of rainfall event duration are similar though greater that those of the mean relatively high changes are projected for the mjja season factors of change approaching 2 lmd or 0 5 guf though these may have a low impact on landslide triggering probability for the quite low intensities and durations of this season changes for rainfall event depth h fig 13c and d relatively to the rcp 4 5 factor of changes of mean rainfall event depth are comprised between 0 85 and 1 2 in the jfma season but centered around the no change line while in the sond season changes are more significant with a prevailing indication of a decrease similarly to duration in the mjja season projected changes are more significant than in the other seasons ranging from 0 7 to 1 5 but are quite unstable changes of standard deviation are again more significant than those of the mean and prevalently indicate an increase of variability for rainfall event depth in the jfma season and an decrease in the sond for the rcp 8 5 scenario changes are qualitatively similar than the rcp 4 5 but the factor of changes are in some cases more significant and unstable cf mjja season changes in interarrival time u fig 13e and f models concordantly indicate that the magnitude and variability of storm interarrival will tend to increase with time a clear upward trend is predicted for the rcp 8 5 scenario and factors of change can exceed 2 at the year 2100 in general with reference to rainfall duration and depth the three considered rcms provide indications that differ significantly from one to another sometimes in opposite directions on the other hand models agree in predicting an increase of storm interarrival times both in magnitude mean and variability standard deviation that becomes more significant moving forward in time also all models predict some significant future changes of rainfall event depth mean and standard deviation in the sond season prevalently a decrease of both the one where landslides have been more recurrent in the past see section 3 1 4 2 changes in pressure head components and landslide return period the obtained factors of changes have enabled us to perform monte carlo simulations for each future period fig 14 shows the resulting factors of changes for the mean of initial ψ 0 and transient pressure head ψ 1 series cf eq 12 as illustrated on section 2 4 the first component is indirectly related to antecedent precipitation crozier 1999 while the second is strictly dependent on the rainfall event intensity and duration characteristics in the rcp 4 5 scenario there is an overall tendency for a decrease of initial pressure head only one rcm the cmcc indicates a possible slight increase in the period 2040 2060 with a factor of change not greater than 1 14 also for the mean transient pressure head rcms indicate prevalently a decrease for the rcp 8 5 all rcm are concordant in indicating a negative trend of the changes of initial pressure head mean though they remain positive until 2080 lmd ca 2090 guf or on all the entire future period considered cmcc changes of the mean transient pressure head are in this case very small and can be deemed not significant factor of change in the range 0 88 1 13 the series of changes in landslide probability and return period are shown in fig 15 for the rcp 4 5 scenario the models indicate in general a decrease of the probability of landslide triggering in particular models guf and lmd show a decrease down to 1 4 respect to the baseline period the cmcc model indicates an increase in the period 2040 2065 which is however quite small less than 1 5 for the rcp 8 5 all three rcms indicate a decrease of landslide probability which is higher than for the previous scenario being the factor of change 1 4 in periods 2040 2050 and 2060 2100 lmd model changes in the return period are smoother than those in landslide probability since eq 4 averages among the probabilities after any year at which return period is referred to return period has the opposite meaning of probability thus for rcp 4 5 models prevalently indicate a increase with factors of change greater than 2 for the lmd and guf models while for the cmcc a slight decrease 0 70 is predicted in the initial period 2040 2060 for the rcp 8 5 the return period is projected to possibly increase to a greater factor than for rcp 4 5 with the highest values in period 2085 2100 where return period can be more than 3 times the current value model lmd 5 conclusion estimation of landslide hazard is of key importance for land use planning and preparatory for landslide mitigation as climate change is being claimed to potentially increase landslide activity researchers and practitioners are nowadays asked to quantitatively assess the induced hazard changes in our paper we have provided tested and demonstrated a modeling chain methodology that allows the computation of future landslide return periods taking into account of the nonstationarities in rainfall event characteristics induced by climate change in particular by sequential monte carlo simulations the approach allows the estimation of the necessary sequence of landslide probabilities to apply formulas proposed by salas and obeysekera 2014 to compute return period under nonstationary climate conditions the tests and the application exercise conducted with reference to the peloritani mountains area has demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed modeling approach allowing also for a preliminary assessment of the possible future impacts of climate change on landslide hazard according to the ensemble of the three med cordex rcms considered there will be a general tendency for a decrease of landslide hazard in the area with return periods that can increase up to a factor of 2 5 or 3 5 respectively for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 these results are a consequence of the projected increase of the interarrival time between rainfall events combined with a prevalent decrease of rainfall event duration and depth only one model the cmcc projects in certain periods some slight increases of these rainfall event characteristics and thus a decrease of return periods nevertheless the relatively high spread of the results due to climate modeling uncertainty indicates the need for further research to confirm the specific results here obtained relatively to climate change impacts this will be partially addressed in further research oriented to the use of a wider ensemble of rcm products such as those provided under the euro cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 as well as additional ones made available from the med cordex also taking into account of their reliability by advanced ensemble averaging techniques christensen et al 2010 mascaro et al 2018 furthermore the proposed approach is in principle suitable for many other

6899,the magnitude of floods depends not only on the intensity and pattern of precipitation during the flood event the flood producing precipitation but also on the moisture stored in the catchment which arises from antecedent hydrological processes over many preceding timescales to characterise this effect an empirical study is conducted on the influence of antecedent precipitation on significant flood events across multiple climate zones and catchment conditions using 100 australian catchments with hourly streamflow and precipitation antecedent conditions are shown to have a significant influence on flood volume with three quarters of catchments having at least a 50 difference in flood volume depending on whether the catchment is wet or dry before the flood producing precipitation event the study considers the sensitivity of flow to antecedent precipitation by means of an elasticity metric which indicates the proportional change in flow for a change in antecedent precipitation or flood producing precipitation flood producing precipitation nevertheless remains the dominant flood driver across most catchments with the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation typically being between 28 and 37 of the elasticity to flood producing precipitation importantly the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation relative to flood producing precipitation decreases with increasing event magnitude highlighting that conclusions of future change based on annual maximum streamflow may not be reflective of the processes that operate for more extreme floods that have the greatest impact on society keywords antecedent moisture conditions soil moisture flood design runoff precipitation elasticity 1 introduction the hydrometeorological drivers of fluvial floods are often conceptualised as the combined effect of heavy or flood producing precipitation events and the catchment s moisture conditions immediately prior to the heavy precipitation event although heavy precipitation is usually recognised as the dominant driver of most fluvial floods the catchment s antecedent moisture conditions amc can have a strong modulating influence on the extent to which a heavy precipitation event will lead to a flood merz and blöschl 2003 for example many studies have shown that elevated amc can lead to increased flood magnitudes compared to average or below average conditions castillo et al 2003 merz and blöschl 2009 pathiraja et al 2012 schröter et al 2014 verhoest et al 2010 so that severe flood events may arise even from moderate precipitation events on saturated catchments conversely extreme precipitation may result in low or moderate flood events where the catchment is relatively dry therefore understanding the relative roles of both drivers is important not only for characterising the physical processes that lead to floods but also for developing projections of future flood hazard johnson et al 2016 the partitioning between flood producing precipitation and amc has implicitly formed the conceptual basis of a large variety of flood modelling approaches for example the rational method mulvaney 1851 represents peak flow rates as a function of rainfall intensity catchment area and a constant that integrates all other factors including the average effect of the catchment s antecedent moisture conditions event based rainfall runoff models also separate the two drivers with flood producing precipitation input as hyetographs into the model and the amc usually parameterised as losses dooge 1957 li et al 2014 pilgrim 1987 or initial conditions these loss parameters are obtained through calibration by relating excess precipitation to direct runoff and therefore are difficult to interpret in a physically meaningful way the implication is that although this class of model may be useful in a predictive sense when applied to events that are similar to those used to calibrate the model there are likely to be problems in extrapolation or for simulating a future climate when the joint relationship between flood producing precipitation and a catchment s antecedent moisture conditions may no longer be the same continuous simulation approaches that are based on soil moisture accounting represent an alternative and more explicit method to account for variations in the relationship between antecedent conditions and flood producing precipitation berthet et al 2009 brigode et al 2014 paquet et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2012 while continuous rainfall runoff models often treat amc in a conceptual manner they provide scope to improve flood estimates through their representation of the catchment water balance berthet et al 2009 garavaglia et al 2017 based on the large number of continuous models used to assess the role of a catchment s antecedent conditions there can be a wide range of responses to amc berthet et al 2009 brigode et al 2014 paquet et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2012 the variety of observations about amc suggests the need for multi model and multi catchment comparisons to establish the relative contribution of model structural differences and catchment specific effects garavaglia et al 2017 an alternative approach to understanding the relative effects of flood drivers is to empirically represent the association between flood producing precipitation and the catchment s amc on overall flood response although amc can be qualitatively defined as being related to a catchment s moisture stores prior to a flood producing precipitation event quantifying the combined influence of moisture stored in the catchment s soils lakes groundwater reservoirs and other stores e g snowpack on flood flows is challenging ali and roy 2010 vivoni et al 2007 to this end several amc definitions have been proposed in the literature james and roulet 2007 mishra and singh 2013 saxton 1989 usda scs 1985 one commonly used approach defines amc as the physically measurable soil moisture content in a catchment implying that it is the moisture stored in the catchment s upper soil layers that are likely to have the largest influence on flood runoff usda scs 1985 although this definition is physically based the practical interpretation of this definition and its relationship to flood risk is unclear huang et al 2007 for example the influence of the amc on flood risk is likely to be determined not only by the soil moisture profile throughout the unsaturated zone but also on the depth of the saturated zone the spatial distribution of soil moisture throughout a catchment vivoni et al 2007 storage levels in lakes large reservoirs and so on some of these features are difficult to measure and the combined effect of multiple moisture stores is challenging to represent in a single moisture indicator the lack of precision in defining amc therefore makes the concept difficult to exploit whether it is in terms of comparing datasets studies or models brocca et al 2009 hjelmfelt 1991 novotny 2003 silveira et al 2000 despite conceptual difficulties several studies have used empirical approaches to quantify the relationship between the amc and flood response biron et al 1999 bischiniotis et al 2018 fedora and beschta 1989 froidevaux et al 2015 uber et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 empirical approaches often use soil moisture measurements penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 or antecedent precipitation to represent a catchment s amc bischiniotis et al 2018 fedora and beschta 1989 froidevaux et al 2015 studies reliant on measurements of initial soil moisture typically near surface soil moisture often quantify the influence of amc on flow by examining associated runoff coefficients penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 however there is a lack of consensus on the influence of soil moisture on flow with studies showing varying results due to the requirement for measurements of initial soil moisture conditions studies typically examine relationships for single or small groups of neighbouring case study catchments with a focus on relatively frequent flow events penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 both of which limit the generalisability of results likewise challenges exist where antecedent precipitation is used as a surrogate measure of amc for example although the storage of water in a catchment is influenced by fluxes over many time scales antecedent precipitation based investigations typically focus on shorter antecedent timescales from days to weeks fedora and beschta 1989 froidevaux et al 2015 and do not consider longer monthly to seasonal time scales or catchment specific features that may affect a catchment s moisture storage to better understand the relative roles of flood producing precipitation and amc on flood runoff this paper presents a new empirical approach to event delineation that has minimal reliance on assumptions embedded in flood models this approach focuses on flood volumes to analyse the water balance and enable the estimation of event based runoff coefficients in this approach flood flow events are characterised according to the total runoff volume and flood producing precipitation is characterised as the total precipitation over an equivalent duration as the flow event amc is similarly represented by a weighted average of the antecedent precipitation depths where unlike other methods the timescale of the amc metric is calibrated to each catchment two empirical metrics are then introduced to quantify the influence of amc on flood volumes the first examines the range of responses in flood volume to amc for a given flood producing precipitation event termed the antecedent effect ratio and the second explores changes in flood volume relative to changes in amc termed the elasticity of flood volume to the amc this latter metric is especially relevant to questions regarding the composition of future flow events the benefits of this empirical approach are that it overcomes sensitivity to the choice of hydrological model and does not require definition of the amc in terms of the moisture in the catchment the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 1 sets out the event delineation algorithm in which sub daily flows are used as the basis for delimiting events to enable a more rigorous event separation method that accounts both for rainfall characteristics as well as catchment features when compared to conventional precipitation based approaches subsequently the antecedent precipitation measure is defined as a surrogate for amc and two metrics are introduced that quantify the influence of amc on flood flow events section 2 2 this empirical study of amc is conducted using 100 catchments having hourly streamflow and precipitation across a wide range of climatic conditions in australia section 3 with results presented in section 4 finally sections 5 and 6 present discussions and conclusions respectively 2 methodology to quantify the effect of amc on a flood flow event in conjunction with an associated flood producing precipitation event it is necessary to first define the characteristics of an event two empirical metrics are then introduced that describe different aspects of the relationship between amc and flood flow events the first is a new metric developed to represent this relationship as a measure of the influence of amc on flows for that catchment the second describes the proportional change in flow for a change in flood producing precipitation or amc together these metrics provide an indication of the extent to which a catchment s amc influences flood volume 2 1 delineation of flood events flood producing precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions a common approach to event definition is to use a precipitation threshold and a time criterion for example precipitation greater than 10 mm with less than 1 5 h of intra event dry period chahinian et al 2005 other variations on this approach can be found for example greater than 6 mm with less than a 6 h dry gap penna et al 2011 these definitions assume that precipitation and its features amount and wet dry pattern are the sole determinant of flooding and do not consider catchment specific features that might affect flood response times such as catchment size an alternative definition is therefore proposed for this study and is designed to use streamflow time series as the basis for delineation thereby accounting for both rainfall patterns and catchment physiography use an n largest approach rather than numerical thresholds for delineation thereby accounting for the significant differences in relative flood magnitudes between catchments avoid reliance on event based or continuous hydrological models and therefore is not subject to the assumptions embedded in those models and mimic how events would be delineated by an expert hydrologist while enabling automation for application across large numbers of catchments of different sizes and across different climate zones the overarching aim of this new definition is to provide a much more physically interpretable separation of flood producing and antecedent precipitation in order to provide a solid quantitative basis for investigating how amc influences flooding 2 1 1 defining a flood event and associated flood producing precipitation the approach for delineating both historical flood events and the precipitation events that lead to those floods is given as algorithm 1 the approach was designed to address both single and multi peak events and was developed on the philosophy that it is the responsiveness of the catchments rather than purely precipitation based approaches that should be the basis for identifying both the flood producing precipitation event and the antecedent processes that lead to the event the implementation of the algorithm is illustrated in fig 1 algorithm 1 delineation of flood and flood producing precipitation events 1 set the number of events to be extracted select the desired number of events to be extracted such that there are on average a given number of flow events defined by peak discharge extracted per year for example if one flow per year on average was to be extracted at a site with 30 years of data then the 30 largest events are extracted 2 divide flow into direct runoff and baseflow contributions separate the direct runoff and baseflow using a hydrograph separation approach here the lyne and hollick 1979 recursive digital filter is selected due to its reproducibility ease of implementation and widespread use in australia ladson et al 2013 furthermore past studies found the approach versatile and in good agreement with other baseflow separation methods including methods based on using electrical conductivity as a natural tracer nathan and mcmahon 1990 uber et al 2018 the ecohydrology r package was used to perform the hydrograph separation fuka et al 2014 the baseflow filter parameter α was set to 0 925 with three passes based on standard recommendations ladson et al 2013 murphy et al 2009 nathan and mcmahon 1990 3 identify the largest peak discharge over the period of record identify the single largest peak flow from the original flow time series baseflow and direct runoff components combined see point i in fig 1 4 delineate the beginning and end of the flow event corresponding to the peak discharge extend the event from the point of the peak discharge forwards and backwards until a direct runoff falls below a pre determined low flow threshold fig 1 see points ii and then b a moving average of the flow series reaches an inflection point fig 1 see points iii the 95th percentile of the direct runoff time series is adopted as the low flow threshold after testing showed the results were not highly sensitive to this parameter the moving average was set to be the length of the catchment s time of concentration calculated using the pilgrim mcdermott formula mcdermott and pilgrim 1982 so that minor fluctuations in flows do not overly influence the delineation algorithm 5 locate the next largest peak discharge in record after accounting for delineated event s locate the next largest peak discharge for the whole record excluding all points relating to the previously identified flow event s and all points within 24 h either side 6 delineate the next largest flow event repeat steps 4 and 5 until the desired number of events identified in step 1 is reached 7 pair the identified flow events with corresponding flood producing precipitation events the flood producing precipitation event is defined as occurring for the same duration as the flood event but offset by the catchment s time of concentration to account for the time taken for precipitation to be converted to runoff see point iv in fig 1 this ensures that the length of the flood producing precipitation event is proportional to the response time of the catchment rather than an arbitrary definition of intra event precipitation dry periods chahinian et al 2005 this paper implements the event delineation procedure for between one and four events per year to investigate whether the relationships between amc flood producing precipitation volume and flood flow event volume change with the extremity of the extracted events in this analysis events with precipitation depths of less than 0 1 mm were removed 2 1 2 defining a measure of antecedent moisture conditions as a result of the difficulties in measuring the volume of antecedent moisture in the catchment this paper uses a measure of the precipitation depth prior to the flood producing precipitation events as a proxy for the amc antecedent precipitation is likely to be the dominant control of soil moisture at depths that impact on precipitation to runoff conversion pathiraja et al 2012 here antecedent precipitation is defined using the antecedent precipitation index api kohler and linsley 1951 which is the weighted precipitation depth in the n hourly time steps prior to the flood producing precipitation event 1 api i 1 n k i p t i where t is the starting time of the flood producing precipitation event p t i is the precipitation at time step i hours prior to the start of the flood producing precipitation event and k is an exponential decay coefficient here k is set to 0 997 pui et al 2011 which more heavily weights the antecedent precipitation occurring immediately before the flood producing precipitation event the antecedent precipitation period n is typically set to the maximum number of hours prior to an event for which the contribution of antecedent precipitation is considered significant pui et al 2011 in this study n is the period over which antecedent precipitation has the maximum influence on flood volume and is determined via calibration at each site to calibrate n a regression model that translates the combination of flood producing precipitation and antecedent precipitation to flood event volume is fitted for a range of given maximum antecedent lags 2 1 3 flood flow event model to support the investigation into the effect of amc on flood response a simple model was developed to determine flood event volume as a function of different combinations of flood producing precipitation and antecedent precipitation the model is as follows 2 q p a p i α p θ p f api where q is the flow event volume p is the flood producing precipitation event volume api is the antecedent precipitation depth f is the empirical cumulative distribution function of the antecedent precipitation depths for the site such that f api ranges between 0 and 1 and θ and α are regression coefficients the form of eq 2 was chosen to reflect the hypothesis that a catchment in its wettest state f api 1 will convert more rainfall to direct runoff compared to a catchment in its driest state f api 0 and thus for a given precipitation event the resulting flow could differ significantly the use of a relative measure of the amc via the cumulative distribution function rather than an absolute measure of antecedent precipitation depth was based on the heterogeneity of the catchments being investigated and the difficulty of identifying a universal measure of the antecedent moisture however this choice has important implications on the interpretation of any results as discussed further in section 5 the value of α represents the event based runoff coefficient when the amc is at its minimum value whereas the sum of α and θ is the runoff coefficient when amc is at its maximum value to fit the model at a site for a given antecedent precipitation length n the regression coefficients θ and α are calibrated to minimise the root mean squared error between observed flow event volumes and those modelled via eq 2 this is repeated for different values of n ranging from 12 h to 4368 h approximately six months to find the length that leads to the maximum influence of antecedent precipitation on flood volume for the catchment the majority of selected n values range between 84 and 3900 h as part of the optimisation procedure the residual errors were limited to 1 65 standard deviations which are equivalent to the 90 limits assuming residual errors are approximately gaussian at each site to avoid single event pairs having too much influence on the fit to evaluate the performance of the model eq 2 a comparison was made against a linear model that ignores the contribution of antecedent precipitation on flood flow events and assumes that flood producing precipitation alone is sufficient to model flood flow events this model is equivalent to eq 2 where θ is set to zero to avoid biases resulting from missing data events were not considered where greater than 10 of the data in the antecedent period was missing 2 2 evaluating the impact of antecedent moisture conditions on the translation of flood producing precipitation to direct runoff a preliminary evaluation of the extracted flood volume flood producing precipitation and antecedent precipitation events at each site showed that the amc had varying degrees of influence across different catchments to illustrate this effect fig 2 shows flood volume and flood producing precipitation volume pairs for a number of events extracted using algorithm 1 where the symbol colour represents the empirical cumulative distribution function of api as an indicator of the amc visual inspection of fig 2a shows differences in the flow response for a given flood producing precipitation based on the amc although there is some noise in the amc effect this can be seen as a transition from red drier to blue wetter in the fan of points in contrast fig 2b does not show a clear relationship between flow and amc magnitude with no clear colour banding the antecedent effect ratio aer is a metric introduced in the following section to represent this effect a second metric explores the elasticity of how flood volume changes relative to changes in both flood producing precipitation and the amc this latter metric is especially relevant to questions regarding the drivers of future flood events while many hydrological modelling approaches may reasonably account for antecedent moisture through calibration to historical floods the relationship between the amc flood producing precipitation and flood volume may not remain constant under a future climate and the elasticity metric helps determine the extent to which changes in amc are likely to affect changes to flood runoff 2 2 1 antecedent effect ratio aer fig 2a provides an illustration that for some locations the flood volume for a given precipitation event can vary substantially depending on the amc the antecedent effect ratio metric aer seeks to quantify this effect by describing the difference in catchment responses when the amc is wet and dry relative to median amc for a given flood producing precipitation event it is calculated as 3 aer q p a p i 90 q p a p i 10 q p a p i 50 where q p a p i n is the flow volume conditioned on a given precipitation event p and the n th percentile of the antecedent precipitation ap i n such that for example the f a p i 10 has a value of 0 1 this expression can be reformulated by combining eq 2 and eq 3 to obtain 4 aer 0 8 θ α 0 5 θ so that the aer can be calculated from the calibrated regression coefficients θ and α directly to evaluate whether the observed at site aer values are statistically different from zero a bootstrap with replacement test was conducted by preserving the relationship between flood producing precipitation and flood volume but resampling the relationship with the catchment s antecedent moisture conditions the test proceeds as follows let n represent the number of separate events extracted as part of the event delineation algorithm 1 and let z z 1 z 2 z n with z j q j p j a p i j denote the observed sets of flow q j flood producing precipitation p j and antecedent precipitation ap i j the aer calculated from this dataset is compared with the ae r obtained from bootstrapped datasets z b z 1 z 2 z n with z j q j p j a p i j which is repeated b 1 b times to generate confidence intervals with b 1000 for this experiment the antecedent effect is deemed significant for sites where the observed aer lies outside the 90 limits of ae r 2 2 2 evaluating the impact of changing antecedent moisture conditions on flood event magnitude elasticity an alternative measure of the effect of amc is obtained through an elasticity estimator that evaluates the proportional change in flow for a change in flood producing precipitation or amc previous studies have applied this metric at the annual timescale by considering the proportional change of annual flows relative to changes in annual precipitation directly from the historical data chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 similarly estimates of the sensitivity of flow response to potential evapotranspiration have been calculated using an elasticity estimator andréassian et al 2015 as an example of its interpretation a precipitation to flow elasticity of 1 4 indicates that a 1 change in precipitation is associated with a 1 4 change in flow the elasticity of flood volume to flood producing precipitation volume is shown in eq 5 while the equivalent metric for antecedent precipitation depth is given in eq 6 5 ε p m e d i a n q j q p p j p q 6 ε api m e d i a n q j q a p i a p i j a p i q where p j q j and ap i j are a flood producing precipitation volume a flood flow volume and antecedent precipitation depth respectively for each event and p q and api are the mean flood producing precipitation volume flood flow volume and antecedent precipitation depth respectively across all events at a given site to evaluate whether the antecedent precipitation to flow elasticity is statistically different from zero a bootstrap test was conducted to determine the range of elasticity values for which there is no association between paired flow volume and antecedent precipitation the test proceeds in a similar manner to the significance test of observed aer values by resampling the antecedent precipitation depths with replacement based on 1000 bootstrap datasets at each site from each bootstrap dataset z b the median ε api b is calculated 7 ε api b m e d i a n q j q a p i a p i j a p i q where q is the mean of q q 1 q n and ap i is the mean of ap i b ap i 1 a p i n this is repeated for all sites so that each site has b bootstrap estimates of ε api the 90 limits based on the bootstrap results are used for comparison with the elasticity metric calculated from the observed events such that the effect is significant where the at site elasticity is outside the 90 bootstrap limits 3 case study area and data the empirical analysis of the effects of amc on flood flows is supported by a database of catchments with extended sub daily streamflow records and sub daily rainfall data obtained from gauges located within or near the catchment the initial database for this study comprised 270 streamflow gauging stations murphy et al 2009 peel et al 2000 representing a wide range of landscape features and climate zones and with minimal upstream regulation records start as early as 1932 and end as recently as 2012 this set of catchments was then filtered by the following additional criteria presence of hourly or sub hourly precipitation gauges in or near the catchment and at least 20 years of concurrent hourly streamflow and precipitation data with less than 25 missing data the final dataset comprises streamflow and precipitation data from 100 catchments across australia fig 3 with combined records starting as early as 1952 and ending as late as 2010 the dataset also contains physiographic and climate information for the 100 catchments including mean slope and stream density m km2 ieaust 2010 murphy et al 2009 as well as average annual precipitation mm calculated from the corresponding catchment precipitation time series an indicator of extreme precipitation depth mm 24 h duration 1 annual exceedance probability precipitation bom 2016 average annual potential evapotranspiration calculated using morton s equation mm point and areal bom 2018 aridity index point and areal calculated as the ratio of average annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration dimensionless and a measure of precipitation seasonality calculated as the ratio of summer precipitation to annual precipitation dimensionless the selected catchments range in size from 7 km2 to 2670 km2 with a median catchment size of 225 km2 and span all of australia s major climate zones from arid and semi arid catchments in the interior summer rainfall dominated tropical catchments in the north and winter rainfall dominated temperate catchments in the south concurrent hourly streamflow and precipitation record lengths range from 20 to 46 years with an average site having approximately 29 years of data the locations and characteristics of the investigated catchments are summarised in supplementary material a 4 results section 4 1 presents an evaluation of the event delineation algorithm section 4 2 evaluates the influence of antecedent moisture condition on flood events via the aer and section 4 3 evaluates the influence of changing antecedent moisture conditions on flood flows due to the multitude of results across the different event extraction criteria 1 2 3 and 4 events on average per year only selected key results are presented in the main paper with a focus on the case where three events are extracted on average per year further detailed results for each catchment are shown in supplementary material b e 4 1 evaluation of the event extraction algorithm visual inspection of the event delineation showed reasonable performance across the 100 sites for the majority of events confirming that events could be delineated using the algorithm as a person would have manually performed by eye for all sites there was an improvement in the model fit eq 2 by allowing for the influence of the amc θ calibrated at each site compared to without the amc θ set to zero with all sites having a greater fraction of variance explained when amc was considered fig 4 this was seen for all numbers of events extracted 4 2 influence of antecedent moisture conditions on flood events the aer is introduced to provide a quantitative measure of the influence of antecedent precipitation on high flow events aer values were found to typically range between 0 2 and 3 2 across australia with the majority of catchments showing a moderate antecedent effect regardless of the number of events extracted to illustrate this effect two catchments are shown in fig 5 fig 5a shows a catchment having a moderate antecedent effect aer 0 63 and fig 5b shows a catchment with a low antecedent effect aer 0 26 the site with the larger aer fig 5a shows that the same flood producing precipitation can result in different flood volumes depending on the antecedent precipitation in contrast for the site with a low aer the impact of a larger or smaller antecedent precipitation depth is not apparent fig 5b scatterplots of flood event volume with respect to flood producing precipitation and antecedent precipitation for all catchments and numbers of events extracted are shown in supplementary material b e according to the bootstrap with replacement test the antecedent effect according to the aer was significant for 84 of sites where three events on average per year are extracted the number of sites that exhibit aer values outside the 90 bootstrap limits is decreased for cases where less than three events per year on average are extracted table 1 significant spatial variation is seen in the aer across australia fig 6 this spatial variation in aer magnitude was exhibited for all numbers of events extracted locations with higher aer magnitude suggest that based on historical records there is a broader range of flood response depending on the percentile of the antecedent precipitation the spatial distribution of the aer and the distribution of aer magnitudes across australia is shown in fig 6 for the case where three events per year on average are extracted considering sites where the antecedent effect according to the aer was significant according to the bootstrap with replacement test the aer values range from 0 2 to 3 2 with 1 of the catchments having aer 0 3 13 of the catchments having 0 3 aer 0 5 43 of the catchments having 0 5 aer 0 8 25 of the catchments having 0 8 aer 1 2 and 18 of the catchments having aer 1 2 for the case shown this indicates that the difference between expected flood volume conditional on a given flood producing precipitation event during high and low antecedent moisture conditions is more than half of the expected flow value in more than three quarters of catchments the spatial pattern of aer across australia and breakdown of aer values is similar for each events extraction threshold with the majority of catchments exhibiting an aer above 0 5 variations in aer magnitude with changing catchment properties were examined to identify factors that may influence the effect of amc on flow response the aer magnitude was regressed against each catchment property with results for all catchment properties given in table 2 including an indication of which trends are statistically significant at a 0 05 level of these five were significant and have been plotted for the aer in fig 7 these relationships and lack of relationships were consistent for all numbers of events extracted see table 2 with the exception of areal potential evapotranspiration that also exhibited a significant trend for two cases potential interpretation of these relationships is discussed in section 5 4 3 influence of changing antecedent moisture conditions on flood events elasticity the distribution of amc elasticity ε api and flood producing precipitation elasticity ε p is presented in fig 8 for the case where three events per year on average are extracted the median ε p of the 100 catchments is 0 91 indicating that a 1 change in flood producing precipitation results in a 0 91 change in flood volume the median ε api is 0 32 the median ε api lies outside the 90 bootstrap limits suggesting that a change in antecedent precipitation as characterised by api fig 8 will result in a small change in flow other event selection thresholds also exhibit median elasticity values of similarly small magnitudes in comparison to precipitation to flow elasticity to investigate potential factors that may influence the elasticity of flow volume to the amc and flood producing precipitation the at site elasticities ε api and ε p were plotted against their corresponding catchment properties not shown linear regression of each elasticity measure ε api or ε p against the chosen catchment properties was then used to help assess if there were any significant relationships at a 0 05 level this investigation demonstrated that ε p decreases with increasing catchment area and increases with increasing annual total precipitation aridity index point and areal and extreme precipitation 24 h duration 1 aep for all event selection thresholds where more events were extracted on average each year three or more events extracted on average each year a slight positive association is detected between ε p and catchment slope and a slight negative association is detected with potential evapotranspiration point and areal in contrast few significant relationships were detected in ε api with the catchment properties a slight negative association was detected between ε api and annual total precipitation and aridity index point and areal but only for some event selection thresholds elasticity was evaluated with respect to the number of events extracted on average per year for both antecedent precipitation and flood producing precipitation table 3 shows the change in both median ε api and ε p with a changing number of events extracted as the number of events extracted per year is increased ε api and ε p increase in all cases the median ε p is greater than median ε api demonstrating that a greater change in antecedent precipitation than flood producing precipitation is required to produce the same change in flood volume however as more events are extracted on average each year the ratio of antecedent precipitation elasticity to flood producing precipitation elasticity e g ε api ε p increases table 3 this suggests that the influence of amc on flow may become less pronounced relative to the influence of event precipitation for more extreme flow events 5 discussion 5 1 the impact of variation in antecedent moisture conditions on flood volume the antecedent effect ratio aer metric was developed to quantify the impact of variations in amc on flood volume and was motivated by the observation that some catchments seem to be more heavily influenced by the events immediately prior to flood producing precipitation events than others fig 2 this is consistent with past empirical studies that showed varying sensitivity of flows to amc e g penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 suggesting differences in the dominant flow generation processes aer magnitudes across the 100 catchments ranged from 0 2 to 3 2 with the majority of catchments exhibiting aer magnitudes between 0 5 and 1 2 regardless of event selection threshold which means that the difference between runoff response at the 10th and 90th percentiles of antecedent precipitation was between 50 and 120 of the runoff response under median antecedent moisture conditions this indicates that the relationship between flood volume and flood producing precipitation depends heavily on antecedent moisture conditions in most catchments throughout australia when examining changes in aer as a function of both climate conditions and physiographic features it was found that catchments with higher aer values tended to be drier than catchments with lower aer values with less rainfall higher evapotranspiration and a lower aridity index and also tended to have larger areas it is possible that the cause of drier catchments having higher aer values is due to the broader range of amc values particularly at the lower end i e arid catchments are likely to have longer periods of low rainfall and thus get much drier than more humid catchments and that this will affect the outcome given the use of an empirical cumulative distribution function of the amc as part of the aer metric here the conversion to an empirical cumulative distribution function was necessary given the difficulties associated with defining an absolute precipitation based measure of amc given the heterogeneities of climate zones and flood generating processes across the australian catchments see section 3 it is noted that a detailed causal assessment of the climatic and or physiographic drivers of aer is unlikely to be possible based on a purely empirical analysis such as that presented here as there are significant interactions not only between the climate drivers e g precipitation evapotranspiration and aridity and flood volume but also between the climate drivers and physiographic variables such as catchment area with the largest catchments often in arid regions these interactions can confound causal analyses and suggest that modelling studies that can isolate individual effects are likely to be required to further understand the controls of how antecedent moisture affects the flood producing precipitation and flood volume relationship nevertheless given the large number of alternative modelling approaches that are available for this causal analysis conceptual versus physically based event based versus continuous etc the empirical relationships between antecedent precipitation and flood volume and how these vary as a function of climatic and physiographic indices may provide a useful benchmark for model evaluation prior to conducting such causal studies 5 2 the importance of antecedent precipitation to flow elasticity this paper has demonstrated that amc have a statistically significant effect in terms of the response of a catchment to flood producing precipitation via the use of an elasticity metric eq 6 however the sensitivity of flow to changes in amc was demonstrated to be relatively small in comparison with the sensitivity to changes in flood producing precipitation for all event selection criteria see table 3 for example for the case where three events per year are extracted on average the median flow to antecedent precipitation elasticity was 0 32 whereas the median flow to flood producing precipitation elasticity was 0 91 overall the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation typically was found to be between 29 and 39 of the elasticity of flood volume to flood producing precipitation it may at first appear surprising that the elasticity results show a much lower influence compared to the aer however as discussed in section 5 1 the aer results may partially reflect the variability in the range of amc values across catchments with catchments exhibiting high aer values potentially exhibiting a broad range of amc conditions i e from very dry to very wet this is consistent with the finding that catchments with higher aridity tended to have higher aer values as these are the locations that tend to exhibit the strongest variations in overall stored moisture in contrast the elasticity definition is defined per unit of change in antecedent precipitation as measured through the weighted average precipitation depth in the time prior to the flood producing rainfall event the findings suggest that each percentage change in weighted antecedent precipitation depth will lead to a 0 22 0 37 change in flood volume the two metrics presented here aer and ε api can be used as diagnostics to aid the development of future models by assessing their ability to represent the relationship between antecedent precipitation and flood flow response under historical and future conditions together these metrics provide an indication of the importance of amc to the magnitude of significant streamflow events and the implications of any potential changes in amc on future streamflow this has implications for streamflow modelling under future climates as it allows for improved diagnosis of contributing mechanisms to the reliability of predictions where regional continental and or global streamflow models are able to simulate sub daily streamflow then the metrics presented here provide a basis for comparing simulated and observed statistics finally it was found that the relative importance of amc was seen to diminish with increasing flow extremity likely indicating different dominant process controls as only the largest one to four events per year on average were investigated further analyses would be required to ensure that conclusions regarding antecedent precipitation elasticity were maintained for the rarer flood events e g 20 year return period which are often those that lead to the greatest societal impacts to the extent that the well known discrepancies in global trend analyses for annual maximum flows e g do et al 2017 ishak et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2005 milly et al 2002 and annual maximum precipitation e g westra et al 2013 are explainable by trends in amc the declining relative importance of antecedent moisture for more extreme floods suggests that the results of flood trend studies at the annual maxima scale may not be reflective of results for rarer events 6 conclusions antecedent moisture conditions are widely understood as an important factor towards explaining differences in the translation of flood producing precipitation to floods but they can be difficult to study with floods arising from myriad combinations of hydro meteorological conditions ivancic and shaw 2015 leonard et al 2014 zscheischler et al 2018 while there are many modelling based assessments of antecedent moisture conditions this study has used a largely empirical approach as it does not require definition of the amc in terms of the moisture in the catchment and it separates sensitivities from specific modelling assumptions e g how losses are parameterised or soil moisture stores are represented within a hydrological model this paper presented a new approach to event delineation that has minimal dependence on modelling and is not reliant on the use of precipitation intermittency as the basis of event separation but rather it uses streamflow time series as the basis for delineation the philosophy behind this algorithm is that the responsiveness of a catchment should be the underlying basis for identifying the flood event and thus the separation between the flood producing precipitation and the antecedent processes that occur prior to that precipitation event the amc is then represented using a weighted precipitation depth prior to the flood producing precipitation events which allows for the consideration of longer time scales while not being sensitive to choice of how catchment moisture stores e g soil moisture groundwater lake and reservoir volumes are measured and aggregated this paper has demonstrated an empirical sensitivity in the flood flow response to antecedent precipitation via the use of two empirical metrics the first metric eq 3 termed the antecedent effect ratio aer which considers for a given precipitation volume the difference in flow volume after conditioning on the 10th and 90th percentiles of antecedent precipitation in other words it indicates the sensitivity of flow to different amc and provides a relative measure across catchments the majority of catchments had an aer above 0 5 indicating that the majority of sites can have a varying response to flood producing precipitation depending on amc the second metric elasticity eq 6 showed that the sensitivity of flow to changes in amc was relatively small in comparison with the sensitivity to changes in flood producing precipitation the median elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation varied with the average number of events extracted annually suggesting that the influence of changing antecedent moisture conditions may be important for less extreme flow events this finding suggests that differing levels of attention should be given to the influence of trends in amc on flood response depending on the extremity of flood flows this study focused on the relationship between amc and flow event volume rather than flow peaks or levels due to the importance of flood volumes for storage based design tramblay et al 2012 and the relative ease of interpretation in terms of event based runoff coefficients however for situations where peak floods are required factors such as the within storm duration and the temporal patterns of the flood producing precipitation event are likely to become important therefore alternative techniques like continuous simulation berthet et al 2009 brigode et al 2014 paquet et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2012 may be required to evaluate the influence of amc on peaks for these investigations metrics like the two presented here could be utilised to evaluate the ability of the hydrologic models to represent the relationship between antecedent precipitation and flood flow response under current and changing conditions finally the demonstrated sensitivities in terms of catchment s response to different amc via the aer metric and changes in a catchment s amc via the elasticity metric have important implications for flood estimation practice under both current and future climate conditions given that annual average rainfall and extreme rainfall may not change to the same extent or even in the same direction under a greenhouse gas enhanced climate for the flow magnitudes considered here although flood producing rainfall remains the dominant driver of flood volumes it is clear that antecedent effects cannot be neglected as part of flood

6899,the magnitude of floods depends not only on the intensity and pattern of precipitation during the flood event the flood producing precipitation but also on the moisture stored in the catchment which arises from antecedent hydrological processes over many preceding timescales to characterise this effect an empirical study is conducted on the influence of antecedent precipitation on significant flood events across multiple climate zones and catchment conditions using 100 australian catchments with hourly streamflow and precipitation antecedent conditions are shown to have a significant influence on flood volume with three quarters of catchments having at least a 50 difference in flood volume depending on whether the catchment is wet or dry before the flood producing precipitation event the study considers the sensitivity of flow to antecedent precipitation by means of an elasticity metric which indicates the proportional change in flow for a change in antecedent precipitation or flood producing precipitation flood producing precipitation nevertheless remains the dominant flood driver across most catchments with the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation typically being between 28 and 37 of the elasticity to flood producing precipitation importantly the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation relative to flood producing precipitation decreases with increasing event magnitude highlighting that conclusions of future change based on annual maximum streamflow may not be reflective of the processes that operate for more extreme floods that have the greatest impact on society keywords antecedent moisture conditions soil moisture flood design runoff precipitation elasticity 1 introduction the hydrometeorological drivers of fluvial floods are often conceptualised as the combined effect of heavy or flood producing precipitation events and the catchment s moisture conditions immediately prior to the heavy precipitation event although heavy precipitation is usually recognised as the dominant driver of most fluvial floods the catchment s antecedent moisture conditions amc can have a strong modulating influence on the extent to which a heavy precipitation event will lead to a flood merz and blöschl 2003 for example many studies have shown that elevated amc can lead to increased flood magnitudes compared to average or below average conditions castillo et al 2003 merz and blöschl 2009 pathiraja et al 2012 schröter et al 2014 verhoest et al 2010 so that severe flood events may arise even from moderate precipitation events on saturated catchments conversely extreme precipitation may result in low or moderate flood events where the catchment is relatively dry therefore understanding the relative roles of both drivers is important not only for characterising the physical processes that lead to floods but also for developing projections of future flood hazard johnson et al 2016 the partitioning between flood producing precipitation and amc has implicitly formed the conceptual basis of a large variety of flood modelling approaches for example the rational method mulvaney 1851 represents peak flow rates as a function of rainfall intensity catchment area and a constant that integrates all other factors including the average effect of the catchment s antecedent moisture conditions event based rainfall runoff models also separate the two drivers with flood producing precipitation input as hyetographs into the model and the amc usually parameterised as losses dooge 1957 li et al 2014 pilgrim 1987 or initial conditions these loss parameters are obtained through calibration by relating excess precipitation to direct runoff and therefore are difficult to interpret in a physically meaningful way the implication is that although this class of model may be useful in a predictive sense when applied to events that are similar to those used to calibrate the model there are likely to be problems in extrapolation or for simulating a future climate when the joint relationship between flood producing precipitation and a catchment s antecedent moisture conditions may no longer be the same continuous simulation approaches that are based on soil moisture accounting represent an alternative and more explicit method to account for variations in the relationship between antecedent conditions and flood producing precipitation berthet et al 2009 brigode et al 2014 paquet et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2012 while continuous rainfall runoff models often treat amc in a conceptual manner they provide scope to improve flood estimates through their representation of the catchment water balance berthet et al 2009 garavaglia et al 2017 based on the large number of continuous models used to assess the role of a catchment s antecedent conditions there can be a wide range of responses to amc berthet et al 2009 brigode et al 2014 paquet et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2012 the variety of observations about amc suggests the need for multi model and multi catchment comparisons to establish the relative contribution of model structural differences and catchment specific effects garavaglia et al 2017 an alternative approach to understanding the relative effects of flood drivers is to empirically represent the association between flood producing precipitation and the catchment s amc on overall flood response although amc can be qualitatively defined as being related to a catchment s moisture stores prior to a flood producing precipitation event quantifying the combined influence of moisture stored in the catchment s soils lakes groundwater reservoirs and other stores e g snowpack on flood flows is challenging ali and roy 2010 vivoni et al 2007 to this end several amc definitions have been proposed in the literature james and roulet 2007 mishra and singh 2013 saxton 1989 usda scs 1985 one commonly used approach defines amc as the physically measurable soil moisture content in a catchment implying that it is the moisture stored in the catchment s upper soil layers that are likely to have the largest influence on flood runoff usda scs 1985 although this definition is physically based the practical interpretation of this definition and its relationship to flood risk is unclear huang et al 2007 for example the influence of the amc on flood risk is likely to be determined not only by the soil moisture profile throughout the unsaturated zone but also on the depth of the saturated zone the spatial distribution of soil moisture throughout a catchment vivoni et al 2007 storage levels in lakes large reservoirs and so on some of these features are difficult to measure and the combined effect of multiple moisture stores is challenging to represent in a single moisture indicator the lack of precision in defining amc therefore makes the concept difficult to exploit whether it is in terms of comparing datasets studies or models brocca et al 2009 hjelmfelt 1991 novotny 2003 silveira et al 2000 despite conceptual difficulties several studies have used empirical approaches to quantify the relationship between the amc and flood response biron et al 1999 bischiniotis et al 2018 fedora and beschta 1989 froidevaux et al 2015 uber et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 empirical approaches often use soil moisture measurements penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 or antecedent precipitation to represent a catchment s amc bischiniotis et al 2018 fedora and beschta 1989 froidevaux et al 2015 studies reliant on measurements of initial soil moisture typically near surface soil moisture often quantify the influence of amc on flow by examining associated runoff coefficients penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 however there is a lack of consensus on the influence of soil moisture on flow with studies showing varying results due to the requirement for measurements of initial soil moisture conditions studies typically examine relationships for single or small groups of neighbouring case study catchments with a focus on relatively frequent flow events penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 both of which limit the generalisability of results likewise challenges exist where antecedent precipitation is used as a surrogate measure of amc for example although the storage of water in a catchment is influenced by fluxes over many time scales antecedent precipitation based investigations typically focus on shorter antecedent timescales from days to weeks fedora and beschta 1989 froidevaux et al 2015 and do not consider longer monthly to seasonal time scales or catchment specific features that may affect a catchment s moisture storage to better understand the relative roles of flood producing precipitation and amc on flood runoff this paper presents a new empirical approach to event delineation that has minimal reliance on assumptions embedded in flood models this approach focuses on flood volumes to analyse the water balance and enable the estimation of event based runoff coefficients in this approach flood flow events are characterised according to the total runoff volume and flood producing precipitation is characterised as the total precipitation over an equivalent duration as the flow event amc is similarly represented by a weighted average of the antecedent precipitation depths where unlike other methods the timescale of the amc metric is calibrated to each catchment two empirical metrics are then introduced to quantify the influence of amc on flood volumes the first examines the range of responses in flood volume to amc for a given flood producing precipitation event termed the antecedent effect ratio and the second explores changes in flood volume relative to changes in amc termed the elasticity of flood volume to the amc this latter metric is especially relevant to questions regarding the composition of future flow events the benefits of this empirical approach are that it overcomes sensitivity to the choice of hydrological model and does not require definition of the amc in terms of the moisture in the catchment the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 1 sets out the event delineation algorithm in which sub daily flows are used as the basis for delimiting events to enable a more rigorous event separation method that accounts both for rainfall characteristics as well as catchment features when compared to conventional precipitation based approaches subsequently the antecedent precipitation measure is defined as a surrogate for amc and two metrics are introduced that quantify the influence of amc on flood flow events section 2 2 this empirical study of amc is conducted using 100 catchments having hourly streamflow and precipitation across a wide range of climatic conditions in australia section 3 with results presented in section 4 finally sections 5 and 6 present discussions and conclusions respectively 2 methodology to quantify the effect of amc on a flood flow event in conjunction with an associated flood producing precipitation event it is necessary to first define the characteristics of an event two empirical metrics are then introduced that describe different aspects of the relationship between amc and flood flow events the first is a new metric developed to represent this relationship as a measure of the influence of amc on flows for that catchment the second describes the proportional change in flow for a change in flood producing precipitation or amc together these metrics provide an indication of the extent to which a catchment s amc influences flood volume 2 1 delineation of flood events flood producing precipitation and antecedent moisture conditions a common approach to event definition is to use a precipitation threshold and a time criterion for example precipitation greater than 10 mm with less than 1 5 h of intra event dry period chahinian et al 2005 other variations on this approach can be found for example greater than 6 mm with less than a 6 h dry gap penna et al 2011 these definitions assume that precipitation and its features amount and wet dry pattern are the sole determinant of flooding and do not consider catchment specific features that might affect flood response times such as catchment size an alternative definition is therefore proposed for this study and is designed to use streamflow time series as the basis for delineation thereby accounting for both rainfall patterns and catchment physiography use an n largest approach rather than numerical thresholds for delineation thereby accounting for the significant differences in relative flood magnitudes between catchments avoid reliance on event based or continuous hydrological models and therefore is not subject to the assumptions embedded in those models and mimic how events would be delineated by an expert hydrologist while enabling automation for application across large numbers of catchments of different sizes and across different climate zones the overarching aim of this new definition is to provide a much more physically interpretable separation of flood producing and antecedent precipitation in order to provide a solid quantitative basis for investigating how amc influences flooding 2 1 1 defining a flood event and associated flood producing precipitation the approach for delineating both historical flood events and the precipitation events that lead to those floods is given as algorithm 1 the approach was designed to address both single and multi peak events and was developed on the philosophy that it is the responsiveness of the catchments rather than purely precipitation based approaches that should be the basis for identifying both the flood producing precipitation event and the antecedent processes that lead to the event the implementation of the algorithm is illustrated in fig 1 algorithm 1 delineation of flood and flood producing precipitation events 1 set the number of events to be extracted select the desired number of events to be extracted such that there are on average a given number of flow events defined by peak discharge extracted per year for example if one flow per year on average was to be extracted at a site with 30 years of data then the 30 largest events are extracted 2 divide flow into direct runoff and baseflow contributions separate the direct runoff and baseflow using a hydrograph separation approach here the lyne and hollick 1979 recursive digital filter is selected due to its reproducibility ease of implementation and widespread use in australia ladson et al 2013 furthermore past studies found the approach versatile and in good agreement with other baseflow separation methods including methods based on using electrical conductivity as a natural tracer nathan and mcmahon 1990 uber et al 2018 the ecohydrology r package was used to perform the hydrograph separation fuka et al 2014 the baseflow filter parameter α was set to 0 925 with three passes based on standard recommendations ladson et al 2013 murphy et al 2009 nathan and mcmahon 1990 3 identify the largest peak discharge over the period of record identify the single largest peak flow from the original flow time series baseflow and direct runoff components combined see point i in fig 1 4 delineate the beginning and end of the flow event corresponding to the peak discharge extend the event from the point of the peak discharge forwards and backwards until a direct runoff falls below a pre determined low flow threshold fig 1 see points ii and then b a moving average of the flow series reaches an inflection point fig 1 see points iii the 95th percentile of the direct runoff time series is adopted as the low flow threshold after testing showed the results were not highly sensitive to this parameter the moving average was set to be the length of the catchment s time of concentration calculated using the pilgrim mcdermott formula mcdermott and pilgrim 1982 so that minor fluctuations in flows do not overly influence the delineation algorithm 5 locate the next largest peak discharge in record after accounting for delineated event s locate the next largest peak discharge for the whole record excluding all points relating to the previously identified flow event s and all points within 24 h either side 6 delineate the next largest flow event repeat steps 4 and 5 until the desired number of events identified in step 1 is reached 7 pair the identified flow events with corresponding flood producing precipitation events the flood producing precipitation event is defined as occurring for the same duration as the flood event but offset by the catchment s time of concentration to account for the time taken for precipitation to be converted to runoff see point iv in fig 1 this ensures that the length of the flood producing precipitation event is proportional to the response time of the catchment rather than an arbitrary definition of intra event precipitation dry periods chahinian et al 2005 this paper implements the event delineation procedure for between one and four events per year to investigate whether the relationships between amc flood producing precipitation volume and flood flow event volume change with the extremity of the extracted events in this analysis events with precipitation depths of less than 0 1 mm were removed 2 1 2 defining a measure of antecedent moisture conditions as a result of the difficulties in measuring the volume of antecedent moisture in the catchment this paper uses a measure of the precipitation depth prior to the flood producing precipitation events as a proxy for the amc antecedent precipitation is likely to be the dominant control of soil moisture at depths that impact on precipitation to runoff conversion pathiraja et al 2012 here antecedent precipitation is defined using the antecedent precipitation index api kohler and linsley 1951 which is the weighted precipitation depth in the n hourly time steps prior to the flood producing precipitation event 1 api i 1 n k i p t i where t is the starting time of the flood producing precipitation event p t i is the precipitation at time step i hours prior to the start of the flood producing precipitation event and k is an exponential decay coefficient here k is set to 0 997 pui et al 2011 which more heavily weights the antecedent precipitation occurring immediately before the flood producing precipitation event the antecedent precipitation period n is typically set to the maximum number of hours prior to an event for which the contribution of antecedent precipitation is considered significant pui et al 2011 in this study n is the period over which antecedent precipitation has the maximum influence on flood volume and is determined via calibration at each site to calibrate n a regression model that translates the combination of flood producing precipitation and antecedent precipitation to flood event volume is fitted for a range of given maximum antecedent lags 2 1 3 flood flow event model to support the investigation into the effect of amc on flood response a simple model was developed to determine flood event volume as a function of different combinations of flood producing precipitation and antecedent precipitation the model is as follows 2 q p a p i α p θ p f api where q is the flow event volume p is the flood producing precipitation event volume api is the antecedent precipitation depth f is the empirical cumulative distribution function of the antecedent precipitation depths for the site such that f api ranges between 0 and 1 and θ and α are regression coefficients the form of eq 2 was chosen to reflect the hypothesis that a catchment in its wettest state f api 1 will convert more rainfall to direct runoff compared to a catchment in its driest state f api 0 and thus for a given precipitation event the resulting flow could differ significantly the use of a relative measure of the amc via the cumulative distribution function rather than an absolute measure of antecedent precipitation depth was based on the heterogeneity of the catchments being investigated and the difficulty of identifying a universal measure of the antecedent moisture however this choice has important implications on the interpretation of any results as discussed further in section 5 the value of α represents the event based runoff coefficient when the amc is at its minimum value whereas the sum of α and θ is the runoff coefficient when amc is at its maximum value to fit the model at a site for a given antecedent precipitation length n the regression coefficients θ and α are calibrated to minimise the root mean squared error between observed flow event volumes and those modelled via eq 2 this is repeated for different values of n ranging from 12 h to 4368 h approximately six months to find the length that leads to the maximum influence of antecedent precipitation on flood volume for the catchment the majority of selected n values range between 84 and 3900 h as part of the optimisation procedure the residual errors were limited to 1 65 standard deviations which are equivalent to the 90 limits assuming residual errors are approximately gaussian at each site to avoid single event pairs having too much influence on the fit to evaluate the performance of the model eq 2 a comparison was made against a linear model that ignores the contribution of antecedent precipitation on flood flow events and assumes that flood producing precipitation alone is sufficient to model flood flow events this model is equivalent to eq 2 where θ is set to zero to avoid biases resulting from missing data events were not considered where greater than 10 of the data in the antecedent period was missing 2 2 evaluating the impact of antecedent moisture conditions on the translation of flood producing precipitation to direct runoff a preliminary evaluation of the extracted flood volume flood producing precipitation and antecedent precipitation events at each site showed that the amc had varying degrees of influence across different catchments to illustrate this effect fig 2 shows flood volume and flood producing precipitation volume pairs for a number of events extracted using algorithm 1 where the symbol colour represents the empirical cumulative distribution function of api as an indicator of the amc visual inspection of fig 2a shows differences in the flow response for a given flood producing precipitation based on the amc although there is some noise in the amc effect this can be seen as a transition from red drier to blue wetter in the fan of points in contrast fig 2b does not show a clear relationship between flow and amc magnitude with no clear colour banding the antecedent effect ratio aer is a metric introduced in the following section to represent this effect a second metric explores the elasticity of how flood volume changes relative to changes in both flood producing precipitation and the amc this latter metric is especially relevant to questions regarding the drivers of future flood events while many hydrological modelling approaches may reasonably account for antecedent moisture through calibration to historical floods the relationship between the amc flood producing precipitation and flood volume may not remain constant under a future climate and the elasticity metric helps determine the extent to which changes in amc are likely to affect changes to flood runoff 2 2 1 antecedent effect ratio aer fig 2a provides an illustration that for some locations the flood volume for a given precipitation event can vary substantially depending on the amc the antecedent effect ratio metric aer seeks to quantify this effect by describing the difference in catchment responses when the amc is wet and dry relative to median amc for a given flood producing precipitation event it is calculated as 3 aer q p a p i 90 q p a p i 10 q p a p i 50 where q p a p i n is the flow volume conditioned on a given precipitation event p and the n th percentile of the antecedent precipitation ap i n such that for example the f a p i 10 has a value of 0 1 this expression can be reformulated by combining eq 2 and eq 3 to obtain 4 aer 0 8 θ α 0 5 θ so that the aer can be calculated from the calibrated regression coefficients θ and α directly to evaluate whether the observed at site aer values are statistically different from zero a bootstrap with replacement test was conducted by preserving the relationship between flood producing precipitation and flood volume but resampling the relationship with the catchment s antecedent moisture conditions the test proceeds as follows let n represent the number of separate events extracted as part of the event delineation algorithm 1 and let z z 1 z 2 z n with z j q j p j a p i j denote the observed sets of flow q j flood producing precipitation p j and antecedent precipitation ap i j the aer calculated from this dataset is compared with the ae r obtained from bootstrapped datasets z b z 1 z 2 z n with z j q j p j a p i j which is repeated b 1 b times to generate confidence intervals with b 1000 for this experiment the antecedent effect is deemed significant for sites where the observed aer lies outside the 90 limits of ae r 2 2 2 evaluating the impact of changing antecedent moisture conditions on flood event magnitude elasticity an alternative measure of the effect of amc is obtained through an elasticity estimator that evaluates the proportional change in flow for a change in flood producing precipitation or amc previous studies have applied this metric at the annual timescale by considering the proportional change of annual flows relative to changes in annual precipitation directly from the historical data chiew 2006 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 similarly estimates of the sensitivity of flow response to potential evapotranspiration have been calculated using an elasticity estimator andréassian et al 2015 as an example of its interpretation a precipitation to flow elasticity of 1 4 indicates that a 1 change in precipitation is associated with a 1 4 change in flow the elasticity of flood volume to flood producing precipitation volume is shown in eq 5 while the equivalent metric for antecedent precipitation depth is given in eq 6 5 ε p m e d i a n q j q p p j p q 6 ε api m e d i a n q j q a p i a p i j a p i q where p j q j and ap i j are a flood producing precipitation volume a flood flow volume and antecedent precipitation depth respectively for each event and p q and api are the mean flood producing precipitation volume flood flow volume and antecedent precipitation depth respectively across all events at a given site to evaluate whether the antecedent precipitation to flow elasticity is statistically different from zero a bootstrap test was conducted to determine the range of elasticity values for which there is no association between paired flow volume and antecedent precipitation the test proceeds in a similar manner to the significance test of observed aer values by resampling the antecedent precipitation depths with replacement based on 1000 bootstrap datasets at each site from each bootstrap dataset z b the median ε api b is calculated 7 ε api b m e d i a n q j q a p i a p i j a p i q where q is the mean of q q 1 q n and ap i is the mean of ap i b ap i 1 a p i n this is repeated for all sites so that each site has b bootstrap estimates of ε api the 90 limits based on the bootstrap results are used for comparison with the elasticity metric calculated from the observed events such that the effect is significant where the at site elasticity is outside the 90 bootstrap limits 3 case study area and data the empirical analysis of the effects of amc on flood flows is supported by a database of catchments with extended sub daily streamflow records and sub daily rainfall data obtained from gauges located within or near the catchment the initial database for this study comprised 270 streamflow gauging stations murphy et al 2009 peel et al 2000 representing a wide range of landscape features and climate zones and with minimal upstream regulation records start as early as 1932 and end as recently as 2012 this set of catchments was then filtered by the following additional criteria presence of hourly or sub hourly precipitation gauges in or near the catchment and at least 20 years of concurrent hourly streamflow and precipitation data with less than 25 missing data the final dataset comprises streamflow and precipitation data from 100 catchments across australia fig 3 with combined records starting as early as 1952 and ending as late as 2010 the dataset also contains physiographic and climate information for the 100 catchments including mean slope and stream density m km2 ieaust 2010 murphy et al 2009 as well as average annual precipitation mm calculated from the corresponding catchment precipitation time series an indicator of extreme precipitation depth mm 24 h duration 1 annual exceedance probability precipitation bom 2016 average annual potential evapotranspiration calculated using morton s equation mm point and areal bom 2018 aridity index point and areal calculated as the ratio of average annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration dimensionless and a measure of precipitation seasonality calculated as the ratio of summer precipitation to annual precipitation dimensionless the selected catchments range in size from 7 km2 to 2670 km2 with a median catchment size of 225 km2 and span all of australia s major climate zones from arid and semi arid catchments in the interior summer rainfall dominated tropical catchments in the north and winter rainfall dominated temperate catchments in the south concurrent hourly streamflow and precipitation record lengths range from 20 to 46 years with an average site having approximately 29 years of data the locations and characteristics of the investigated catchments are summarised in supplementary material a 4 results section 4 1 presents an evaluation of the event delineation algorithm section 4 2 evaluates the influence of antecedent moisture condition on flood events via the aer and section 4 3 evaluates the influence of changing antecedent moisture conditions on flood flows due to the multitude of results across the different event extraction criteria 1 2 3 and 4 events on average per year only selected key results are presented in the main paper with a focus on the case where three events are extracted on average per year further detailed results for each catchment are shown in supplementary material b e 4 1 evaluation of the event extraction algorithm visual inspection of the event delineation showed reasonable performance across the 100 sites for the majority of events confirming that events could be delineated using the algorithm as a person would have manually performed by eye for all sites there was an improvement in the model fit eq 2 by allowing for the influence of the amc θ calibrated at each site compared to without the amc θ set to zero with all sites having a greater fraction of variance explained when amc was considered fig 4 this was seen for all numbers of events extracted 4 2 influence of antecedent moisture conditions on flood events the aer is introduced to provide a quantitative measure of the influence of antecedent precipitation on high flow events aer values were found to typically range between 0 2 and 3 2 across australia with the majority of catchments showing a moderate antecedent effect regardless of the number of events extracted to illustrate this effect two catchments are shown in fig 5 fig 5a shows a catchment having a moderate antecedent effect aer 0 63 and fig 5b shows a catchment with a low antecedent effect aer 0 26 the site with the larger aer fig 5a shows that the same flood producing precipitation can result in different flood volumes depending on the antecedent precipitation in contrast for the site with a low aer the impact of a larger or smaller antecedent precipitation depth is not apparent fig 5b scatterplots of flood event volume with respect to flood producing precipitation and antecedent precipitation for all catchments and numbers of events extracted are shown in supplementary material b e according to the bootstrap with replacement test the antecedent effect according to the aer was significant for 84 of sites where three events on average per year are extracted the number of sites that exhibit aer values outside the 90 bootstrap limits is decreased for cases where less than three events per year on average are extracted table 1 significant spatial variation is seen in the aer across australia fig 6 this spatial variation in aer magnitude was exhibited for all numbers of events extracted locations with higher aer magnitude suggest that based on historical records there is a broader range of flood response depending on the percentile of the antecedent precipitation the spatial distribution of the aer and the distribution of aer magnitudes across australia is shown in fig 6 for the case where three events per year on average are extracted considering sites where the antecedent effect according to the aer was significant according to the bootstrap with replacement test the aer values range from 0 2 to 3 2 with 1 of the catchments having aer 0 3 13 of the catchments having 0 3 aer 0 5 43 of the catchments having 0 5 aer 0 8 25 of the catchments having 0 8 aer 1 2 and 18 of the catchments having aer 1 2 for the case shown this indicates that the difference between expected flood volume conditional on a given flood producing precipitation event during high and low antecedent moisture conditions is more than half of the expected flow value in more than three quarters of catchments the spatial pattern of aer across australia and breakdown of aer values is similar for each events extraction threshold with the majority of catchments exhibiting an aer above 0 5 variations in aer magnitude with changing catchment properties were examined to identify factors that may influence the effect of amc on flow response the aer magnitude was regressed against each catchment property with results for all catchment properties given in table 2 including an indication of which trends are statistically significant at a 0 05 level of these five were significant and have been plotted for the aer in fig 7 these relationships and lack of relationships were consistent for all numbers of events extracted see table 2 with the exception of areal potential evapotranspiration that also exhibited a significant trend for two cases potential interpretation of these relationships is discussed in section 5 4 3 influence of changing antecedent moisture conditions on flood events elasticity the distribution of amc elasticity ε api and flood producing precipitation elasticity ε p is presented in fig 8 for the case where three events per year on average are extracted the median ε p of the 100 catchments is 0 91 indicating that a 1 change in flood producing precipitation results in a 0 91 change in flood volume the median ε api is 0 32 the median ε api lies outside the 90 bootstrap limits suggesting that a change in antecedent precipitation as characterised by api fig 8 will result in a small change in flow other event selection thresholds also exhibit median elasticity values of similarly small magnitudes in comparison to precipitation to flow elasticity to investigate potential factors that may influence the elasticity of flow volume to the amc and flood producing precipitation the at site elasticities ε api and ε p were plotted against their corresponding catchment properties not shown linear regression of each elasticity measure ε api or ε p against the chosen catchment properties was then used to help assess if there were any significant relationships at a 0 05 level this investigation demonstrated that ε p decreases with increasing catchment area and increases with increasing annual total precipitation aridity index point and areal and extreme precipitation 24 h duration 1 aep for all event selection thresholds where more events were extracted on average each year three or more events extracted on average each year a slight positive association is detected between ε p and catchment slope and a slight negative association is detected with potential evapotranspiration point and areal in contrast few significant relationships were detected in ε api with the catchment properties a slight negative association was detected between ε api and annual total precipitation and aridity index point and areal but only for some event selection thresholds elasticity was evaluated with respect to the number of events extracted on average per year for both antecedent precipitation and flood producing precipitation table 3 shows the change in both median ε api and ε p with a changing number of events extracted as the number of events extracted per year is increased ε api and ε p increase in all cases the median ε p is greater than median ε api demonstrating that a greater change in antecedent precipitation than flood producing precipitation is required to produce the same change in flood volume however as more events are extracted on average each year the ratio of antecedent precipitation elasticity to flood producing precipitation elasticity e g ε api ε p increases table 3 this suggests that the influence of amc on flow may become less pronounced relative to the influence of event precipitation for more extreme flow events 5 discussion 5 1 the impact of variation in antecedent moisture conditions on flood volume the antecedent effect ratio aer metric was developed to quantify the impact of variations in amc on flood volume and was motivated by the observation that some catchments seem to be more heavily influenced by the events immediately prior to flood producing precipitation events than others fig 2 this is consistent with past empirical studies that showed varying sensitivity of flows to amc e g penna et al 2011 uber et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 suggesting differences in the dominant flow generation processes aer magnitudes across the 100 catchments ranged from 0 2 to 3 2 with the majority of catchments exhibiting aer magnitudes between 0 5 and 1 2 regardless of event selection threshold which means that the difference between runoff response at the 10th and 90th percentiles of antecedent precipitation was between 50 and 120 of the runoff response under median antecedent moisture conditions this indicates that the relationship between flood volume and flood producing precipitation depends heavily on antecedent moisture conditions in most catchments throughout australia when examining changes in aer as a function of both climate conditions and physiographic features it was found that catchments with higher aer values tended to be drier than catchments with lower aer values with less rainfall higher evapotranspiration and a lower aridity index and also tended to have larger areas it is possible that the cause of drier catchments having higher aer values is due to the broader range of amc values particularly at the lower end i e arid catchments are likely to have longer periods of low rainfall and thus get much drier than more humid catchments and that this will affect the outcome given the use of an empirical cumulative distribution function of the amc as part of the aer metric here the conversion to an empirical cumulative distribution function was necessary given the difficulties associated with defining an absolute precipitation based measure of amc given the heterogeneities of climate zones and flood generating processes across the australian catchments see section 3 it is noted that a detailed causal assessment of the climatic and or physiographic drivers of aer is unlikely to be possible based on a purely empirical analysis such as that presented here as there are significant interactions not only between the climate drivers e g precipitation evapotranspiration and aridity and flood volume but also between the climate drivers and physiographic variables such as catchment area with the largest catchments often in arid regions these interactions can confound causal analyses and suggest that modelling studies that can isolate individual effects are likely to be required to further understand the controls of how antecedent moisture affects the flood producing precipitation and flood volume relationship nevertheless given the large number of alternative modelling approaches that are available for this causal analysis conceptual versus physically based event based versus continuous etc the empirical relationships between antecedent precipitation and flood volume and how these vary as a function of climatic and physiographic indices may provide a useful benchmark for model evaluation prior to conducting such causal studies 5 2 the importance of antecedent precipitation to flow elasticity this paper has demonstrated that amc have a statistically significant effect in terms of the response of a catchment to flood producing precipitation via the use of an elasticity metric eq 6 however the sensitivity of flow to changes in amc was demonstrated to be relatively small in comparison with the sensitivity to changes in flood producing precipitation for all event selection criteria see table 3 for example for the case where three events per year are extracted on average the median flow to antecedent precipitation elasticity was 0 32 whereas the median flow to flood producing precipitation elasticity was 0 91 overall the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation typically was found to be between 29 and 39 of the elasticity of flood volume to flood producing precipitation it may at first appear surprising that the elasticity results show a much lower influence compared to the aer however as discussed in section 5 1 the aer results may partially reflect the variability in the range of amc values across catchments with catchments exhibiting high aer values potentially exhibiting a broad range of amc conditions i e from very dry to very wet this is consistent with the finding that catchments with higher aridity tended to have higher aer values as these are the locations that tend to exhibit the strongest variations in overall stored moisture in contrast the elasticity definition is defined per unit of change in antecedent precipitation as measured through the weighted average precipitation depth in the time prior to the flood producing rainfall event the findings suggest that each percentage change in weighted antecedent precipitation depth will lead to a 0 22 0 37 change in flood volume the two metrics presented here aer and ε api can be used as diagnostics to aid the development of future models by assessing their ability to represent the relationship between antecedent precipitation and flood flow response under historical and future conditions together these metrics provide an indication of the importance of amc to the magnitude of significant streamflow events and the implications of any potential changes in amc on future streamflow this has implications for streamflow modelling under future climates as it allows for improved diagnosis of contributing mechanisms to the reliability of predictions where regional continental and or global streamflow models are able to simulate sub daily streamflow then the metrics presented here provide a basis for comparing simulated and observed statistics finally it was found that the relative importance of amc was seen to diminish with increasing flow extremity likely indicating different dominant process controls as only the largest one to four events per year on average were investigated further analyses would be required to ensure that conclusions regarding antecedent precipitation elasticity were maintained for the rarer flood events e g 20 year return period which are often those that lead to the greatest societal impacts to the extent that the well known discrepancies in global trend analyses for annual maximum flows e g do et al 2017 ishak et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2005 milly et al 2002 and annual maximum precipitation e g westra et al 2013 are explainable by trends in amc the declining relative importance of antecedent moisture for more extreme floods suggests that the results of flood trend studies at the annual maxima scale may not be reflective of results for rarer events 6 conclusions antecedent moisture conditions are widely understood as an important factor towards explaining differences in the translation of flood producing precipitation to floods but they can be difficult to study with floods arising from myriad combinations of hydro meteorological conditions ivancic and shaw 2015 leonard et al 2014 zscheischler et al 2018 while there are many modelling based assessments of antecedent moisture conditions this study has used a largely empirical approach as it does not require definition of the amc in terms of the moisture in the catchment and it separates sensitivities from specific modelling assumptions e g how losses are parameterised or soil moisture stores are represented within a hydrological model this paper presented a new approach to event delineation that has minimal dependence on modelling and is not reliant on the use of precipitation intermittency as the basis of event separation but rather it uses streamflow time series as the basis for delineation the philosophy behind this algorithm is that the responsiveness of a catchment should be the underlying basis for identifying the flood event and thus the separation between the flood producing precipitation and the antecedent processes that occur prior to that precipitation event the amc is then represented using a weighted precipitation depth prior to the flood producing precipitation events which allows for the consideration of longer time scales while not being sensitive to choice of how catchment moisture stores e g soil moisture groundwater lake and reservoir volumes are measured and aggregated this paper has demonstrated an empirical sensitivity in the flood flow response to antecedent precipitation via the use of two empirical metrics the first metric eq 3 termed the antecedent effect ratio aer which considers for a given precipitation volume the difference in flow volume after conditioning on the 10th and 90th percentiles of antecedent precipitation in other words it indicates the sensitivity of flow to different amc and provides a relative measure across catchments the majority of catchments had an aer above 0 5 indicating that the majority of sites can have a varying response to flood producing precipitation depending on amc the second metric elasticity eq 6 showed that the sensitivity of flow to changes in amc was relatively small in comparison with the sensitivity to changes in flood producing precipitation the median elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation varied with the average number of events extracted annually suggesting that the influence of changing antecedent moisture conditions may be important for less extreme flow events this finding suggests that differing levels of attention should be given to the influence of trends in amc on flood response depending on the extremity of flood flows this study focused on the relationship between amc and flow event volume rather than flow peaks or levels due to the importance of flood volumes for storage based design tramblay et al 2012 and the relative ease of interpretation in terms of event based runoff coefficients however for situations where peak floods are required factors such as the within storm duration and the temporal patterns of the flood producing precipitation event are likely to become important therefore alternative techniques like continuous simulation berthet et al 2009 brigode et al 2014 paquet et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2012 may be required to evaluate the influence of amc on peaks for these investigations metrics like the two presented here could be utilised to evaluate the ability of the hydrologic models to represent the relationship between antecedent precipitation and flood flow response under current and changing conditions finally the demonstrated sensitivities in terms of catchment s response to different amc via the aer metric and changes in a catchment s amc via the elasticity metric have important implications for flood estimation practice under both current and future climate conditions given that annual average rainfall and extreme rainfall may not change to the same extent or even in the same direction under a greenhouse gas enhanced climate for the flow magnitudes considered here although flood producing rainfall remains the dominant driver of flood volumes it is clear that antecedent effects cannot be neglected as part of flood
