25305,understanding the processes and consequences of habitat fragmentation is highly relevant since it represents a serious threat to biodiversity however fragmentation includes several facets that are difficult to dissect such as loss of habitat connectivity edge effects and habitat loss in this study we analyze by mathematical and computational means a single isolated component of habitat fragmentation the loss of connectivity the main novelty of our approach is that we consider the entire temporal process by which a continuous habitat gets progressively divided into two isolated patches for this purpose we present a new mathematical model our results indicate that in line with empirical evidence connectivity loss derived from habitat fragmentation could lead to either a decrease or an increase in total population abundance during the process we give some conditions under which the mentioned effects should occur we conclude that connectivity loss could exert strong influences on non equilibrium populations keywords biodiversity mathematical analysis population dynamics simulation 1 introduction biodiversity is being currently depleted at unprecedented rates cardinale et al 2012 butchart et al 2010 one of the main causes of such crisis is the fragmentation of habitat wu 2013 that consists of the division of a continuous habitat into smaller isolated pieces of habitat immersed into a matrix of human disturbed land fragmentation accounts for up to 75 biodiversity loss concurrent with a severe depletion of ecosystem services haddad et al 2015 habitat fragmentation is not a simple phenomenon at least there are three main sources of disturbance generated by such a process 1 loss of connectivity 2 habitat loss and 3 edge effect connectivity loss or fragmentation per se fahrig 2003 is understood as a process in which a single large patch is subjected to one or several divisions within it that leads to the formation of several smaller disconnected patches the geographical isolation of the remaining habitat impedes that certain species migrate between patches habitat loss results from the replacement of original suitable habitat into matrix hostile to most native species in which the fragments get immersed total area summed over all patches get smaller than original area edge effect results from increasing the length of border as a consequence of habitat division borders constitute the contact zone with the matrix and survival of species often decrease there because of an increased occupation of the matrix and because of increased antagonistic species interactions with natural enemies the relative contribution of each of the component factor to the total adverse effect reported for the fragmentation complex remains controversial however available evidence suggests that edge effect and habitat loss exert the largest effects and that the consequences of connectivity loss could be of minimal impact and indeed could also enhance population abundance fahrig 2003 as stressed in fahrig 2003 our understanding of the population consequences of habitat fragmentation has been hampered by the lack of distinction between the components of the fragmentation process besides this most previous analytical studies have studied habitat fragmentation through comparing two static states continuous versus fragmented habitat and have not dealt with this phenomenon as a genuine process in the course of this process connectivity loss progressively limits species dispersal shaping population dynamics prior to complete isolation of remnant patches see fig 1 in this study we isolate a single factor within the fragmentation phenomenon habitat connectivity loss to analyze its consequences on single species population dynamics moreover and unlike previous work we address the continuous nature of the fragmentation process for this we present and analyze mathematically a single species population dynamics model that covers the whole succession of system states from a to c in fig 1 in contrast to prior models that usually compare states a versus state c only disregarding the population dynamics driven by the processes occurring during fragmentation our aim is to understand under which circumstances if any connectivity loss by itself drives either transient or long term changes in population abundances the rest of this paper is organized as follows in the next section we present our model step by step ending with the general equations which represent the rates of changes in abundance when a population is being subjected to a loss of connectivity between two subregions then we present the main results of a mathematical analysis of our model next we show numerical results to show the model behavior in a population simultaneously subjected to habitat fragmentation and an independent periodic perturbation we end this paper with a discussion of our results 2 the model we will assume a deterministic and continuous time dynamics if the population is located in a habitat represented by a set ω t of the space at time t 0 whose measure e g area is given by m and the population abundance is denoted by x t then the population growth rate is governed by the differential equation 1 x t x t r d ω t where r is the time varying per capita growth rate as a function of population density d ω t given by the population abundance per unit area i e d ω t x t m ω t there is sufficient evidence of density dependent negative feedback see hixon et al 2002 sinclair 1989 tanner 1966 so that we will assume r being a decreasing function if a t is a subset of ω t and b t ω t a t is its complement then the total population abundance is equal to the sum of the abundances in each subset that is x a t x b t this equality expressed in terms of the growth rates is 2 x x a t x b t x a t r d a t x b t r d b t if d a and d b are assumed to be equal to d ω then eqn 2 reduces to eqn 1 on a time interval 0 t t 0 let us assume that a population is being subjected to the process of fragmentation during a subinterval t i t f 0 t i t f t this population is located in a habitat represented in mathematical terms by a region an open connected bounded and non empty set ω of ℝ 2 to represent the division of a continuous habitat into two isolated patches by the development of a discontinuity we assume that ω is the union of three disjoint sets two regions a and b and a common frontier γ a b sign indicates the boundary of which is an arcwise connected set moreover we assume that γ is the graph of a regular and simple curve α t i t f ω such that α t i and α t f exist in ℝ 2 ω writing γ t α s s t i t with t t i t f we have that at any moment t of the process the habitat is represented by the set ω t ω γ t note that we have a continuous habitat i e ω t ω for t t i because γ t i ϕ and a fragmented habitat i e ω t a b for t t f because γ t f γ then at t t i the population is in a unique patch ω but after the final instant t t f the population is distributed over two isolated patches a and b see fig 1 note that the loss of habitat at time t t i t f is γ t a set of measure area zero therefore our model considers only the loss of connectivity without habitat loss and without decreased habitat quality e g expressed as edge effect our interest is to develop a unified model equation for the population dynamics before during and after the fragmentation process which constitute the main novelty of this modeling exercise now we present equations for each of the major phases involved in the fragmentation process and then the general model for the entire process continuous habitat 0 t t i in this time interval the subregions a and b are only a conceptual division of ω and are fully connected see fig 1a if we assume that areas of measure zero never contain any individuals then the total population growth rate is 3 x a x b x a x b r d ω t 0 t i which is another form of eq 1 fragmented habitat t f t t in this time interval the zones a and b are physically divided by γ and isolated from each other to the migration of population members so they form two disjoint patches see fig 1c nevertheless there has been no loss of habitat in the process because m γ 0 then we have two decoupled ordinary differential equations governing the growth one for each patch that is 4 x a x a r d a x b x b r d b t t f t transitional phase t i t t f to model the population growth rate during the whole process of habitat fragmentation see fig 1b we present the following differential system 5 x a x a r d a b t x b x b r d a t b t t i t f where a b t and a t b is an extension of the zone a and b in a subset b t of b and a t of a to calculate the population density at a b t represents the area of influence of the demographic type of b at the instant t the same for b t respect to a note that a and b are functions from 0 t to the set of parts of a and b respectively such that a t 2 a t 1 and b t 2 b t 1 if t i t 1 t 2 t f in addition we have a t a and b t b for t 0 t i and a t b t ϕ for t t f t in this way the system 5 with t 0 t becomes a generalization of the whole fragmentation process modeled by 3 5 2 1 on the per capita growth rate the per capita growth rate r 0 as a function of the population density assuming no migration rates is the difference between per capita birth rate b and per capita death rate d where b d 0 0 are assumed to be analytic on their whole domain developing b and d in maclaurin series we obtain 6 b d b 0 b 1 d k 2 b k k d k and d d d 0 d 1 d k 2 d k k d k where b i and d i i 0 1 are positive numbers and b 0 d 0 we assume also that b is strictly decreasing and d is strictly increasing so that there is a density carrying capacity d ω such that b d ω d d ω 2 2 population densities in the transitional phase to express d a b t and d a t b of 5 in other more interpretable terms note that d a b t x a b t m a b t x a t x b t t m a m b t introducing the hypothesis that the population in the region b t is a fraction of the abundance in b equal to the ratio of the sizes of the territories we obtain 7 d a b t x a t η t x b t m a η t m b with η t m b t m b similarly the density d a t b is given by 8 d a t b x a t ξ t x b t m a ξ t m b where ξ t m a t m a 2 3 the unified equation replacing the population densities 7 and 8 in 5 we obtain explicitly the non autonomous system of differential equations 9 x a x a r x a η t x b m a η t m b x b x b r x a ξ t x b m a ξ t m b t 0 t where η ξ 0 t 0 1 are decreasing functions such that η t ξ t 1 for any t 0 t i and η t ξ t 0 for any t t f t the functions η and ξ can be interpreted as a measure of the degree of connectivity between the regions a and b at time t a value of one for η and ξ means full connectivity between these subregions and a value of zero means complete isolation between them due to the fragmentation hereafter for simplicity we assume that η and ξ are equal and differentiable 3 main results theorem 1 let x a x b be a solution of 5 such that x a t i m a x b t i m b then x a t m a x b t m b for each t t i t f in addition x a t x b t satisfies 3 proof the proof is given in appendix a biological interpretation 1 the equality condition in theorem 1 indicates that when the regions a and b have the same population densities at t t i these densities persist over time during the fragmentation in this case the fragmentation process exerts no effect on the total population abundance theorem 2 let x a x b be a solution of 5 such that x a t i m a x b t i m b χ a solution of 3 on t i t f such that χ t i x a t i x b t i and p x a x b t x a t x b t x a t m a x b t m b if p x a x b t i 0 resp then χ t x a t x b t resp for each t t i t i ε some ε 0 proof the proof is given in appendix b biological interpretation 2 theorem 2 states that the fragmentation process could generate a decrease in population abundance at least at the beginning of the process particularly when min 1 m a m b x a t i x b t i max 1 m a m b in addition theorem 2 shows the counterintuitive fact that there exist conditions under which the fragmentation process enhances the total population abundance for some time interval 4 highlighting consequences of fragmentation through numerical simulations in order to simulate numerically the trajectories of population abundance determined by 9 we will consider a specific case for the per capita growth rate r which is the well known verhulst pearl logistic form when the terms of higher order k 2 are null in 6 then b d b 0 b 1 d and d d d 0 d 1 d thus the per capita rate of growth r d b d d d is determined by the expression r d r 0 r 1 d where r 0 b 0 d 0 and r 1 d 1 b 1 with d 1 b 1 because r d b 1 d 1 0 due to the existence of the density carrying capacity d ω it is natural to think of a population level k ω that determines this density so k ω m ω r 0 r 1 such that r k ω m ω 0 is the carrying capacity of ω then eq 9 becomes 10 x a r 0 x a 1 x a η t x b k a η t k b x b r 0 x b 1 ξ t x a x b ξ t k a k b t 0 t where k c m c r 0 r 1 c a b are the carrying capacities of the subregions once the habitat fragmentation is completed in order to describe the global dynamics defined by the non autonomous system 10 note that we have only the natural equilibria 0 0 and k a k b which are also equilibria of 3 and 4 in asymptotic terms we have eq 4 where the origin is a repellor and k a k b is globally asymtotically stable to visualize the dynamics on the interval t i t f we divide the set of states into six zones according to table 11 and fig 2 where l respectively l means to be below respectively above the line l x a x b k a k b 11 then given a point x a x b in some z i i 1 6 at some time t t i t f we present in table 12 an overview of the signs of x a t and x b t at the same instant 12 in 12 a double sign separated by in an entry means that the first sign corresponds to a first subinterval and the next sign in the complementary interval see fig 2 note that reordering the terms of 10 the signs of x a and x b are given respectively by the signs of f k a x a η k b x b and g η k a x a k b x b in z 1 we have k a x a 0 and k b x b 0 which are positive numbers in z 2 the argument is similar and x a and x b are negative in z 3 we have x a k a x b k b and k a k b x a x b 0 since f is equal to k a k b x a x b x b k b 1 η we obtain that x a is positive in order to determine the sign of x b note that λ x b k b k a x a is a positive number less than one so there exists t 1 0 1 such that if t t 1 respectively t t 1 then η λ respectively η λ since g η λ k a x a we have x b 0 respectively if t t 1 respectively in z 4 we have that f is equal to η x a x b k a k b 1 η x a k a 1 η a negative number and so x a 0 on the other hand λ k b x b x a k a 1 and g λ η x a k a note that t t 1 respectively implies η λ respectively i e x b 0 respectively let us define q k a x a x b k b in z 5 we have f k b x b and g equals x a x b k a k b 1 η k a x a then x b 0 and x a 0 or x a 0 depending on whether q η or q η that is t t 2 or t t 2 where η t 2 q finally in z 6 since f and g are respectively k b x b η q and k b x b 1 η q it follows that x b 0 and x a 0 respectively if t t 2 respectively let us consider an interval of fragmentation t i t f 20 70 as a subset of a horizon time 0 t 0 100 we take the parameters that follow b 0 d 0 b 1 d 1 m a m b 2 10 1 10 1 100 4 100 180 30 note that with these parameters r 0 1 10 r 1 3 100 k a 600 and k b 100 assuming a linear connectivity function η t ξ t t f t t f t i t t i t f and initial conditions x a 0 100 and x b 0 50 fig 3 compares the total abundances of the cases with and without fragmentation note that x a 20 312 and x b 20 156 then 1 6 m b m a x b 20 x a 20 1 which is consistent with theorem 2 part b more details on the behavior of an alternative model of r are given in appendix c from theorem 2 it follows that the largest effects exerted by the fragmentation process on population abundances are exhibited well before the system reach the steady state in this section we analyze by numerical means how habitat fragmentation affects the long term behavior of a population that is periodically perturbed in its death rate at migration instance for this goal we will use a modified version of system 10 13 x a t r 0 x a t 1 x a t η t x b t k a η t k b x b t r 0 x b t 1 x a t η t x b t k a η t k b t τ k t i t f t 0 t 1 x a t 1 p x a t qx b t μ x a t x b t 1 q x b t px a t μ x b t t τ k t i t f t 0 t 1 this is an impulsive system córdova lepe 2007 del valle et al 2012 that exhibits logistic population growth with the same intrinsic growth rate r 0 in the two patches at certain time instants τ k equally spaced during the transition phase of the fragmentation process fractions p and q of subpopulations in a and b migrate to the other patch and some fraction μ in each subpopulation dies as a consequence of the perturbation with μ p q 0 system 13 reduces to system 10 using the time horizon t t 0 t 1 a linear connectivity function η t t f t t f t i with time values t 0 0 t i 0 t 1 t f 200 where r 0 1 10 r 1 3 10 and initial condition x a t 0 100 x b t 0 50 we performed computer simulations of system 13 to show some model behaviors fig 4 fig 4 shows how the negative effect of fragmentation on population abundance increases with perturbation intensity μ besides this the time interval between successive perturbation events δ τ also exerts a marked influence on the magnitude of the fragmentation impact on population abundance the range of δ τ for which fragmentation exerts its stronger negative effect increases with μ from near zero for the lowest μ values to intermediate values of about 20 40 time units for highest μ values these effects exerted by μ and δ τ were stronger with higher values of migration rates p and q fig 4c and d and with higher differences between carrying capacities k a and k b fig 4a and c note also that for low μ and high δ τ values we found that habitat fragmentation increased population abundance summed over the two patches even so this effect was slight in magnitude fig 4a d 5 discussion the analytical results of our study reveal that in general habitat fragmentation acting only through suppressing connectivity among regions affects the abundances of involved populations during some time interval a restricted case does not follow this rule when initial population density is homogeneous across habitat regions that will get isolated whenever population density is different between regions a and b at the beginning of the fragmentation process population abundances will be either enhanced or depleted by fragmentation before the population reaches its steady state based on our analysis we conjectured that given that the effects of habitat fragmentation are mostly exhibited in a transient phase of population dynamics they should be especially important in populations whose asymptotic dynamics is delayed by perturbations exerted during the fragmentation process therefore we performed numerical simulations on a version of our mathematical model aimed at highlighting the effects of habitat fragmentation in perturbed populations in a sample of the parameter space our numerical results confirmed our expectations showing that habitat fragmentation via connectivity loss could exert both negative and positive effects on total population density although the positive effects are expected to be of low intensity in perturbed populations strong adverse effects of habitat fragmentation are evident the magnitude of these effects was markedly dependent on perturbation intensity and frequency but also on migration rates and heterogeneity in the carrying capacities of the patches in general terms our analytical and numerical results suggest that habitat fragmentation in their more restricted sense connectivity loss independent on habitat loss edge effects and other related processes exert important and most likely adverse effects on population abundances the process of habitat fragmentation involves a set of phenomena besides the isolation of habitat regions per se among the most important ones habitat loss and edge effects are known to exert severe effects on biodiversity fahrig 2003 haddad et al 2015 nevertheless the empirical studies show conflicting results respect to the main effect of habitat fragmentation and connectivity loss as a driver of biodiversity changes debinski and holt 2000 ibá nez et al 2014 in particular it has been found that connectivity loss once isolated from habitat loss and degradation can exert either negative null or indeed positive effects on populations caley julian et al 2001 fahrig 2003 as our model predicts however for a large portion of the parameter space habitat fragmentation via loss of connectivity exerts negative effects on population abundance this was particularly evident when the simulated population was subjected to periodic perturbations so extending its transient phase recently haddad et al 2015 reviewed the best available experimental results reporting various ecological effects of fragmentation including population abundances of species the experiments were conducted on evergreen broadleaf forests the biological dynamics of forest fragments project bdffp brazil initiated in the early 1980s and the wog wog habitat fragmentation experiment ww australia initiated in 1987 shrub kansas fragmentation experiment kfe usa initiated in 1984 and grassland savannah river site experiment srs usa initiated in 1993 and the moss fragmentation experiments mfe uk and canada initiated in 1995 ecosystems see details in haddad et al 2015 all these studies reported results from long term experiments 20 years which covered entire ecosystems from a total of eight results on population abundances six of them gave negative effects while other two gave positive effects decreases in abundances as a result of habitat fragmentation were observed in birds bdffp spiders kfe insects kfe butterflies srs plants srs and microarthropods mfe on the other hand increases in abundance driven by fragmentation were observed in plants kfe and beetles ww however when the effect of connectivity loss was isolated there was a clear trend toward negative effects in line with our findings our results suggest that habitat connectivity loss can be a cause of strong impact on population abundance in stochastic environments where the occurrence of perturbations of diverse nature is the rule and not the exception of course for this effect to occur fragmentation should impede movements of individuals across non connected patches as claimed in caley julian et al 2001 there could be species whose organisms are insensitive to fragmentation due to their high mobility therefore the same physical force of habitat division could affect the connectivity of species among patches in diverse degrees this study opens opportunities for extending our model to more realistic scenarios such as multispecific assemblages with varying degrees of organism s mobility simultaneous habitat divisions that occur at different rates and including other environmental phenomena that often co occur with habitat division such as habitat loss degradation and biological invasions fragmentation of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will continue to occur on earth for which it is necessary to develop a deeper understanding of the nature underlying mechanisms and ecological consequences of this process in order to build a more solid explanatory and predictive theory of habitat fragmentation useful also for designing better management practices 6 code availability for simulation analysis we

25305,understanding the processes and consequences of habitat fragmentation is highly relevant since it represents a serious threat to biodiversity however fragmentation includes several facets that are difficult to dissect such as loss of habitat connectivity edge effects and habitat loss in this study we analyze by mathematical and computational means a single isolated component of habitat fragmentation the loss of connectivity the main novelty of our approach is that we consider the entire temporal process by which a continuous habitat gets progressively divided into two isolated patches for this purpose we present a new mathematical model our results indicate that in line with empirical evidence connectivity loss derived from habitat fragmentation could lead to either a decrease or an increase in total population abundance during the process we give some conditions under which the mentioned effects should occur we conclude that connectivity loss could exert strong influences on non equilibrium populations keywords biodiversity mathematical analysis population dynamics simulation 1 introduction biodiversity is being currently depleted at unprecedented rates cardinale et al 2012 butchart et al 2010 one of the main causes of such crisis is the fragmentation of habitat wu 2013 that consists of the division of a continuous habitat into smaller isolated pieces of habitat immersed into a matrix of human disturbed land fragmentation accounts for up to 75 biodiversity loss concurrent with a severe depletion of ecosystem services haddad et al 2015 habitat fragmentation is not a simple phenomenon at least there are three main sources of disturbance generated by such a process 1 loss of connectivity 2 habitat loss and 3 edge effect connectivity loss or fragmentation per se fahrig 2003 is understood as a process in which a single large patch is subjected to one or several divisions within it that leads to the formation of several smaller disconnected patches the geographical isolation of the remaining habitat impedes that certain species migrate between patches habitat loss results from the replacement of original suitable habitat into matrix hostile to most native species in which the fragments get immersed total area summed over all patches get smaller than original area edge effect results from increasing the length of border as a consequence of habitat division borders constitute the contact zone with the matrix and survival of species often decrease there because of an increased occupation of the matrix and because of increased antagonistic species interactions with natural enemies the relative contribution of each of the component factor to the total adverse effect reported for the fragmentation complex remains controversial however available evidence suggests that edge effect and habitat loss exert the largest effects and that the consequences of connectivity loss could be of minimal impact and indeed could also enhance population abundance fahrig 2003 as stressed in fahrig 2003 our understanding of the population consequences of habitat fragmentation has been hampered by the lack of distinction between the components of the fragmentation process besides this most previous analytical studies have studied habitat fragmentation through comparing two static states continuous versus fragmented habitat and have not dealt with this phenomenon as a genuine process in the course of this process connectivity loss progressively limits species dispersal shaping population dynamics prior to complete isolation of remnant patches see fig 1 in this study we isolate a single factor within the fragmentation phenomenon habitat connectivity loss to analyze its consequences on single species population dynamics moreover and unlike previous work we address the continuous nature of the fragmentation process for this we present and analyze mathematically a single species population dynamics model that covers the whole succession of system states from a to c in fig 1 in contrast to prior models that usually compare states a versus state c only disregarding the population dynamics driven by the processes occurring during fragmentation our aim is to understand under which circumstances if any connectivity loss by itself drives either transient or long term changes in population abundances the rest of this paper is organized as follows in the next section we present our model step by step ending with the general equations which represent the rates of changes in abundance when a population is being subjected to a loss of connectivity between two subregions then we present the main results of a mathematical analysis of our model next we show numerical results to show the model behavior in a population simultaneously subjected to habitat fragmentation and an independent periodic perturbation we end this paper with a discussion of our results 2 the model we will assume a deterministic and continuous time dynamics if the population is located in a habitat represented by a set ω t of the space at time t 0 whose measure e g area is given by m and the population abundance is denoted by x t then the population growth rate is governed by the differential equation 1 x t x t r d ω t where r is the time varying per capita growth rate as a function of population density d ω t given by the population abundance per unit area i e d ω t x t m ω t there is sufficient evidence of density dependent negative feedback see hixon et al 2002 sinclair 1989 tanner 1966 so that we will assume r being a decreasing function if a t is a subset of ω t and b t ω t a t is its complement then the total population abundance is equal to the sum of the abundances in each subset that is x a t x b t this equality expressed in terms of the growth rates is 2 x x a t x b t x a t r d a t x b t r d b t if d a and d b are assumed to be equal to d ω then eqn 2 reduces to eqn 1 on a time interval 0 t t 0 let us assume that a population is being subjected to the process of fragmentation during a subinterval t i t f 0 t i t f t this population is located in a habitat represented in mathematical terms by a region an open connected bounded and non empty set ω of ℝ 2 to represent the division of a continuous habitat into two isolated patches by the development of a discontinuity we assume that ω is the union of three disjoint sets two regions a and b and a common frontier γ a b sign indicates the boundary of which is an arcwise connected set moreover we assume that γ is the graph of a regular and simple curve α t i t f ω such that α t i and α t f exist in ℝ 2 ω writing γ t α s s t i t with t t i t f we have that at any moment t of the process the habitat is represented by the set ω t ω γ t note that we have a continuous habitat i e ω t ω for t t i because γ t i ϕ and a fragmented habitat i e ω t a b for t t f because γ t f γ then at t t i the population is in a unique patch ω but after the final instant t t f the population is distributed over two isolated patches a and b see fig 1 note that the loss of habitat at time t t i t f is γ t a set of measure area zero therefore our model considers only the loss of connectivity without habitat loss and without decreased habitat quality e g expressed as edge effect our interest is to develop a unified model equation for the population dynamics before during and after the fragmentation process which constitute the main novelty of this modeling exercise now we present equations for each of the major phases involved in the fragmentation process and then the general model for the entire process continuous habitat 0 t t i in this time interval the subregions a and b are only a conceptual division of ω and are fully connected see fig 1a if we assume that areas of measure zero never contain any individuals then the total population growth rate is 3 x a x b x a x b r d ω t 0 t i which is another form of eq 1 fragmented habitat t f t t in this time interval the zones a and b are physically divided by γ and isolated from each other to the migration of population members so they form two disjoint patches see fig 1c nevertheless there has been no loss of habitat in the process because m γ 0 then we have two decoupled ordinary differential equations governing the growth one for each patch that is 4 x a x a r d a x b x b r d b t t f t transitional phase t i t t f to model the population growth rate during the whole process of habitat fragmentation see fig 1b we present the following differential system 5 x a x a r d a b t x b x b r d a t b t t i t f where a b t and a t b is an extension of the zone a and b in a subset b t of b and a t of a to calculate the population density at a b t represents the area of influence of the demographic type of b at the instant t the same for b t respect to a note that a and b are functions from 0 t to the set of parts of a and b respectively such that a t 2 a t 1 and b t 2 b t 1 if t i t 1 t 2 t f in addition we have a t a and b t b for t 0 t i and a t b t ϕ for t t f t in this way the system 5 with t 0 t becomes a generalization of the whole fragmentation process modeled by 3 5 2 1 on the per capita growth rate the per capita growth rate r 0 as a function of the population density assuming no migration rates is the difference between per capita birth rate b and per capita death rate d where b d 0 0 are assumed to be analytic on their whole domain developing b and d in maclaurin series we obtain 6 b d b 0 b 1 d k 2 b k k d k and d d d 0 d 1 d k 2 d k k d k where b i and d i i 0 1 are positive numbers and b 0 d 0 we assume also that b is strictly decreasing and d is strictly increasing so that there is a density carrying capacity d ω such that b d ω d d ω 2 2 population densities in the transitional phase to express d a b t and d a t b of 5 in other more interpretable terms note that d a b t x a b t m a b t x a t x b t t m a m b t introducing the hypothesis that the population in the region b t is a fraction of the abundance in b equal to the ratio of the sizes of the territories we obtain 7 d a b t x a t η t x b t m a η t m b with η t m b t m b similarly the density d a t b is given by 8 d a t b x a t ξ t x b t m a ξ t m b where ξ t m a t m a 2 3 the unified equation replacing the population densities 7 and 8 in 5 we obtain explicitly the non autonomous system of differential equations 9 x a x a r x a η t x b m a η t m b x b x b r x a ξ t x b m a ξ t m b t 0 t where η ξ 0 t 0 1 are decreasing functions such that η t ξ t 1 for any t 0 t i and η t ξ t 0 for any t t f t the functions η and ξ can be interpreted as a measure of the degree of connectivity between the regions a and b at time t a value of one for η and ξ means full connectivity between these subregions and a value of zero means complete isolation between them due to the fragmentation hereafter for simplicity we assume that η and ξ are equal and differentiable 3 main results theorem 1 let x a x b be a solution of 5 such that x a t i m a x b t i m b then x a t m a x b t m b for each t t i t f in addition x a t x b t satisfies 3 proof the proof is given in appendix a biological interpretation 1 the equality condition in theorem 1 indicates that when the regions a and b have the same population densities at t t i these densities persist over time during the fragmentation in this case the fragmentation process exerts no effect on the total population abundance theorem 2 let x a x b be a solution of 5 such that x a t i m a x b

proof the proof is given in appendix b biological interpretation 2 theorem 2 states that the fragmentation process could generate a decrease in population abundance at least at the beginning of the process particularly when min 1 m a m b x a t i x b t i max 1 m a m b in addition theorem 2 shows the counterintuitive fact that there exist conditions under which the fragmentation process enhances the total population abundance for some time interval 4 highlighting consequences of fragmentation through numerical simulations in order to simulate numerically the trajectories of population abundance determined by 9 we will consider a specific case for the per capita growth rate r which is the well known verhulst pearl logistic form when the terms of higher order k 2 are null in 6 then b d b 0 b 1 d and d d d 0 d 1 d thus the per capita rate of growth r d b d d d is determined by the expression r d r 0 r 1 d where r 0 b 0 d 0 and r 1 d 1 b 1 with d 1 b 1 because r d b 1 d 1 0 due to the existence of the density carrying capacity d ω it is natural to think of a population level k ω that determines this density so k ω m ω r 0 r 1 such that r k ω m ω 0 is the carrying capacity of ω then eq 9 becomes 10 x a r 0 x a 1 x a η t x b k a η t k b x b r 0 x b 1 ξ t x a x b ξ t k a k b t 0 t where k c m c r 0 r 1 c a b are the carrying capacities of the subregions once the habitat fragmentation is completed in order to describe the global dynamics defined by the non autonomous system 10 note that we have only the natural equilibria 0 0 and k a k b which are also equilibria of 3 and 4 in asymptotic terms we have eq 4 where the origin is a repellor and k a k b is globally asymtotically stable to visualize the dynamics on the interval t i t f we divide the set of states into six zones according to table 11 and fig 2 where l respectively l means to be below respectively above the line l x a x b k a k b 11 then given a point x a x b in some z i i 1 6 at some time t t i t f we present in table 12 an overview of the signs of x a t and x b t at the same instant 12 in 12 a double sign separated by in an entry means that the first sign corresponds to a first subinterval and the next sign in the complementary interval see fig 2 note that reordering the terms of 10 the signs of x a and x b are given respectively by the signs of f k a x a η k b x b and g η k a x a k b x b in z 1 we have k a x a 0 and k b x b 0 which are positive numbers in z 2 the argument is similar and x a and x b are negative in z 3 we have x a k a x b k b and k a k b x a x b 0 since f is equal to k a k b x a x b x b k b 1 η we obtain that x a is positive in order to determine the sign of x b note that λ x b k b k a x a is a positive number less than one so there exists t 1 0 1 such that if t t 1 respectively t t 1 then η λ respectively η λ since g η λ k a x a we have x b 0 respectively if t t 1 respectively in z 4 we have that f is equal to η x a x b k a k b 1 η x a k a 1 η a negative number and so x a 0 on the other hand λ k b x b x a k a 1 and g λ η x a k a note that t t 1 respectively implies η λ respectively i e x b 0 respectively let us define q k a x a x b k b in z 5 we have f k b x b and g equals x a x b k a k b 1 η k a x a then x b 0 and x a 0 or x a 0 depending on whether q η or q η that is t t 2 or t t 2 where η t 2 q finally in z 6 since f and g are respectively k b x b η q and k b x b 1 η q it follows that x b 0 and x a 0 respectively if t t 2 respectively let us consider an interval of fragmentation t i t f 20 70 as a subset of a horizon time 0 t 0 100 we take the

t f t i t t i t f and initial conditions x a 0 100 and x b 0 50 fig 3 compares the total abundances of the cases with and without fragmentation note that x a 20 312 and x b 20 156 then 1 6 m b m a x b 20 x a 20 1 which is consistent with theorem 2 part b more details on the behavior of an alternative model of r are given in appendix c from theorem 2 it follows that the largest effects exerted by the fragmentation process on population abundances are exhibited well before the system reach the steady state in this section we analyze by numerical means how habitat fragmentation affects the long term behavior of a population that is periodically perturbed in its death rate at migration instance for this goal we will use a modified version of system 10 13 x a t r 0 x a t 1 x a t η t x b t k a

2007 del valle et al 2012 that exhibits logistic population growth with the same intrinsic growth rate r 0 in the two patches at certain time instants τ k equally spaced during the transition phase of the fragmentation process fractions p and q of subpopulations in a and b migrate to the other patch and some fraction μ in each subpopulation dies as a consequence of the perturbation with μ p q 0 system 13 reduces to system 10 using the time horizon t t 0 t 1 a linear connectivity function η t t f t t f t i with time values t 0 0 t i 0 t 1 t f 200 where r 0 1 10 r 1 3 10 and initial condition x a t 0 100 x b t 0 50 we performed computer simulations of system 13 to show some model behaviors fig 4 fig 4 shows how the negative effect of fragmentation on population abundance increases with perturbation intensity μ besides this the time interval between successive perturbation events δ τ also exerts a marked influence on the magnitude of the fragmentation impact on population abundance the range of δ τ for which fragmentation exerts its stronger negative effect increases with μ from near zero for the lowest μ values to intermediate values of about 20 40 time units for highest μ values these effects exerted by μ and δ τ were stronger with higher values of migration rates p and q fig 4c and d and with higher differences between carrying capacities k a and k b fig 4a and c note also that for low μ and high δ τ values we found that habitat fragmentation increased population abundance summed over the two patches even so this effect was slight in magnitude fig 4a d 5 discussion the analytical results of our study reveal that in general habitat fragmentation acting only through suppressing connectivity among regions affects the abundances of involved populations during some time interval a restricted case does not follow this rule when initial population density is homogeneous across habitat regions that will get isolated whenever population density is different between regions a and b at the beginning of the fragmentation process population abundances will be either enhanced or depleted by fragmentation before the population reaches its steady state based on our analysis we conjectured that given that the effects of habitat fragmentation are mostly exhibited in a transient phase of population dynamics they should be especially important in populations whose asymptotic dynamics is delayed by perturbations exerted during the fragmentation process therefore we performed numerical simulations on a version of our mathematical model aimed at highlighting the effects of habitat fragmentation in perturbed populations in a sample of the parameter space our numerical results confirmed our expectations showing that habitat fragmentation via connectivity loss could exert both negative and positive effects on total population density although the positive effects are expected to be of low intensity in perturbed populations strong adverse effects of habitat fragmentation are evident the magnitude of these effects was markedly dependent on perturbation intensity and frequency but also on migration rates and heterogeneity in the carrying capacities of the patches in general terms our analytical and numerical results suggest that habitat fragmentation in their more restricted sense connectivity loss independent on habitat loss edge effects and other related processes exert important and most likely adverse effects on population abundances the process of habitat fragmentation involves a set of phenomena besides the isolation of habitat regions per se among the most important ones habitat loss and edge effects are known to exert severe effects on biodiversity fahrig 2003 haddad et al 2015 nevertheless the empirical studies show conflicting results respect to the main effect of habitat fragmentation and connectivity loss as a driver of biodiversity changes debinski and holt 2000 ibá nez et al 2014 in particular it has been found that connectivity loss once isolated from habitat loss and degradation can exert either negative null or indeed positive effects on populations caley julian et al 2001 fahrig 2003 as our model predicts however for a large portion of the parameter space habitat fragmentation via loss of connectivity exerts negative effects on population abundance this was particularly evident when the simulated population was subjected to periodic perturbations so extending its transient phase recently haddad et al 2015 reviewed the best available experimental results reporting various ecological effects of fragmentation including population abundances of species the experiments were conducted on evergreen broadleaf forests the biological dynamics of forest fragments project bdffp brazil initiated in the early 1980s and the wog wog habitat fragmentation experiment ww australia initiated in 1987 shrub kansas fragmentation experiment kfe usa initiated in 1984 and grassland savannah river site experiment srs usa initiated in 1993 and the moss fragmentation experiments mfe uk and canada initiated in 1995 ecosystems see details in haddad et al 2015 all these studies reported results from long term experiments 20 years which covered entire ecosystems from a total of eight results on population abundances six of them gave negative effects while other two gave positive effects decreases in abundances as a result of habitat fragmentation were observed in birds bdffp spiders kfe insects kfe butterflies srs plants srs and microarthropods mfe on the other hand increases in abundance driven by fragmentation were observed in plants kfe and beetles ww however when the effect of connectivity loss was isolated there was a clear trend toward negative effects in line with our findings our results suggest that habitat connectivity loss can be a cause of strong impact on population abundance in stochastic environments where the occurrence of perturbations of diverse nature is the rule and not the exception of course for this effect to occur fragmentation should impede movements of individuals across non connected patches as claimed in caley julian et al 2001 there could be species whose organisms are insensitive to fragmentation due to their high mobility therefore the same physical force of habitat division could affect the connectivity of species among patches in diverse degrees this study opens opportunities for extending our model to more realistic scenarios such as multispecific assemblages with varying degrees of organism s mobility simultaneous habitat divisions that occur at different rates and including other environmental phenomena that often co occur with habitat division such as habitat loss degradation and biological invasions fragmentation of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will continue to occur on earth for which it is necessary to develop a deeper understanding of the nature underlying mechanisms and ecological consequences of this process in order to build a more solid explanatory and predictive theory of habitat fragmentation useful also for designing better management practices 6 code availability for simulation analysis we

25306,lake taihu was chosen as a case for parameter uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of water quality simulation in large shallow lakes forty parameters in environmental fluid dynamic code model efdc were filtered and analyzed the results showed that parameters had a considerable influence on simulation and three groups of parameters related to algal kinetics i e pmc bmrc and prrc light kechl and temperature ktg1c were very sensitive for shallow lakes with frequent algal blooms light extinction due to chlorophyll a is also a sensitive parameter while the temperature effect coefficient for algal growth is sensitive for lakes with seasonal temperature variation sensitive parameters and their relevant uncertainty varied spatially for high nutrients and algae concentration subareas temperature was more likely to be a limiting factor whereas sensitive factors could be light in lower concentration subareas since most sensitive parameters were related to algae uncertainty in simulation increased with increasing algal kinetic processes over time and varied in different subareas lower nutrients and algae concentration subareas were more easily influenced by model parameters while nearshore areas were highly influenced by boundary conditions for better simulation of water quality variable stoichiometry phytoplankton models should be considered and zooplankton need to be integrated into the model explicitly rather than a fixed predation rate keywords key words lake taihu sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis water quality models 1 introduction water quality models wqms valuable tools of supporting water quality predictions have been widely applied in environmental management in recent years arhonditsis and brett 2005 li et al 2015a xu et al 2013 cerco and cole 1993 however the inherent uncertainty of these models is greatly influenced by factors including model structure uncertainty model input uncertainty model parameter uncertainty and measurement errors radwan et al 2002 with the development and application of performance computing technology many water quality models with good structure and complex parameters have been developed wang et al 2013b however an increasing number of parameters has resulted in a sharp increase in computational requirements and thus exacerbated the complexity of these models highly interactive parameter spaces and the nonlinear non monotonous objective spaces have increased the difficulty of calibration gupta et al 2000 herman et al 2013a b yi et al 2016 in order to improve the accuracy and rationality of model predictions and study the parametric uncertainty and sensitivity of models we conducted several uncertainty and sensitivity studies in different water bodies such as rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and coasts to identify subsets of important model parameters that significantly influence model outputs have been carried out muleta et al 2005 neumann 2012 yi et al 2016 amongst these studies large shallow lakes are often accompanied with complex hydrodynamic and eutrophication problems the simulation of water quality is difficult and few studies were conducted on parameters under different situations the hydrodynamic conditions in large shallow lakes are highly influenced by wind wave they are not like other deep lakes or reservoirs which may be driven by thermal stratification parameters related to wind and wave like wind drag coefficient were supposed to be sensitive parameters in simulation li et al 2015b some large shallow lakes also face serious eutrophication and algal bloom problems like lake taihu parametric uncertainty is considerable with parameters related to growth respiration and death of algae and zooplankton generally sensitive in lake eutrophication models omlin et al 2001 missaghi et al 2013 three factors i e nutrients temperature and light are considered to control the algal growth but the limitation factors are normally not so clear in many cases for example phosphorus was thought to be the limitation factors in lake taihu before but the influence of nitrogen is also quite important by recent researches tang et al 2016 paerl et al 2011 some typical large shallow lake models which have been analyzed with different methods showed that parameters related to light and temperature were significant for example in the venician lagoon pastres and ciavatta 2005 pastres et al 1997 and dian lake china yi et al 2016 parameters related to limitation factors will change according to real situation and sensitivities of these parameters need to be investigated sediment is also an important source of pollution and parameters related to settling velocity and mineralization were found to be sensitive in some models missaghi et al 2013 researches on different models of shallow lakes suggested that the adsorption constant was relatively important in the simulation of total nitrogen whereas mineralization and settling rates were sensitive to total phosphorus janse et al 2010 meteorological and hydrodynamic situations pollutant inflow and bathymetric variance in lakes and reservoirs results in inherent temporal and spatial variability in water quality missaghi et al 2013 in a multi dimensional model formulated by physical chemical and biological processes model behavior may vary across the spatial domain whilst time dependency should also be considered because of time varying sensitivities herman et al 2013a b wang et al 2013a however few studies involving complex water quality models of multi dimensional lakes or reservoirs have been conducted on this problem in this research we choose lake taihu a large shallow lake the third largest freshwater lake in china as an example to make relevant analysis the water quality module of the environmental fluid dynamic code efdc was chosen for the simulation and water quality indicators such as ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen phosphate and chlorophyll a as model outputs the objectives of this study were thus to 1 quantify the sensitivity of parameters in simulation of water quality model and evaluate uncertainty caused by it 2 analyze the spatial temporal variability of uncertainty and sensitivity and 3 compare with other lakes and extend the result to a larger modelling community the results can be utilized in the design of a reasonable water quality model for large shallow lakes and improve the efficiency of calibration of such models 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area lake taihu longitude 119 08ʹ 122 55ʹe latitude 30 05ʹ 32 08ʹn is the third largest shallow freshwater lake in china with a surface area of 2338 km2 and a catchment area of 36 500 km2 zhu et al 2007 the average depth of the lake is 1 9 m and the maximum depth is 2 6 m corresponding to an elevation of 3 0 m a s l qin 2009 the floor of the lake features flat terrain with an average topographic gradient of 0 0ʹ19 66ʺ lake taihu has complex shoreline geometry and is connected to 172 rivers or channels qin 2009 and the mean hydraulic retention time is about 300d the water quality of the lake is seriously deteriorated nuisance algal blooms often occur in summer and early fall in most lake areas especially meiliang bay and zhushan bay the blooms are considered to be the result of a combination of high nutrient loading and weak hydrodynamics mao et al 2008 for the convenience of management and monitoring lake taihu have been divided into eight subareas liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 three subareas i e meiliang bay central zone and southwest zone represent bay central and nearshore zones respectively and represent different hydrodynamic and water quality situations for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in the water quality model fig 1 2 2 model set up and calibration the environmental fluid dynamic code a three dimensional hydrodynamic model originally developed by john hamrick hamrick 1996 is utilized to simulate water quality in lake taihu the model is one of the most widely applied advanced modeling frameworks for simulating hydrodynamics water quality eutrophication and dynamic changes and interactions in sediment transportation in lakes rivers and estuaries park et al 2012 kim et al 2011 li et al 2011 a large number of applications have demonstrated that the model has considerable generality convenient operation and faster calculation times wu and xu 2011 youngteck and jinhyeog 2009 uniform rectangular grids were utilized to set up the model for lake taihu in the horizontal plane in the vertical direction vertical sigma coordinates with an evenly distributed three layer system were adopted as a trade off between resolution and stability issues li et al 2015b the effect of temperature stratification was ignored because the lake was shallow the model was driven by atmospheric forcing surface wind stress tributary inflow outflow and benthic fluxes fig 2 inflow outflow tributaries were generalized into 30 primary rivers fig 1 atmospheric precipitation data was obtained by averaging data from eight monitoring stations near the lake fig 1 the wind data was collected from previous field monitoring li et al 2015b benthic fluxes were set zonally by field experiment and previous research pang and wang 1994 and the dry wet atmospheric deposition was set by field experiment song et al 2005 yang et al 2007 we try to run the model for several days with an assumption that the lake surface was level and then the initial hydrodynamic conditions was set by the average value of simulation on the first day it is also applied in our previous study and can help alleviate the influence of initial conditions on the simulation results the initial condition of water quality was set by the monitoring data in the first few days of january from the 30 monitoring sites in lake taihu including water temperature and the concentrations of do cod no3 n nh4 n tn po4 tp and chl a the simulated time lasted for one year from 1 jan to 31 dec and a 10 s time step was used as a trade off between computational speed and stability issues parameters concerned with the hydrodynamic processes were the same as those used in previous studies li et al 2015b and the results of current calibrations have been presented in previous research li et al 2011 annual monitoring data of water quality variables from 2005 was used to calibrate the water quality module and relative errors were less than 30 on the whole the amount of error remained significant after calibration and therefore parametric uncertainty was estimated and the most sensitive parameter s was investigated in order to improve the model 2 3 methods of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the water quality module in efdc for lake taihu was conducted based on the glue and rsa methods the main analysis procedure is shown as follows 2 3 1 parameter identification the simulation of water quality with efdc involves a large number of parameters it was not feasible or necessary to take all parameters into consideration muleta et al 2005 so a reduction in the number of parameters based on the actual simulations was performed taking into account that the predominant type of algae in lake taihu is cyanobacteria especially when algal blooms happened feng et al 2016 lu et al 2016 yue et al 2014 we excluded all parameters relating to other algal species i e macroalgae diatoms and greens the competitive relationships between algal groups were omitted to reduce the number of parameters sediment is another factor that can have a great impact on the simulation result the sediments module and water quality module were separated in efdc model it is difficult to calibrate the simulation results and the sampling quantity will increase exponentially if we include the sediments part in our previous research field observations with using of advanced devices were conducted on the lake to find behaviours of sediments settling and resuspension gao et al 2017 diffusive exchange of dissolved phase nutrients between water column and interstitial waters was investigated in many studies as well yu et al 2016 huang et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 kaiming et al 2014 thus we set the model with fixed benthic flux rates spatially by recent researches to simulate the processes of sediment instead i e phosphate ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen chemical oxygen demand sediment oxygen demand since these processes were highly influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions driven by wind wave in the lake we set flux rates with considering about the influence of wind yu et al 2016 huang et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 kaiming et al 2014 in addition parameters about reference temperature optimal depth for algal growth and other parameters not likely to be modified in most cases were set to default values finally 40 parameters were determined for further study and their descriptions are summarised in table 1 the ranges of these parameters for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were determined through a detailed investigation of the literature he et al 2011 seo and kim 2011 wang et al 2014a b arhonditsis and brett 2005 2 3 2 sampling of input parameters with the lhs method input parameters were sampled by using the latin hypercube sampling lhs method a random sampling method which is commonly used for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis manache and melching 2008 the lhs method works by taking the range of each independent parameter dividing the range by the selected realizations rearranging the values into a random distribution and then combining the distributions for each independent parameter xu and gertner 2008 as the variable space was sampled with relatively few samples in lhs the number of model runs could be less compared with monte carlo sampling in the study 100 300 500 1000 and 2000 realizations were generated by using lhs and were tested in order to obtain their optimal realizations for analyzing model uncertainty and sensitivity using the robustness test we found that the results of the sensitivity analysis were nearly stable when the sampling quantity was greater than 500 therefore taking into consideration the computational cost and the stability of the result we chose 500 latin hypercube samples for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 2 3 3 uncertainty analysis with the glue method the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 was utilized to quantify the uncertainty of the model the method which avoided the optimal partial solution was suitable for the water quality model with equifinality of different parameter sets and it is commonly used in river lake and rainfall runoff models blasone et al 2008 500 sets of parameters obtained from random sampling using the lhs method were used in this model and 500 sets of simulation results were obtained the following formula was used to calculate the likelihood measure of the simulated results 1 l θ i y 1 α i 2 α 0 2 where l θ i y is the likelihood measure for the ith model conditioned on the observations α i 2 is the error variance for the ith model i e the combination of the model and the ith parameter set and α 0 2 is the variance of the observations to ensure that the group of parameters can represent the functional characteristics of the model a threshold was set to exclude these groups from the results and normalized likelihood measure by using the linear function 2 l θ i y l θ i y l m i n θ i y l m a x θ i y l m i n θ i y where l θ i y is the likelihood measure calculated by using formula 1 l θ i y is the likelihood measure that has been normalized l m i n θ i y and l m a x θ i y are the minimum and maximum likelihood measures respectively the normalized likelihood measure was sorted by value and the 97 5th and 2 5th percentiles were chosen as the upper and lower bounds of confidence intervals proportion of observations in uncertainty interval and ratio of uncertainty interval to mean concentration were calculated to evaluate the uncertainty of the model 2 3 4 parametric sensitivity analysis with the rsa method the rsa methodology is utilized to analyze the sensitivity of parameters the method overcomes the constraints of single factor analysis in traditional sensitivity analysis and complex assumptions were not necessary marginal cumulative distributions were calculated by likelihood measure and sensitivity can be assessed qualitatively by examining differences between 10 distributions of the parameter the degree of dispersion of the lines is the visual measure of a model s sensitivity to an input parameter to acquire the sensitivity accurately the sensitivity indices si of parameters in the three subareas were then calculated by adopting the kolmogorov smirnov k s test kottegoda and rosso 1997 the k s test is a non parametric test which can be used to compare different samples the method is one of the most useful and general nonparametric methods for comparing the difference of samples and it is sensitive to differences in both location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of samples first 500 sets of simulation results were divide into ten groups by the likelihood measure and the empirical distribution function fn for n iid observations xi in each group is defined as 3 f n x 1 n i 1 n i x x i where i x x i is the indicator function equal to 1 if x i x and equal to 0 otherwise the kolmogorov smirnov statistic used to quantify a distance between the empirical distribution functions of different groups is 4 d i j sup f i n x f j m x where f i n x and f j m x are the empirical distribution functions of two samples respectively i j were the number of groups and sup is the supremum of the set of distances the maximum vertical distances mvd were then calculated as sensitivity indices si to quantify the sensitivity 5 m v d s i max d i j the parameters were divided into three levels by the sensitivity indices very sensitive parameters si 0 25 p 0 05 sensitive parameters 0 1 si 0 25 p 0 05 and insensitive parameters si 0 1 p 0 05 the interval range of these parameters was divided into 10 groups finally the posterior distributions of these parameters were calculated to discover suitable ranges in simulation in this research a matlab toolbox for global sensitivity analysis pianosi et al 2015 was utilized to analyze the output data 3 results 3 1 model uncertainty analysis the reliability and uncertainty of the model was studied by setting the threshold of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse to 0 5 the 2 5th percentile and the 97 5th percentile of the nse were chosen to determine the lower and upper bounds of likelihood measure the simulated results with 95 percent confidence in the three subareas of lake taihu are shown in figs 3 and 4 trends in simulated results were basically consistent with field observations in the three subareas figs 3 and 4 and the proportion of observations in uncertainty interval cr was mostly higher than 66 7 table 2 meant that most observations were within the confidence interval the model was therefore deemed feasible to be utilized in the simulation of water quality in lake taihu the cr was also distinguished between the three subareas the average cr in central zone was the highest 84 7 and higher than that of southwest zone 76 4 the average cr in meiliang bay with a higher indicator concentration was the lowest 66 7 which indicated that it is difficult to get accurate simulations in meiliang bay the uncertainty intervals between the median and lower bounds ui were significant with some of them even accounted for more than half of the mean concentrations from field observations mc therefore uncertainty resulting from these parameters could not be ignored the ratio of uncertainty to mean concentration ri increased basically with decreased concentration of observations although the ui decreased at the same time for example the ri of chlorophyll a simulation in southwest zone was 45 1 higher than that of meiliang bay 37 3 table 2 although ui decreased from 15 59 to 13 00 μg l the ui of different indicators were also variable in simulation of nitrogen the ui of nitrate nitrogen was greater than that of ammonia nitrogen especially in the southwest zone which showed that the accuracy of nitrate nitrogen simulation was highly important in the simulation of total nitrogen in simulation of nitrogen and chlorophyll a the cumulative differences between the lower and upper bounds cd increased slowly at the beginning but more rapidly after half of the simulation time this indicated that the uncertainty of some parameters was strongly related to model simulation time for example the cd of ammonia nitrogen in the central zone fig 3 b increased slowly before 150 days but more rapidly after that time in simulation of phosphorus the cd were founded to be highly related to chlorophyll a especially for phosphate for example the uncertainties in central zone were lowest when simulation time was about 120 and 300 days with highest concentrations of chlorophyll a fig 4 b h some observations were found not to be within the confidence intervals for example the simulation of nitrate nitrogen in meiliang bay fig 3 d did not conform to field observations and the median of the simulated results underestimated the concentration in this case only 58 33 of the monitoring data was within the confidence interval the model appears to be missing several important nutrients peaks as it can be easily in figs 3 and 4 this result most likely stems from some other uncertainty factors such as inflow rivers monitoring data and so on which could also be significant factors and not be ignored when the water quality model is modified 3 2 sensitive parameters in the simulation the maximum vertical distance mvd calculated by using the kolmogorov smirnov test eq 5 was used to represent sensitivity indices si of parameters sensitive parameters with an si greater than 0 1 are shown in fig 5 the maximum growth rate pmc basal metabolism rate bmrc predation rate prrc light extinction due to chlorophyll a kechl and suboptimal temperature effect coefficient for growth ktg1c were all found to be sensitive parameters in simulations of all indicators all of these sensitive parameters are connected with algal growth kinetics which indicated that water quality simulations were influenced by algae sensitive parameters distinguished between different indicators in the simulation of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen pmc kechl and ktg1c were very sensitive parameters prrc was found to be the most sensitive parameter in the simulation of total nitrogen but it was not a sensitive parameter in the simulation of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen this may indicate that prrc is a significant parameter in the simulation of organic nitrogen kdc a parameter representing the minimum dissolution rate of doc was also a sensitive parameter in the simulation of nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen which influenced simulations through denitrification the settling velocity of cyanobacteria wsc was the most sensitive parameter in the simulation of phosphate since settling of algae with absorbed phosphate is one way for soluble phosphate to be removed from the aquatic system fig 5 d wsc was also a sensitive parameter in the simulation of phosphorus and algae although the sensitivity was lower than that of other parameters such as three important parameters related to algal kinetics i e pmc prrc and bmrc two parameters related to light and temperature i e kechl and ktg1c respectively were the most important parameters in simulation of algae tmc1 optimal temperature for algal growth was also a significant parameter for simulating algae sensitive parameters also varied spatially and were influenced primarily by concentration the bar charts fig 5 showing six indicators indicated that some parameters are clearly distinguished between the three subareas such as ktg1c kechl and pmc in the simulation of nitrate nitrogen and algae the si of ktg1c in meiliang bay was higher than that of the central zone and southwest zone for ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen the si of ktg1c in meiliang bay was almost two times higher than that of the other two subareas in simulation of almost all indicators except for phosphate the si of kechl in meiliang bay were lower than that of the other two subareas which demonstrated kechl was a more sensitive parameter in the central zone and southwest zone in the simulation of phosphate the si of kechl and pmc in meiliang bay was obviously higher than that of the central zone and southwest zone which became lowest in the simulation of total phosphorus and algae it indicated that the sensitivities of these two parameters were influenced by both indicators and locations the si of other indicators in the three subareas was almost identical which means the parametric sensitivity of these indicators was less affected by location although sensitive parameters were distinguished in the three subareas the situations in the central zone and southwest zone were similar probably due to the close concentrations in these two subareas we suggest that sensitivities of these parameters are highly influenced by concentrations of indicators fig 5 the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of likelihood measures within each group were calculated to be the posterior distributions of parameters fig 6 the sensitivity and the proper range of parameters can be found directly by the deviation of the posterior distribution for example the probability of cumulative distribution functions increased obviously when bmrc 0 04 which mean that the simulation with bmrc 0 04 are more likely to have high likelihood measures therefore the probably suitable range of bmrc was from 0 04 to 0 06 day other speculative ranges of sensitive parameters are also shown in table 3 the cdfs were useful not only for setting parameter ranges but also for specifying more informative distributions than the uniform or normal distributions used in this analysis pmc fits a normal or gamma distribution well which prrc should probably use a triangle distribution with suitable values at 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 influence of algae on parameter sensitivity biological activity was found to be an important mechanism in influencing the simulation of water quality particularly in lakes with higher concentrations of algae as shown in fig 7 most of the sensitive parameters were found to be related to algal growth kinetics such as pmc bmrc and prrc in the three dimensional nutrients algal dynamic model built using efdc in lake dianchi which is a large shallow lake similar to lake taihu and also suffers from algae blooms the global sensitivity analysis also showed the maximum growth rate and basal metabolism rate were sensitive parameters in the simulation of tn and tp yi et al 2016 in the venetian lagoon a large shallow lake with average depth of 1 1m maximum growth rate of phytoplankton and zooplankton also had significant impacts on simulation results pastres and ciavatta 2005 pastres et al 1997 we suggest that parameters related to algal growth kinetics are significant parameters for large shallow lakes with high concentrations of algae in this study the minimum value for pmc was set to 2 day which may be a little higher than the value in ever research hoogenhout and amesz 1965 edwards et al 2015 kruk et al 2010 from measured values reported in literatures a mean value for microcystis which is common in taihu was 0 53 day temperature adjusted or 0 7 day without temperature correction robson et al 2018 edwards et al 2015 however we checked the real time growth rate in our model when pmc was set to 3 day and found the values varied from 0 15 day to 0 6 day which was close to the range reported in literatures we have conducted several pre researches with a wider range of pmc and the results showed that the concentration of algae will be quite low if we set the pmc lower than 2 we attributed the difference to the overestimation of settling of algae which lead to a lower rate of algal increase cyanobacterial settling wsc was found in this study to be a sensitive parameter especially in the simulation of phosphorus in part because it is one of ways for soluble phosphate to be removed from the aquatic system another p removal processes is adsorption to suspended or benthic sediment surfaces and it may be compensated for in part by high cyanobacterial settling therefore a higher pmc used would then be needed to compensate for the effect of high cyanobacterial settling on chlorophyll a concentration and the possible range of pmc would be lower than the speculative range we provided light and temperature impacts on algal growth also have significant influence on models benke et al 2008 confalonieri 2010 in meiliang bay parameters related to energy such as light and temperature were found to be more sensitive than parameters concerned with nutrients li et al 2015c in marine biological models the result of sensitivity analysis also suggested that light limitation was a sensitive parameter on phytoplankton growth chu et al 2007 in our research light extinction due to chlorophyll a kechl was a very sensitive parameter in simulations of all water quality indicators and similar phenomenon was also found in lake dianchi yi et al 2016 in these eutrophic lakes algae concentration is very high and play an important role in light extinction which in return lead to a great impact on algal growth and then affect the simulation of nutrients temperature was also a significant factor in algal growth and the suboptimal temperature effect coefficient ktg1c was a very sensitive parameter in the limitation of temperature in our research due to the great change of temperature seasonally in lake taihu temperature effect coefficient was sensitive which was not found in lakes with little difference in temperature over time like dianchi yi et al 2016 4 2 spatial variability of sensitivity and uncertainty sensitive parameters were apparently related to concentrations of water quality indicators in the three subareas in the central zone and southwest zone with lower concentrations the rank of very sensitive parameters was almost identical while they changed significantly in meiliang bay table 4 in simulations of phosphorus for example bmrc and prrc were more sensitive in meilang bay while wsc and pmc were very sensitive in other two subareas with lower nutrients concentrations in meiliang bay ktg1c was the most sensitive parameter in simulations of most indicators which meant that temperature was the most significant factor in this subarea in subareas with lower concentrations i e central zone and southwest zone kechl were the most important parameters table 4 thus influence of light should be given greater attention we attribute the phenomenon to the difference in limiting factors in three subareas in subareas with lower algae concentration algae play an important role in light extinction which in return lead to a great impact on algal growth and then affect the simulation of nutrients however influence of light decreases in subareas with too high algae concentration because algae on the water surface has already intercepted most light temperature then became a limiting factor in these subareas not only light and temperature have great impact in simulation but also other boundary conditions could also be responsible for the spatial variability of sensitivity for example wind speed was found to have the largest impact on simulation between in out flow wind speed wind direction and initial water level li et al 2014 thus some parameters concerned with wind like wind drag coefficient were found to be very sensitive in our previous research on hydrodynamic conditions li et al 2015b the effects of external nutrients reductions on algal blooms were investigated to evaluate the influence of boundary conditions on the model and results showed that chlorophyll a chl a concentrations only decreased a little when implementing high nutrients reduction scenario tang et al 2016 it is consistent with our results that little parameters related to nutrients were sensitive uncertainty of simulation also had a close relationship with indicators concentration in different subareas meiliang bay is connected to some inflow rivers with high concentrations of nutrients and greater benthic fluxes due to thick sediment deposits luo et al 2004 the simulation in this subareas was therefore less influenced by model parameters and lower concentration subareas should be given much attention when modifying parameters in addition currents and waves were weak in this bay area where the impact of wind is expected to be less than other two subareas the calculation of water quality variables was based on hydrodynamic conditions strong currents and waves will accelerate transportation and transformation of nutrients which results in higher relative uncertainty in the central zone and southwest zone uncertainty of simulation was related to the simulation time as well according to the results the uncertainty in the three subareas increased rapidly when the simulation time was over 150 days while the concentration of algae began to rise and algae blooms frequently occurred at the same time with increasing temperature and light intensity algal growth basal metabolism and some other algal kinetic processes became more active from the results of the sensitivity analysis that most sensitivity parameters were related to algal kinetics we infer that the increased uncertainty over time mostly resulted from enhanced algal kinetic processes finally it was hard to simulate all water quality indicators through modification of model parameters since other uncertain factors also showed significant impact on simulation results several important nutrients peaks were missed in figs 3 and 4 almost all of the missed peaks were located in offshore areas i e meiliang bay and southwest zone which were highly influenced by boundary conditions we attributed the result to the uncertainty of nutrients loading data especially for the non point source pollution we checked the rainfall data and found that there is a strong relationship between missed peaks and the intensity of rainfall we suggested that the non point source pollution resulted from rainfall was underestimated which caused reduce in nutrients loading 4 3 generalization for a larger modelling community and future work except external input from rivers and internal input from sediment beds biological activity is a significant part for nutrients simulation in these models with more sensitive parameters than that in hydrolysis mineralization and settlement since net algal production can be divided into five phases algal growth metabolism predation settling and external sources ji 2007 maximum growth rate basal metabolism rate and predation rate were sensitive apparently which was found both in our study and other places like lake kinneret based on a dyresm caedym model bruce et al 2006 light was an important limitation on algae growth and light extinction due to chlorophyll a was a very sensitive parameter in this study however for some deep lakes like lake washington background light extinction was more sensitive arhonditsis and brett 2005 thus light extinction due to chlorophyll a in shallow lakes with serious algal blooms were more sensitive than that in deep lakes where background light extinction was more sensitive temperature was also a significant factor in algal growth and the optimal temperature effect coefficient was a very sensitive parameter in the limitation of temperature in our research seasonal temperature varying widely in lake taihu was mostly lower than the optimal temperature for cyanobacterial growth in contrast the temperature of lake dianchi was higher than that of lake taihu and temperature effect coefficient was not a sensitive parameter in the dianchi model yi et al 2016 hence we infer that the temperature effect coefficient might turn out to be a sensitive parameter in lakes with an obvious seasonal temperature variation some water quality models used widely are based on similar theory which contains dissolved oxygen algae nutrients and so on some modern models are only subtle variations on model structures established in the 1970s or earlier franks 2009 the governing equations in these models such as efdc wasp and dyresm are similar as well park et al 2005 cerco and cole 1993 which encourage us to extend the results in this study to a larger modelling community producing a believable output requires not only a realistic growth rate response to limiting nutrients but also a realistic consumption of non or lesser limiting nutrients flynn 2003 2005 for the future work variable stoichiometry phytoplankton models like caperon meyer quota model need to be considered for non steady state applications rather than some traditional models like michaelis menten nutrient kinetics flynn 2008 2005 flynn and mitra 2016 though this requires better statistical comparisons of models and data it can make planktonic ecosystem models much more powerful tools franks 2009 redfield monod models often use nutrient limitation as a significant factor controlling phytoplankton growth and yet biologically such nutrient limitation is associated with significant variation in elemental stoichiometry flynn 2010 such as the variable stoichiometry c n p and in some models c chl of phytoplankton cells jackson et al 2017 butenschön et al 2016 robson 2014 baird et al 2013 flynn 2001 droop 1975 it can demonstrate the behavior of the dynamic chl parameterization over a range of light and nutrient limiting environments for phytoplankton of different sizes and growth rates baird et al 2013 the appropriate description of the control of the transport of the non limiting nutrient is also important and a ﬁxed algal n p should not be assumed flynn 2008 including zooplankton explicitly rather than a fixed predation rate leads to much more realistic plankton dynamics due to the complexity of zooplankton model there are no advanced module in efdc currently current knowledge of plankton ecology ascribes a large proportion of zooplankton losses to zooplankton cannibalism and carnivory rather than via the activity of higher trophic levels beyond the plankton planktonic ecosystem models typically represent all zooplankton losses by mathematically rather than biologically justified closure functions even these closure functions include zooplanktonic cannibalism and carnivory these processes are not explicitly implemented within the grazing function while the biomass outputs may appear similar the fate of annual primary production and f ratios vary widely mitra 2009 5 conclusions in this research nutrients were chosen as output indicators and 40 parameters were sampled glue and rsa methods were applied to analyze the parametric uncertainty and sensitivity of the efdc model in lake taihu a typical large shallow lake three parameters related to algal kinetics i e pmc bmrc and prrc were sensitive parameters in the simulation of water quality in the eutrophic waterbody for shallow lakes with frequent algal blooms light extinction due to chlorophyll a is also a sensitive parameter while background light extinction has also been shown to be sensitive for deep lakes for lakes with seasonal temperature variation the temperature effect coefficient for algal growth is sensitive sensitive parameters also varied in different lake subareas for high nutrients and algae concentration subareas temperature was more likely to be a limiting factor whereas sensitive factors could be light in lower concentration subareas since most sensitive parameters were related to algae uncertainty of simulation results increased with increase in algal kinetic processes over time it also varied in different subareas lower nutrients and algae concentration subareas were more easily influenced by model parameters and nearshore areas were highly influenced by boundary conditions for the future work variable stoichiometry phytoplankton models will be considered and zooplankton will be integrated into the model explicitly rather than a fixed predation rate acknowledgements the authors wish to express their great gratitude to the toolbox developed by pianosi et al

25306,lake taihu was chosen as a case for parameter uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of water quality simulation in large shallow lakes forty parameters in environmental fluid dynamic code model efdc were filtered and analyzed the results showed that parameters had a considerable influence on simulation and three groups of parameters related to algal kinetics i e pmc bmrc and prrc light kechl and temperature ktg1c were very sensitive for shallow lakes with frequent algal blooms light extinction due to chlorophyll a is also a sensitive parameter while the temperature effect coefficient for algal growth is sensitive for lakes with seasonal temperature variation sensitive parameters and their relevant uncertainty varied spatially for high nutrients and algae concentration subareas temperature was more likely to be a limiting factor whereas sensitive factors could be light in lower concentration subareas since most sensitive parameters were related to algae uncertainty in simulation increased with increasing algal kinetic processes over time and varied in different subareas lower nutrients and algae concentration subareas were more easily influenced by model parameters while nearshore areas were highly influenced by boundary conditions for better simulation of water quality variable stoichiometry phytoplankton models should be considered and zooplankton need to be integrated into the model explicitly rather than a fixed predation rate keywords key words lake taihu sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis water quality models 1 introduction water quality models wqms valuable tools of supporting water quality predictions have been widely applied in environmental management in recent years arhonditsis and brett 2005 li et al 2015a xu et al 2013 cerco and cole 1993 however the inherent uncertainty of these models is greatly influenced by factors including model structure uncertainty model input uncertainty model parameter uncertainty and measurement errors radwan et al 2002 with the development and application of performance computing technology many water quality models with good structure and complex parameters have been developed wang et al 2013b however an increasing number of parameters has resulted in a sharp increase in computational requirements and thus exacerbated the complexity of these models highly interactive parameter spaces and the nonlinear non monotonous objective spaces have increased the difficulty of calibration gupta et al 2000 herman et al 2013a b yi et al 2016 in order to improve the accuracy and rationality of model predictions and study the parametric uncertainty and sensitivity of models we conducted several uncertainty and sensitivity studies in different water bodies such as rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and coasts to identify subsets of important model parameters that significantly influence model outputs have been carried out muleta et al 2005 neumann 2012 yi et al 2016 amongst these studies large shallow lakes are often accompanied with complex hydrodynamic and eutrophication problems the simulation of water quality is difficult and few studies were conducted on parameters under different situations the hydrodynamic conditions in large shallow lakes are highly influenced by wind wave they are not like other deep lakes or reservoirs which may be driven by thermal stratification parameters related to wind and wave like wind drag coefficient were supposed to be sensitive parameters in simulation li et al 2015b some large shallow lakes also face serious eutrophication and algal bloom problems like lake taihu parametric uncertainty is considerable with parameters related to growth respiration and death of algae and zooplankton generally sensitive in lake eutrophication models omlin et al 2001 missaghi et al 2013 three factors i e nutrients temperature and light are considered to control the algal growth but the limitation factors are normally not so clear in many cases for example phosphorus was thought to be the limitation factors in lake taihu before but the influence of nitrogen is also quite important by recent researches tang et al 2016 paerl et al 2011 some typical large shallow lake models which have been analyzed with different methods showed that parameters related to light and temperature were significant for example in the venician lagoon pastres and ciavatta 2005 pastres et al 1997 and dian lake china yi et al 2016 parameters related to limitation factors will change according to real situation and sensitivities of these parameters need to be investigated sediment is also an important source of pollution and parameters related to settling velocity and mineralization were found to be sensitive in some models missaghi et al 2013 researches on different models of shallow lakes suggested that the adsorption constant was relatively important in the simulation of total nitrogen whereas mineralization and settling rates were sensitive to total phosphorus janse et al 2010 meteorological and hydrodynamic situations pollutant inflow and bathymetric variance in lakes and reservoirs results in inherent temporal and spatial variability in water quality missaghi et al 2013 in a multi dimensional model formulated by physical chemical and biological processes model behavior may vary across the spatial domain whilst time dependency should also be considered because of time varying sensitivities herman et al 2013a b wang et al 2013a however few studies involving complex water quality models of multi dimensional lakes or reservoirs have been conducted on this problem in this research we choose lake taihu a large shallow lake the third largest freshwater lake in china as an example to make relevant analysis the water quality module of the environmental fluid dynamic code efdc was chosen for the simulation and water quality indicators such as ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen phosphate and chlorophyll a as model outputs the objectives of this study were thus to 1 quantify the sensitivity of parameters in simulation of water quality model and evaluate uncertainty caused by it 2 analyze the spatial temporal variability of uncertainty and sensitivity and 3 compare with other lakes and extend the result to a larger modelling community the results can be utilized in the design of a reasonable water quality model for large shallow lakes and improve the efficiency of calibration of such models 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area lake taihu longitude 119 08ʹ 122 55ʹe latitude 30 05ʹ 32 08ʹn is the third largest shallow freshwater lake in china with a surface area of 2338 km2 and a catchment area of 36 500 km2 zhu et al 2007 the average depth of the lake is 1 9 m and the maximum depth is 2 6 m corresponding to an elevation of 3 0 m a s l qin 2009 the floor of the lake features flat terrain with an average topographic gradient of 0 0ʹ19 66ʺ lake taihu has complex shoreline geometry and is connected to 172 rivers or channels qin 2009 and the mean hydraulic retention time is about 300d the water quality of the lake is seriously deteriorated nuisance algal blooms often occur in summer and early fall in most lake areas especially meiliang bay and zhushan bay the blooms are considered to be the result of a combination of high nutrient loading and weak hydrodynamics mao et al 2008 for the convenience of management and monitoring lake taihu have been divided into eight subareas liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 three subareas i e meiliang bay central zone and southwest zone represent bay central and nearshore zones respectively and represent different hydrodynamic and water quality situations for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in the water quality model fig 1 2 2 model set up and calibration the environmental fluid dynamic code a three dimensional hydrodynamic model originally developed by john hamrick hamrick 1996 is utilized to simulate water quality in lake taihu the model is one of the most widely applied advanced modeling frameworks for simulating hydrodynamics water quality eutrophication and dynamic changes and interactions in sediment transportation in lakes rivers and estuaries park et al 2012 kim et al 2011 li et al 2011 a large number of applications have demonstrated that the model has considerable generality convenient operation and faster calculation times wu and xu 2011 youngteck and jinhyeog 2009 uniform rectangular grids were utilized to set up the model for lake taihu in the horizontal plane in the vertical direction vertical sigma coordinates with an evenly distributed three layer system were adopted as a trade off between resolution and stability issues li et al 2015b the effect of temperature stratification was ignored because the lake was shallow the model was driven by atmospheric forcing surface wind stress tributary inflow outflow and benthic fluxes fig 2 inflow outflow tributaries were generalized into 30 primary rivers fig 1 atmospheric precipitation data was obtained by averaging data from eight monitoring stations near the lake fig 1 the wind data was collected from previous field monitoring li et al 2015b benthic fluxes were set zonally by field experiment and previous research pang and wang 1994 and the dry wet atmospheric deposition was set by field experiment song et al 2005 yang et al 2007 we try to run the model for several days with an assumption that the lake surface was level and then the initial hydrodynamic conditions was set by the average value of simulation on the first day it is also applied in our previous study and can help alleviate the influence of initial conditions on the simulation results the initial condition of water quality was set by the monitoring data in the first few days of january from the 30 monitoring sites in lake taihu including water temperature and the concentrations of do cod no3 n nh4 n tn po4 tp and chl a the simulated time lasted for one year from 1 jan to 31 dec and a 10 s time step was used as a trade off between computational speed and stability issues parameters concerned with the hydrodynamic processes were the same as those used in previous studies li et al 2015b and the results of current calibrations have been presented in previous research li et al 2011 annual monitoring data of water quality variables from 2005 was used to calibrate the water quality module and relative errors were less than 30 on the whole the amount of error remained significant after calibration and therefore parametric uncertainty was estimated and the most sensitive parameter s was investigated in order to improve the model 2 3 methods of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for the water quality module in efdc for lake taihu was conducted based on the glue and rsa methods the main analysis procedure is shown as follows 2 3 1 parameter identification the simulation of water quality with efdc involves a large number of parameters it was not feasible or necessary to take all parameters into consideration muleta et al 2005 so a reduction in the number of parameters based on the actual simulations was performed taking into account that the predominant type of algae in lake taihu is cyanobacteria especially when algal blooms happened feng et al 2016 lu et al 2016 yue et al 2014 we excluded all parameters relating to other algal species i e macroalgae diatoms and greens the competitive relationships between algal groups were omitted to reduce the number of parameters sediment is another factor that can have a great impact on the simulation result the sediments module and water quality module were separated in efdc model it is difficult to calibrate the simulation results and the sampling quantity will increase exponentially if we include the sediments part in our previous research field observations with using of advanced devices were conducted on the lake to find behaviours of sediments settling and resuspension gao et al 2017 diffusive exchange of dissolved phase nutrients between water column and interstitial waters was investigated in many studies as well yu et al 2016 huang et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 kaiming et al 2014 thus we set the model with fixed benthic flux rates spatially by recent researches to simulate the processes of sediment instead i e phosphate ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen chemical oxygen demand sediment oxygen demand since these processes were highly influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions driven by wind wave in the lake we set flux rates with considering about the influence of wind yu et al 2016 huang et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 kaiming et al 2014 in addition parameters about reference temperature optimal depth for algal growth and other parameters not likely to be modified in most cases were set to default values finally 40 parameters were determined for further study and their descriptions are summarised in table 1 the ranges of these parameters for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were determined through a detailed investigation of the literature he et al 2011 seo and kim 2011 wang et al 2014a b arhonditsis and brett 2005 2 3 2 sampling of input parameters with the lhs method input parameters were sampled by using the latin hypercube sampling lhs method a random sampling method which is commonly used for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis manache and melching 2008 the lhs method works by taking the range of each independent parameter dividing the range by the selected realizations rearranging the values into a random distribution and then combining the distributions for each independent parameter xu and gertner 2008 as the variable space was sampled with relatively few samples in lhs the number of model runs could be less compared with monte carlo sampling in the study 100 300 500 1000 and 2000 realizations were generated by using lhs and were tested in order to obtain their optimal realizations for analyzing model uncertainty and sensitivity using the robustness test we found that the results of the sensitivity analysis were nearly stable when the sampling quantity was greater than 500 therefore taking into consideration the computational cost and the stability of the result we chose 500 latin hypercube samples for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis 2 3 3 uncertainty analysis with the glue method the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 was utilized to quantify the uncertainty of the model the method which avoided the optimal partial solution was suitable for the water quality model with equifinality of different parameter sets and it is commonly used in river lake and rainfall runoff models blasone et al 2008 500 sets of parameters obtained from random sampling using the lhs method were used in this model and 500 sets of simulation results were obtained the following formula was used to calculate the likelihood measure of the simulated results 1 l θ i y 1 α i 2 α 0 2 where l θ i y is the likelihood measure for the ith model conditioned on the observations α i 2 is the error variance for the ith model i e the combination of the model and the ith parameter set and α 0 2 is the variance of the observations to ensure that the group of parameters can represent the functional characteristics of the model a threshold was set to exclude these groups from the results and normalized likelihood measure by using the linear function 2 l θ i y l θ i y l m i n θ i y l m a x θ i y l m i n θ i y where l θ i y is the likelihood measure calculated by using formula 1 l θ i y is the likelihood measure that has been normalized l m i n θ i y and l m a x θ i y are the minimum and maximum likelihood measures respectively the normalized likelihood measure was sorted by value and the 97 5th and 2 5th percentiles were chosen as the upper and lower bounds of confidence intervals proportion of observations in uncertainty interval and ratio of uncertainty interval to mean concentration were calculated to evaluate the uncertainty of the model 2 3 4 parametric sensitivity analysis with the rsa method the rsa methodology is utilized to analyze the sensitivity of parameters the method overcomes the constraints of single factor analysis in traditional sensitivity analysis and complex assumptions were not necessary marginal cumulative distributions were calculated by likelihood measure and sensitivity can be assessed qualitatively by examining differences between 10 distributions of the parameter the degree of dispersion of the lines is the visual measure of a model s sensitivity to an input parameter to acquire the sensitivity accurately the sensitivity indices si of parameters in the three subareas were then calculated by adopting the kolmogorov smirnov k s test kottegoda and rosso 1997 the k s test is a non parametric test which can be used to compare different samples the method is one of the most useful and general nonparametric methods for comparing the difference of samples and it is sensitive to differences in both location and shape of the empirical cumulative distribution functions of samples first 500 sets of simulation results were divide into ten groups by the likelihood measure and the empirical distribution function fn for n iid observations xi in each group is defined as 3 f n x 1 n i 1 n i x x i where i x x i is the indicator function equal to 1 if x i x and equal to 0 otherwise the kolmogorov smirnov statistic used to quantify a distance between the empirical distribution functions of different groups is 4 d i j sup f i n x f j m x where f i n x and f j m x are the empirical distribution functions of two samples respectively i j were the number of groups and sup is the supremum of the set of distances the maximum vertical distances mvd were then calculated as sensitivity indices si to quantify the sensitivity 5 m v d s i max d i j the parameters were divided into three levels by the sensitivity indices very sensitive parameters si 0 25 p 0 05 sensitive parameters 0 1 si 0 25 p 0 05 and insensitive parameters si 0 1 p 0 05 the interval range of these parameters was divided into 10 groups finally the posterior distributions of these parameters were calculated to discover suitable ranges in simulation in this research a matlab toolbox for global sensitivity analysis pianosi et al 2015 was utilized to analyze the output data 3 results 3 1 model uncertainty analysis the reliability and uncertainty of the model was studied by setting the threshold of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse to 0 5 the 2 5th percentile and the 97 5th percentile of the nse were chosen to determine the lower and upper bounds of likelihood measure the simulated results with 95 percent confidence in the three subareas of lake taihu are shown in figs 3 and 4 trends in simulated results were basically consistent with field observations in the three subareas figs 3 and 4 and the proportion of observations in uncertainty interval cr was mostly higher than 66 7 table 2 meant that most observations were within the confidence interval the model was therefore deemed feasible to be utilized in the simulation of water quality in lake taihu the cr was also distinguished between the three subareas the average cr in central zone was the highest 84 7 and higher than that of southwest zone 76 4 the average cr in meiliang bay with a higher indicator concentration was the lowest 66 7 which indicated that it is difficult to get accurate simulations in meiliang bay the uncertainty intervals between the median and lower bounds ui were significant with some of them even accounted for more than half of the mean concentrations from field observations mc therefore uncertainty resulting from these parameters could not be ignored the ratio of uncertainty to mean concentration ri increased basically with decreased concentration of observations although the ui decreased at the same time for example the ri of chlorophyll a simulation in southwest zone was 45 1 higher than that of meiliang bay 37 3 table 2 although ui decreased from 15 59 to 13 00 μg l the ui of different indicators were also variable in simulation of nitrogen the ui of nitrate nitrogen was greater than that of ammonia nitrogen especially in the southwest zone which showed that the accuracy of nitrate nitrogen simulation was highly important in the simulation of total nitrogen in simulation of nitrogen and chlorophyll a the cumulative differences between the lower and upper bounds cd increased slowly at the beginning but more rapidly after half of the simulation time this indicated that the uncertainty of some parameters was strongly related to model simulation time for example the cd of ammonia nitrogen in the central zone fig 3 b increased slowly before 150 days but more rapidly after that time in simulation of phosphorus the cd were founded to be highly related to chlorophyll a especially for phosphate for example the uncertainties in central zone were lowest when simulation time was about 120 and 300 days with highest concentrations of chlorophyll a fig 4 b h some observations were found not to be within the confidence intervals for example the simulation of nitrate nitrogen in meiliang bay fig 3 d did not conform to field observations and the median of the simulated results underestimated the concentration in this case only 58 33 of the monitoring data was within the confidence interval the model appears to be missing several important nutrients peaks as it can be easily in figs 3 and 4 this result most likely stems from some other uncertainty factors such as inflow rivers monitoring data and so on which could also be significant factors and not be ignored when the water quality model is modified 3 2 sensitive parameters in the simulation the maximum vertical distance mvd calculated by using the kolmogorov smirnov test eq 5 was used to represent sensitivity indices si of parameters sensitive parameters with an si greater than 0 1 are shown in fig 5 the maximum growth rate pmc basal metabolism rate bmrc predation rate prrc light extinction due to chlorophyll a kechl and suboptimal temperature effect coefficient for growth ktg1c were all found to be sensitive parameters in simulations of all indicators all of these sensitive parameters are connected with algal growth kinetics which indicated that water quality simulations were influenced by algae sensitive parameters distinguished between different indicators in the simulation of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen pmc kechl and ktg1c were very sensitive parameters prrc was found to be the most sensitive parameter in the simulation of total nitrogen but it was not a sensitive parameter in the simulation of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen this may indicate that prrc is a significant parameter in the simulation of organic nitrogen kdc a parameter representing the minimum dissolution rate of doc was also a sensitive parameter in the simulation of nitrate nitrogen and total nitrogen which influenced simulations through denitrification the settling velocity of cyanobacteria wsc was the most sensitive parameter in the simulation of phosphate since settling of algae with absorbed phosphate is one way for soluble phosphate to be removed from the aquatic system fig 5 d wsc was also a sensitive parameter in the simulation of phosphorus and algae although the sensitivity was lower than that of other parameters such as three important parameters related to algal kinetics i e pmc prrc and bmrc two parameters related to light and temperature i e kechl and ktg1c respectively were the most important parameters in simulation of algae tmc1 optimal temperature for algal growth was also a significant parameter for simulating algae sensitive parameters also varied spatially and were influenced primarily by concentration the bar charts fig 5 showing six indicators indicated that some parameters are clearly distinguished between the three subareas such as ktg1c kechl and pmc in the simulation of nitrate nitrogen and algae the si of ktg1c in meiliang bay was higher than that of the central zone and southwest zone for ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen the si of ktg1c in meiliang bay was almost two times higher than that of the other two subareas in simulation of almost all indicators except for phosphate the si of kechl in meiliang bay were lower than that of the other two subareas which demonstrated kechl was a more sensitive parameter in the central zone and southwest zone in the simulation of phosphate the si of kechl and pmc in meiliang bay was obviously higher than that of the central zone and southwest zone which became lowest in the simulation of total phosphorus and algae it indicated that the sensitivities of these two parameters were influenced by both indicators and locations the si of other indicators in the three subareas was almost identical which means the parametric sensitivity of these indicators was less affected by location although sensitive parameters were distinguished in the three subareas the situations in the central zone and southwest zone were similar probably due to the close concentrations in these two subareas we suggest that sensitivities of these parameters are highly influenced by concentrations of indicators fig 5 the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of likelihood measures within each group were calculated to be the posterior distributions of parameters fig 6 the sensitivity and the proper range of parameters can be found directly by the deviation of the posterior distribution for example the probability of cumulative distribution functions increased obviously when bmrc 0 04 which mean that the simulation with bmrc 0 04 are more likely to have high likelihood measures therefore the probably suitable range of bmrc was from 0 04 to 0 06 day other speculative ranges of sensitive parameters are also shown in table 3 the cdfs were useful not only for setting parameter ranges but also for specifying more informative distributions than the uniform or normal distributions used in this analysis pmc fits a normal or gamma distribution well which prrc should probably use a triangle distribution with suitable values at 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 influence of algae on parameter sensitivity biological activity was found to be an important mechanism in influencing the simulation of water quality particularly in lakes with higher concentrations of algae as shown in fig 7 most of the sensitive parameters were found to be related to algal growth kinetics such as pmc bmrc and prrc in the three dimensional nutrients algal dynamic model built using efdc in lake dianchi which is a large shallow lake similar to lake taihu and also suffers from algae blooms the global sensitivity analysis also showed the maximum growth rate and basal metabolism rate were sensitive parameters in the simulation of tn and tp yi et al 2016 in the venetian lagoon a large shallow lake with average depth of 1 1m maximum growth rate of phytoplankton and zooplankton also had significant impacts on simulation results pastres and ciavatta 2005 pastres et al 1997 we suggest that parameters related to algal growth kinetics are significant parameters for large shallow lakes with high concentrations of algae in this study the minimum value for pmc was set to 2 day which may be a little higher than the value in ever research hoogenhout and amesz 1965 edwards et al 2015 kruk et al 2010 from measured values reported in literatures a mean value for microcystis which is common in taihu was 0 53 day temperature adjusted or 0 7 day without temperature correction robson et al 2018 edwards et al 2015 however we checked the real time growth rate in our model when pmc was set to 3 day and found the values varied from 0 15 day to 0 6 day which was close to the range reported in literatures we have conducted several pre researches with a wider range of pmc and the results showed that the concentration of algae will be quite low if we set the pmc lower than 2 we attributed the difference to the overestimation of settling of algae which lead to a lower rate of algal increase cyanobacterial settling wsc was found in this study to be a sensitive parameter especially in the simulation of phosphorus in part because it is one of ways for soluble phosphate to be removed from the aquatic system another p removal processes is adsorption to suspended or benthic sediment surfaces and it may be compensated for in part by high cyanobacterial settling therefore a higher pmc used would then be needed to compensate for the effect of high cyanobacterial settling on chlorophyll a concentration and the possible range of pmc would be lower than the speculative range we provided light and temperature impacts on algal growth also have significant influence on models benke et al 2008 confalonieri 2010 in meiliang bay parameters related to energy such as light and temperature were found to be more sensitive than parameters concerned with nutrients li et al 2015c in marine biological models the result of sensitivity analysis also suggested that light limitation was a sensitive parameter on phytoplankton growth chu et al 2007 in our research light extinction due to chlorophyll a kechl was a very sensitive parameter in simulations of all water quality indicators and similar phenomenon was also found in lake dianchi yi et al 2016 in these eutrophic lakes algae concentration is very high and play an important role in light extinction which in return lead to a great impact on algal growth and then affect the simulation of nutrients temperature was also a significant factor in algal growth and the suboptimal temperature effect coefficient ktg1c was a very sensitive parameter in the limitation of temperature in our research due to the great change of temperature seasonally in lake taihu temperature effect coefficient was sensitive which was not found in lakes with little difference in temperature over time like dianchi yi et al 2016 4 2 spatial variability of sensitivity and uncertainty sensitive parameters were apparently related to concentrations of water quality indicators in the three subareas in the central zone and southwest zone with lower concentrations the rank of very sensitive parameters was almost identical while they changed significantly in meiliang bay table 4 in simulations of phosphorus for example bmrc and prrc were more sensitive in meilang bay while wsc and pmc were very sensitive in other two subareas with lower nutrients concentrations in meiliang bay ktg1c was the most sensitive parameter in simulations of most indicators which meant that temperature was the most significant factor in this subarea in subareas with lower concentrations i e central zone and southwest zone kechl were the most important parameters table 4 thus influence of light should be given greater attention we attribute the phenomenon to the difference in limiting factors in three subareas in subareas with lower algae concentration algae play an important role in light extinction which in return lead to a great impact on algal growth and then affect the simulation of nutrients however influence of light decreases in subareas with too high algae concentration because algae on the water surface has already intercepted most light temperature then became a limiting factor in these subareas not only light and temperature have great impact in simulation but also other boundary conditions could also be responsible for the spatial variability of sensitivity for example wind speed was found to have the largest impact on simulation between in out flow wind speed wind direction and initial water level li et al 2014 thus some parameters concerned with wind like wind drag coefficient were found to be very sensitive in our previous research on hydrodynamic conditions li et al 2015b the effects of external nutrients reductions on algal blooms were investigated to evaluate the influence of boundary conditions on the model and results showed that chlorophyll a chl a concentrations only decreased a little when implementing high nutrients reduction scenario tang et al 2016 it is consistent with our results that little parameters related to nutrients were sensitive uncertainty of simulation also had a close relationship with indicators concentration in different subareas meiliang bay is connected to some inflow rivers with high concentrations of nutrients and greater benthic fluxes due to thick sediment deposits luo et al 2004 the simulation in this subareas was therefore less influenced by model parameters and lower concentration subareas should be given much attention when modifying parameters in addition currents and waves were weak in this bay area where the impact of wind is expected to be less than other two subareas the calculation of water quality variables was based on hydrodynamic conditions strong currents and waves will accelerate transportation and transformation of nutrients which results in higher relative uncertainty in the central zone and southwest zone uncertainty of simulation was related to the simulation time as well according to the results the uncertainty in the three subareas increased rapidly when the simulation time was over 150 days while the concentration of algae began to rise and algae blooms frequently occurred at the same time with increasing temperature and light intensity algal growth basal metabolism and some other algal kinetic processes became more active from the results of the sensitivity analysis that most sensitivity parameters were related to algal kinetics we infer that the increased uncertainty over time mostly resulted from enhanced algal kinetic processes finally it was hard to simulate all water quality indicators through modification of model parameters since other uncertain factors also showed significant impact on simulation results several important nutrients peaks were missed in figs 3 and 4 almost all of the missed peaks were located in offshore areas i e meiliang bay and southwest zone which were highly influenced by boundary conditions we attributed the result to the uncertainty of nutrients loading data especially for the non point source pollution we checked the rainfall data and found that there is a strong relationship between missed peaks and the intensity of rainfall we suggested that the non point source pollution resulted from rainfall was underestimated which caused reduce in nutrients loading 4 3 generalization for a larger modelling community and future work except external input from rivers and internal input from sediment beds biological activity is a significant part for nutrients simulation in these models with more sensitive parameters than that in hydrolysis mineralization and settlement since net algal production can be divided into five phases algal growth metabolism predation settling and external sources ji 2007 maximum growth rate basal metabolism rate and predation rate were sensitive apparently which was found both in our study and other places like lake kinneret based on a dyresm caedym model bruce et al 2006 light was an important limitation on algae growth and light extinction due to chlorophyll a was a very sensitive parameter in this study however for some deep lakes like lake washington background light extinction was more sensitive arhonditsis and brett 2005 thus light extinction due to chlorophyll a in shallow lakes with serious algal blooms were more sensitive than that in deep lakes where background light extinction was more sensitive temperature was also a significant factor in algal growth and the optimal temperature effect coefficient was a very sensitive parameter in the limitation of temperature in our research seasonal temperature varying widely in lake taihu was mostly lower than the optimal temperature for cyanobacterial growth in contrast the temperature of lake dianchi was higher than that of lake taihu and temperature effect coefficient was not a sensitive parameter in the dianchi model yi et al 2016 hence we infer that the temperature effect coefficient might turn out to be a sensitive parameter in lakes with an obvious seasonal temperature variation some water quality models used widely are based on similar theory which contains dissolved oxygen algae nutrients and so on some modern models are only subtle variations on model structures established in the 1970s or earlier franks 2009 the governing equations in these models such as efdc wasp and dyresm are similar as well park et al 2005 cerco and cole 1993 which encourage us to extend the results in this study to a larger modelling community producing a believable output requires not only a realistic growth rate response to limiting nutrients but also a realistic consumption of non or lesser limiting nutrients flynn 2003 2005 for the future work variable stoichiometry phytoplankton models like caperon meyer quota model need to be considered for non steady state applications rather than some traditional models like michaelis menten nutrient kinetics flynn 2008 2005 flynn and mitra 2016 though this requires better statistical comparisons of models and data it can make planktonic ecosystem models much more powerful tools franks 2009 redfield monod models often use nutrient limitation as a significant factor controlling phytoplankton growth and yet biologically such nutrient limitation is associated with significant variation in elemental stoichiometry flynn 2010 such as the variable stoichiometry c n p and in some models c chl of phytoplankton cells jackson et al 2017 butenschön et al 2016 robson 2014 baird et al 2013 flynn 2001 droop 1975 it can demonstrate the behavior of the dynamic chl parameterization over a range of light and nutrient limiting environments for phytoplankton of different sizes and growth rates baird et al 2013 the appropriate description of the control of the transport of the non limiting nutrient is also important and a ﬁxed algal n p should not be assumed flynn 2008 including zooplankton explicitly rather than a fixed predation rate leads to much more realistic plankton dynamics due to the complexity of zooplankton model there are no advanced module in efdc currently current knowledge of plankton ecology ascribes a large proportion of zooplankton losses to zooplankton cannibalism and carnivory rather than via the activity of higher trophic levels beyond the plankton planktonic ecosystem models typically represent all zooplankton losses by mathematically rather than biologically justified closure functions even these closure functions include zooplanktonic cannibalism and carnivory these processes are not explicitly implemented within the grazing function while the biomass outputs may appear similar the fate of annual primary production and f ratios vary widely mitra 2009 5 conclusions in this research nutrients were chosen as output indicators and 40 parameters were sampled glue and rsa methods were applied to analyze the parametric uncertainty and sensitivity of the efdc model in lake taihu a typical large shallow lake three parameters related to algal kinetics i e pmc bmrc and prrc were sensitive parameters in the simulation of water quality in the eutrophic waterbody for shallow lakes with frequent algal blooms light extinction due to chlorophyll a is also a sensitive parameter while background light extinction has also been shown to be sensitive for deep lakes for lakes with seasonal temperature variation the temperature effect coefficient for algal growth is sensitive sensitive parameters also varied in different lake subareas for high nutrients and algae concentration subareas temperature was more likely to be a limiting factor whereas sensitive factors could be light in lower concentration subareas since most sensitive parameters were related to algae uncertainty of simulation results increased with increase in algal kinetic processes over time it also varied in different subareas lower nutrients and algae concentration subareas were more easily influenced by model parameters and nearshore areas were highly influenced by boundary conditions for the future work variable stoichiometry phytoplankton models will be considered and zooplankton will be integrated into the model explicitly rather than a fixed predation rate acknowledgements the authors wish to express their great gratitude to the toolbox developed by pianosi et al

25307,although tropical rainforests preserve high levels of biodiversity they are among the most threatened ecosystems globally due to large scale fragmentation as a result of anthropogenic activities overall fast human driven habitat destruction is suspected to be one of the major causes of species extinction the mosaic of vegetation types which contributes to the incredible diversity of the tropics is highly impacted by large scale fragmentation the main causes of such habitat fragmentation are selective logging for valuable timber and agricultural clearance the knowledge of the short and long term effects of removing selected species in the tropical rainforests are scarce and need to be further investigated some studies about the effects of tropical forest disturbance in the short term have been conducted but in the long term there is limited knowledge in this paper i consider a system of coupled ordinary differential equations odes that modelled the dynamics of tropical rainforest subject to selective logging to understand how and why weeds and vine displace and limit tree species from the empirical data collected on canopy height and plant diversity and the model proposed i have the evidence of a decreasing tree diversity in tropical forests subject to management in comparison with to the same but untouched forests keywords forest gaps dynamics weed vines disturbance logging 1 introduction tropical forests provide crucial ecosystem goods and services such as sequestering carbon from the atmosphere protecting watersheds and conserving biodiversity valentini et al 2014 cazzolla gatti 2016a b avitabile et al 2016 around 40 75 of all biotic species are indigenous to rainforests half of all the living animal and plant species on the planet live there and about two thirds of all flowering plants can be found in rainforests tropical forests are among the most threatened ecosystems by large scale fragmentation due to human activity such as heavy logging and agricultural clearance cazzolla gatti et al 2015 actually the area covered by rainforests around the world is rapidly shrinking most prior studies into the impacts of land use in tropical ecosystems on the global carbon cycle and conservation of biological diversity have focused on deforestation thompson et al 2009 in several countries forest resource extraction has experienced a shift from clearcutting to selective logging de wasseige and defourny 2004 gascon et al 1998 drigo et al 2009 cazzolla gatti et al 2015 vaglio laurin et al 2016 in some regions of the world such as africa selective logging is of great importance because it allows maintaining a significant forest cover and understock of living biomass selective logging i e the practice of cutting down one or two largest trees while leaving the rest intact is increasingly embraced as an approach which protects the integrity of forest ecosystems while allowing an appropriate use of resources this is a concept specifically designed to reconcile the different interests in forests including the maintenance of biodiversity rametsteiner and simula 2003 imai et al 2012 however several studies in tropical forests subject to selective logging have shown changes in species composition silva et al 1995 magnusson et al 1999 luna et al 1999 ganzhorn et al 1990 genetic diversity jennings et al 2001 forest structure hall et al 2003 okuda et al 2003 and nutrient cycling herbohn and congdon 1993 however the knowledge on the short and long term effects of removing selected species are scarce and need to be further investigated one of the main effects of selective logging on forest dynamics seems to be the local disturbance which involves the invasion of open space by weed vines and climbers at the expense of the late successional state cenosis schnitzer et al 2000 in secondary forests regrowth of clearcut areas instead the secondary succession does not significantly involve vines and weeds being directed by the pioneer tree species towards a climax there is some evidence that tropical forests subject to selective logging have suffered a decline of biodiversity both of animals and plants species gascon et al 1998 thompson et al 2009 asner et al 2005 imai et al 2012 cazzolla gatti et al 2015 weeds vines and climbing forest species exhibit a well known range of ecological roles darwin 1867 and are fundamental components in forest dynamics with respect to natural disturbance regimes from pioneer phase to mature phase and they regenerate from a range of sources including dormant seeds seed rain pre established juveniles and resprouts from damaged adults gentry 1991 most weeds vines and climbers are uncommon in old growth forest ecosystems disturbance plays a critical role in weed invasions in rainforests because it creates opportunities for weeds to claim previously utilised space and resources rainforest weeds rarely tolerate shade so some kind of minor disturbance resulting in an opening of the canopy is usually necessary for weed establishment typically fragmentation and selective logging open up gaps of light in which weeds displace or suppress native species otherwise in natural gaps e g due to big broken branch or standing dead trees the light space created is usually smaller than in logging gaps and tree saplings seem to be prepared to grow fast to fill the canopy opening bais et al 2003 perry et al 2005 thorpe et al 2009 dudley and file 2007 callaway and mahall 2007 this reduces the likelihood of vines weeds and climber invasion asner et al 2004 cannon et al 1994 in this work i will derive a simple model to describe the dynamics of tropical rainforest subject to selective logging for this purpose i developed a quantitative deterministic model that describes the dynamic of tropical trees coexisting with weeds vines and climbers i argue that the selective removal of tallest tropical trees creates gaps of light in which weeds vines and climbers can grow to suppress the sprouting trees this hypothesis is supported by a dataset of tree heights and weed vine cover that i collected from 21 plots located in central and west africa both in untouched and managed areas to my knowledge this is the first mathematical model that builds on those experimental findings to quantitatively explain the presence of weed and vines in forest subject to selective logging the model is embodied with two simple ordinary differential equations and does not explicitly describe the spatial structure of the forest my results show that different regime shifts may occur depending on the type of forest management adopted 2 materials and methods this work is based on the concept of the vertical structure of the forest cazzolla gatti et al 2017b i refer to structure as the vertical composition and stratification of vegetational layers from the understory to the highest trees in this sense the vertical structure of a forest may be described by some statistical parameters of height distribution of the trees like the mean the standard deviation or a specific percentile i consider that a forest is well structured when the distribution of trees heights is wide and heterogeneous fig 1 vice versa i consider forest as unstructured when the distribution of the trees heights is concentrated into a small range and the variability is quite low for the purpose of this work i introduce a vertical vegetational structure index h ranging from 1 the maximum value corresponding to a proxy of a well conserved old growth tropical forest to 0 the minimum value corresponding to a proxy of a highly damaged forest e g clearcut intermediate values of h should indicate that the forest has decreased its height of some amount but the largest contribution to the index must be given by the tall trees therefore a herd of elephants cutting a path below the untouched high canopy should decrease by little or no amount the value of h while the selective logging of commercially valuable trees which are the tallest in the forest should decrease h by a sizable amount such index may represent a single statistical parameter e g mean canopy height or the standard deviation as well as an indicator of the combination of more parameters in this study because i am interested in the effects on the long term of the selective removal of higher trees i assign to the vertical structure index h the mean of trees height over the 80 percentile nevertheless other statistical parameters will be compared and some discussion will be carried out 2 1 the model the model includes two state variables the forest vertical index h based on the height distribution of the trees over the 80 percentile and the weeds vines and climbers cover q in the absence of any other disturbance when empty space becomes colonized by a forest i shall assume that the index h is subject to the following simple dynamics 1 d h d t r h h where the growth rate r is a decreasing continuous function of h it reaches a positive maximum for h 0 and becomes zero at h hmax it is convenient to rescale all the quantities by using r 0 1 as the unit of time and hmax as the unit of h therefore the above assumptions on r can be summarized as r 0 1 r 1 0 r h 0 because weeds and vines grow only in gaps of light into structured forest i take into account three basic assumption i the carrying capacity of the vines in an untouched forest values of h close to hmax is essentially zero ii weeds vines and climbers cannot grow after a clearcutting indeed there is evidence that the forest returns to its natural composition after such management so i assume a low or even zero carrying capacity of weed vines and climbers at h 0 iii if the upper canopy of the forest is removed without damaging the lowest trees in this case one or more locations with enough light will appear at the lower levels of the forest without shattering the vertical structure therefore i am lead to conclude that the carrying capacity of the vines has a maximum at intermediate values of h the above discussion leads to the following conceptual model for the coexistence of forest and vines 2 d h d t r h α q h d q d t ε 1 q k h q where q is the biomass of vines per unit area ε is their maximum growth rate and the function k is the h dependent carrying capacity of the weeds and vines which shall be a positive function for h 0 but may be zero if h 0 the constant α determines the damping strength of the vines on the re growth of the forest 2 2 study sites i collected data on vine weed and climber densities and tree heights in tropical forests of west and central africa cazzolla gatti et al 2015 2017a in west africa forest plots were selected along the border between ghana and ivory coast bia national park and ankasa national park in central africa forest plots were selected within the congo river basin in gabon and on the border between cameroon and central african republic sangha tri national forest the first study area bia national park is part of a protected area of 306 km2 which comprise 77 7 km2 of the national park in the north and 227 9 km2 of resource reserve where logging is permitted in the south the area is located in the transition zone between the southern mixed evergreen forest and northern mixed semi deciduous forest the average annual precipitation ranges from 1500 mm to 1800 mm and the average monthly temperatures range between 24 and 28 c with the rainy season during the months of may june september and october more than 300 plant species per hectare can be observed species from the makore dahoma khaya and marantis genera are widespread the ankasa conservation area in western ghana is a 500 km2 wildlife protected area the southern parts of ankasa were logged from the early 1960s up to 1970s logging intensity was relatively low due to the low volumes of commercially valuable species available nini sushien contains one of the few remaining blocks of relatively untouched forest in the country annual precipitation is 1700 2000 mm plant diversity is similar to bia national park is classified as wet evergreen and ankasa as evergreen forest the study area in cameroon is bordered to the east by the sangha river a tributary of the congo river and it belongs to the sangha tri national protected area stn the park covers an area of 1838 km2 with an altitude ranging between 300 m and 750 m above sea level the area consists of semi evergreen forests with over 300 species of trees the largest ones including ceiba pentandra l gaertn terminalia superba engl diels and members of the family sterculiaceae triplochiton pterygota the average annual precipitation is 1400 mm with the dry season occurring from december to february the study area of woleu ntem and moyen ogoouè in the north and central gabon cover about 1800 km2 annual precipitation is 1750 3050 mm with almost all rain falling between october and april there is little if any rainfall may september but humidity remains high mean daily temperature is about 27 c and varies little throughout the year the vegetation is a moist and evergreen forest in all the study sites the commercial tree species most commonly harvested are enthandrophragma cylindricum k schum terminalia superba engl diels triplochiton scleroxylon sprague and heritiera utilis sprague sprague a typical selective logging scheme includes the harvest of trees with diameters bigger than 30 100 cm and logging cycles of 15 30 years for example in central africa the minimum diameter is 100 cm for enthandrophragma cylindricum 60 cm for terminalia superba and 80 cm for triplochiton scleroxylon and logging cycle is 15 30 years 2 3 plots selection and data sampling original data used to calibrate the model proposed here are in cazzolla gatti et al 2015 cazzolla gatti et al 2017a table 1 to identify and outline the sample plots i performed the following protocol i the study areas in three tropical african countries cameroon ghana and gabon were surveyed to detect each forest category primary secondary and selectively logged fig 1 34 plots of 500 m2 were selected at a minimum buffer distance of 50 m from access roads and logging trails and subdivided into 5 subplots of 100 m2 for an easier tree mapping and detection the selected plots included 11 primary old growth forests pf 13 areas subject to selective logging sl and 10 secondary forests i e subject to clear cutting and then left to recover sf iii in each plot corners coordinates were collected with a gps and the years from the last logging activity was recorded when available height and biodiversity variance were calculated for each of the 3 main forest management types grouping plots with similar conditions as reported in table 1 for each plot i also recorded genus species name tree position into the plot and trees height by a laser hypsometer dendrometer 3 results 3 1 data analysis the evidence of the leading role of taller trees on forest structure is shown in fig 2 in this figure the model s two unstable manifolds solid red lines connect with the two stable equilibria the model s two stable manifolds solid blue lines come from infinity one of them goes close to the trivial equilibrium without reaching it two initial conditions black stars belonging to two separate basins of attractions are shown together with the orbits originating from them thin solid green lines the thin dashed black line represents the process of removing the highest commercially valuable trees bringing the system from the healthy forest state lower right black dot to a state the star further from the origin which has essentially the same weed density but a much lower value of h and that belongs to the attraction basin of the unhealthy forest upper left black dot a forest fire would destroy both forest and weeds moving the system to a state the star closer to the origin which is still in the basin of attraction of the healthy forest fixed point the standard deviation of the mean canopy height of the untouched forests green markers is higher than those subject to selective logging red markers that is the untouched forests show greater variability in the distribution of heights with regard to the basic assumption of the model listed above the data collected give rise to my hypothesis the correlation between the average of trees height over the 80 percentile and weeds vines climbers is quite strong in plots subject to selective logging but not for those subject to clearcutting in forests subject to clear cutting the weeds vines climbers are almost absent indicating that they do not have important ecological roles in deforested site also the correlation between the mean canopy height and weeds vines climbers although less strong is not deniable in the plots subject to selective logging this result is reasonable since the arithmetic mean takes into account all trees present into the plot and in tropical forests the tallest tree is also the rarest one 3 2 equilibria the system of eq 2 has the trivially fixed point ho qo 0 corresponding to the absence of both forest and vines other fixed points satisfy the following algebraic equation 3 q o k h o r h o α in other words an equilibrium occurs when the growth rate of the forest rescaled with the damping term α equals the carrying capacity of the vines fig 2 on the other hand if the upper canopy of the forest is removed without damaging the lowest trees many more gaps with enough light will appear at the lower levels of the forest without damaging too much the quality of the soil therefore i am lead to conclude that the carrying capacity of the vines has a maximum at intermediate values of h depending on the shape of the functions k and r the condition of the eq 3 may be satisfied never once or more than once fig 3 shows a case with one non trivial equilibrium dashed magenta line and a case with three non trivial equilibria solid magenta line for simplicity i have used r h 1 h and k h βh2e ɤh2 with suitable values of the constants β γ if my assumptions on the general shape r and k are correct three intersections should be not uncommon this is the interesting case of my discussion when there are three non trivial equilibria linear stability analysis shows that the equilibrium having intermediate values of ho and qo is unstable and in particular it is a saddle the equilibria having low ho and high qo unhealthy forest with a dominance of weeds and vines and high ho and high qo healthy forest with few vines are stable the phase state of the system is partitioned into two basins of attractions by the stable manifold of the saddle equilibrium the u shaped blue line in fig 2 all the orbits starting from the states into the u region of the phase space converge to the unhealthy forest equilibrium and the orbits from the states outside that region converge to the healthy forest state the particular choice of r and k does not affect much this partitioning as long as there are three non trivial equilibria two stable ones and a saddle in between them and that k 0 is sufficiently small if k 0 has a sufficiently high value i have numerical evidence that a global bifurcation occurs in which the left side branch of the stable manifold of the saddle point originates from the trivial fixed point rather than from infinity in this case the states with low values of h but a sufficiently high value of q will originate orbits converging to the unhealthy forest fixed point 4 discussion and conclusion the action of cutting the highest trees leaves the forest with a much lowered value of h but changes little the density of the few vines present in the healthy forest in other words the cut moves the system along the horizontal dashed line in fig 2 if the drop in h is large enough the new state represented by the star at the left end of the dashed line may belong to the basin of attraction of the unhealthy forest state therefore as time passes the forest does not recover to a healthy state but falls into the unhealthy vine infested one it is possible that even the removal of a single big tree is enough to locally move the system to the unhealthy forest basin of attraction by locally i mean on a surface of a few thousand square meters the possibility of recovery then depends on the ability of the surrounding healthy forest to invade the unhealthy spot this calls for an explicit spatial modelling on the other hand the action of a fire or other catastrophic events that destroy most of the biomass in the forest including the vines moves the system close to the origin the star in the lower left corner of fig 2 because of the basin of attraction of the unhealthy forest fixed point does not extend up to the axis h 0 it is u shaped all states having sufficiently small h belong to the basin of attraction of the healthy forest fixed point from the empirical data collected on canopy height and plant diversity fig 4 i have the evidence of a decreasing tree diversity in tropical forests subject to selective logging in comparison with to the same but untouched forests i now have evidence that there is a well defined correlation between canopy height and biodiversity cazzolla gatti et al 2017b and it is clear that the highest levels of biodiversity reside in the untouched forests cazzolla gatti et al 2017c therefore this finding calls for an urgent response aimed at protecting and enhancing the forest conservation through specific interventions both in terms of policy and management and regulatory mechanisms to prevent human pressure on tropical areas cazzolla gatti 2016c also in the light of the recent anthropogenic impacts of climate change battipaglia et al 2015 my work confirms the importance of using dynamic deterministic models for identifying vulnerabilities and thresholds while assessing the impacts of anthropogenic activities i believe that in the future approaches like this model will have a wider use because they provide simple and clear instruments to policy makers and planning conservation

25307,although tropical rainforests preserve high levels of biodiversity they are among the most threatened ecosystems globally due to large scale fragmentation as a result of anthropogenic activities overall fast human driven habitat destruction is suspected to be one of the major causes of species extinction the mosaic of vegetation types which contributes to the incredible diversity of the tropics is highly impacted by large scale fragmentation the main causes of such habitat fragmentation are selective logging for valuable timber and agricultural clearance the knowledge of the short and long term effects of removing selected species in the tropical rainforests are scarce and need to be further investigated some studies about the effects of tropical forest disturbance in the short term have been conducted but in the long term there is limited knowledge in this paper i consider a system of coupled ordinary differential equations odes that modelled the dynamics of tropical rainforest subject to selective logging to understand how and why weeds and vine displace and limit tree species from the empirical data collected on canopy height and plant diversity and the model proposed i have the evidence of a decreasing tree diversity in tropical forests subject to management in comparison with to the same but untouched forests keywords forest gaps dynamics weed vines disturbance logging 1 introduction tropical forests provide crucial ecosystem goods and services such as sequestering carbon from the atmosphere protecting watersheds and conserving biodiversity valentini et al 2014 cazzolla gatti 2016a b avitabile et al 2016 around 40 75 of all biotic species are indigenous to rainforests half of all the living animal and plant species on the planet live there and about two thirds of all flowering plants can be found in rainforests tropical forests are among the most threatened ecosystems by large scale fragmentation due to human activity such as heavy logging and agricultural clearance cazzolla gatti et al 2015 actually the area covered by rainforests around the world is rapidly shrinking most prior studies into the impacts of land use in tropical ecosystems on the global carbon cycle and conservation of biological diversity have focused on deforestation thompson et al 2009 in several countries forest resource extraction has experienced a shift from clearcutting to selective logging de wasseige and defourny 2004 gascon et al 1998 drigo et al 2009 cazzolla gatti et al 2015 vaglio laurin et al 2016 in some regions of the world such as africa selective logging is of great importance because it allows maintaining a significant forest cover and understock of living biomass selective logging i e the practice of cutting down one or two largest trees while leaving the rest intact is increasingly embraced as an approach which protects the integrity of forest ecosystems while allowing an appropriate use of resources this is a concept specifically designed to reconcile the different interests in forests including the maintenance of biodiversity rametsteiner and simula 2003 imai et al 2012 however several studies in tropical forests subject to selective logging have shown changes in species composition silva et al 1995 magnusson et al 1999 luna et al 1999 ganzhorn et al 1990 genetic diversity jennings et al 2001 forest structure hall et al 2003 okuda et al 2003 and nutrient cycling herbohn and congdon 1993 however the knowledge on the short and long term effects of removing selected species are scarce and need to be further investigated one of the main effects of selective logging on forest dynamics seems to be the local disturbance which involves the invasion of open space by weed vines and climbers at the expense of the late successional state cenosis schnitzer et al 2000 in secondary forests regrowth of clearcut areas instead the secondary succession does not significantly involve vines and weeds being directed by the pioneer tree species towards a climax there is some evidence that tropical forests subject to selective logging have suffered a decline of biodiversity both of animals and plants species gascon et al 1998 thompson et al 2009 asner et al 2005 imai et al 2012 cazzolla gatti et al 2015 weeds vines and climbing forest species exhibit a well known range of ecological roles darwin 1867 and are fundamental components in forest dynamics with respect to natural disturbance regimes from pioneer phase to mature phase and they regenerate from a range of sources including dormant seeds seed rain pre established juveniles and resprouts from damaged adults gentry 1991 most weeds vines and climbers are uncommon in old growth forest ecosystems disturbance plays a critical role in weed invasions in rainforests because it creates opportunities for weeds to claim previously utilised space and resources rainforest weeds rarely tolerate shade so some kind of minor disturbance resulting in an opening of the canopy is usually necessary for weed establishment typically fragmentation and selective logging open up gaps of light in which weeds displace or suppress native species otherwise in natural gaps e g due to big broken branch or standing dead trees the light space created is usually smaller than in logging gaps and tree saplings seem to be prepared to grow fast to fill the canopy opening bais et al 2003 perry et al 2005 thorpe et al 2009 dudley and file 2007 callaway and mahall 2007 this reduces the likelihood of vines weeds and climber invasion asner et al 2004 cannon et al 1994 in this work i will derive a simple model to describe the dynamics of tropical rainforest subject to selective logging for this purpose i developed a quantitative deterministic model that describes the dynamic of tropical trees coexisting with weeds vines and climbers i argue that the selective removal of tallest tropical trees creates gaps of light in which weeds vines and climbers can grow to suppress the sprouting trees this hypothesis is supported by a dataset of tree heights and weed vine cover that i collected from 21 plots located in central and west africa both in untouched and managed areas to my knowledge this is the first mathematical model that builds on those experimental findings to quantitatively explain the presence of weed and vines in forest subject to selective logging the model is embodied with two simple ordinary differential equations and does not explicitly describe the spatial structure of the forest my results show that different regime shifts may occur depending on the type of forest management adopted 2 materials and methods this work is based on the concept of the vertical structure of the forest cazzolla gatti et al 2017b i refer to structure as the vertical composition and stratification of vegetational layers from the understory to the highest trees in this sense the vertical structure of a forest may be described by some statistical parameters of height distribution of the trees like the mean the standard deviation or a specific percentile i consider that a forest is well structured when the distribution of trees heights is wide and heterogeneous fig 1 vice versa i consider forest as unstructured when the distribution of the trees heights is concentrated into a small range and the variability is quite low for the purpose of this work i introduce a vertical vegetational structure index h ranging from 1 the maximum value corresponding to a proxy of a well conserved old growth tropical forest to 0 the minimum value corresponding to a proxy of a highly damaged forest e g clearcut intermediate values of h should indicate that the forest has decreased its height of some amount but the largest contribution to the index must be given by the tall trees therefore a herd of elephants cutting a path below the untouched high canopy should decrease by little or no amount the value of h while the selective logging of commercially valuable trees which are the tallest in the forest should decrease h by a sizable amount such index may represent a single statistical parameter e g mean canopy height or the standard deviation as well as an indicator of the combination of more parameters in this study because i am interested in the effects on the long term of the selective removal of higher trees i assign to the vertical structure index h the mean of trees height over the 80 percentile nevertheless other statistical parameters will be compared and some discussion will be carried out 2 1 the model the model includes two state variables the forest vertical index h based on the height distribution of the trees over the 80 percentile and the weeds vines and climbers cover q in the absence of any other disturbance when empty space becomes colonized by a forest i shall assume that the index h is subject to the following simple dynamics 1 d h d t r h h where the growth rate r is a decreasing continuous function of h it reaches a positive maximum for h 0 and becomes zero at h hmax it is convenient to rescale all the quantities by using r 0 1 as the unit of time and hmax as the unit of h therefore the above assumptions on r can be summarized as r 0 1 r 1 0 r h 0 because weeds and vines grow only in gaps of light into structured forest i take into account three basic assumption i the carrying capacity of the vines in an untouched forest values of h close to hmax is essentially zero ii weeds vines and climbers cannot grow after a clearcutting indeed there is evidence that the forest returns to its natural composition after such management so i assume a low or even zero carrying capacity of weed vines and climbers at h 0 iii if the upper canopy of the forest is removed without damaging the lowest trees in this case one or more locations with enough light will appear at the lower levels of the forest without shattering the vertical structure therefore i am lead to conclude that the carrying capacity of the vines has a maximum at intermediate values of h the above discussion leads to the following conceptual model for the coexistence of forest and vines 2 d h d t r h α q h d q d t ε 1 q k h q where q is the biomass of vines per unit area ε is their maximum growth rate and the function k is the h dependent carrying capacity of the weeds and vines which shall be a positive function for h 0 but may be zero if h 0 the constant α determines the damping strength of the vines on the re growth of the forest 2 2 study sites i collected

25308,ecological models attempting to unite the concepts of biodiversity and biogeography have been used to describe and predict the distribution and abundance of species two mechanistic hypotheses the neutral model and the community level metapopulation model have the potential for direct comparison however there is potential for incorrectly inferring the underlying mechanisms of observed data if the hypotheses have similar descriptive ability in this paper we simulated a range of abiotic island mainland system and biotic community structure variables following the mechanisms underlying these two hypotheses in order to compare model descriptive ability relative to each other and to a null model we found that the null and metapopulation models could accurately describe data created under their respective assumptions for many of the simulated system structures the neutral model generally failed to describe data created under neutral conditions relative to the null model modelling also revealed limitations of these mechanistic models identifying conditions where metapopulation dynamics would be inferred but were not occurring and failing to detect metapopulation dynamics where it was actually occurring to help alleviate this problem we also identified sets of conditions where metapopulation dynamics if it is actually occurring could be distinguished from null or neutral models such systems have moderate variability in distance to mainland density of mainland species and island area as well as low to moderate numbers of islands and species 10 50 simulations demonstrated the potential to distinguish unified models under certain conditions but there are also conditions where models are equivalent and where the model that best described the data was not consistent with the underlying mechanism these shortcomings may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding mechanisms presumed to be producing observed patterns in species abundance and distribution keywords biodiversity metapopulation neutral theory null model species richness unified theory 1 introduction understanding and predicting the distribution and abundance of species lies at the heart

rosinell and harmon 2013 whittaker et al 2008 these competing hypotheses all describe patterns of biodiversity and hold promise for predicting the distribution and abundance of species and potentially for understanding the biological mechanisms thought to produce these patterns cabral et al 2017 jones et al 2011 leidinger and cabral 2017 a limitation of current unified hypotheses is that there have been few quantitative comparisons among them jones et al 2011 evaluation often has been limited to qualitative analysis of a single hypothesis e g mcgill et al 2006 and less commonly between or among hypotheses e g mcgill 2010 where quantitative comparisons exist the studies generally have tested a single hypothesis within a taxon versus a null model in contrast to testing competing hypotheses e g matter et al 2002 mcgill 2006 quantitative comparison among all unified hypotheses is difficult due to the inherit dissimilarities among them including the spatial and temporal scale of investigation mechanisms influencing distribution and abundance assumed and underlying theories used to develop the hypotheses however comparisons can be made among unified hypotheses derived from similar theory two of the unified hypotheses can be used to investigate the same community scale structure and were similarly derived both the unified neutral and metapopulation hypotheses incorporate similar mechanisms and are derived from the theory of island biogeography macarthur and wilson 1967 to produce patterns of species incidence and abundance assuming these mechanisms small and or isolated areas of habitat would have lower colonization and higher extinction rates compared to larger less isolated areas producing a positive relationship between species richness and area and a decreasing relationship between species richness and isolation hanski and gyllenberg 1997 matter et al 2002 these two hypotheses have the potential to be useful for ecological studies because of the limited set of mechanisms but their performances have not been directly compared the general background of the two unified hypotheses used in this paper neutral and metapopulation are briefly described here but are described in detail elsewhere including their derivations hanski and gyllenberg 1997 hubbell 2001 matter et al 2002 may et al 2013 may et al 2016 mcgill 2010 rosindell et al 2011 rosinell and harmon 2013 the two unified models can only be compared within an island mainland system for a variety of reasons detailed in the model descriptions island mainland systems historically have served as important models to study ecological theories and continue to be important for elucidating mechanisms driving biodiversity warren et al 2015 1 1 neutral model the neutral hypothesis is considered neutral because all individuals in the community are assumed to have identical migration birth and death rates the interactions among species at the level of individual organisms is also considered equal the hypothesis mechanisms such as colonization extinction and speciation determine species richness and are assumed to be equal for all individuals and in the community hubbell 2001 specifically the neutral hypothesis describes both local and regional metacommunity patterns of relative abundance and can include the mechanisms of random migration speciation as well as ecological drift while the neutral hypothesis has application over evolutionary time it also can be applied to biodiversity patterns in island mainland systems over ecological time which is the focus of this study the neutral hypothesis also follows a zero sum dynamics assumption there is a constant number of individuals in a system with equal birth and death rates hubbell 1979 hubbell 2001 under these assumptions the distribution and abundance of species can be predicted from the relative abundance of each species in the community the neutral hypothesis has been used to predict the distribution and abundance of different taxa such as tropical trees marine invertebrates temperate herbaceous plants birds fish and insects fuller et al 2004 he 2005 hubbell 2001 mcgill 2003 mcgill 2006 mcgill et al 2007 pandolfi 1996 terborgh et al 1996 but generally has not been applied to island mainland systems despite its flexibility to be used in these systems leidinger and cabral 2017 rosindell and phillimore 2011 previous studies generally only evaluated this hypothesis for a single island and for fragmented habitat patches fuller et al 2004 he 2005 hubbell 2001 mcgill 2003 mcgill 2006 mcgill et al 2007 pandolfi 1996 rosindell and harmon 2013 terborgh et al 1996 a unified hypothesis should not be taxon specific but rather have the ability to universally applied to any ecological communities few studies have tested the neutral hypothesis in an island mainland system and tests generally have only considered a single taxon leidinger and cabral et al 2017 rosindell and phillimore 2011 mcgill 2006 reviewed multiple sets of empirical tests and found that all failed to support the neutral model despite that the development of the neutral model was done with single island data hubbell 2001 none of these empirical tests were done in an island mainland setting using multiple islands the distribution patterns of such a system may vary from patterns seen for a single sample or habitat patch one example is a study done by leigh et al 1993 on islands of gatun reservoir in central panama which was the same system where hubbell 2001 collected the data that the neutral hypothesis was based on the authors indirectly tested neutrality for the same taxa as well mature tropical tree species and found that some species were lost more rapidly than expected by random extinction on the six smallest islands hubbell 2001 found neutrality for data collected on one of the largest islands of gatun reservoir barro colorado island therefore evaluating the assumption of neutrality for all islands in a multiple island mainland setting may yield different results than if it was studied in a single island setting or a subset of island sizes bowers and matter 1997 connor et al 2000 differences in community structure may also occur depending on the sampling scale gaston and matter 2002 found the relationship between the number of individuals of a species and area can change depending on whether sampling was at a habitat specific patch level versus a general sampling area similarly neutrality may also be scale dependent since it operates on the level of the individual since the neutral hypothesis was originally derived using islands as patches it may be more appropriate to test it in island systems 1 2 metapopulation model the second unified hypothesis is the metapopulation hypothesis which scales up predictions made for single species to the community level thus this model can be used to describe species incidence as well as species richness the metapopulation hypothesis was developed assuming island mainland conditions i e there is a mainland that is a source of species that re colonize islands hanski and gyllenberg 1997 therefore comparative tests are only valid under island mainland conditions the metapopulation hypothesis assumes that species richness s for a given island is determined by a balance of local extinction occurring on islands and re colonization from a mainland species pool r 1 l o g s j r 1 s j r a x l o g a j α d j where a is the area and d the distance from the mainland of island j and x and α describe the mean extinction risk and the mean migration ability of species in the community respectively hanski and gyllenberg 1997 matter et al 2002 the parameter a is an amalgam of mean population density the scaling of extinction risk with area and a constant parameter this bottom up approach scaling a population level hypothesis to the community level is potentially beneficial because extinction and recolonization are viewed from the species level species richness is then determined by summing incidence for individual species on an island as opposed to the neutral hypothesis species in the metapopulation model are not treated equally but instead have individual estimates using the following the incidence p function for species i on island j 2 p i j e k i j e k i j 1 where k i j is the logit transformed species specific incidence 3 k i j l o g p i j 1 p i j l o g c 1 x i l o g w i x i l o g a j α i d j where α i describes the migration ability of species i in the community and w i is the constant density of species i hanski and gyllenberg 1997 matter et al 2002 c is a constant parameter 1 3 null model an important consideration when testing mechanistic models is its performance relative to a null hypothesis a model that does not include the postulated mechanisms gotelli and graves 1996 by comparing the unified hypotheses to a null we can test if the mechanistic processes are important as well as if one unified hypothesis explains significantly more variance in the data than the other in the current case the null hypothesis is random placement of individuals into habitat patches which can be described by williams 1995 extreme value function this null hypothesis does not contain mechanisms found in the neutral and metapopulation hypotheses and also has the benefit of being able to accommodate sites with no species since unified hypotheses have the potential to be important tools for investigating biodiversity from a mechanistic biogeographic perspective their limitations and use should be clearly defined for empirical comparison rosindell et al 2012 one problem when applying mechanistic models to describe biological patterns is the tendency to assume that the presumed mechanisms produced the observed patterns observable patterns have the potential to be caused by alternative mechanisms thus the ability of a mechanistic model to describe data does not necessitate that the mechanism actually caused the pattern jeltsch et al 1999 kendall et al 1999 levin 1992 null models help in these situations gotelli and graves 1996 but different mechanistic models and null models can be similar in their descriptive and predictive abilities hence the ability to distinguish among them and identify when particular mechanisms are occurring may be limited in such cases an investigator looking to empirically compare mechanistic hypotheses may not find a difference between models due to their inherent similarities and not because the hypotheses have an equivalent ability to discriminate among mechanisms pontarp et al 2017 the purpose of this study was to determine the conditions that a real world system would require in order to detect a difference between the performance of the metapopulation and the unified neutral biodiversity hypotheses we simulated a range of conditions based on the underlying theory and assumptions made by both unified hypotheses i e species area relationships as well as different possible island mainland and taxon structures where neutral and metapopulation models could be directly compared our aim was to further define the potential application of these models under ecological timescales and allow for meaningful comparison under appropriate real world conditions 2 materials and methods we ran a series of simulations to compare the abilities of the neutral and metapopulation hypotheses as well as a null model to describe species richness on islands under different conditions we created three different sets of occupancy and abundance values where we knew the mechanisms responsible for the observed species distribution i e we generated them following either null neutral or metapopulation rules fig 1 each of these datasets used the same abiotic and biotic conditions we then fit statistical models based on the null neutral and metapopulation hypotheses to each of the datasets and compared their ability to describe the data 2 1 simulation structure for the abiotic island mainland system we established a range of values to represent the number of islands and variation in island area and distance to mainland table 1 island area and distance to mainland were simulated following a log normal distribution with a mean 1 and a varying range of standard deviations log scaled the resulting values were multiplied by 10 to arrive at a realistic final area simulated mainland area was calculated as the sum of all island areas multiplied by 100 we chose a log normal distribution for our simulation since it is common to a variety of island systems for example the aleutian archipelago japanese archipelago hawaiian islands and svalbard archipelago kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 wolfram mathematica v 10 for taxon structure we set species richness of the system using a range of values from 10 to 500 species for each species on the mainland we generated densities in a similar manner to island size and distance to mainland by following a log normal distribution with mean 1 and range of standard deviations of log scaled variates table 1 we calculated mainland abundance by multiplying the species specific density values by area of the mainland we used a factorial design to create a total of 3125 different system and taxon structures each of these combinations of parameters were replicated 100 times as previously stated the 3125 systems were generated following log normal distributions for area distance to mainland and species mainland densities to explore the robustness of our results to this assumption we also generated systems following uniform distributions island size distance to mainland and species mainland density were generated with a minimum 0 and a maximum value equal to the maximum values of the log normal generated values averaged across replicates table 2 we wanted both sets of data to have the same range of values with the only difference between sets being the distribution pattern which can produce vastly different systems fig 2 in order to generate occupancy and abundance data that conform to each hypothesis we incorporated their basic assumptions the structure for island occupancy and abundance for the null and starting structure for the metapopulation hypotheses were based on the species specific densities on the mainland we generated these datasets by multiplying mainland densities by island area and rounding down to the nearest whole individual for the neutral hypothesis structure was based on the proportion of total individuals comprising each species on the mainland the total numbers of individuals on islands were derived from the null dataset by summing all individuals of all species the neutral dataset was then generated by multiplying the proportion of individuals of species i on the mainland out of the total number of all individuals of all species by the total number of individuals on an island rounding down to the nearest individual the resulting null and neutral datasets were similar but not always identical since datasets had a similar number of individuals but varying abundances among species since species identity was based on density versus proportion these datasets tended to be most similar when there were few individuals on islands to incorporate metapopulation dynamics into metapopulation datasets we conducted one round of extinction and recolonization on data generated by mainland density see above extinction and recolonization were based on island area and isolation respectively as well as species specific colonization and extinction rates to incorporate extinction we followed hanski 1992 metapopulation extinction probability e where islands with larger area have a lower extinction probability than smaller islands 4 e j i μ j a j x i μ j is an extinction constant and x i is a parameter incorporating how extinction risk scales with area for species i hanski 1994 1998 hanski and gyllenberg 1997 matter et al 2002 we created an extinction probability for island j by randomly generating μ j and x i following a normal distribution μ j and x i 0 2 sd 0 5 then for each island we determined a base island extinction value following a uniform distribution min 0 and max 1 if this uniform island extinction value was smaller than the extinction probability then a local extinction occurred on that island for that species the process was repeated for each species on an island and across all islands to incorporate re colonization we determined colonization probability c i j for each species i on each island j 5 c i j c i w i d i j 6 w h e r e d i j e α i d j j e α i d j where c i is a constant we generated using a normal distribution c i 1 sd 0 05 and d i j represents a connectivity value where α i was generated using a normal distribution α i 2 sd 0 5 taken from previous metapopulation estimates hanski 1998 matter et al 2002 where extinction was absent and colonization rate was greater than zero we assumed an island to be occupied by a species we only applied one round of extinctions and recolonizations once to represent a static island mainland community following metapopulation dynamics we did this to follow ecological timescales rather than evolutionary timescales which would mimic the snapshot data collected by ecological field studies that often can only gather species richness and abundance data over a short period of time 2 2 analyses we took the datasets generated under null neutral and metapopulation assumptions and fit each dataset to the following null neutral and metapopulation generalized linear models glm to compare the ability of each to describe the data 2 2 1 null model glm 7 s j 1 s j a j 8 w h e r e s j n u m b e r o f s p e c i e s o n i s l a n d j m a i n l a n d s p e c i e s r i c h n e s s 9 a n d s j 1 s j is the expected fraction of species present on island j out of total species pool we used a conjugate log log link function to fit the null model which is referred to as the extreme value function williams 1995 2 2 2 neutral model glm 10 s j 1 s j 1 θ log 1 w i n d i v i d u a l s a r e a j 1 θ where θ is double the number of individuals of all species on the mainland hubbell 2001 2 2 3 metapopulation model glm 11 s j 1 s j a j d j we used a logit link function to fit the metapopulation and neutral models and compared all three models using qaicc values for overdispersed data corrected for small sample sizes since some combinations of parameters had only 10 islands and 10 species burnham and anderson 2002 2 3 simulation evaluation for each of the three datasets we determined the best model using the lowest qaicc value when models had qaicc scores within two value points we assigned the same ranking to avoid overestimating a model s descriptive power we then determined the number of times the model was ranked best out of the 100 replicates with ties receiving half value to summarize the results this proportion was used as the dependent variable in a multinomial log linear regression mlr analysis in order to determine how biotic and abiotic conditions affected the explanatory ability of the models the mlr allowed the comparison of independent variables across the three models and indicated what variables are important for seeing a difference in the models descriptive abilities the independent variables we considered were the five abiotic and biotic variables used to construct the simulated datasets island area distance to mainland species mainland density number of islands and number of species we considered all interactions between variables in our analysis the mlr was run using the multinom function within the nnet package available for program r venables and ripley 2002 we determined the best regression models based on aic for each dataset and full interactions between all five variables using the step function in the stats package r core team 2012 the mlr test compares models using one as the baseline for evaluation the baseline for each mlr test was the model matching the generated dataset e g null model as baseline when the dataset was generated under null conditions 3 results 3 1 null generated data the null model generally was ranked as the best model 46 80 model with lowest qaicc over the neutral 15 75 and metapopulation 41 69 models for null generated data some runs resulted in models tied for the best model and not all replications had successful convergence due to insufficient variation however overall the null model had the highest descriptive ability under null conditions generally the null had better descriptive ability when data was sparser such as when there were few species and islands table 3 distance to mainland had no influence on how the data was structured and the null model descriptive ability reflected this the mlr results supported these findings particularly how null descriptive ability was dependent upon the interactions of variables table 4 such as area density and number of species which reflected the variables used in generating the underlying structure of the null data although the null model correctly described the data for the majority of combinations of conditions the metapopulation model was also ranked as the best model over 41 of the time despite the fact the statistical metapopulation model contains an extra parameter for distance from the mainland the metapopulation model generally exceeded the null when all islands had full species richness values this scenario leads to the potential error of assuming metapopulation dynamics are occurring when no such dynamics are influencing the community structure 3 2 neutral generated data the neutral model generally had poor descriptive ability for all datasets including the neutrally generated dataset the neutral model was ranked best only 14 20 out of all neutrally simulated data sets in contrast the null model and metapopulation models ranked best describing neutral data 44 00 and 42 10 respectively the neutral model had a limited range of system conditions where it excelled at describing its own data table 5 descriptive ability depended heavily on island area and variability in mainland density as expected due to how the data was generated fig 3 table 6 the majority of all replications for the neutrally derived dataset were better described by the null and metapopulation models this lack of model descriptive ability was most apparent when the system had few islands 10 50 and few species 10 50 indicating sparse presence absences of species usually in a dataset with few data points i e islands interestingly for the mlr results number of species alone was not a significant predictor but it was included in three significant interaction terms comparing the neutral to the null table 6 the three way interaction between density islands species was significantly different between the null and neutral models 3 3 metapopulation generated data the metapopulation model generally was ranked as the best model over the null and neutral models for metapopulation generated data but its descriptive ability was imperfect the metapopulation model was the best model 58 60 out of all combinations of variables and replications compared to the null 27 37 and neutral 14 01 models those conditions where the metapopulation model could explain 75 of all replications included a limited range of sd values for distance to mainland and island area table 7 the mlr results further differentiated where the null and neutral models descriptive ability were different from the metapopulation model table 8 area and density were significantly different from the metapopulation model for both the null and neutral models and the only significant interaction term for both comparisons was the density distance interaction system conditions where the metapopulation model had poor descriptive ability included the extremes in variation for distance to mainland 0 01 and 2 50 5 00 there was an interaction between mainland species densities and distance where systems with high variation in densities and low variation in distance to mainland had the poorest descriptive ability for the metapopulation model fig 4 most of the systems with low variability in island distance resulted in all islands having full species richness values due to recolonization when there is high variability in species densities almost all islands had some species missing the null model was ranked best for most of these systems incorrectly indicating that metapopulation processes were not influencing species richness 3 4 effects of uniform distributions our results are somewhat sensitive to the underlying distributions of island area and isolation and species density when we replaced the log normal with uniform distributions it resulted in a large increase in the neutral model s descriptive ability when describing neutrally generated data the neutral model went from 14 20 best rankings for log normal data to 32 07 for uniform data conditions where the neutral model had highest descriptive ability under uniform conditions include low variation in mainland species density sd 0 01 when variation in island area was moderate sd 1 00 for systems with many species 200 500 despite the increase in neutral model descriptive ability however the null model still had better 61 67 and the metapopulation had comparable 25 44 descriptive ability for neutrally generated data than the neutral model the null and metapopulations models were also sensitive to the change in underlying distribution when using uniformly distributed data the null model s descriptive ability for the null generated data increased with the null being ranked best 46 80 for log normal data to 63 74 in contrast the metapopulation model had slightly poorer descriptive ability when data was generated under uniform 49 51 compared to log normal 58 60 distributions 4 discussion inferring process from pattern continues to be fraught with difficulty while unified mechanistic models are a positive step they are by no means perfect in this paper we have demonstrated two possible errors when comparing unified models to a null i not detecting processes such as metapopulation dynamics when they are actually occurring or ii model selection choosing a unified model over a null when those processes are not occurring care must be taken when ranking empirical data since it may not necessarily reflect the true mechanisms or the mechanisms may not be the main driving force in determining species richness in all circumstances the same observable patterns in nature can be generated by multiple processes cale et al 1989 testing mechanistic models versus a null model is a common and recommended method for trying to tease apart process from pattern in ecological studies gotelli and graves 1996 we agree that null models are a useful tool however we caution against their use to infer mechanisms because there is potential to conclude they are occurring when they are not and to miss them when they are in some cases this involves situations where the underlying mechanism would be occurring but either the landscape or biotic conditions do not allow the mechanism i e extinction may not occur in a particular landscape despite the potential for extinction similarly observable patterns can be caused by different mechanisms and model selection may not even include a model with the mechanism that is actually occurring gotelli and graves 1996 peters 1991 in contrast failing to reject a null model does not guarantee that there is only random placement of species and mechanisms are not occurring for some species in the community sometimes mechanisms are occurring but cannot be detected over the general noise of a null pattern gotelli and graves 1996 hastings 1987 may 1974 the neutral model did not exceed the descriptive ability of competing models despite not varying greatly from the null while the neutral model has been proposed as a null model in which to compare individual versus species differences or test for niches or mechanisms that may account for species distribution patterns rosindell et al 2011 rosindell et al 2012 the neutral model is not a traditional null model containing no assumed mechanisms gotelli and ellison 2002 gotelli and graves 1996 gotelli and mcgill 2006 the results of this simulation although there was a narrow set of conditions where the neutral model was ranked best suggest against using the neutral model as a baseline null model at least in the context of community structure over ecological timescales while the basic neutral model used in this simulation is able to be extended temporally with other variables such as ecological drift and different types of speciation hubbell 2001 rosindell and philmore 2011 rosindell et al 2011 the main mechanism of neutrality in a variety of simulated systems cannot always be differentiated from the null model of random placement therefore empirical studies trying to distinguish among these models are limited when trying to determine if neutral mechanisms are occurring in a community 4 1 appropriate systems to test for metapopulation dynamics there was a set of conditions where an investigator could be more confident that they are detecting metapopulation dynamics in comparison to a null model table 9 these guidelines are based on when there was the largest discrepancy in model ranking averaged across replications and include island mainland systems with moderate variation in island distance to mainland mainland species densities and island area 0 50 1 00 the number of islands and species was less influential on model performance but having a system with low to moderate numbers of islands and species had better metapopulation performance therefore real world systems fitting these restrictions would be optimal for empirically distinguishing the metapopulation model from the null model having good model fit in a system without the correct ranges of system structure values could result in the incorrectly assuming the underlying mechanism especially when the variability in island distance to mainland is low 4 2 conclusions when investigating whether certain mechanisms are influencing species richness it is advisable to first check the structure of the system and taxa whenever possible it is recommended that preliminary surveys to estimate variables like species mainland density are employed alternatively previously reported system components can aid in determining whether or not a system can be used to differentiate between a mechanistic model and a null setting guidelines where mechanistic models can be evaluated helps eliminate studies that have a low potential to distinguish underlying mechanisms based on the results of this simulation even when these guidelines have been set and there is a higher possibility that the correct model is describing the mechanisms an investigator cannot be completely sure of the mechanisms structuring the community using these unified models unified models attempt to simplify the complex study of species distribution patterns in order to identify important mechanisms influencing community structure this simulation demonstrated that under certain conditions there is a potential to distinguish mechanisms of these unified models however there is also a range of conditions where models have equivalent descriptive abilities and where the model that best described the data was not consistent

25308,ecological models attempting to unite the concepts of biodiversity and biogeography have been used to describe and predict the distribution and abundance of species two mechanistic hypotheses the neutral model and the community level metapopulation model have the potential for direct comparison however there is potential for incorrectly inferring the underlying mechanisms of observed data if the hypotheses have similar descriptive ability in this paper we simulated a range of abiotic island mainland system and biotic community structure variables following the mechanisms underlying these two hypotheses in order to compare model descriptive ability relative to each other and to a null model we found that the null and metapopulation models could accurately describe data created under their respective assumptions for many of the simulated system structures the neutral model generally failed to describe data created under neutral conditions relative to the null model modelling also revealed limitations of these mechanistic models identifying conditions where metapopulation dynamics would be inferred but were not occurring and failing to detect metapopulation dynamics where it was actually occurring to help alleviate this problem we also identified sets of conditions where metapopulation dynamics if it is actually occurring could be distinguished from null or neutral models such systems have moderate variability in distance to mainland density of mainland species and island area as well as low to moderate numbers of islands and species 10 50 simulations demonstrated the potential to distinguish unified models under certain conditions but there are also conditions where models are equivalent and where the model that best described the data was not consistent with the underlying mechanism these shortcomings may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding mechanisms presumed to be producing observed patterns in species abundance and distribution keywords biodiversity metapopulation neutral theory null model species richness unified theory 1 introduction understanding and predicting the distribution and abundance of species lies at the heart of ecology andrewartha and birch 1954 thus it is not surprising that ecologists have developed a variety of hypotheses to explain patterns in species richness and abundance several of these hypotheses are referred to as unified hypotheses in their attempt to unify the fields of biodiversity and biogeography mcgill 2010 identified six unified hypotheses hubbell 2001 unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography the metapopulation derived hypothesis developed by hanski and gyllenberg 1997 gauch and whittaker s continuum hypothesis 1972 storch et al 2008 fractal hypothesis the cluster poisson hypothesis morlon et al 2008 plotkin and muller landau 2002 stoyan and stoyan 1994 and the maximum entropy hypothesis harte 2008 mcgill 2006 subsequent to mcgill 2010 review there have been additional attempts at unifying the concepts of biodiversity and biogeography and extensions of these hypotheses e g borregaard et al 2016 connolly et al 2017 may et al 2013 may et al 2016 rosinell and harmon 2013 whittaker et al 2008 these competing hypotheses all describe patterns of biodiversity and hold promise for predicting the distribution and abundance of species and potentially for understanding the biological mechanisms thought to produce these patterns cabral et al 2017 jones et al 2011 leidinger and cabral 2017 a limitation of current unified hypotheses is that there have been few quantitative comparisons among them jones et al 2011 evaluation often has been limited to qualitative analysis of a single hypothesis e g mcgill et al 2006 and less commonly between or among hypotheses e g mcgill 2010 where quantitative comparisons exist the studies generally have tested a single hypothesis within a taxon versus a null model in contrast to testing competing hypotheses e g matter et al 2002 mcgill 2006 quantitative comparison among all unified hypotheses is difficult due to the inherit dissimilarities among them including the spatial and temporal scale of investigation mechanisms influencing distribution and abundance assumed and underlying theories used to develop the hypotheses however comparisons can be made among unified hypotheses derived from similar theory two of the unified hypotheses can be used to investigate the same community scale structure and were similarly derived both the unified neutral and metapopulation hypotheses incorporate similar mechanisms and are derived from the theory of island biogeography macarthur and wilson 1967 to produce patterns of species incidence and abundance assuming these mechanisms small and or isolated areas of habitat would have lower colonization and higher extinction rates compared to larger less isolated areas producing a positive relationship between species richness and area and a decreasing relationship between species richness and isolation hanski and gyllenberg 1997 matter et al 2002 these two hypotheses have the potential to be useful for ecological studies because of the limited set of mechanisms but their performances have not been directly compared the general background of the two unified hypotheses used in this paper neutral and metapopulation are briefly described here but are described in detail elsewhere including their derivations hanski and gyllenberg 1997 hubbell 2001 matter et al 2002 may et al 2013 may et al 2016 mcgill 2010 rosindell et al 2011 rosinell and harmon 2013 the two unified models can only be compared within an island mainland system for a variety of reasons detailed in the model descriptions island mainland systems historically have served as important models to study ecological theories and continue to be important for elucidating mechanisms driving biodiversity warren et al 2015 1 1 neutral model the neutral hypothesis is considered neutral because all individuals in the community are assumed to have identical migration birth and death rates the interactions among species at the level of individual organisms is also considered equal the hypothesis mechanisms such as colonization extinction and speciation determine species richness and are assumed to be equal for all individuals and in the community hubbell 2001 specifically the neutral hypothesis describes both local and regional metacommunity patterns of relative abundance and can include the mechanisms of random migration speciation as well as ecological drift while the neutral hypothesis has application over evolutionary time it also can be applied to biodiversity patterns in island mainland systems over ecological time which is the focus of this study the neutral hypothesis also follows a zero sum dynamics assumption there is a constant number of individuals in a system with equal birth and death rates hubbell 1979 hubbell 2001 under these assumptions the distribution and abundance of species can be predicted from the relative abundance of each species in the community the neutral hypothesis has been used to predict the distribution and abundance of different taxa such as tropical trees marine invertebrates temperate herbaceous plants birds fish and insects fuller et al 2004 he 2005 hubbell 2001 mcgill 2003 mcgill 2006 mcgill et al 2007

2011 previous studies generally only evaluated this hypothesis for a single island and for fragmented habitat patches fuller et al 2004 he 2005 hubbell 2001 mcgill 2003 mcgill 2006 mcgill et al 2007 pandolfi 1996 rosindell and harmon 2013 terborgh et al 1996 a unified hypothesis should not be taxon specific but rather have the ability to universally applied to any ecological communities few studies have tested the neutral hypothesis in an island mainland system and tests generally have only considered a single taxon leidinger and cabral et al 2017 rosindell and phillimore 2011 mcgill 2006 reviewed multiple sets of empirical tests and found that all failed to support the neutral model despite that the development of the neutral model was done with single island data hubbell 2001 none of these empirical tests were done in an island mainland setting using multiple islands the distribution patterns of such a system may vary from patterns seen for a single sample or habitat patch one example is a study done by leigh et al 1993 on islands of gatun reservoir in central panama which was the same system where hubbell 2001 collected the data that the neutral hypothesis was based on the authors indirectly tested neutrality for the same taxa as well mature tropical tree species and found that some species were lost more rapidly than expected by random extinction on the six smallest islands hubbell 2001 found neutrality for data collected on one of the largest islands of gatun reservoir barro colorado island therefore evaluating the assumption of neutrality for all islands in a multiple island mainland setting may yield different results than if it was studied in a single island setting or a subset of island sizes bowers and matter 1997 connor et al 2000 differences in community structure may also occur depending on the sampling scale gaston and matter 2002 found the relationship between the number of individuals of a species and area can change depending on whether sampling was at a habitat specific patch level versus a general sampling area similarly neutrality may also be scale dependent since it operates on the level of the individual since the neutral hypothesis was originally derived using islands as patches it may be more appropriate to test it in island systems 1 2 metapopulation model the second unified hypothesis is the metapopulation hypothesis which scales up predictions made for single species to the community level thus this model can be used to describe species incidence as well as species richness the metapopulation hypothesis was developed assuming island mainland conditions i e there is a mainland that is a source of species that re colonize islands hanski and gyllenberg 1997 therefore comparative tests are only valid under island mainland conditions the metapopulation hypothesis assumes that species richness s for a given island is determined by a balance of local extinction occurring on islands and re colonization from a mainland species pool r 1 l o g s j r 1 s j r a x l o g a j α d j where a is the area and d the distance from the mainland of island j and x and α describe the mean extinction risk and the mean migration ability of species in the community respectively hanski and gyllenberg 1997 matter et al 2002 the parameter a is an amalgam of mean population density the scaling of extinction risk with area and a constant parameter this bottom up approach scaling a population level hypothesis to the community level is potentially beneficial because extinction and recolonization are viewed from the species level species richness is then determined by summing incidence for individual species on an island as opposed to the neutral hypothesis species in the metapopulation model are not treated equally but instead have individual estimates using the following the incidence p function for species i on island j 2 p i j e k i j e k i j 1 where k i j is the logit transformed species specific incidence 3 k i j l o g p i j 1 p i j l o g c 1 x i l o g w i x i l o g a j α i d j where α i describes the migration ability of species i in the community and w i is the constant density of species i hanski and gyllenberg 1997 matter et al 2002 c is a constant parameter 1 3 null model an important consideration when testing mechanistic models is its performance relative to a null hypothesis a model that does not include the postulated mechanisms gotelli and graves 1996 by comparing the unified hypotheses to a null we can test if the mechanistic processes are important as well as if one unified hypothesis explains significantly more variance in the data than the other in the current case the null hypothesis is random placement of individuals into habitat patches which can be described by williams 1995 extreme value function this null hypothesis does not contain mechanisms found in the neutral and metapopulation hypotheses and also has the benefit of being able to accommodate sites with no species since unified hypotheses have the potential to be important tools for investigating biodiversity from a mechanistic biogeographic perspective their limitations and use should be clearly defined for empirical comparison rosindell et al 2012 one problem when applying mechanistic models to describe biological patterns is the tendency to assume that the presumed mechanisms produced the observed patterns observable patterns have the potential to be caused by alternative mechanisms thus the ability of a mechanistic model to describe data does not necessitate that the mechanism actually caused the pattern jeltsch et al 1999 kendall et al 1999 levin 1992 null models help in these situations gotelli and graves 1996 but different mechanistic models and null models can be similar in their descriptive and predictive abilities hence the ability to distinguish among them and identify when particular mechanisms are occurring may be limited in such cases an investigator looking to empirically compare mechanistic hypotheses may not find a difference between models due to their inherent similarities and not because the hypotheses have an equivalent ability to discriminate among mechanisms pontarp et al 2017 the purpose of this study was to determine the conditions that a real world system would require in order to detect a difference between the performance of the metapopulation and the unified neutral biodiversity hypotheses we simulated a range of conditions based on the underlying theory and assumptions made by both unified hypotheses i e species area relationships as well as different possible island mainland and taxon structures where neutral and metapopulation models could be directly compared our aim was to further define the potential application of these models under ecological timescales and allow for meaningful comparison under appropriate real world conditions 2 materials and methods we ran a series of simulations to compare the abilities of the neutral and metapopulation hypotheses as well as a null model to describe species richness on islands under different conditions we created three different sets of occupancy and abundance values where we knew the mechanisms responsible for the observed species distribution i e we generated them following either null neutral or metapopulation rules fig 1 each of these datasets used the same abiotic and biotic conditions we then fit statistical models based on the null neutral and metapopulation hypotheses to each of the datasets and compared their ability to describe the data 2 1 simulation structure for the abiotic island mainland system we established a range of values to represent the number of islands and variation in island area and distance to mainland table 1 island area and distance to mainland were simulated following a log normal distribution with a mean 1 and a varying range of standard deviations log scaled the resulting values were multiplied by 10 to arrive at a realistic final area simulated mainland area was calculated as the sum of all island areas multiplied by 100 we chose a log normal distribution for our simulation since it is common to a variety of island systems for example the aleutian archipelago japanese archipelago hawaiian islands and svalbard archipelago kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 wolfram mathematica v 10 for taxon structure we set species richness of the system using a range of values from 10 to 500 species for each species on the mainland we generated densities in a similar manner to island size and distance to mainland by following a log normal distribution with mean 1 and range of standard deviations of log scaled variates table 1 we calculated mainland abundance by multiplying the species specific density values by area of the mainland we used a factorial design to create a total of 3125 different system and taxon structures each of these combinations of parameters were replicated 100 times as previously stated the 3125 systems were generated following log normal distributions for area distance to mainland and species mainland densities to explore the robustness of our results to this assumption we also generated systems following uniform distributions island size distance to mainland and species mainland density were generated with a minimum 0 and a maximum value equal to the maximum values of the log normal generated values averaged across replicates table 2 we wanted both sets of data to have the same range of values with the only difference between sets being the distribution pattern which can produce vastly different systems fig 2 in order to generate occupancy and abundance data that conform to each hypothesis we incorporated their basic assumptions the structure for island occupancy and abundance for the null and starting structure for the metapopulation hypotheses were based on the species specific densities on the mainland we generated these datasets by multiplying mainland densities by island area and rounding down to the nearest whole individual for the neutral hypothesis structure was based on the proportion of total individuals comprising each species on the mainland the total numbers of individuals on islands were derived from the null dataset by summing all individuals of all species the neutral dataset was then generated by multiplying the proportion of individuals of species i on the mainland out of the total number of all individuals of all species by the total number of individuals on an island rounding down to the nearest individual the resulting null and neutral datasets were similar but not always identical since datasets had a similar number of individuals but varying abundances among species since species identity was based on density versus proportion these datasets tended to be most similar when there were few individuals on islands to incorporate metapopulation dynamics into metapopulation datasets we conducted one round of extinction and recolonization on data generated by mainland density see above extinction and recolonization were based on island area and isolation respectively as well as species specific colonization and extinction rates to incorporate extinction we followed hanski 1992 metapopulation extinction probability e where islands with larger area have a lower extinction probability than smaller islands 4 e j i μ j a j x i μ j is an extinction constant and x i is a parameter incorporating how extinction risk scales with area for species i hanski 1994 1998 hanski and gyllenberg 1997 matter et al 2002 we created an extinction probability for island j by randomly generating μ j and x i following a normal distribution μ j and x i 0 2 sd 0 5 then for each island we determined a base island extinction value following a uniform distribution min 0 and max 1 if this uniform island extinction value was smaller than the extinction probability then a local extinction occurred on that island for that species the process was repeated for each species on an island and across all islands to incorporate re colonization we determined colonization probability c i j for each species i on each island j 5 c i j c i w i d i j 6 w h e r e d i j e α i d j j e α i d j where c i is a constant we generated using a normal distribution c i 1 sd 0 05 and d i j represents a connectivity value where α i was generated using a normal distribution α i 2 sd 0 5 taken from previous metapopulation estimates hanski 1998 matter et al 2002 where extinction was absent and colonization rate was greater than zero we assumed an island to be occupied by a species we only applied one round of extinctions and recolonizations once to represent a static island mainland community following metapopulation dynamics we did this to follow ecological timescales rather than evolutionary timescales which would mimic the snapshot data collected by ecological field studies that often can only gather species richness and abundance data over a short period of time 2 2 analyses we took the datasets generated under null neutral and metapopulation assumptions and fit each dataset to the following null neutral and metapopulation generalized linear models glm to compare the ability of each to describe the data 2 2 1 null model glm 7 s j 1 s j a j 8 w h e r e s j n u m b e r o f s p e c i e s o n i s l a n d j m a i n l a n d s p e c i e s r i c h n e s s 9 a n d s j 1 s j is the expected fraction of species present on island j out of total species pool we used a conjugate log log link function to fit the null model which is referred to as the extreme value function williams 1995 2 2 2 neutral model glm 10 s j 1 s j 1 θ log 1 w i n d i v i d u a l s a r e a j 1 θ where θ is double the number of individuals of all species on the mainland hubbell 2001 2 2 3 metapopulation model glm 11 s j 1 s j a j d j we used a logit link function to fit the metapopulation and neutral models and compared all three models using qaicc values for overdispersed data corrected for small sample sizes since some combinations of parameters had only 10 islands and 10 species burnham and anderson 2002 2 3 simulation evaluation for each of the three datasets we determined the best model using the lowest qaicc value when models had qaicc scores within two value points we assigned the same ranking to avoid overestimating a model s descriptive power we then determined the number of times the model was ranked best out of the 100 replicates with ties receiving half value to summarize the results this proportion was used as the dependent variable in a multinomial log linear regression mlr analysis in order to determine how biotic and abiotic conditions affected the explanatory ability of the models the mlr allowed the comparison of independent variables across the three models and indicated what variables are important for seeing a difference in the models descriptive abilities the independent variables we considered were the five abiotic and biotic variables used to construct the simulated datasets island area distance to mainland species mainland density number of islands and number of species we considered all interactions between variables in our analysis the mlr was run using the multinom function within the nnet package available for program r venables and ripley 2002 we determined the best regression models based on aic for each dataset and full interactions between all five variables using the step function in the stats package r core team 2012 the mlr test compares models using one as the baseline for evaluation the baseline for each mlr test was the model matching the generated dataset e g null model as baseline when the dataset was generated under null conditions 3 results 3 1 null generated data the null model generally was ranked as the best model 46 80 model with lowest qaicc over the neutral 15 75 and metapopulation 41 69 models for null generated data some runs resulted in models tied for the best model and not all replications had successful convergence due to insufficient variation however overall the null model had the highest descriptive ability under null conditions generally the null had better descriptive ability when data was sparser such as when there were few species and islands table 3 distance to mainland had no influence on how the data was structured and the null model descriptive ability reflected this the mlr results supported these findings particularly how null descriptive ability was dependent upon the interactions of variables table 4 such as area density and number of species which reflected the variables used in generating the underlying structure of the null data although the null model correctly described the data for the majority of combinations of conditions the metapopulation model was also ranked as the best model over 41 of the time despite the fact the statistical metapopulation model contains an extra parameter for distance from the mainland the metapopulation model generally exceeded the null when all islands had full species richness values this scenario leads to the potential error of assuming metapopulation dynamics are occurring when no such dynamics are influencing the community structure 3 2 neutral generated data the neutral model generally had poor descriptive ability for all datasets including the neutrally generated dataset the neutral model was ranked best only 14 20 out of all neutrally simulated data sets in contrast the null model and metapopulation models ranked best describing neutral data 44 00 and 42 10 respectively the neutral model had a limited range of system conditions where it excelled at describing its own data table 5 descriptive ability depended heavily on island area and variability in mainland density as expected due to how the data was generated fig 3 table 6 the majority of all replications for the neutrally derived dataset were better described by the null and metapopulation models this lack of model descriptive ability was most apparent when the system had few islands 10 50 and few species 10 50 indicating sparse presence absences of species usually in a dataset with few data points i e islands interestingly for the mlr results number of species alone was not a significant predictor but it was included in three significant interaction terms comparing the neutral to the null table 6 the three way interaction between density islands species was significantly different between the null and neutral models 3 3 metapopulation generated data the metapopulation model generally was ranked as the best model over the null and neutral models for metapopulation generated data but its descriptive ability was imperfect the metapopulation model was the best model 58 60 out of all combinations of variables and replications compared to the null 27 37 and neutral 14 01 models those conditions where the metapopulation model could explain 75 of all replications included a limited range of sd values for distance to mainland and island area table 7 the mlr results further differentiated where the null and neutral models descriptive ability were different from the metapopulation model table 8 area and density were significantly different from the metapopulation model for both the null and neutral models and the only significant interaction term for both comparisons was the density distance interaction system conditions where the metapopulation model had poor descriptive ability included the extremes in variation for distance to mainland 0 01 and 2 50 5 00 there was an interaction between mainland species densities and distance where systems with high variation in densities and low variation in distance to mainland had the poorest descriptive ability for the metapopulation model fig 4 most of the systems with low variability in island distance resulted in all islands having full species richness values due to recolonization when there is high variability in species densities almost all islands had some species missing the null model was ranked best for most of these systems incorrectly indicating that metapopulation processes were not influencing species richness 3 4 effects of uniform distributions our results are somewhat sensitive to the underlying distributions of island area and isolation and species density when we replaced the log normal with uniform distributions it resulted in a large increase in the neutral model s descriptive ability when describing neutrally generated data the neutral model went from 14 20 best rankings for log normal data to 32 07 for uniform data conditions where the neutral model had highest descriptive ability under uniform conditions include low variation in mainland species density sd 0 01 when variation in island area was moderate sd 1 00 for systems with many species 200 500 despite the increase in neutral model descriptive ability however the null model still had better 61 67 and the metapopulation had comparable 25 44 descriptive ability for neutrally generated data than the neutral model the null and metapopulations models were also sensitive to the change in underlying distribution when using uniformly distributed data the null model s descriptive ability for the null generated data increased with the null being ranked best 46 80 for log normal data to 63 74 in contrast the metapopulation model had slightly poorer descriptive ability when data was generated under uniform 49 51 compared to log normal 58 60 distributions 4 discussion inferring process from pattern continues to be fraught with difficulty while unified mechanistic models are a positive step they are by no means perfect in this paper we have demonstrated two possible errors when comparing unified models to a null i not detecting processes such as metapopulation dynamics when they are actually occurring or ii model selection choosing a unified model over a null when those processes are not occurring care must be taken when ranking empirical data since it may not necessarily reflect the true mechanisms or the mechanisms may not be the main driving force in determining species richness in all circumstances the same observable patterns in nature can be generated by multiple processes cale et al 1989 testing mechanistic models versus a null model is a common and recommended method for trying to tease apart process from pattern in ecological studies gotelli and graves 1996 we agree that null models are a useful tool however we caution against their use to infer mechanisms because there is potential to conclude they are occurring when they are not and to miss them when they are in some cases this involves situations where the underlying mechanism would be occurring but either the landscape or biotic conditions do not allow the mechanism i e extinction may not occur in a particular landscape despite the potential for extinction similarly observable patterns can be caused by different mechanisms and model selection may not even include a model with the mechanism that is actually occurring gotelli and graves 1996 peters 1991 in contrast failing to reject a null model does not guarantee that there is only random placement of species and mechanisms are not occurring for some species in the community sometimes mechanisms are occurring but cannot be detected over the general noise of a null pattern gotelli and graves 1996 hastings 1987 may 1974 the neutral model did not exceed the descriptive ability of competing models despite not varying greatly from the null while the neutral model has been proposed as a null model in which to compare individual versus species differences or test for niches or mechanisms that may account for species distribution patterns rosindell et al 2011 rosindell et al 2012 the neutral model is not a traditional null model containing no assumed mechanisms gotelli and ellison 2002 gotelli and graves 1996 gotelli and mcgill 2006 the results of this simulation although there was a narrow set of conditions where the neutral model was ranked best suggest against using the neutral model as a baseline null model at least in the context of community structure over ecological timescales while the basic neutral model used in this simulation is able to be extended temporally with other variables such as ecological drift and different types of speciation hubbell 2001 rosindell and philmore 2011 rosindell et al 2011 the main mechanism of neutrality in a variety of simulated systems cannot always be differentiated from the null model of random placement therefore empirical studies trying to distinguish among these models are limited when trying to determine if neutral mechanisms are occurring in a community 4 1 appropriate systems to test for metapopulation dynamics there was a set of conditions where an investigator could be more confident that they are detecting metapopulation dynamics in comparison to a null model table 9 these guidelines are based on when there was the largest discrepancy in model ranking averaged across replications and include island mainland systems with moderate variation in island distance to mainland mainland species densities and island area 0 50 1 00 the number of islands and species was less influential on model performance but having a system with low to moderate numbers of islands and species had better metapopulation performance therefore real world systems fitting these restrictions would be optimal for empirically distinguishing the metapopulation model from the null model having good model fit in a system without the correct ranges of system structure values could result in the incorrectly assuming the underlying mechanism especially when the variability in island distance to mainland is low 4 2 conclusions when investigating whether certain mechanisms are influencing species richness it is advisable to first check the structure of the system and taxa whenever possible it is recommended that preliminary surveys to estimate variables like species mainland density are employed alternatively previously reported system components can aid in determining whether or not a system can be used to differentiate between a mechanistic model and a null setting guidelines where mechanistic models can be evaluated helps eliminate studies that have a low potential to distinguish underlying mechanisms based on the results of this simulation even when these guidelines have been set and there is a higher possibility that the correct model is describing the mechanisms an investigator cannot be completely sure of the mechanisms structuring the community using these unified models unified models attempt to simplify the complex study of species distribution patterns in order to identify important mechanisms influencing community structure this simulation demonstrated that under certain conditions there is a potential to distinguish mechanisms of these unified models however there is also a range of conditions where models have equivalent descriptive abilities and where the model that best described the data was not consistent with the underlying mechanism these shortcomings merit caution when applying unified models to identify mechanisms presumed to be acting in nature declaration of interests the authors have no

25309,linear infrastructures one of several forms of land use are a major driver of biodiversity loss roads impact populations at many levels with direct road mortality and barrier effect contributing to decreased population abundance higher isolation and subdivision and therefore to increased extinction risk in this paper we compared the effect of road mortality and of the barrier effect on population isolation persistence and size and assessed the interaction of these effects with dispersal we used a spatially explicit process based model of population dynamics in landscapes fragmented by varying levels of road density we modelled a barrier effect independently from road mortality by varying the probability with which individuals avoid crossing roads both road mortality and the barrier effect caused population isolation while road mortality alone had stronger negative effects than the barrier effect without extra mortality the latter also resulted in decreased population size yet road avoidance could in some cases rescue populations from extinction populations with a large dispersal distance were more negatively affected as road mortality increased however when there was no road mortality they maintained larger sizes than populations with a short dispersal distance our results highlight the much higher relative importance of road mortality than the barrier effect for population size and persistence and the importance of assessing relevant species traits for effective long term transportation planning and conservation management our model can be used in species specific situations and with real landscape configurations in applications such as conservation planning keywords extinction abundance barrier effect mortality roads individual based model 1 introduction the current biodiversity crisis is mainly driven by land use change pereira et al 2012 maxwell et al 2016 roads one of many forms of land use cause major impacts on populations as the road network is predicted to strongly increase in the coming years van der ree et al 2015 it is crucial to assess its impact on populations in order to apply suitable mitigation measures and improve conservation and road planning roads cause habitat loss and fragmentation and decrease habitat quality roads also cause direct mortality through wildlife collisions with vehicles and act as a barrier to movement van der ree et al 2015 these direct and indirect impacts of roads can contribute to population isolation and subdivision to decreases in population abundance and therefore can increase population extinction risk van der ree et al 2015 ascensão et al 2016 although there are also positive effects for some species e g see rytwinski and fahrig 2012 2013 species traits can also influence population level responses to land use change pereira and daily 2006 and should be considered when assessing the effects of roads specifically dispersal has been identified as an important factor but its influence on population persistence is still not fully understood for example while the role of dispersal is beneficial in metapopulation models e g hanski 1998 because more patches can be colonized if dispersal is large in source sink models or reaction diffusion models e g skellam 1951 pulliam 1988 dispersal affects populations negatively because it can lead to colonization of habitats where population growth rates are negative sink habitats pereira and borda de água 2013 moreover dispersal can be associated with increased mortality risk e g nathan et al 2012 with some studies suggesting there is an optimal intermediate dispersal rate for persistence in disturbed habitats casagrandi and gatto 1999 the detrimental effect of dispersal in disturbed habitats is supported by several empirical studies e g fragmented forests gibbs 1998 van houtan et al 2007 in the specific case of roads a higher mobility has been related to negative effects of roads in mammal and bird species rytwinski and fahrig 2012 furthermore using a theoretical approach borda de água et al 2011 predicted that the larger the mean dispersal distance in a population the larger would be the minimum area necessary for this population to persist in a landscape fragmented by roads in this paper we focus on dispersal movement as the process whereby individuals leave their initial location move across a more or less suitable environment and settle in a new location clobert et al 2012 matthysen 2012 our model does not currently include other types of movement such as daily movements direct road mortality introduces an additional source of mortality besides natural mortality in addition roads can also act as a barrier that does not introduce additional mortality when the animals do not cross the roads this barrier effect can be due to physical structures such as fences or to road avoidance behavior e g jaeger and fahrig 2004 grilo et al 2012 and for simplicity in this paper we refer to it simply as barrier effect although this can rescue individuals from road mortality to some extent the negative consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation may be higher when such barrier effect is present since road avoidance can lead to population isolation and to higher exposure to demographic and environmental stochasticity rytwinski and fahrig 2012 ascensão et al 2016 moreover the effects of road mortality and of road avoidance can be confounded and are still to be properly disentangled for example reduced population abundance near roads may be due to direct road mortality or due to road avoidance behavior e g fahrig et al 1995 although there is evidence that the effects of roads on population abundance are in general negative rytwinski and fahrig 2015 the impact of roads on population persistence has not been so commonly addressed but see for example borda de água et al 2014 and ceia hasse et al 2017 the key issue addressed in this paper was to disentangle the influence of an additional source of mortality direct road mortality versus the influence of a barrier effect to movement that does not introduce such additional mortality on population isolation persistence and size as well as the influence of dispersal in fragmented landscapes we addressed this using roads we use a spatially explicit process based model of population dynamics our questions were 1 what is the importance of road mortality versus isolation for population persistence and size in landscapes fragmented by roads 2 how does dispersal influence the size and the persistence of populations under varying levels of road mortality and of a barrier effect 2 materials and methods we used an individual based toy model of population dynamics to perform a theoretical study on the effects of road mortality barrier effect and dispersal on population isolation size and persistence of a virtual species our study is not based on any empirical data and thus is more appropriately considered under the virtual ecology rationale e g grimm 1999 zurell et al 2010 2 1 model description the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing agent based models grimm et al 2006 2010 the model was implemented as an ansi c program which can be downloaded from https github com anaceiahasse landsim 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to simulate population dynamics in fragmented landscapes specifically in this study the model simulated population dynamics in landscapes fragmented by roads with special emphasis on the effects of road mortality of a barrier effect without mortality and on the influence of dispersal distance 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the entities of the model are the landscape and the individuals i e the model keeps track of the features of the landscape and of the female population the model only considers female individuals for simplicity the landscape is a two dimensional grid of n x n square cells with reflecting boundaries an alternative approach to deal with edge effects would have been to consider periodic boundary conditions i e torus geometry instead of reflecting boundaries however given a dispersal step size of only one cell and the large size of the grid both approaches can lead to similar outcomes each cell of the landscape is assigned to one of n possible types with values varying between 0 and 1 in the present case each cell belongs to one of two possible types high quality habitat non road or road with values of 1 and 0 respectively we generated several landscapes with different proportions of road cells where roads were placed perpendicularly to one another fig 1 table 1 we used simple hypothetical regular road networks because our main objective was to disentangle the effects of sink mortality versus those of a barrier effect that does not introduce additional mortality sink mortality here corresponds to road mortality and it is the probability that an individual dies when crossing a road see section 2 1 7 3 below our goal was to derive general principles that can be the basis to understanding and model more specific or complex cases individuals are characterized by the following state variables age developmental stage juvenile or adult position in the landscape and by the following attributes fecundity age at first breeding natural survival probability home range size dispersal distance road mortality probability road avoidance probability table 1 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling each simulation time step consists of the following sequential events fig 2 table 1 reproduction natural mortality dispersal of juveniles juvenile density dependent mortality section 2 1 7 describes the submodels implementing these processes juveniles that establish a home range are inserted into the adult population at the end of each simulation time step thereby updating population size and landscape cell availability for the following time step at the beginning of each simulation time step the age of each individual is updated increased by 1 and the sequential steps listed above ensue 2 1 4 design concepts 2 1 4 1 basic principles roads can contribute to population isolation decreased size and increased extinction risk through direct mortality and barrier effects e g van der ree et al 2015 ascensão et al 2016 dispersal can also influence how roads impact populations e g borda de água et al 2011 rytwinski and fahrig 2012 the model allows assessing the relative importance of these factors for population isolation persistence and size which is not yet fully understood 2 1 4 2 emergence population dynamics emerges from the model i e from the set of rules defined parameter values used and landscape configuration 2 1 4 3 adaptation juveniles choose the direction in which they disperse according to cell type road versus high quality habitat cell and occupancy they may avoid dispersing into road cells with a given probability and they do not disperse to occupied cells respectively 2 1 4 4 sensing during dispersal juveniles evaluate cell type road versus non road cell and occupancy 2 1 4 5 interaction juveniles do not disperse through cells that are already occupied 2 1 4 6 stochasticity stochasticity was incorporated in several processes reproduction natural mortality dispersal of juveniles see section 2 1 7 for details 2 1 4 7 observation for each model run we recorded population size at the end of each simulation and averaged population size across replicates we calculated the probability of extinction as the proportion of replicates in which populations went extinct before the end of the simulation 2 1 5 initialization the model starts by settling an initial population of females at breeding age in the landscape after the initial population is created each simulation time step consists of the events described in section 2 1 7 submodels in all simulations the initial population size was 10 individuals set at random in the landscape see table 1 for the remaining parameter values used in the simulations and fig 3 for a representation of the settlement of the initial population in the landscape and of the colonization of the landscape 2 1 6 input data the model does not import data of driving environmental variables 2 1 7 submodels 2 1 7 1 reproduction females reproduce after one year and once they have established their home range the number of female juveniles that a breeding female produces follows a poisson distribution with mean equal to its fecundity bi 2 1 7 2 natural mortality adults and juveniles die with probability 1 s when an individual dies it is removed from the population and its home range cell is made available for dispersing individuals 2 1 7 3 dispersal of juveniles in our model adults do not move and do not get killed by direct road mortality only juveniles disperse each juvenile disperses a fixed number of cells from its mother cell a dispersal step is always to one of the four neighboring cells von neumann neighborhood and is composed of the following events fig 2b 1 the individual evaluates whether its four neighboring cells are occupied or free and does not disperse to occupied cells 2 the individual evaluates whether the free neighboring cells correspond to roads or not and can avoid dispersing through road cells with probability pra 3 if the individual disperses through a road cell sink dispersal mortality road mortality is applied with probability mrm the dispersal process is not stopped when the individual finds a first suitable empty cell instead it continues until the individual either dies due to road mortality or disperses over his dispersal distance d an individual is allowed to move back to a cell it has previously visited therefore two neighboring unoccupied cells are sufficient for an individual to survive over any number of dispersal steps moreover each juvenile disperses from its mother cell but given natural mortality that cell may be freed and in that case it can be occupied by a juvenile the default probability of dispersing to any neighboring cell is 1 however if all four neighboring cells are occupied and since individuals do not disperse to occupied cells then the individual cannot move and dispersal is unsuccessful if the cell in which the individual is at the end of dispersal is a road dispersal is also unsuccessful if dispersal is successful the individual can settle a home range in this study we set the home range size to one cell and only one individual can establish its home range in each cell 2 1 7 4 juvenile density dependent mortality following unsuccessful dispersal juveniles that did not establish their home range are removed from the population 2 2 simulations we created five landscapes of 200 200 cells with perpendicular roads each with a different proportion of road cells fig 1 table 1 we used two dispersal distances short 5 cells and large 50 cells the latter of which we deemed reasonable considering the total size of the grid 40 000 cells we modelled a barrier effect independently from sink mortality by varying the probability with which individuals do not cross roads while dispersing we performed two sets of simulations in the first set of simulations we assessed the effect of different extreme scenarios of road mortality and of road avoidance in landscapes with different proportions of road cells i road mortality probability was one and there was no road avoidance ii road avoidance probability was one and there was no road mortality iii road mortality and road avoidance probabilities were both zero for each dispersal distance and each road density to assess the combined effects of road mortality and of road avoidance in the second set of simulations we varied road mortality and road avoidance probabilities both at the same time independently from 0 to 1 in steps of 0 1 i e using all combinations possible for each dispersal distance table 1 in all simulations we used fixed values of the remaining parameters table 1 simulating the dynamics of hypothetical animal populations in hypothetical landscapes because our main objective was to obtain general predictions on the differential effects of road mortality versus a barrier effect that did not introduce additional mortality due to road avoidance behavior or physical structures such as fences under different levels of dispersal we ran each simulation for 1000 time steps to ensure that population size did not vary by more than 10 between consecutive simulation time steps for at least the last 10 simulation time steps and ran 100 replicates for each combination of values of parameters table 1 our computer program was extensively debugged thus we are confident that the program is reproducing accurately the intended model being an individual based model computer simulation we performed our simulations under a set of assumptions that we deemed reasonable and we tested them for a wide range of parameter values obtaining the expected results our model takes as input the model parameters and a two dimensional matrix with the landscape it produces a file containing the location of the home range of each adult in the landscape at each time step and the population age structure at each time step to apply the model to other species and landscape configurations users can choose the values of the parameters specific to the species or population of interest and a matrix with the desired landscape configuration 3 results in our simulations isolation occurred due to road mortality or to road avoidance fig 3 with complete road mortality and no avoidance fig 3a or with complete avoidance and no road mortality fig 3b the landscape was only partially occupied in contrast when there was no mortality and no avoidance fig 3c the whole landscape was occupied when there was no road mortality and no road avoidance the probability of extinction was higher and the population size was smaller at higher road densities suggesting an effect due to habitat loss fig 4 nevertheless with no road mortality and no road avoidance the probability of extinction was zero or close to zero even with high road density fig 4a and the population size was considerably larger than with either complete road avoidance or complete road mortality fig 4b these results suggest that in such cases there was an effect of road avoidance or of road mortality respectively the probability of extinction was higher and the population size was smaller when there was road mortality alone than when there was road avoidance alone except at the highest road density fig 4 however population size was much smaller at all road densities when there was road avoidance than in the case with no road avoidance and no road mortality fig 4b when assessing the combined effects of road mortality and of road avoidance for different dispersal distances at the highest road density the probability of extinction increased and the population size decreased with increasing road mortality horizontal lines in fig 5 for a constant value of road mortality vertical lines in fig 5 probability of extinction decreased and population size increased with increasing road avoidance however at this road density the good habitat patches delimited by roads were small 16 cells and populations went extinct when road avoidance was complete even without road mortality the role of dispersal varied with road mortality the probability of extinction increased and the population size decreased much faster with increasing road mortality for the large than for the short dispersal distance however when there was no road mortality the probability of extinction was higher fig 5a and the population size was smaller fig 5b for the short dispersal distance similar patterns were observed when assessing these effects at a lower road density proportion of road cells in the landscape 0 07 fig s1 in appendix however they were less obvious than in the case of high road density especially for the short dispersal distance the probability of extinction was low and the population sizes varied less nevertheless population size strongly decreased with complete road avoidance or with complete road mortality for both dispersal distances as in the case of high road density fig 5 note that for the short dispersal distance and also for most of the large dispersal distance simulations in fig s1 while the probability of population extinction is close to zero the population size is low both when road mortality is one and when road avoidance is one this is because many individuals die on roads when road mortality is one or the population can only occupy part of the landscape when road avoidance is one 4 discussion our results allow to make inferences about the differential effects of sink mortality versus those of a barrier effect without additional mortality and the role of dispersal on population persistence isolation and size which were the goals of this study while habitat amount was kept constant when road mortality probability and road avoidance probability were varied with a same road density it should nevertheless be taken into account that by generating landscapes with habitats and roads as grid cells and by using a regular road network pattern landscapes with higher road densities have lower total habitat amount and smaller habitat patches in this sense there were three effects present i e road mortality road avoidance and habitat amount change 4 1 importance of road mortality versus a barrier effect without mortality for population persistence and size road mortality alone had a stronger negative effect on the probability of persistence and on population size than road avoidance alone road avoidance could also in some cases rescue populations under low to moderate road mortality from extinction as suggested by other authors since road avoidance decreases the probability that individuals cross roads therefore reducing mortality caused by collision with vehicles jaeger and fahrig 2004 rytwinski and fahrig 2013 previous studies also suggest that the genetic effects of road mortality are stronger than those of the barrier effect without road mortality e g jackson and fahrig 2011 ascensão et al 2013 in our simulations population isolation occurred both when there was road mortality or when there was a barrier effect without additional mortality populations persisted even when road avoidance was very high provided that the road mortality was low to moderate only complete road avoidance led populations to extinction when road density was the highest in those cases individuals were isolated within the small patches of good habitat that were bounded by roads and the resulting small populations exhibited an increased extinction risk due to demographic stochasticity lande 1993 habitat fragmentation impairs species persistence and ecosystem functions moreover the several effects of fragmentation are interlinked and can operate over long time scales haddad et al 2015 in our analysis population sizes were negatively affected when road avoidance was complete regardless of the road density even if there was no road mortality population sizes were much smaller when compared to the cases with no road avoidance and no road mortality this may influence population persistence in the long term especially if other factors of disturbance come into play for example we did not vary habitat quality all non road cells had maximum habitat quality because our aim was to obtain general predictions on the differential effects of road mortality versus those of a barrier effect without mortality however habitat quality can influence how roads affect populations e g grilo et al 2014 and therefore the habitat quality of the non road cells could be varied in more detailed studies for example by including species specific information on habitat preferences moreover although not included explicitly in our analysis traffic volume is also important to consider when assessing the effects of roads on populations and in landscape connectivity studies since traffic intensity may influence both road mortality and road avoidance and thus population persistence jaeger et al 2006 jaeger 2007 charry and jones 2009 van langevelde and jaarsma 2009 van strien and grêt regamey 2016 several studies suggest that road mortality may be higher at intermediate traffic volumes than high traffic volumes because at higher traffic volumes road avoidance will be higher for many species e g seiler 2005 grilo et al 2015 however the focus of our analysis was on comparing the effects of road mortality vs those of a barrier that does not introduce additional mortality which can be due to road avoidance behavior but also due to physical structures such as fences e g jaeger and fahrig 2004 grilo et al 2012 hence we modeled these directly as the probability of an individual dying on a road while crossing it and the probability of an individual not crossing a road regardless of the cause e g road surface avoidance behavior road avoidance due to traffic fences and therefore we did not consider traffic volume explicitly additionally while in our simulations individuals only evaluated their immediate neighboring cells in each step of dispersal some species avoid roads from a distance e g jaeger et al 2005 which may exacerbate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation including microevolution in our individual based model which is fundamental to capture the response of organisms to changing conditions grimm and berger 2016 would also allow analysing eco evolutionary responses to fragmentation haddad et al 2015 4 2 influence of dispersal distance on population persistence and size the role of dispersal distance varied depending on the values of road mortality in fragmented landscapes as was the case in all our simulations since roads were always present populations with a larger dispersal distance showed a lower probability of extinction and maintained larger sizes provided an additional source of mortality due to roads was not present however a large dispersal distance was detrimental for population size and persistence as road mortality increased we used fixed dispersal distances in our simulations however dispersal distance is usually stochastic e g nathan et al 2012 and therefore it would not only be interesting but also add realism to the model by implementing dispersal kernels to determine dispersal distances e g austerlitz et al 2004 chipperfield et al 2011 instead of using fixed dispersal distances furthermore in our simulations dispersing individuals only evaluated their immediate four neighboring cells in each dispersal step which can be considered as a biased random walk e g turchin 1998 while this has been a common choice to model movement with an orientation component e g börger et al 2008 expanding the perceptive range of dispersing individuals would increase the realism and facilitate the transferability of the model to concrete situations 4 3 limitations the type of movement juvenile dispersal considered in our paper can have a large influence on individual fitness and population structure matthysen 2012 however our model does not currently include other types of movement such as daily movements and thus adults do not get killed due to road mortality this is a simplification because in real contexts animals will encounter roads during other types of movement as well therefore it would be important to include such types of movement in the analysis furthermore in our model each juvenile disperses over a fixed number of cells which implies that individuals may end their dispersal movement on a road or right of way this could correspond to situations where there are no other options for dispersal e g all neighboring areas already occupied or corresponding to unsuitable habitat but it should be considered as a simplification of real cases we used two dispersal distances in our simulations because we wanted to ensure that we were comparing the roles of contrasting dispersal distances i e a short vs a large dispersal distance including a wider range of dispersal distances could help further understand the role of dispersal in these fragmented landscapes as some studies suggest there is an optimal intermediate dispersal rate for persistence in disturbed habitats casagrandi and gatto 1999 we used a virtual species and simple hypothetical regular road networks because our main goal was to disentangle the effects of road mortality versus those of a barrier effect without such mortality however this implies that our results hold for the virtual species in the regular road network used 4 4 conclusions and future research directions our results highlight the much higher relative importance of road mortality than the barrier effect without road mortality and of assessing relevant species traits such as dispersal distance we emphasize three results of our study first that even though population persistence was not impaired when road avoidance was complete except when suitable habitat patches became too small to sustain viable populations population size was considerably decreased which is important to consider in long term conservation management secondly that a large dispersal distance is not necessarily always detrimental for population size and persistence in fragmented landscapes if mortality in unsuitable habitats is low which calls for further investigation and thirdly that population isolation occurred in extreme cases i e complete road mortality or a complete barrier effect without road mortality these may be especially important for species expected rytwinski and fahrig 2013 or observed e g some snakes and turtles shepard et al 2008 to avoid roads and for species for which road avoidance increases with increasing traffic volume e g carnivores and ungulates dyer et al 2002 alexander et al 2005 leblond et al 2013 finally our model can stimulate other studies either theoretical or empirical our results hold for the virtual species in the regular road network used but our model can be applied to species specific situations by using the specific trait values of the species or population of interest information on model parameter values initial population size fecundity age at first breeding survival probability home range size dispersal distance road mortality or road avoidance can be obtained from published databases individual studies or derived from related or ecologically similar species and using allometric relationships e g jones et al 2009 borda de água et al 2014 salguero gómez et al 2016 ceia hasse et al 2017 for example data on population density can be used to determine the initial population size data availability is usually higher for vertebrates and within these for mammals followed by birds this is also true for data on road mortality and especially on road avoidance behavior for which species specific information is lacking for many species rytwinski and fahrig 2012 furthermore although we used only simple hypothetical regular road networks in our simulations the modelled landscape can represent real landscapes with real road configurations and can hence also be used to evaluate the impact of different mitigation options for

25309,linear infrastructures one of several forms of land use are a major driver of biodiversity loss roads impact populations at many levels with direct road mortality and barrier effect contributing to decreased population abundance higher isolation and subdivision and therefore to increased extinction risk in this paper we compared the effect of road mortality and of the barrier effect on population isolation persistence and size and assessed the interaction of these effects with dispersal we used a spatially explicit process based model of population dynamics in landscapes fragmented by varying levels of road density we modelled a barrier effect independently from road mortality by varying the probability with which individuals avoid crossing roads both road mortality and the barrier effect caused population isolation while road mortality alone had stronger negative effects than the barrier effect without extra mortality the latter also resulted in decreased population size yet road avoidance could in some cases rescue populations from extinction populations with a large dispersal distance were more negatively affected as road mortality increased however when there was no road mortality they maintained larger sizes than populations with a short dispersal distance our results highlight the much higher relative importance of road mortality than the barrier effect for population size and persistence and the importance of assessing relevant species traits for effective long term transportation planning and conservation management our model can be used in species specific situations and with real landscape configurations in applications such as conservation planning keywords extinction abundance barrier effect mortality roads individual based model 1 introduction the current biodiversity crisis is mainly driven by land use change pereira et al 2012 maxwell et al 2016 roads one of many forms of land use cause major impacts on populations as the road network is predicted to strongly increase in the coming years van der ree et al 2015 it is crucial to assess its impact on populations in order to apply suitable mitigation measures and improve conservation and road planning roads cause habitat loss and fragmentation and decrease habitat quality roads also cause direct mortality through wildlife collisions with vehicles and act as a barrier to movement van der ree et al 2015 these direct and indirect impacts of roads can contribute to population isolation and subdivision to decreases in population abundance and therefore can increase population extinction risk van der ree et al 2015 ascensão et al 2016 although there are also positive effects for some species e g see rytwinski and fahrig 2012 2013 species traits can also influence population level responses to land use change pereira and daily 2006 and should be considered when assessing the effects of roads specifically dispersal has been identified as an important factor but its influence on population persistence is still not fully understood for example while the role of dispersal is beneficial in metapopulation models e g hanski 1998 because more patches can be colonized if dispersal is large in source sink models or reaction diffusion models e g skellam 1951 pulliam 1988 dispersal affects populations negatively because it can lead to colonization of habitats where population growth rates are negative sink habitats pereira and borda de água 2013 moreover dispersal can be associated with increased mortality risk e g nathan et al 2012 with some studies suggesting there is an optimal intermediate dispersal rate for persistence in disturbed habitats casagrandi and gatto 1999 the detrimental effect of dispersal in disturbed habitats is supported by several empirical studies e g fragmented forests gibbs 1998 van houtan et al 2007 in the specific case of roads a higher mobility has been related to negative effects of roads in mammal and bird species rytwinski and fahrig 2012 furthermore using a theoretical approach borda de água et al 2011 predicted that the larger the mean dispersal distance in a population the larger would be the minimum area necessary for this population to persist in a landscape fragmented by roads in this paper we focus on dispersal movement as the process whereby individuals leave their initial location move across a more or less suitable environment and settle in a new location clobert et al 2012 matthysen 2012 our model does not currently include other types of movement such as daily movements direct road mortality introduces an additional source of mortality besides natural mortality in addition roads can also act as a barrier that does not introduce additional mortality when the animals do not cross the roads this barrier effect can be due to physical structures such as fences or to road avoidance behavior e g jaeger and fahrig 2004 grilo et al 2012 and for simplicity in this paper we refer to it simply as barrier effect although this can rescue individuals from road mortality to some extent the negative consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation may be higher when such barrier effect is present since road avoidance can lead to population isolation and to higher exposure to demographic and environmental stochasticity rytwinski and fahrig 2012 ascensão et al 2016 moreover the effects of road mortality and of road avoidance can be confounded and are still to be properly disentangled for example reduced population abundance near roads may be due to direct road mortality or due to road avoidance behavior e g fahrig et al 1995 although there is evidence that the effects of roads on population abundance are in general negative rytwinski and fahrig 2015 the impact of roads on population persistence has not been so commonly addressed but see for example borda de água et al 2014 and ceia hasse et al 2017 the key issue addressed in this paper was to disentangle the influence of an additional source of mortality direct road mortality versus the influence of a barrier effect to movement that does not introduce such additional mortality on population isolation persistence and size as well as the influence of dispersal in fragmented landscapes we addressed this using roads we use a spatially explicit process based model of population dynamics our questions were 1 what is the importance of road mortality versus isolation for population persistence and size in landscapes fragmented by roads 2 how does dispersal influence the size and the persistence of populations under varying levels of road mortality and of a barrier effect 2 materials and methods we used an individual based toy model of population dynamics to perform a theoretical study on the effects of road mortality barrier effect and dispersal on population isolation size and persistence of a virtual species our study is not based on any empirical data and thus is more appropriately considered under the virtual ecology rationale e g grimm 1999 zurell et al 2010 2 1 model description the model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing agent based models grimm et al 2006 2010 the model was implemented as an ansi c program which can be downloaded from https github com anaceiahasse landsim 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to simulate population dynamics in fragmented landscapes specifically in this study the model simulated population dynamics in landscapes fragmented by roads with special emphasis on the effects of road mortality of a barrier effect without mortality and on the influence of dispersal distance 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the entities of the model are the landscape and the individuals i e the model keeps track of the features of the landscape and of the female population the model only considers female individuals for simplicity the landscape is a two dimensional grid of n x n square cells with reflecting boundaries an alternative approach to deal with edge effects would have been to consider periodic boundary conditions i e torus geometry instead of reflecting boundaries however given a dispersal step size of only one cell and the large size of the grid both approaches can lead to similar outcomes each cell of the landscape is assigned to one of n possible types with values varying between 0 and 1 in the present case each cell belongs to one of two possible types high quality habitat non road or road with values of 1 and 0 respectively we generated several landscapes with different proportions of road cells where roads were placed perpendicularly to one another fig 1 table 1 we used simple hypothetical regular road networks because our main objective was to disentangle the effects of sink mortality versus those of a barrier effect that does not introduce additional mortality sink mortality here corresponds to road mortality and it is the probability that an individual dies when crossing a road see section 2 1 7 3 below our goal was to derive general principles that can be the basis to understanding and model more specific or complex cases individuals are characterized by the following state variables age developmental stage juvenile or adult position in the landscape and by the following attributes fecundity age at first breeding natural survival probability home range size dispersal distance road mortality probability road avoidance probability table 1 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling each simulation time step consists of the following sequential events fig 2 table 1 reproduction natural mortality dispersal of juveniles juvenile density dependent mortality section 2 1 7 describes the submodels implementing these processes juveniles that establish a home range are inserted into the adult population at the end of each simulation time step thereby updating population size and landscape cell availability for the following time step at the beginning of each simulation time step the age of each individual is updated increased by 1 and the sequential steps listed above ensue 2 1 4 design concepts 2 1 4 1 basic principles roads can contribute to population isolation decreased size and increased extinction risk through direct mortality and barrier effects e g van der ree et al 2015 ascensão et al 2016 dispersal can also influence how roads impact populations e g borda de água et al 2011 rytwinski and fahrig 2012 the model allows assessing the relative importance of these factors for population isolation persistence and size which is not yet fully understood 2 1 4 2 emergence population dynamics emerges from the model i e from the set of rules defined parameter values used and landscape configuration 2 1 4 3 adaptation juveniles choose the direction in which they disperse according to cell type road versus high quality habitat cell and occupancy they may avoid dispersing into road cells with a given probability and they do not disperse to occupied cells respectively 2 1 4 4 sensing during dispersal juveniles evaluate cell type road versus non road cell and occupancy 2 1 4 5 interaction juveniles do not disperse through cells that are already occupied 2 1 4 6 stochasticity stochasticity was incorporated in several processes reproduction natural mortality dispersal of juveniles see section 2 1 7 for details 2 1 4 7 observation for each model run we recorded population size at the end of each simulation and averaged population size across replicates we calculated the probability of extinction as the proportion of replicates in which populations went extinct before the end of the simulation 2 1 5 initialization the model starts by settling an initial population of females at breeding age in the landscape after the initial population is created each simulation time step consists of the events described in section 2 1 7 submodels in all simulations the initial population size was 10 individuals set at random in the landscape see table 1 for the remaining parameter values used in the simulations and fig 3 for a representation of the settlement of the initial population in the landscape and of the colonization of the landscape 2 1 6 input data the model does not import data of driving environmental variables 2 1 7 submodels 2 1 7 1 reproduction females reproduce after one year and once they have established their home range the number of female juveniles that a breeding female produces follows a poisson distribution with mean equal to its fecundity

individuals 2 1 7 3 dispersal of juveniles in our model adults do not move and do not get killed by direct road mortality only juveniles disperse each juvenile disperses a fixed number of cells from its mother cell a dispersal step is always to one of the four neighboring cells von neumann neighborhood and is composed of the following events fig 2b 1 the individual evaluates whether its four neighboring cells are occupied or free and does not disperse to occupied cells 2 the individual evaluates whether the free neighboring cells correspond to roads or not and can avoid dispersing through road cells with probability pra 3 if the individual disperses through a road cell sink dispersal mortality road mortality is applied with probability mrm the dispersal process is not stopped when the individual finds a first suitable empty cell instead it continues until the individual either dies due to road mortality or disperses over his dispersal distance d an individual is allowed to move back to a cell it has previously visited therefore two neighboring unoccupied cells are sufficient for an individual to survive over any number of dispersal steps moreover each juvenile disperses from its mother cell but given natural mortality that cell may be freed and in that case it can be occupied by a juvenile the default probability of dispersing to any neighboring cell is 1 however if all four neighboring cells are occupied and since individuals do not disperse to occupied cells then the individual cannot move and dispersal is unsuccessful if the cell in which the individual is at the end of dispersal is a road dispersal is also unsuccessful if dispersal is successful the individual can settle a home range in this study we set the home range size to one cell and only one individual can establish its home range in each cell 2 1 7 4 juvenile density dependent mortality following unsuccessful dispersal juveniles that did not establish their home range are removed from the population 2 2 simulations we created five landscapes of 200 200 cells with perpendicular roads each with a different proportion of road cells fig 1 table 1 we used two dispersal distances short 5 cells and large 50 cells the latter of which we deemed reasonable considering the total size of the grid 40 000 cells we modelled a barrier effect independently from sink mortality by varying the probability with which individuals do not cross roads while dispersing we performed two sets of simulations in the first set of simulations we assessed the effect of different extreme scenarios of road mortality and of road avoidance in landscapes with different proportions of road cells i road mortality probability was one and there was no road avoidance ii road avoidance probability was one and there was no road mortality iii road mortality and road avoidance probabilities were both zero for each dispersal distance and each road density to assess the combined effects of road mortality and of road avoidance in the second set of simulations we varied road mortality and road avoidance probabilities both at the same time independently from 0 to 1 in steps of 0 1 i e using all combinations possible for each dispersal distance table 1 in all simulations we used fixed values of the remaining parameters table 1 simulating the dynamics of hypothetical animal populations in hypothetical landscapes because our main objective was to obtain general predictions on the differential effects of road mortality versus a barrier effect that did not introduce additional mortality

results in our simulations isolation occurred due to road mortality or to road avoidance fig 3 with complete road mortality and no avoidance fig 3a or with complete avoidance and no road mortality fig 3b the landscape was only partially occupied in contrast when there was no mortality and no avoidance fig 3c the whole landscape was occupied when there was no road mortality and no road avoidance the probability of extinction was higher and the population size was smaller at higher road densities suggesting an effect due to habitat loss fig 4 nevertheless with no road mortality and no road avoidance the probability of extinction was zero or close to zero even with high road density fig 4a and the population size was considerably larger than with either complete road avoidance or complete road mortality fig 4b these results suggest that in such cases there was an effect of road avoidance or of road mortality respectively the probability of extinction was higher and the population size was smaller when there was road mortality alone than when there was road avoidance alone except at the highest road density fig 4 however population size was much smaller at all road densities when there was road avoidance than in the case with no road avoidance and no road mortality fig 4b when assessing the combined effects of road mortality and of road avoidance for different

delimited by roads were small 16 cells and populations went extinct when road avoidance was complete even without road mortality the role of dispersal varied with road mortality the probability of extinction increased and the population size decreased much faster with increasing road mortality for the large than for the short dispersal distance however when there was no road mortality the probability of extinction was higher fig 5a and the population size was smaller fig 5b for the short dispersal distance similar patterns were observed when assessing these effects at a lower road density proportion of road cells in the landscape 0 07 fig s1 in appendix however they were less obvious than in the case of high road density especially for the short dispersal distance the probability of extinction was low and the population sizes varied less nevertheless population size strongly decreased with complete road avoidance or with complete road mortality for both dispersal distances as in the case of high road density fig 5 note that for the short dispersal distance and also for most of the large dispersal distance simulations in fig s1 while the probability of population extinction is close to zero the population size is low both when road mortality is one and when road avoidance is one this is because many individuals die on roads when road mortality is one or the population can only occupy part of the landscape when road avoidance is one 4 discussion our results allow to make inferences about the differential effects of sink mortality versus those

highest in those cases individuals were isolated within the small patches of good habitat that were bounded by roads and the resulting small populations exhibited an increased extinction risk due to demographic stochasticity lande 1993 habitat fragmentation impairs species persistence and ecosystem functions moreover the several effects of fragmentation are interlinked and can operate over long time scales haddad et al 2015 in our analysis population sizes were negatively affected when road avoidance was complete regardless of the road density even if there was no road mortality population sizes were much smaller when compared to the cases with no road avoidance and no road mortality this may influence population persistence in the long term especially if other factors of disturbance come into play for example we did not vary habitat quality all non road cells had maximum habitat quality because our aim was to obtain general predictions on the differential effects of road mortality versus those of a barrier effect without mortality however habitat quality can influence how roads affect populations e g grilo et al 2014 and therefore the habitat quality of the non road cells could be varied in more detailed studies for example by including species specific information on habitat preferences moreover although not included explicitly in our analysis traffic volume is also important to consider when assessing the effects of roads on populations and in landscape connectivity studies since traffic intensity may influence both road mortality and road avoidance and thus population persistence jaeger et al 2006 jaeger 2007 charry and jones 2009 van langevelde and jaarsma 2009 van strien and grêt regamey 2016 several studies suggest that road mortality may be higher at intermediate traffic volumes than high traffic volumes because at higher traffic volumes road avoidance will be higher for many species e g seiler 2005 grilo et al 2015 however the focus of our analysis was on comparing the effects of road mortality vs those of a barrier that does not introduce additional mortality which can be due to road avoidance behavior but also due to physical structures such as fences e g jaeger and fahrig 2004 grilo et al 2012 hence we modeled these directly as the probability of an individual dying on a road while crossing it and the probability of an individual not crossing a road regardless of the cause e g road surface avoidance behavior road avoidance due to traffic fences and therefore we did not consider traffic volume explicitly additionally while in our simulations individuals only evaluated their immediate neighboring cells in each step of dispersal some species avoid roads from a distance e g jaeger et al 2005 which may exacerbate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation including microevolution in our individual based model which is fundamental to capture the response of organisms to changing conditions grimm and berger 2016 would also allow analysing eco evolutionary responses to fragmentation haddad et al 2015 4 2 influence of dispersal distance on population persistence and size the role of dispersal distance varied depending on the values of road mortality in fragmented landscapes as was the case in all our simulations since roads were always present populations with a larger dispersal distance showed a lower probability of extinction and maintained larger sizes provided an additional source of mortality due to roads was not present however a large dispersal distance was detrimental for population size and persistence as road mortality increased we used fixed dispersal distances in our simulations however dispersal distance is usually stochastic e g nathan et al 2012 and therefore it would not only be interesting but also add realism to the model by implementing dispersal kernels to determine dispersal distances e g austerlitz et al 2004 chipperfield et al 2011 instead of using fixed dispersal distances furthermore in our simulations dispersing individuals only evaluated their immediate four neighboring cells in each dispersal step which can be considered as a biased random walk e g turchin 1998 while this has been a common choice to model movement with an orientation component e g börger et al 2008 expanding the perceptive range of dispersing individuals would increase the realism and facilitate the transferability of the model to concrete situations 4 3 limitations the type of movement juvenile dispersal considered in our paper can have a large influence on individual fitness and population structure matthysen 2012 however our model does not currently include other types of movement such as daily movements and thus adults do not get killed due to road mortality this is a simplification because in real contexts animals will encounter roads during other types of movement as well therefore it would be important to include such types of movement in the analysis furthermore in our model each juvenile disperses over a fixed number of cells which implies that individuals may end their dispersal movement on a road or right of way this could correspond to situations where there are no other options for dispersal e g all neighboring areas already occupied or corresponding to unsuitable habitat but it should be considered as a simplification of real cases we used two dispersal distances in our simulations because we wanted to ensure that we were comparing the roles of contrasting dispersal distances i e a short vs a large dispersal distance including a wider range of dispersal distances could help further understand the role of dispersal in these fragmented landscapes as some studies suggest there is an optimal intermediate dispersal rate for persistence in disturbed habitats casagrandi and gatto 1999 we used a virtual species and simple hypothetical regular road networks because our main goal was to disentangle the effects of road mortality versus those of a barrier effect without such mortality however this implies that our results hold for the virtual species in the regular road network used 4 4 conclusions and future research directions our results highlight the much higher relative importance of road mortality than the barrier effect without road mortality and of assessing relevant species traits such as dispersal distance we emphasize three results of our study first that even though population persistence was not impaired when road avoidance was complete except when suitable habitat patches became too small to sustain viable populations population size was considerably decreased which is important to consider in long term conservation management secondly that a large dispersal distance is not necessarily always detrimental for population size and persistence in fragmented landscapes if mortality in unsuitable habitats is low which calls for further investigation and thirdly that population isolation occurred in extreme cases i e complete road mortality or a complete barrier effect without road mortality these may be especially important for species expected rytwinski and fahrig 2013 or observed e g some snakes and turtles shepard et al 2008 to avoid roads and for species for which road avoidance increases with increasing traffic volume e g carnivores and ungulates dyer et al 2002 alexander et al 2005 leblond et al 2013 finally our model can stimulate other studies either theoretical or empirical our results hold for the virtual species in the regular road network used but our model can be applied to species specific situations by using the specific trait values of the species or population of interest information on model parameter values initial population size fecundity age at first breeding survival probability home range size dispersal distance road mortality or road avoidance can be obtained from published databases individual studies or derived from related or ecologically similar species and using allometric relationships e g jones et al 2009 borda de água et al 2014 salguero gómez et al 2016 ceia hasse et al 2017 for example data on population density can be used to determine the initial population size data availability is usually higher for vertebrates and within these for mammals followed by birds this is also true for data on road mortality and especially on road avoidance behavior for which species specific information is lacking for many species rytwinski and fahrig 2012 furthermore although we used only simple hypothetical regular road networks in our simulations the modelled landscape can represent real landscapes with real road configurations and can hence also be used to evaluate the impact of different mitigation options for increasing population persistence in environmental impact assessments and for conservation planning acknowledgments we thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their helpful comments that
