25080,the babassu palm tree attalea speciosa mart ex spreng is an endemic species of amazon forests and has social and economical impact utility deforestation highlights this palm tree in anthropogenic open areas pastures and cultivated fields simultaneously knowledge concerning the sustainable functioning of the species within these manmade environments is sorely lacking its life cycle is not well known and its population dynamics remains unstudied in this study our objective was to generate a model of the population dynamics of the babassu palm tree validated by in situ analysis to understand how babassu a forest species adapts to pastureland and under certain conditions becomes invasive we propose a random matrix model with aggregated variables based on the biological stages of the species as the input the probabilities of the between stage transition matrix were modelled using a dirichlet multinomial model with a hierarchy taking geographical organization i e transect level into account the integration of prior information was formulated through a bayesian approach this bayesian hierarchical matrix model enabled us to demonstrate a bottleneck in the population dynamics and a high year dependent mortality rate at an early stage keywords mathematical modelling bayesian statistics population dynamics babassu palm tree 1 introduction the primary threat to primary forests long before climate change is human action jha 2010 the majority of plant species that grow in tropical rainforests do not resist land use change at the time of cultivation fearnside 2005 barlow et al 2016 some other tree and palm species are resilient anthelme et al 2011 norden et al 2009 the babassu palm tree attalea speciosa mart ex spreng which can reach 30 m height is endemic to the south american amazonian forest it is sometimes present in agrosystems installed following clearing of the primary forest while many other woody species have disappeared mitja et al 2018 dos santos and mitja 2011 it persists years later in secondary forests resulting from the abandonment of crops and pastures and it can even become invasive and hinder the development of cultivated species while a portion of the population wants to eliminate it another part wants to maintain it because of its multiple uses araújo and lopes 2012 some plot scale work has demonstrated higher densities of adult babassu in pastures than in the original forest anderson 1983 campos et al 2017 while other work has shown the opposite barot et al 2005 a territory wide study of the pa benfica smallholder farming community revealed this variability in the density of babassu cauliflower palms in primary forests as well as in pastures and secondary forests in these environments the few plots with very high densities are only observed in pastures or secondary forests mitja et al 2018 in contrast because the number of plots without cauliflower babassu is higher in pastures the average babassu density in the study area is lower in pastures than in secondary or primary forests mitja et al 2018 thus babassu has the potential to invade agrosystems even if this does not occur systematically in fact there is a high variability of the palm density in pastures potentially that is related to the initial density in the forest depending on the cultivation practices of farmers who can conserve or eliminate palm trees mitja et al 2018 in pastures babassu are influenced by factors such as sun exposure mitja and ferraz 2001 anderson et al 1991 burning chemical or manual cleaning of plots competition with forage grasses burial of fruit in the soil and clear cutting these factors sometimes act in a contradictory way on fruits seedlings and young individuals and adults and can counteract the high resilience of this species at certain stages mitja et al 2018 in our study context the studied pastures did not undergo significant anthropogenic actions such as chemical cleaning or clear cutting to explain this ability of babassu to remain on pasture after forest clearing the possibility of natural biological diversity within babassus diversity of genetic epigenetic origins or more generally due to genetic interaction with the environment cannot be excluded bräutigam et al 2013 richards et al 2017 although we do not currently have data to support these assumptions previous works focusing on all babassu individuals from seedlings to adults have examined the life cycle divided into ontogenic stages three stages for campos et al 2017 four stages for anderson 1983 five stages for barot et al 2005 six stages for dos santos et al 2017 in the latter case which concerns our field of study the life cycle was divided into a seedling stage four stages of young individuals and an adult stage stages 1 2 and 3 are characterized by a rosette configuration and a buried terminal bud stage 4 corresponds to the presence of the terminal bud on the soil surface protected by the leaf sheaths stage 5 last young stage corresponds to individuals with a terminal bud above ground that is very often still protected by the leaf sheath stage 6 is the adult stage most often ascertained by a free stripe considering the stages some authors have studied the population structure using a single one shot measure barot et al 2005 campos et al 2017 barot et al 2005 obtained an inverted j shaped curve for the primary tropical forest characteristics of natural unharvested populations hall and bawa 1993 while in pastures this structure was found to be different with a lower seedling density these latter results have not been verified by studies by campos et al 2017 and anderson 1983 who showed an inverted j curve not only for primary forest but also for pastures however the accepted interpretation that species with inverted j population structures are in equilibrium while those with a small number of young stages would correspond to declining populations has been questioned indeed the survival of the plant population would depend more on the growth rate of individuals in the various stages condit et al 1998 which if rapid can maintain a sufficient density of adults to determine whether the babassu will persist in this newly set up farmland in the long term it will be necessary to assess the growth rate and thus monitor the evolution of the population over time johnson et al 1994 by studying the population dynamics through periodic measurements over the long term recently individual based models have received great interest and have been used to predict population dynamics and the effects of management strategies buckley et al 2003 following the ideas of uchmaski and grimm 1996 and lomnicki 1999 the interest in individual based models is to take the individual interactions competition and the resource dynamics explicitly into account in our case pastureland is a stable and non limited resource environment where competition between trees is negligible an individual based model could be interesting to ascertain the time spent at each stage of development and to define trajectories but as the data are from a three year experiment the results may not be sufficiently extensive to be reliable because of the very low transition rates often observed between some stages a longer observation period would be necessary to be of use the population dynamics models appear to offer a simpler and better adapted framework for our study zuidema and zagt 2000 two components must be taken into account when modelling the ecological process and the observation process in our context the ecological process describes variation in abundance over transects and time two periods of measurement demographic models represent a standard approach for abundance data that provides insight into population growth caswell 1989 deterministic matrix models have been used for trees in the following articles bullock 1980 pinero et al 1984 enright and watson 1992 pinard 1993 olmsted and alvarez buylla 1995 barot et al 2000 holm et al 2008 and also guarín and del valle 2014 demographic models include a deterministic part but stochastic elements can be added to accommodate any sources of variability transects time individuals that affect the observations to take into account the geographical structure of our data palm trees are observed on different transects thus defining the hierarchical model this approach was advocated by clark 2003 who insists that variability associated with space time and among individuals who are not accommodated by demographic models can make parameter estimates and growth rate predictions unrealistic stochastic models can be defined in different ways in the method defined by tuljapurkar and caswell 1997 the stochastic matrix involves elasticity and stochasticity of the vital rate in our case we did not focus on one parameter only but on a global approach that allows one to deal with broader issues and topics from different fields economy social impact biology technical aspect of the management and so on ipm integrated population models is another possible approach which is also known as hierarchical or state space models eacker et al 2017 schaub and abadi 2011 more generally than ipm the bayesian hierarchical model is well adapted and sufficiently flexible to incorporate hierarchical data and expert knowledge hobbs and hooten 2015 it can be adjusted over successive years of observation and updated over time posterior estimation is used from the first year as prior information for the second year estimation and so on as suggested by parent and rivot 2012 to understand how babassu which is a forest species adapts to grazing and under certain conditions becomes invasive this study proposes to develop a population dynamics model that does not currently exist for this species this model will be a hierarchical stochastic matrix population model in the bayesian framework beyond the knowledge produced this model can be used in future species management projects to make forecasts this article covers the following topics 1 materials provides a description of the biology of the babassu as well as a description of the study site and of the sampling 2 model provides a comprehensive description of all aspects of the modelling matrix model hierarchy and bayesian framework 3 results and discussion provides comments on the model validation and on population dynamics and the existence of a bottleneck these sections are followed by a global conclusion 2 materials 2 1 biology of babassu in pastures the babassu life cycle can be organized in biological stages of development six stages have been defined varying from the seedling to the adult palm tree fig 1 see mitja et al 2019 for more details in addition the reproductive stage and fructification of the babassu has been studied by barot et al 2005 and anderson et al 1991 providing knowledge for understanding the reproductive process and recruitment in our modelling 2 2 study site our data was collected over three years of field monitoring from 2013 to 2015 this monitoring was carried out on the benfica agriculture installation project projeto de assentamento site which is located in the brazilian state of pará fig 2 this territory is located within the amazonian rain forest on the territory of the itupiranga municipality and covers 10 026 ha the shape of benfica is irregular and lies within a quadrilateral space formed by the straight line connection at the coordinates 05 12 20 s latitude 05 20 40 s latitude and 49 48 00 w longitude 49 56 40 w longitude the particularity of this site is that it includes man made spaces that since 1989 have been progressively colonized by one thousand people sampaio 2008 2 3 field sampling the fieldwork protocol was developed in early 2012 seven surface areas of pastureland were designated for this research project within each piece of land two to three transects linear paths were defined and visibly marked out on the ground dos santos et al 2017 we obtained the total number of seventeen transects from which we collected data regarding growth sprouting and fruiting processes in addition we also used seven supplementary transects to obtain more data about the growth process especially for stages 5 and 6 table 1 the counting and marking of all individuals at all six stages of development was performed within these transects in 2013 2987 palm trees of all stages were identified in 2014 and 2015 we surveyed the same palm trees to which we respectively added 471 and 482 newly recruited individuals of stage 1 table 2 3 model the modelling was constructed based on three distinct experimental data sets see flowchart fig 3 that were observed during two observation periods one in 2013 2014 and one in 2014 2015 on 17 or 24 transects we decided to infer three independent models based on three different observational units for the following reasons the transition survival model was our main concern for answering demographic questions such as the existence of a bottleneck or a reverse j shape curve the survey was constructed for that purpose the sample land was chosen to be representative of the different ages of pasture in para the 24 transects were chosen in order to sample a sufficient number of babassu palm trees in different stages for the transition survival study including 7 very specific transects focusing on old babassu palm trees stage 5 and 6 the fruiting and sprouting processes were less precisely observed and only on the 17 transects we wanted to avoid error propagation of the measurement or modelling approximations to the transition survival modelling therefore we decided to construct independent fruiting and sprouting models moreover estimation of these models on the 17 transects might not be adapted to the 7 specific transects of older palm trees however even if the three models were independently estimated they could be combined to simulate a life cycle the survey did not focus on the seed dispersal even if it exists see mitja and ferraz 2001 for more detailed or the germination no information was collected on the germination of fruits or seedlings no information was available for outside the transects linear paths without this information it was not possible to fit and use seed dispersal models such as the one proposed by clark et al 1999 localization of adult palm trees around or adjacent to the transect would be necessary to achieve such modelling and the new recruits were considered to be of unknown origin brief description of the three independent models a demographic model with two levels transect studied area in benfica was defined the observation were performed at an individual level but the palm trees were considered to be independent and the observations were pooled at the transect level for each stage demographic stochasticity was modelled with hierarchical dirichlet prior and multinomial likelihood laws the annual number of fruits from a palm tree was modelled with a lognormal distribution to restrict them to positive values and to maintain flexibility in the meantime a non conjugated hierarchical model is used to model the annual mean number of fruits per palm tree across the studied area level normal prior in addition to the observation individual level lognormal likelihood this model is conditional on the probability that a palm tree can have fruits this probability is modelled with a classical conjugate beta binomial distribution we used a classical conjugate beta binomial distribution to model the probability of sprouting across the studied area recall that the sprouting process was observed at the transect level from a number of pooled observed fruits including contribution from babassu palm trees besides along and outside the transect 3 1 hierarchy the ecological process was observed on transects belonging to the designated area of land only two levels were considered for the transition survival process the transect and the whole studied area in benfica moreover our estimation concerning the probability of transition between stages see fig 4 did not exhibit any structure at the level of the farmer s piece of land each piece of land is separated by a red line no spatial structure was observed except for the transition from stage 2 to stage 3 where a link with spatial coordinates might be possible see appendix and discussion but it was difficult to estimate or ensure with our dataset therefore we preferred to employ a multilevel model using the level of the transects and of the whole studied area in benfica 3 2 observation process and definition of the observed variables survival transition process observations were performed on 17 7 for stages 5 and 6 transects see table 1 for transect l we observed the total number of plants in stage i at year t 1 n i t 1 l we also observed the number of survivors at year t in stage i n i t l this number was the sum of the observed number of survivors that remained in this stage denoted as s i i t l and of the observed number of survivors from stage i 1 who had moved to stage i denoted as s i 1 i t l n i t l s i i t l s i 1 i t l moreover in a given transect l at time t the number of deaths among those in stage i was the total number of plants in stage i from the previous year minus the number of survivors from the previous year that remained in stage i minus the survivors from the previous year that changed stages dead i t l n i t 1 l s i i t l s i i 1 t l from these observations we could infer proportions for each transect l we assumed that the expected proportions remained constant over time and denoted π i i l as the expected proportion of plants that remained at the same stage i π i i 1 l as the expected proportion moving from stage i to the next stage i 1 and 1 π i i l π i i 1 l as the expected mortality proportion in stage i these three parameters allowed us to define a categorical distribution for each transect l π i l π i i l π i i 1 l 1 π i i l π i i 1 l we also defined a categorical distribution at the level of the whole studied area π i π i i π i i 1 1 π i i π i i 1 no observations performed at this level therefore π i i and π i i 1 are latent variables fruiting and sprouting processes first the fruit production per palm tree was observed on the 17 transects for each palm tree in stage 6 the reproduction process begins with the definition of the sexual state no inflorescence male or female inflorescence or both inflorescences the babassu palm tree has a complex reproductive process that is not well understood and has not been well measured the female and male inflorescences change over undefined periods of time therefore the reproductive process has been simplified and resumed with the observed reproductive state variable u j t l which indicates the presence of fruits at year t on palm tree j from transect l this variable was coded as 1 when fruits were present and 0 if they were not we assumed that the expected proportion ϕ of palm trees of stage 6 in a reproductive state 1 was constant over time and was common to all transects when a palm tree j of year t 1 was in a reproductive state 1 its number of fruits denoted fruits j t 1 l was the sum of the observed number of fruits on the palm tree and on the ground immediately under the palm tree this observation was performed directly in the field but also validated later by using photography of the palm tree we approximated fruit observations using a normal distribution with a mean parameter μ and a variance parameter σ 2 next the seedlings were not observed outside the transect but only the number of recruited seedlings in stage one per transect l and per year t was measured in the field we denoted this variable r t l but the origin of these new palm trees was unknown they could represent fruit from an adult palm tree stage 6 adjacent to the transect therefore the total number of fruits on transect l year t 1 was counted regardless of their origin and we denoted this variable totalf t 1 l we assumed that the recruitment occurred only in the first stage and that the expected proportion of fruit providing a new palm tree in one year was constant over time and was common to all transects we denoted this parameter λ remark all variables were directly measured observed on the ground by expert biologists we assumed that there were no errors and our observation process was identity 3 3 lefkovitch matrices for the ecological process six growth stages have been defined for babassu mitja et al 2019 vector n t l n 1 t l n 6 t l is the state vector where n i t l is the number of individuals in stage i at year t in transect l the ecological process is modelled with a markovian process 1 e n 1 t l n 6 t l n 1 t 1 l n 6 t 1 l π 1 1 l 0 0 0 0 0 π 1

transect level with a survival transition matrix following caswell 2001 the model must take into account the demographic stochasticity and hierarchy integration of different kinds sources of variability was performed in a bayesian framework in this framework all parameters except σ 2 were considered as random variables see the dag directed acyclic graph fig 5 for details this parameter was fixed in the observation in an empirical bayes approach to ensure mcmc converged because we omitted the observation process error lack of measurements allowing estimation of the observation error apart from the variability in the number of fruits and also due to the very small sample size three independent bayesian sub models were defined survival transition for the six stages according to buckland et al 2007 demographic stochasticity is modelled with multinomial laws extension of the binomial law to a context with more than two possibilities evolution from year t 1 to year t of the six

preceding model we adapted a hierarchical dirichlet distribution from cowans 2004 cowans proposed a hierarchical dirichlet document model where each document transect for us is modelled using a multinomial distribution whose parameters are given a dirichlet prior the mean value of the dirichlet prior is itself assumed to be random and given a dirichlet hyperprior this kind of modelling with dirichlet priors and dirichlet hyperpriors is used for topic models wallach et al 2009 or information retrieval from documents haffari and teh 2009 hierarchical dirichlet distribution to add to the hierarchy for each stage i 3 π i l π i η i dirichlet η i π i i 1 6 π i dirichlet weights i i 1 6 η i uniform u 1 u 2 i 1 6 the shared mean parameter by stage i induces sharing of information across transects weights i of the dirichlet hyperprior were calibrated with both observed proportions as in an empirical bayes approach and uniform distribution following cowans 2004 idea to test the sensitivity of the model to this hyperprior the latent variable η i could be considered to be a size effect which indicated the level of confidence in the realization of the latent vector π i fruiting

0 where δ 0 indicates the dirac mass at 0 the lognormal distribution was preferred to the usual poisson or negative binomial distributions to increase the flexibility of the modelling to address over dispersion and add explicitly to the population latent variable μ the mean annual number of fruits inferred at the level of the studied area the lognormal distribution provided the best fit our data see supplementary materials fig 10 next we assumed that the palm trees in stage 6 shared the same parameter of fruiting ϕ 5 u j t 1 l bernoulli ϕ to add to the hierarchy allowing the sharing of information across palm trees and transects we defined 6 ϕ beta a b μ n m v sprouting or recruitment in the first stage recruitment in the first stage r t l was stochastic and was defined conditional

we defined 8 λ beta c d 3 4 hyperparameters two sets of hyperparameters were used with one per year of estimation for the first year the prior was less informative as no expert knowledge was available for the second year we used the marginal posterior mean value and variance of the variables ϕ λ π i to calibrate the hyperparameters for both years the hyperparameters m v and σ 2 were calibrated from observed field data the values are presented in table 3 3 5 bayesian inference and model validation in bayesian frameworks estimation of the variables of interest is performed for the posterior

the notation we will omit the dependence on param in the following equations of course we are clearly aware that posterior estimation is conditional on param and therefore sensitive to the values of

informative versus non informative priors in a learning approach estimation based on the first year of observation was performed according to helser et al 2012 since no study to date has provided prior information on babassu growth or reproduction processes in the babassu environment we endorsed the approach of smith and wakefield 1994 who suggest that priors should be non informative to ensure that the likelihood dominates the prior the hyperparameters characterizing the distribution of π i η i ϕ λ and μ were chosen to provide a prior that was as flat and non informative as possible then in a learning approach the value of the hyperparameters weights i was set to the posterior estimates of π i we compared the estimation based on the second year of observation obtained with each set of hyperparameters this comparison allowed us to study the sensitivity of the model and its stability over the years model validation the predictive posterior distribution can be used to check whether the model is consistent with the observed data gelman et al 1996 measurement y obs is the observed value and y rep is a replicate sampled from the predictive posterior p y rep θ p θ data dθ steinbakk and storvik 2009 posterior p values of approximately 0 5 indicate that the distributions of replicated and actual data are close while values near zero or one indicate a discrepancy between them moreover validation was possible by leaving out 25 of the transects for the second year of observation 2014 2015 the posterior population estimate π i was then used to predict the total expected number of survivors s i i s i i 1 dead i of the omitted transects the total number per stage of the omitted transects was considered to be consistent with a prediction at the level of the studied area computation with r and jags jags which uses the dialect of bugs lunn et al 2000 2013 plummer 2003 was used to fit the model to the data with the package rjags the estimates of parameters were evaluated based on 200 000 samples after 50 000 burn in samples thinning to one draw for each sample by mcmc simulation of the joint posterior distribution the mcmc inference samples analysis was processed with the coda package plummer et al 2006 convergence diagnostics consisted of visuals traces and autocorrelations and statistical calculations using the test of gelman et al 2003 based on gelman and rubin 1999 for all variables in the model the gelman criteria of between chain variance over within chain variance converged into one more information on the convergence diagnosis and on the script of the model are available in the supplementary materials 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation we focused the validation analysis on the survival transition matrix at the level of the studied area the validation concerned the second year of observation 2014 2015 with the informative prior first we computed the posterior predictive p value for estimation of the survival transition probabilities obtained for the second year of observation 2014 2015 and with the informative prior see table 4 when the ppp value was much smaller than 0 5 e g 0 or 0 1 then the probability simulated with the model was less variable than the observed probability and the model failed to reproduce the variability of the data thus the model underestimated the data variability we imputed this phenomenon as a higher variability observed in the data during 2014 2015 than during 2013 2014 which may indicate a year effect a longer time series of observation may well be needed to define an informative prior as suggested by bierzychudek 1999 next we checked the adequacy of the model with the cross validation approach see table 5 for the second year of observation 2014 2015 and with the informative prior the young stages namely one and two showed a poor prediction as the observed values were not in the 95 credible interval of the prediction for all variables again this mismatch for the young stages was a result of the extreme variability observed in the field for the dynamics of the young during the two periods of observation 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 eventually the learning approach of using the posterior of the first period 2013 2014 to calibrate the prior of the second period 2014 2015 was not satisfactory for the young stage namely 1 and 2 4 2 survival and transition between states identification of a bottleneck table 6 summarizes the estimates of the survival transition probabilities for both periods 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 the dynamic can be divided into two parts before compared with after stage 3 mortality was significantly elevated 5 to 27 the first stage exhibited a high year variability as underlined in the model validation section this competition disappeared at a later stage of palm tree growth the death probability for the first stage was estimated at 12 for the first period and 27 for the second period these values were both lower than the estimate of 38 published by anderson 1983 and anderson and balick 1988 concerning another experiment in brazil after stage 3 the estimates were not sensitive to the prior or the year effect the mortality rates were lower and difficult to estimate with small sample sizes except for the transition between stage 3 and stage 4 lower than 1 the probability of transitions were significant 10 to 28 hence these results showed a clear bottleneck at stage 3 due to its extremely low probability the transition between stage 3 and 4 had a large impact on the needed time for a babassu to reach the adult stage 6 thus a supplementary sampling effort should be performed for stages 3 and 4 to better estimate and understand this transition stage 3 is critical in the biology of the babassu because the palm terminal bud rises from the ground during this stage 4 3 link between the bottleneck and population structure finally we observed a bottleneck at the end of stage 3 in pastures this bottleneck was observed in a primary forest by barot et al 2005 moreover a comparison of our bar plot of densities by stage see fig 6 revealed a shape similar to barot et al 2005 for stages 1 to 3 corresponding to els sls and juv1 respectively in their article however in the next stage situated after the bottleneck the densities are collapsed toward zero in our case we expected a priori high densities in all young stages for this palm species which is considered to be an invasive plant species in pastures barot et al 2005 a pasture is an open field environment with less competition for light or with other species in open areas the number of germinations per fruit is lower but growth in stage 1 is more rapid mitja and ferraz 2001 fig 6 shows an increase in density in stage 3 over the time in addition the mortality rates for stages 3 to 6 were very low during this period therefore we may assume that the observed bottleneck was due to the low transition rate from stage 3 to stage 4 multiple causes could have contributed or explained this low transition first competition for light and nutrients with fodder plants or introduced grasses might not be negligible in the younger stages as stated in the article by sankaran et al 2004 tree grass coexistence in savannas competition based models or demographic bottleneck models or a mixture of the two could explain the population structure of babassu in the pasture second the management of the pasture with human intervention has an impact on what is believed to be an appropriate density of babassu palm trees for cattle shelter runk 1998 observed this kind of human intervention in the regulation of ivory palm tree where the lack of juveniles to the sub adult stage appears to be a population bottleneck in managed stands limiting the number of adults however during the period of our study management was limited to an annual clearing to respect our research on the population dynamics and estimation of the natural mortality annual clearing of pasture plots by cutting leaves from stages 2 to 4 and sometimes even stage 5 can delay the transition between stages because the palm tree must reinvest in the production of new leaves mitja et al 2018 third the impact of cattle for example trampling grazing might provide an explanation for a demographic bottleneck model the terminal meristem of the plant is below ground until stage 3 and the plant can regenerate even if the aerial part is damaged grazed etc these non lethal actions as we estimated a very low mortality in stage 3 might delay the transition and thus create a bottleneck for the transition from stage 3 to stage 4 fourth none of these suggestions explain why this bottleneck or at least a reverse j shaped curve with a lower density in stage 4 was observed in primary rain forests in addition to the competition for light with other trees or babassus the population structure could be due to different times of residence in the different stages the prolonged juvenile phase of trees is obviously a central component of their life strategy brunner and ove 2004 have suggested a different mechanism mainly related to chromatin based repression to explain this prolongation one hypothesis is that epigenetic mechanisms play a central role in the regulation of the tree phases bräutigam et al 2013 have explored the epigenetic variation and adaptive capacity of plant species including forest trees considered in this way the prolonged juvenile phase might be a contributory strategy to the babassu s ability to colonize or persist in pastures 4 4 other biological information fruiting and sprouting the fruiting and sprouting parts of the model were simplifications of the complex reality nevertheless rate estimation of fruit production 55 and sprouting 12 exhibited good statistical properties and these estimations were enriched by the bayesian learning period we suggest that these processes fruiting and sprouting remained unchanged during the two periods of observation fruiting the mean estimate values the standard error of the fruiting rate ϕ were 0 52 0 10 for 2013 and 0 54 0 07 for 2014 the estimation for 2014 was performed with an informative prior using a bayesian learning approach the posterior of the first period was used as the prior for the second period biologically speaking these values indicate that a little more than fifty percent of the adult palm trees contribute annually to the fruiting process the mean estimate values the standard error of the number of fruits per palm tree μ respectively were 313 50 for 2013 and 317 48 for 2014 sprouting the mean value estimates for the sprouting probability λ were approximately 0 12 for both periods with standard error of 0 005 for the first period 2013 2014 and 0 004 for the second period 2014 2015 λ represents the probability that a fruit produced in year t becomes a seedling stage 1 in the next year t 1 4 5 bayesian learning fruiting sprouting the estimation for the first period 2013 2014 was performed with a non informative prior a flat distribution was used as illustrated in blue for the fruiting rate ϕ beta a b 1 5 fig 7 a the distribution obtained a posteriori in red was concentrated on the estimated mean value of 54 this figure illustrated the bayesian learning approach with the evolution between the flat distribution non informative prior to the conditional distribution knowledge of the information provided by the data this informative distribution in red fig 7a obtained during the first period of observation was then used as the prior in blue fig 7b for estimation of the fruiting rate during the second period of observation 2014 2015 again the distribution obtained a posteriori in red exhibited a concentration around the same mean estimated value bayesian learning helped to increase the precision of the estimation for the fruiting rate we observed similar figures for the sprouting rate and the number of fruits per palm tree concerning transition survival probabilities this learning approach was not so fruitful because of important variability fluctuation between the two periods of observation mainly during the early stages 1 and 2 5 conclusion and perspectives to better understand the babassu population dynamics in pastures we used a bayesian hierarchical matrix model this model with two levels of hierarchy studied area in benfica and transect allowed a more reliable estimation of the population dynamics because information is shared between transects to improve the estimation at the level of the studied area and then retrospectively at the transect level this is a significant improvement over direct empirical estimations using small sample sizes with missing data and an unbalanced design fontez and cavalli 2014 in our case the observed stages in transects were unbalanced as shown in fig 4 the model did not reveal unobserved empirical facts but provided a direct and reliable estimation at the level of the studied area this model enabled us to demonstrate a bottleneck at stage 3 in the population dynamics the origin of this bottleneck is not known but was not due to mortality low values the bottleneck between stages 3 and 4 has significant consequences for the population dynamics of babassu but in the present state of knowledge provided by the model it is difficult to specify the exact consequences of this bottleneck in fact two extreme cases can occur 1 all the palms have an equal probability of passing from stage 3 to stage 4 each year 2 only a portion of the palm trees are able to undergo this transition in the first case all the palm trees are impacted by the bottleneck and a rough estimation of the period in stage 3 with a geometrical model could be π 3 4 1 π 3 3 2 0 005 1 0 99 2 50 years this bottleneck dramatically raised the age at which a palm tree becomes an adult this result contradicts information from experiments some palm trees became adults only after 10 12 years in the second case a fraction of individuals f can successfully transit and a fraction 1 f will never transit therefore π 3 4 is a compromise a mean value between those two kinds of palm trees the very low value estimated for π 3 4 could be due to this fraction 1 f that never transited according to barot et al 2005 fraction f that transits is probably composed of juvenile with a high survival and growth rate to be quickly recruited into the adult stage and hence representative of a small percentage of the population for this kind of juvenile using a geometrical model we deduced the expected time spent in the stages that are above soil and observable 4 6 using estimates presented in table 6 we obtained 3 68 4 16 for stage 4 and 6 22 7 1 for stage 5 for a total sum of these stages of 9 9 to 11 3 years in the field the people interviewed suggested 10 to 12 years if we consider the stages that are above the soil and observable 4 6 the predictions are coherent with our model estimations the reality is undoubtedly between these two extreme cases to arbitrate between these two hypotheses follow up sequences should be available in the future which will soon be possible as new surveys are underway concerning the second case one possible explanation could be the high genetic variability of the babassu which is a wild plant thus important genetic environment interactions may be involved a genetic difference for the f fraction of successful babassu is coherent with the observed increase in density in stage 3 over the years at the population level clearing of the forest and the use of fire to clear brush have resulted in a population bottleneck following rapp and wendel 2005 these anthropic actions may have created genomic stress leading to the induction of epigenetic phenomena from an epigenetic perspective a population bottleneck leads to a decrease in genetic diversity but an increase in phenotypic variability in fact we observed a great density variability between pieces of land which could be due to phenotypic variability see for example the probability of transition from stage 2 to 3 in the supplementary material based on our study of very local and limited points of observation in pará it is impossible to comment further without additional research another explanation could be the past history of each plant new sequences would make it possible to determine for an individual whether the past history of the passages from stage 1 to stage 2 and stage 2 to stage 3 affected the probability of passage from stage 3 to stage 4 in open environments such as pastureland the number of seedlings per fruit is lower for babassu mitja and ferraz 2001 in the present work we highlighted a high and year dependent mortality rate at stage 1 and a bottleneck at stage 3 these three points highlight a new perspective maybe in contradiction with the common idea that the babassu is an invasive species barot et al 2005 these three points in conjunction with harvesting might explain the negative evolution of density in pastures observed in mitja et al 2018 and the need for reliable preventive scientific information to help manage babassu population dynamics in pastures our model could be extended to a larger scale region country by incorporating palm density information from high spatial resolution satellite images dos santos et al 2017 however to achieve the sustainable management of the species a more comprehensive study of the mechanisms underlying the low transition rate between stage 3 to 4 is needed some factors such as competition for light and nutrients with fodder plants as well as information on the genetic diversity or a potential epigenetic mechanism should first be addressed author s contributions nikolay

25080,the babassu palm tree attalea speciosa mart ex spreng is an endemic species of amazon forests and has social and economical impact utility deforestation highlights this palm tree in anthropogenic open areas pastures and cultivated fields simultaneously knowledge concerning the sustainable functioning of the species within these manmade environments is sorely lacking its life cycle is not well known and its population dynamics remains unstudied in this study our objective was to generate a model of the population dynamics of the babassu palm tree validated by in situ analysis to understand how babassu a forest species adapts to pastureland and under certain conditions becomes invasive we propose a random matrix model with aggregated variables based on the biological stages of the species as the input the probabilities of the between stage transition matrix were modelled using a dirichlet multinomial model with a hierarchy taking geographical organization i e transect level into account the integration of prior information was formulated through a bayesian approach this bayesian hierarchical matrix model enabled us to demonstrate a bottleneck in the population dynamics and a high year dependent mortality rate at an early stage keywords mathematical modelling bayesian statistics population dynamics babassu palm tree 1 introduction the primary threat to primary forests long before climate change is human action jha 2010 the majority of plant species that grow in tropical rainforests do not resist land use change at the time of cultivation fearnside 2005 barlow et al 2016 some other tree and palm species are resilient anthelme et al 2011 norden et al 2009 the babassu palm tree attalea speciosa mart ex spreng which can reach 30 m height is endemic to the south american amazonian forest it is sometimes present in agrosystems installed following clearing of the primary forest while many other woody species have disappeared mitja et al 2018 dos santos and mitja 2011 it persists years later in secondary forests resulting from the abandonment of crops and pastures and it can even become invasive and hinder the development of cultivated species while a portion of the population wants to eliminate it another part wants to maintain it because of its multiple uses araújo and lopes 2012 some plot scale work has demonstrated higher densities of adult babassu in pastures than in the original forest anderson 1983 campos et al 2017 while other work has shown the opposite barot et al 2005 a territory wide study of the pa benfica smallholder farming community revealed this variability in the density of babassu cauliflower palms in primary forests as well as in pastures and secondary forests in these environments the few plots with very high densities are only observed in pastures or secondary forests mitja et al 2018 in contrast because the number of plots without cauliflower babassu is higher in pastures the average babassu density in the study area is lower in pastures than in secondary or primary forests mitja et al 2018 thus babassu has the potential to invade agrosystems even if this does not occur systematically in fact there is a high variability of the palm density in pastures potentially that is related to the initial density in the forest depending on the cultivation practices of farmers who can conserve or eliminate palm trees mitja et al 2018 in pastures babassu are influenced by factors such as sun exposure mitja and ferraz 2001 anderson et al 1991 burning chemical or manual cleaning of plots competition with forage grasses burial of fruit in the soil and clear cutting these factors sometimes act in a contradictory way on fruits seedlings and young individuals and adults and can counteract the high resilience of this species at certain stages mitja et al 2018 in our study context the studied pastures did not undergo significant anthropogenic actions such as chemical cleaning or clear cutting to explain this ability of babassu to remain on pasture after forest clearing the possibility of natural biological diversity within babassus diversity of genetic epigenetic origins or more generally due to genetic interaction with the environment cannot be excluded bräutigam et al 2013 richards et al 2017 although we do not currently have data to support these assumptions previous works focusing on all babassu individuals from seedlings to adults have examined the life cycle divided into ontogenic stages three stages for campos et al 2017 four stages for anderson 1983 five stages for barot et al 2005 six stages for dos santos et al 2017 in the latter case which concerns our field of study the life cycle was divided into a seedling stage four stages of young individuals and an adult stage stages 1 2 and 3 are characterized by a rosette configuration and a buried terminal bud stage 4 corresponds to the presence of the terminal bud on the soil surface protected by the leaf sheaths stage 5 last young stage corresponds to individuals with a terminal bud above ground that is very often still protected by the leaf sheath stage 6 is the adult stage most often ascertained by a free stripe considering the stages some authors have studied the population structure using a single one shot measure barot et al 2005 campos et al 2017 barot et al 2005 obtained an inverted j shaped curve for the primary tropical forest characteristics of natural unharvested populations hall and bawa 1993 while in pastures this structure was found to be different with a lower seedling density these latter results have not been verified by studies by campos et al 2017 and anderson 1983 who showed an inverted j curve not only for primary forest but also for pastures however the accepted interpretation that species with inverted j population structures are in equilibrium while those with a small number of young stages would correspond to declining populations has been questioned indeed the survival of the plant population would depend more on the growth rate of individuals in the various stages condit et al 1998 which if rapid can maintain a sufficient density of adults to determine whether the babassu will persist in this newly set up farmland in the long term it will be necessary to assess the growth rate and thus monitor the evolution of the population over time johnson et al 1994 by studying the population dynamics through periodic measurements over the long term recently individual based models have received great interest and have been used to predict population dynamics and the effects of management strategies buckley et al 2003 following the ideas of uchmaski and grimm 1996 and lomnicki 1999 the interest in individual based models is to take the individual interactions competition and the resource dynamics explicitly into account in our case pastureland is a stable and non limited resource environment where competition between trees is negligible an individual based model could be interesting to ascertain the time spent at each stage of development and to define trajectories but as the data are from a three year experiment the results may not be sufficiently extensive to be reliable because of the very low transition rates often observed between some stages a longer observation period would be necessary to be of use the population dynamics models appear to offer a simpler and better adapted framework for our study zuidema and zagt 2000 two components must be taken into account when modelling the ecological process and the observation process in our context the ecological process describes variation in abundance over transects and time two periods of measurement demographic models represent a standard approach for abundance data that provides insight into population growth caswell 1989 deterministic matrix models have been used for trees in the following articles bullock 1980 pinero et al 1984 enright and watson 1992 pinard 1993 olmsted and alvarez buylla 1995 barot et al 2000 holm et al 2008 and also guarín and del valle 2014 demographic models include a deterministic part but stochastic elements can be added to accommodate any sources of variability transects time individuals that affect the observations to take into account the geographical structure of our data palm trees are observed on different transects thus defining the hierarchical model this approach was advocated by clark 2003 who insists that variability associated with space time and among individuals who are not accommodated by demographic models can make parameter estimates and growth rate predictions unrealistic stochastic models can be defined in different ways in the method defined by tuljapurkar and caswell 1997 the stochastic matrix involves elasticity and stochasticity of the vital rate in our case we did not focus on one parameter only but on a global approach that allows one to deal with broader issues and topics from different fields economy social impact biology technical aspect of the management and so on ipm integrated population models is another possible approach which is also known as hierarchical or state space models eacker et al 2017 schaub and abadi 2011 more generally than ipm the bayesian hierarchical model is well adapted and sufficiently flexible to incorporate hierarchical data and expert knowledge hobbs and hooten 2015 it can be adjusted over successive years of observation and updated over time posterior estimation is used from the first year as prior information for the second year estimation and so on as suggested by parent and rivot 2012 to understand how babassu which is a forest species adapts to grazing and under certain conditions becomes invasive this study proposes to develop a population dynamics model that does not currently exist for this species this model will be a hierarchical stochastic matrix population model in the bayesian framework beyond the knowledge produced this model can be used in future species management projects to make forecasts this article covers the following topics 1 materials provides a description of the biology of the babassu as well as a description of the study site and of the sampling 2 model provides a comprehensive description of all aspects of the modelling matrix model hierarchy and bayesian framework 3 results and discussion provides comments on the model validation and on population dynamics and the existence of a bottleneck these sections are followed by a global conclusion 2 materials 2 1 biology of babassu in pastures the babassu life cycle can be organized in biological stages of development six stages have been defined varying from the seedling to the adult palm tree fig 1 see mitja et al 2019 for more details in addition the reproductive stage and fructification of the babassu has been studied by barot et al 2005 and anderson et al 1991 providing knowledge for understanding the reproductive process and recruitment in our modelling 2 2 study site our data was collected over three years of field monitoring from 2013 to 2015 this monitoring was carried out on the benfica agriculture installation project projeto de assentamento site which is located in the brazilian state of pará fig 2 this territory is located within the amazonian rain forest on the territory of the itupiranga municipality and covers 10 026 ha the shape of benfica is irregular and lies within a quadrilateral space formed by the straight line connection at the coordinates 05 12 20 s latitude 05 20 40 s latitude and 49 48 00 w longitude 49 56 40 w longitude the particularity of this site is that it includes man made spaces that since 1989 have been progressively colonized by one thousand people sampaio 2008 2 3 field sampling the fieldwork protocol was developed in early 2012 seven surface areas of pastureland were designated for this research project within each piece of land two to three transects linear paths were defined and visibly marked out on the ground dos santos et al 2017 we obtained the total number of seventeen transects from which we collected data regarding growth sprouting and fruiting processes in addition we also used seven supplementary transects to obtain more data about the growth process especially for stages 5 and 6 table 1 the counting and marking of all individuals at all six stages of development was performed within these transects in 2013 2987 palm trees of all stages were identified in 2014 and 2015 we surveyed the same palm trees to which we respectively added 471 and 482 newly recruited individuals of stage 1 table 2 3 model the modelling was constructed based on three distinct experimental data sets see flowchart fig 3 that were observed during two observation periods one in 2013 2014 and one in 2014 2015 on 17 or 24 transects we decided to infer three independent models based on three different observational units for the following reasons the transition survival model was our main concern for answering demographic questions such as the existence of a bottleneck or a reverse j shape curve the survey was constructed for that purpose the sample land was chosen to be representative of the different ages of pasture in para the 24 transects were chosen in order to sample a sufficient number of babassu palm trees in different stages for the transition survival study including 7 very specific transects focusing on old babassu palm trees stage 5 and 6 the fruiting and sprouting processes were less precisely observed and only on the 17 transects we wanted to avoid error propagation of the measurement or modelling approximations to the transition survival modelling therefore we decided to construct independent fruiting and sprouting models moreover estimation of these models on the 17 transects might not be adapted to the 7 specific transects of older palm trees however even if the three models were independently estimated they could be combined to simulate a life cycle the survey did not focus on the seed dispersal even if it exists see mitja and ferraz 2001 for more detailed or the germination no information was collected on the germination of fruits or seedlings no information was available for outside the transects linear paths without this information it was not possible to fit and use seed dispersal models such as the one proposed by clark et al 1999 localization of adult palm trees around or adjacent to the transect would be necessary to achieve such modelling and the new recruits were considered to be of unknown origin brief description of the three independent models a demographic model with two levels transect studied area in benfica was defined the observation were performed at an individual level but the palm trees were considered to be independent and the observations were pooled at the transect level for each stage demographic stochasticity was modelled with hierarchical dirichlet prior and multinomial likelihood laws the annual number of fruits from a palm tree was modelled with a lognormal distribution to restrict them to positive values and to maintain flexibility in the meantime a non conjugated hierarchical model is used to model the annual mean number of fruits per palm tree across the studied area level normal prior in addition to the observation individual level lognormal likelihood this model is conditional on the probability that a palm tree can have fruits this probability is modelled with a classical conjugate beta binomial distribution we used a classical conjugate beta binomial distribution to model the probability of sprouting across the studied area recall that the sprouting process was observed at the transect level from a number of pooled observed fruits including contribution from babassu palm trees besides along and outside the transect 3 1 hierarchy the ecological process was observed on transects belonging to the designated area of land only two levels were considered for the transition survival process the transect and the whole studied area in benfica moreover our estimation concerning the probability of transition between stages see fig 4 did not exhibit any structure at the level of the farmer s piece of land each piece of land is separated by a red line no spatial structure was observed except for the transition from stage 2 to stage 3 where a link with spatial coordinates might be possible see appendix and discussion but it was difficult to estimate or ensure with our dataset therefore we preferred to employ a multilevel model using the level of the transects and of the whole studied area in benfica 3 2 observation process and definition of the observed variables survival transition process observations were performed on 17 7 for stages 5 and 6 transects see table 1 for transect l we observed the total number of plants in stage i at year t 1 n i t 1 l we also observed the number of survivors at year t in stage i n i t l this number was the sum of the observed number of survivors that remained in this stage denoted as s i i t l and of the observed number of survivors from stage i 1 who had moved to stage i denoted as s i 1 i t l n i t l s i i t l s i 1 i t l moreover in a given transect l at time t the number of deaths among those in stage i was the total number of plants in stage i from the previous year minus the number of survivors from the previous year that remained in stage i minus the survivors from the previous year that changed stages dead i t l n i t 1 l s i i t l s i i 1 t l from these observations we could infer proportions for each transect l we assumed that the expected proportions remained constant over time and denoted π i i l as the expected proportion of plants that remained at the same stage i π i i 1 l as the expected proportion moving from stage i to the next stage i 1 and 1 π i i l π i i 1 l as the expected mortality proportion in stage i these three parameters allowed us to define a categorical distribution for each transect l π i l π i i l π i i 1 l 1 π i i l π i i 1 l we also defined a categorical distribution at the level of the whole studied area π i π i i π i i 1 1 π i i π i i 1 no observations performed at this level therefore π i i and π i i 1 are latent variables fruiting and sprouting processes first the fruit production per palm tree was observed on the 17 transects for each palm tree in stage 6 the reproduction process begins with the definition of the sexual state no inflorescence male or female inflorescence or both inflorescences the babassu palm tree has a complex reproductive process that is not well understood and has not been well measured the female and male inflorescences change over undefined periods of time therefore the reproductive process has been simplified and resumed with the observed reproductive state variable u j t l which indicates the presence of fruits at year t on palm tree j from transect l this variable was coded as 1 when fruits were present and 0 if they were not we assumed that the expected proportion ϕ of palm trees of stage 6 in a reproductive state 1 was constant over time and was common to all transects when a palm tree j of year t 1 was in a reproductive state 1 its number of fruits denoted fruits j t 1 l was the sum of the observed number of fruits on the palm tree and on the ground immediately under the palm tree this observation was performed directly in the field but also validated later by using photography of the palm tree we approximated fruit observations using a normal distribution with a mean parameter μ and a variance parameter σ 2 next the seedlings were not observed outside the transect but only the number of recruited seedlings in stage one per transect l and per year t was measured in the field we denoted this variable r t l but the origin of these new palm trees was unknown they could represent fruit from an adult palm tree stage 6 adjacent to the transect therefore the total number of fruits on transect l year t 1 was counted regardless of their origin and we denoted this variable totalf t 1 l we assumed that the recruitment occurred only in the first stage and that the expected proportion of fruit providing a new palm tree in one year was constant over time and was common to all transects we denoted this parameter λ remark all variables were directly measured observed on the ground by expert biologists we assumed that there were no errors and our observation process was identity 3 3 lefkovitch matrices for the ecological process six growth stages have been defined for babassu mitja et al 2019 vector n t l n 1 t l n 6 t l is the state vector

transect level with a survival transition matrix following caswell 2001 the model must take into account the demographic stochasticity and hierarchy integration of different kinds sources of variability was performed in a bayesian framework in this framework all parameters except σ 2 were considered as random variables see the dag directed acyclic graph fig 5 for details this parameter was fixed in the observation in an empirical bayes approach to ensure mcmc converged because we omitted the observation process error lack of measurements allowing estimation of the observation error apart from the variability in the number of fruits and also due to the very small sample size three independent bayesian sub models were defined survival transition for the six stages according to buckland et al 2007 demographic stochasticity is modelled with multinomial laws extension of the binomial law to a context with more than two possibilities evolution from year t 1 to year t of the six

preceding model we adapted a hierarchical dirichlet distribution from cowans 2004 cowans proposed a hierarchical dirichlet document model where each document transect for us is modelled using a multinomial distribution whose parameters are given a dirichlet prior the mean value of the dirichlet prior is itself assumed to be random and given a dirichlet hyperprior this kind of modelling with dirichlet priors and dirichlet hyperpriors is used for topic models wallach et al 2009 or information retrieval from documents haffari and teh 2009 hierarchical dirichlet distribution to add to the

transects weights i of the dirichlet hyperprior were calibrated with both observed proportions as in an empirical bayes approach and uniform distribution following cowans 2004 idea to test the sensitivity of the model to this hyperprior the latent variable η i could be considered to be a size effect which indicated the level of confidence in the realization of the latent vector π i fruiting

dispersion and add explicitly to the population latent variable μ the mean annual number of fruits inferred at the level of the studied area the lognormal distribution provided the best fit our data see supplementary materials fig 10 next we assumed that the palm trees in stage 6 shared the same parameter of fruiting ϕ 5 u j t 1 l bernoulli ϕ to add to the hierarchy allowing the sharing of

informative versus non informative priors in a learning approach estimation based on the first year of observation was performed according to helser et al 2012 since no study to date has provided prior information on babassu growth or reproduction processes in the babassu environment we endorsed the approach of smith and wakefield 1994 who suggest that priors should be non informative to ensure that the likelihood dominates the prior the hyperparameters characterizing the distribution of π i η i ϕ λ and μ were chosen to provide a prior that was as flat and non informative as possible then in a learning approach the value of the hyperparameters weights i was set to the posterior estimates of π i we compared the estimation based on the second year of observation obtained with each set of hyperparameters this comparison allowed us to study the sensitivity of the model and its stability over the years model validation the predictive posterior distribution can be used to check whether the model is consistent with the observed data gelman et al 1996 measurement y obs is the observed value and y rep is a replicate sampled from the predictive posterior p y rep θ p θ data dθ steinbakk and storvik 2009 posterior p values of approximately 0 5 indicate that the distributions of replicated and actual data are close while values near zero or one indicate a discrepancy between them moreover validation was possible by leaving out 25 of the transects for the second year of observation 2014 2015 the posterior population estimate π i was then used to predict the total expected number of survivors s i i s i i 1 dead i of the omitted transects the total number per stage of the omitted transects was considered to be consistent with a prediction at the level of the studied area computation with r and jags jags which uses the dialect of bugs lunn et al 2000 2013 plummer 2003 was used to fit the model to the data with the package rjags the estimates of parameters were evaluated based on 200 000 samples after 50 000 burn in samples thinning to one draw for each sample by mcmc simulation of the joint posterior distribution the mcmc inference samples analysis was processed with the coda package plummer et al 2006 convergence diagnostics consisted of visuals traces and autocorrelations and statistical calculations using the test of gelman et al 2003 based on gelman and rubin 1999 for all variables in the model the gelman criteria of between chain variance over within chain variance converged into one more information on the convergence diagnosis and on the script of the model are available in the supplementary materials 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation we focused the validation analysis on the survival transition matrix at the level of the studied area the validation concerned the second year of observation 2014 2015 with the informative prior first we computed the posterior predictive p value for estimation of the survival transition probabilities obtained for the second year of observation 2014 2015 and with the informative prior see table 4 when the ppp value was much smaller than 0 5 e g 0 or 0 1 then the probability simulated with the model was less variable than the observed probability and the model failed to reproduce the variability of the data thus the model underestimated the data variability we imputed this phenomenon as a higher variability observed in the data during 2014 2015 than during 2013 2014 which may indicate a year effect a longer time series of observation may well be needed to define an informative prior as suggested by bierzychudek 1999 next we checked the adequacy of the model with the cross validation approach see table 5 for the second year of observation 2014 2015 and with the informative prior the young stages namely one and two showed a poor prediction as the observed values were not in the 95 credible interval of the prediction for all variables again this mismatch for the young stages was a result of the extreme variability observed in the field for the dynamics of the young during the two periods of observation 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 eventually the learning approach of using the posterior of the first period 2013 2014 to calibrate the prior of the second period 2014 2015 was not satisfactory for the young stage namely 1 and 2 4 2 survival and transition between states identification of a bottleneck table 6 summarizes the estimates of the survival transition probabilities for both periods 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 the dynamic can be divided into two parts before compared with after stage 3 mortality was significantly elevated 5 to 27 the first stage exhibited a high year variability as underlined in the model validation section this competition disappeared at a later stage of palm tree growth the death probability for the first stage was estimated at 12 for the first period and 27 for the second period these values were both lower than the estimate of 38 published by anderson 1983 and anderson and balick 1988 concerning another experiment in brazil after stage 3 the estimates were not sensitive to the prior or the year effect the mortality rates were lower and difficult to estimate with small sample sizes except for the transition between stage 3 and stage 4 lower than 1 the probability of transitions were significant 10 to 28 hence these results showed a clear bottleneck at stage 3 due to its extremely low probability the transition between stage 3 and 4 had a large impact on the needed time for a babassu to reach the adult stage 6 thus a supplementary sampling effort should be performed for stages 3 and 4 to better estimate and understand this transition stage 3 is critical in the biology of the babassu because the palm terminal bud rises from the ground during this stage 4 3 link between the bottleneck and population structure finally we observed a bottleneck at the end of stage 3 in pastures this bottleneck was observed in a primary forest by barot et al 2005 moreover a comparison of our bar plot of densities by stage see fig 6 revealed a shape similar to barot et al 2005 for stages 1 to 3 corresponding to els sls and juv1 respectively in their article however in the next stage situated after the bottleneck the densities are collapsed toward zero in our case we expected a priori high densities in all young stages for this palm species which is considered to be an invasive plant species in pastures barot et al 2005 a pasture is an open field environment with less competition for light or with other species in open areas the number of germinations per fruit is lower but growth in stage 1 is more rapid mitja and ferraz 2001 fig 6 shows an increase in density in stage 3 over the time in addition the mortality rates for stages 3 to 6 were very low during this period therefore we may assume that the observed bottleneck was due to the low transition rate from stage 3 to stage 4 multiple causes could have contributed or explained this low transition first competition for light and nutrients with fodder plants or introduced grasses might not be negligible in the younger stages as stated in the article by sankaran et al 2004 tree grass coexistence in savannas competition based models or demographic bottleneck models or a mixture of the two could explain the population structure of babassu in the pasture second the management of the pasture with human intervention has an impact on what is believed to be an appropriate density of babassu palm trees for cattle shelter runk 1998 observed this kind of human intervention in the regulation of ivory palm tree where the lack of juveniles to the sub adult stage appears to be a population bottleneck in managed stands limiting the number of adults however during the period of our study management was limited to an annual clearing to respect our research on the population dynamics and estimation of the natural mortality annual clearing of pasture plots by cutting leaves from stages 2 to 4 and sometimes even stage 5 can delay the transition between stages because the palm tree must reinvest in the production of new leaves mitja et al 2018 third the impact of cattle for example trampling grazing might provide an explanation for a demographic bottleneck model the terminal meristem of the plant is below ground until stage 3 and the plant can regenerate even if the aerial part is damaged grazed etc these non lethal actions as we estimated a very low mortality in stage 3 might delay the transition and thus create a bottleneck for the transition from stage 3 to stage 4 fourth none of these suggestions explain why this bottleneck or at least a reverse j shaped curve with a lower density in stage 4 was observed in primary rain forests in addition to the competition for light with other trees or babassus the population structure could be due to different times of residence in the different stages the prolonged juvenile phase of trees is obviously a central component of their life strategy brunner and ove 2004 have suggested a different mechanism mainly related to chromatin based repression to explain this prolongation one hypothesis is that epigenetic mechanisms play a central role in the regulation of the tree phases bräutigam et al 2013 have explored the epigenetic variation and adaptive capacity of plant species including forest trees considered in this way the prolonged juvenile phase might be a contributory strategy to the babassu s ability to colonize or persist in pastures 4 4 other biological information fruiting and sprouting the fruiting and sprouting parts of the model were simplifications of the complex reality nevertheless rate estimation of fruit production 55 and sprouting 12 exhibited good statistical properties and these estimations were enriched by the bayesian learning period we suggest that these processes fruiting and sprouting remained unchanged during the two periods of observation fruiting the mean estimate values the standard error of the fruiting rate ϕ were 0 52 0 10 for 2013 and 0 54 0 07 for 2014 the estimation for 2014 was performed with an informative prior using a bayesian learning approach the posterior of the first period was used as the prior for the second period biologically speaking these values indicate that a little more than fifty percent of the adult palm trees contribute annually to the fruiting process the mean estimate values the standard error of the number of fruits per palm tree μ respectively were 313 50 for 2013 and 317 48 for 2014 sprouting the mean value estimates for the sprouting probability λ were approximately 0 12 for both periods with standard error of 0 005 for the first period 2013 2014 and 0 004 for the second period 2014 2015 λ represents the probability that a fruit produced in year t becomes a seedling stage 1 in the next year t 1 4 5 bayesian learning fruiting sprouting the estimation for the first period 2013 2014 was performed with a non informative prior a flat distribution was used as illustrated in blue for the fruiting rate ϕ beta a b 1 5 fig 7 a the distribution obtained a posteriori in red was concentrated on the estimated mean value of 54 this figure illustrated the bayesian learning approach with the evolution between the flat distribution non informative prior to the conditional distribution knowledge of the information provided by the data this informative distribution in red fig 7a obtained during the first period of observation was then used as the prior in blue fig 7b for estimation of the fruiting rate during the second period of observation 2014 2015 again the distribution obtained a posteriori in red exhibited a concentration around the same mean estimated value bayesian learning helped to increase the precision of the estimation for the fruiting rate we observed similar figures for the sprouting rate and the number of fruits per palm tree concerning transition survival probabilities this learning approach was not so fruitful because of important variability fluctuation between the two periods of observation mainly during the early stages 1 and 2 5 conclusion and perspectives to better understand the babassu population dynamics in pastures we used a bayesian hierarchical matrix model this model with two levels of hierarchy studied area in benfica and transect allowed a more reliable estimation of the population dynamics because information is shared between transects to improve the estimation at the level of the studied area and then retrospectively at the transect level this is a significant improvement over direct empirical estimations using small sample sizes with missing data and an unbalanced design fontez and cavalli 2014 in our case the observed stages in transects were unbalanced as shown in fig 4 the model did not reveal unobserved empirical facts but provided a direct and reliable estimation at the level of the studied area this model enabled us to demonstrate a bottleneck at stage 3 in the population dynamics the origin of this bottleneck is not known but was not due to mortality low values the bottleneck between stages 3 and 4 has significant consequences for the population dynamics of babassu but in the present state of knowledge provided by the model it is difficult to specify the exact consequences of this bottleneck in fact two extreme cases can occur 1 all the palms have an equal probability of passing from stage 3 to stage 4 each year 2 only a portion of the palm trees are able to undergo this transition in the first case all the palm trees are impacted by the bottleneck and a rough estimation of the period in stage 3 with a geometrical model could be π 3 4 1 π 3 3 2 0 005 1 0 99 2 50 years this bottleneck dramatically raised the age at which a palm tree becomes an adult this result contradicts information from experiments some palm trees became adults only after 10 12 years in the second case a fraction of individuals f can successfully transit and a fraction 1 f will never transit therefore π 3 4 is a compromise a mean value between those two kinds of palm trees the very low value estimated for π 3 4 could be due to this fraction 1 f that never transited according to barot et al 2005 fraction f that transits is probably composed of juvenile with a high survival and growth rate to be quickly recruited into the adult stage and hence representative of a small percentage of the population for this kind of juvenile using a geometrical model we deduced the expected time spent in the stages that are above soil and observable 4 6 using estimates presented in table 6 we obtained 3 68 4 16 for stage 4 and 6 22 7 1 for stage 5 for a total sum of these stages of 9 9 to 11 3 years in the field the people interviewed suggested 10 to 12 years if we consider the stages that are above the soil and observable 4 6 the predictions are coherent with our model estimations the reality is undoubtedly between these two extreme cases to arbitrate between these two hypotheses follow up sequences should be available in the future which will soon be possible as new surveys are underway concerning the second case one possible explanation could be the high genetic variability of the babassu which is a wild plant thus important genetic environment interactions may be involved a genetic difference for the f fraction of successful babassu is coherent with the observed increase in density in stage 3 over the years at the population level clearing of the forest and the use of fire to clear brush have resulted in a population bottleneck following rapp and wendel 2005 these anthropic actions may have created genomic stress leading to the induction of epigenetic phenomena from an epigenetic perspective a population bottleneck leads to a decrease in genetic diversity but an increase in phenotypic variability in fact we observed a great density variability between pieces of land which could be due to phenotypic variability see for example the probability of transition from stage 2 to 3 in the supplementary material based on our study of very local and limited points of observation in pará it is impossible to comment further without additional research another explanation could be the past history of each plant new sequences would make it possible to determine for an individual whether the past history of the passages from stage 1 to stage 2 and stage 2 to stage 3 affected the probability of passage from stage 3 to stage 4 in open environments such as pastureland the number of seedlings per fruit is lower for babassu mitja and ferraz 2001 in the present work we highlighted a high and year dependent mortality rate at stage 1 and a bottleneck at stage 3 these three points highlight a new perspective maybe in contradiction with the common idea that the babassu is an invasive species barot et al 2005 these three points in conjunction with harvesting might explain the negative evolution of density in pastures observed in mitja et al 2018 and the need for reliable preventive scientific information to help manage babassu population dynamics in pastures our model could be extended to a larger scale region country by incorporating palm density information from high spatial resolution satellite images dos santos et al 2017 however to achieve the sustainable management of the species a more comprehensive study of the mechanisms underlying the low transition rate between stage 3 to 4 is needed some factors such as competition for light and nutrients with fodder plants as well as information on the genetic diversity or a potential epigenetic mechanism should first be addressed author s contributions nikolay

25081,due to its crucial role in the ecosystem phytoplankton is incorporated in marine ecosystem models most models however neglect the evolutionary potential of phytoplankton previous resurrection experiments with a spring bloom dinoflagellate suggest that the past century of global warming has caused an adaptive response in an important life cycle trait the encystment rate here based on this resurrection case study we apply an advanced ecosystem model including selection and mutation to test whether a temperature increase could induce a change in encystment in line with the findings from resurrection experiments our results show that in warmer waters strains with a lower encystment rate benefit over those with a higher encystment rate the magnitude of change in encystment rate is however only reproduced if additional factors like eutrophication and a cyst mortality that increases with temperature are considered by using this ecosystem model including selection and mutation we demonstrate that ecosystem modeling represents a powerful approach to investigate the adaptive potential of phytoplankton keywords ecosystem model evolution global warming life cycle living sediment archives phytoplankton 1 introduction phytoplankton organisms represent the base of the marine food web they are an important component of biogeochemical cycles hutchins and fu 2017 and they even feed back on ocean physics sathyendranath et al 1991 kahru et al 1993 joehnk et al 2008 hense et al 2017 due to the importance of phytoplankton for the ecosystem they are explicitly considered in marine ecosystem models bruggeman and kooijman 2007 follows et al 2007 steinacher et al 2010 bopp et al 2013 dutkiewicz et al 2015 laufkötter et al 2015 owing to their large population sizes and short generation times phytoplankton have a high potential to rapidly adapt to environmental changes despite the growing body of research demonstrating this high evolutionary potential of phytoplankton it is so far disregarded in the vast majority of ecosystem models here we apply an advanced ecosystem model which allows for evolution by selection and mutation to investigate how phytoplankton may adapt to global warming through changes in a life cycle trait the high evolutionary potential of phytoplankton organisms has been previously described in many experimental evolution studies e g collins and bell 2004 lohbeck et al 2012 schaum et al 2018 there is also a number of conceptual and modelling studies that include evolutionary aspects one example focuses on thermal adaptation of phytoplankton in the global ocean grimaud et al 2015 denman 2017 simulates observed changes in the growth rate of the phytoplankton emiliania huxleyi under different temperature conditions assuming random mutations as well as plasticity collins 2016 explains with an individual based model how cellular damage and repair influence the change in cell division rates in phytoplankton under improved environmental conditions considering an explicit trade off of resource allocation between growth and repair these studies grimaud et al 2015 denman 2017 collins 2016 apply the theoretical knowledge to the real world but do not account for ecosystem dynamics apart from these more conceptual studies on phytoplankton evolution some ecosystem modeling studies exist which allow for mutation in form of trait diffusion mechanisms here mutation in trait values is described as a diffusion process over generations previous ecosystem models that consider mutation in form of trait diffusion focused on understanding species coexistence within a modeling framework simulating stable chemostat environmental conditions as well as fluctuating environmental conditions without a trend kremer and klausmeier 2013 merico et al 2014 smith et al 2016 sauterey et al 2017 only recently it was demonstrated that this modeling concept for mutation can also be applied to study adaptation to changing environmental conditions beckmann et al 2019 however this model concept has not been applied to real data yet in contrast to these modeling studies which consider evolution by mutation and selection there are numerous ecosystem models which prescribe functional groups and or strains with fixed traits and only allow for selection among those traits follows et al 2007 steinacher et al 2010 bopp et al 2013 dutkiewicz et al 2015 laufkötter et al 2015 bruggeman and kooijman 2007 regard trait distribution and its changes by immigration but also ignore evolutionary changes by mutation thus none of the above mentioned ecosystem models has applied a mutation selection model to real data to investigate phytoplankton adaptation to changing environmental conditions lately life cycle trait changes were detected in resurrected phytoplankton resting stages from the sediment in the gulf of finland n baltic sea hinners et al 2017 over the past hundred years the temperature in the gulf of finland has increased significantly by 0 3 c per decade laakso et al 2018 temperature tolerance experiments with revived strains of the spring bloom dinoflagellate apocalathium malmogiense suggest that in consequence of increasing temperatures changes in resting stage formation encystment have already occurred the encystment rate of recent strains was almost 5 times lower compared to the encystment rate of historic 100 years old strains hinners et al 2017 encystment is an annually occurring life cycle process which terminates the spring bloom of a malmogiense and thus has an important effect on its phenology see section 2 for a detailed description of the life cycle of a malmogiense the authors hypothesized that the lowered encystment rate represents an adaptation to global warming allowing for spring bloom formation even if the temperature threshold for encystment is already exceeded they assumed that under warming conditions natural selection favours strains with a lower encystment rate here based on data from a case study on resurrected a malmogiense resting stages we apply for the first time a state of the art ecosystem model that includes selection and mutation as well as life cycle processes specifically we investigate bloom formation and encystment of a model dinoflagellate population over a period of 200 years of global warming 1900 2100 the population comprises a number of strains competing with each other for nutrients and light and differing only in their encystment rate apart from this incorporation of selection we also include mutation in form of trait diffusion following beckmann et al 2019 using this advanced model approach we are able to trace concretely if and how a phytoplankton trait responds to global warming moreover we explore additional factors that could have influenced the adaptive response the first factor we consider for this purpose is cyst mortality cysts are known to play an important role in bloom formation klais et al 2013 lee et al 2018 and the survival potential of resting stages can be affected under elevated temperatures ellegaard and ribeiro 2017 we therefore study the sensitivity of the adaptive response under global warming and a concurrent increase in cyst mortality the second factor we investigate is eutrophication the baltic sea has experienced a significant eutrophication over the past century which has led to a higher primary production rönnberg and bonsdorff 2004 gustafsson et al 2012 the higher nutrient levels may have affected spring bloom dynamics and in turn also evolutionary dynamics all in all we investigate 1 whether the hypothesis that global warming causes an adaptive response in the encystment rate is confirmed by using an advanced marine ecosystem model and 2 whether our model reflects the data from resurrection experiments as well as how additional factors influence the adaptive response 2 model description 2 1 life cycle ecosystem model our life cycle ecosystem model is similar to the dinoflagellate life cycle model in warns et al 2012 and includes 3 life cycle stages of a malmogiense vegetative cells v gametes g and resting cysts c as well as nutrients n and detritus d see fig 1 a all components are in nitrogen units in mmol n m 3 and mass conservation is ensured our model system represents the natural spring bloom phenology for the dominating dinoflagellate complex in the gulf of finland which includes a malmogiense see fig 1 b cysts germinate in early spring after a dormancy period of several months when they are resuspended into the water column kremp 2001 kremp and parrow 2006 in the 0 dimensional model used here we simplified this process by prescribing germination to a certain time window in early spring as long as the water temperature is below freezing point growth of vegetative cells is inhibited when the freezing temperature is exceeded vegetative cells take up nutrients and form a spring bloom which lasts from march to may kremp and heiskanen 1999 kremp et al 2005 fleming and kaitala 2006 olli and trunov 2010 gamete production takes place under nutrient replete low temperature conditions hinners et al 2017 but it is not known what triggers the fusion of gametes to a planozygote and whether planozygotes form new vegetative cells or cysts since most cysts are produced asexually kremp and parrow 2006 we assume that sexual reproduction plays a minor role in the life cycle of a malmogiense we therefore do not consider this process in detail but account for the losses of vegetative cells to gametes the formation of resting cysts takes place when spring temperatures rise above a certain threshold kremp and parrow 2006 hinners et al 2017 the concentration of cysts peaks at the end of may and decreases again over fall and winter due to burial and cyst mortality kremp and heiskanen 1999 kremp et al 2005 a mortality rate for all life cycle stages is assumed filling the detritus pool detritus is subsequently remineralized into nutrients the changes in life cycle stages nutrients and detritus in time are given by 1 dv dt gr v τ cv τ vc τ vg mort v dc dt τ vc τ cv mort c dg dt τ vg mort g dd dt

in comparison to strains revived from a recent sediment layer from 2013 0 2 yrs hinners et al 2017 therefore we include an encystment factor x c into cyst formation which varies between 0 1 and 9 8

simulated year is fixed at 360 days to solve our differential equations we use a predictor corrector method the irradiance i l during the seasonal cycle is adapted from stramska and zuzewicz 2013 with

global warming a continuous increase of 0 3 c decade is applied following laakso et al 2018 which is similar to the ipcc scenario rcp8 5 pachauri et al 2015 additionally since environmental fluctuations can alter and accelerate adaptive responses in phytoplankton traits schaum et al 2016 2018 we include short term temperature fluctuations in form of daily oscillations and weekly random fluctuations into the temperature forcing the extent of these daily oscillations and weekly fluctuations were obtained as well from the hiresaff data set schenk and zorita 2012 daily oscillations comprise 0 75 c weekly fluctuations are set to random values in the range of 6 c once per week and interpolated linearly in between the resulting temperature forcing is illustrated in supplementary s1 to account for the varying effect of short term temperature fluctuations on the model results in single years we performed an ensemble of 30 runs and averaged the results the effect of short term temperature fluctuations on the adaptive response in comparison to a steady increase in temperature are analyzed in supplementary s3 2 3 basic evolution model experiment in this evolution experiment we use an advanced model approach which allows for mutation and selection eq 13 to investigate how an a malmogiense population may adapt to increasing temperatures for a more detailed description of the mutation selection model approach the reader is referred to beckmann et al 2019 we consider a number of strains with fixed characteristics that differ only in one life cycle trait the encystment rate in order to represent the effects of mutation part of the newly grown biomass in each strain v i is transferred to the neighboring strains v i 1 and v i 1 this transfer is symmetric for all strains except for the first and last v 1 and v n and penalty free no trade off since it is unclear whether the cost for producing a cyst is significantly different from that for a vegetative cell the transfer in form of trait diffusion allows for evolution by small steps following the assumption that most mutations have a small effect on the fitness of organisms fisher 1930 orr 2005 matuszewski et al 2014 all strains are in competition for nutrients leading to selection of the strain with the most favorable encystment rate for the prevailing temperature regime in a warming environment the population will continuously adjust to the temperature change the effect of simulating evolution including both selection and mutation in comparison to selection alone is analyzed in supplementary s4

our experiment we have chosen n 98 strains with encystment rates expressed by the encystment factor x c times the basic encystment rate α vc and times a temperature dependent term see eq 7 the encystment factor ranges from x c1 0 1 to x cn 9 8 with an interval of 0 1 three percent δ 0 03 of the biomass from a strain is transferred after mutation to each of the neighboring strains for the first and last strain this transfer is one sided only since each strain also receives biomass from its neighboring strains the change in net biomass resulting from mutation ranges between 0 and 6 of the growth term initial concentrations were set to n 5 9 mmol n m 3 and v 46 1 1 mmol n m 3 v 46 corresponds to the strain with an encystment factor x c 4 6 measured in revived historic cultures all other strain concentrations were set to zero the model is forced for 20 years with the historic temperature curve for 1900 to allow for model spin up and subsequently for 200 years with increasing temperatures of 0 3 c decade the first 20 years of simulations are excluded from analysis 2 4 modified evolution model experiments to explore possible additional reasons for the decrease in encystment rate observed in revived a malmogiense strains we investigate the influence of two factors a temperature dependent cyst mortality and eutrophication on the adaptive response in encystment the motivation for exploring these two factors is described in detail in section 4 to analyze the influence of a temperature dependent cyst mortality we assume that the cyst mortality is not constant see eq 9 but proportional to the temperature increase of 0 3 c decade laakso et al 2018 see eq 14 14 mort c m c 1 0 5 t inc t c to investigate the development of encystment under eutrophied nutrient conditions the model was run for 200 years of global warming plus 20 years for model spin up with high initial nutrient concentrations for this purpose the model was initialized with a doubled nutrient concentration n 12 0 mmol n m 3 this nutrient concentration lies in the range of recently measured dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the gulf of finland suikkanen et al 2013 3 results here we use our advanced ecosystem model approach to investigate adaptation to global warming we confirmed that our model is able to represent the natural spring bloom phenology in the gulf of finland characterized by a bloom period from march to may and a subsequent formation of resting cysts kremp and heiskanen 1999 fleming and kaitala 2006 warns et al 2013 lee et al 2018 see fig 1 b we illustrate the evolutionary changes of the encystment rate expressed by the encystment factor which according to observations should range from 4 6 in 100 years old to 1 0 of recent strains hinners et al 2017 3 1 basic evolution experiment in an evolution model experiment we analyze how the mean encystment factor of a population responds to increasing temperatures in comparison to a control experiment which excludes an increase in temperature the control evolution experiment is initiated with the same biomass for all strains without global warming the population evolves to a comparably high encystment rate see fig 2 a the mean encystment factor after 200 years lies at x c 4 56 and close to the encystment factor of x c 4 6 measured in revived historic strains the basic evolution experiment including global warming is initiated with the strain characterized by a high encystment factor x c 4 60 with warming the population adapts to higher temperatures by a gradual and accelerating decrease of the mean encystment factor over 200 years fig 2 b the encystment rate is significantly lower under warm conditions x c 3 74 at the end of the experiment but not as low as the resurrection experiments of hinners et al 2017 indicated 3 2 modified evolution experiments in modified evolution experiments we investigate how two other factors namely a temperature dependent cyst mortality and high nutrient conditions alter the adaptive response in encystment a temperature dependent cyst mortality causes a stronger decrease in the mean encystment factor in response to increasing temperatures down to x c 1 75 see fig 3 a eutrophied nutrient concentrations in comparison lead only to a slightly stronger decrease in the encystment factor over 200 years of global warming to x c 3 71 fig 3 b when compared to the basic evolution experiment 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge this ecosystem model approach is the first one analyzing potential adaptation in phytoplankton to increasing temperatures based on experimental data from a case study on living sediment archives hinners et al 2017 4 1 basic evolution model experiment our basic evolution model experiment shows a decrease in the encystment factor over 200 years of global warming thus our modeling results qualitatively agree with results from resurrection experiments an increase in temperature causes a decrease in the encystment rate but how can this decrease in the encystment rate evolve a large inoculum formed by extensive cyst beds is argued to be one major reason why dinoflagellates can compete with the faster growing diatoms klais et al 2013 lee et al 2018 the large inoculum of cysts ready to germinate as soon as conditions become favorable lead to a rapid input of vegetative cells which can outcompete less abundant vegetative cells of other strains or species in the water column in a previous resurrection study hinners et al 2017 hypothesized that under cold conditions strains with a higher encystment rate have a competitive advantage over those which form less cysts vice versa they hypothesize that under warm conditions strains with a lower encystment rate benefit since their bloom continues even if the threshold temperature for encystment is exceeded leading to larger blooms of strains with a low encystment rate our model results confirm this hypothesis without prescribing the encystment rate our simulations show that strains with a high encystment rate are dominant under cold conditions see fig 2 a while strains with a lower encystment rate become more abundant under warm conditions see fig 2 b under cold conditions strains with a high encystment rate have enough time over the entire spring period to grow and form a bloom such that after the onset of encystment a major part of the biomass of vegetative cells is transferred to resting stages forming a large cyst pool see upper left panel in fig 4 in the following year the high cyst pool leads to a high inoculum after germination resulting in a larger bloom a lower encystment rate will result in smaller cyst pool and thus a smaller inoculum for the onset of the next spring bloom upper right panel in fig 4 consequently strains with a high encystment rate become dominant under cold conditions in contrast under warm conditions the temperature threshold for encystment is exceeded early in time before nutrients become exhausted leading to high biomass transfer from vegetative cells to cysts early in spring due to the high encystment rate thereby severely shortening the bloom time span lower left panel of fig 4 a lower encystment rate however will cause a prolonged spring bloom since the onset of encystment does not directly terminate the spring bloom lower right panel of fig 4 making use of the remaining nutrients more vegetative cells are produced and as a consequence the inoculum of newly formed cysts becomes larger even though the encystment rate is lower this higher inoculum of cysts formed by strains with a low encystment rate represents an advantage in the following year because it allows for a higher amount of germinating cells therefore in response to global warming strains with a low encystment rate will gradually make up a larger fraction of the population and the mean encystment rate of the population will decrease by showing a gradual decrease in the mean encystment factor for our model population in response to global warming our model results support this theory thus regarding our research hypothesis 1 our model confirms that global warming may cause an adaptive response in the encystment rate 4 2 modified evolution experiments even though our results qualitatively agree with the results from resurrection experiments they show some quantitative difference the magnitude of change in encystment in our evolution model experiment is smaller than the change in encystment observed in resurrection experiments which showed a change in the encystment factor from x c 4 6 to x c 1 0 within the past 100 years hence we test whether further factors not yet captured in this model could have enhanced the adaptive response in nature for this purpose we first look at cyst mortality cysts are known to have a large influence on the spring bloom formation klais et al 2013 lee et al 2018 but it is unclear how cyst mortality might be influenced by global warming a decrease in the survival potential of resting stages due to elevated temperatures has been previously observed in different phytoplankton species ellegaard and ribeiro 2017 since not only the sea surface but also deeper water layers warmed over the past century laakso et al 2018 this temperature increase may have caused an increase in cyst mortality over the past 100 years we therefore study the sensitivity of the adaptive response under increasing temperature conditions and a simultaneously increasing cyst mortality indeed this experiment shows a stronger decrease in the mean encystment factor in response to increasing temperatures a temperature dependent cyst mortality can thus amplify the adaptive response to global warming by representing an additional selection pressure towards a smaller encystment rate for further exemplification see also supplementary s2 another possible explanation for a stronger change in encystment in nature may lie in the eutrophication which the baltic sea experienced over the past century gustafsson et al 2012 and which could have influenced spring bloom dynamics and thereby also evolutionary dynamics our model experiment with eutrophied conditions shows a slightly stronger decrease in the encystment factor compared to the basic evolution experiment this stronger adaptive response develops since strains with a lower encystment rate benefit more from eutrophied conditions compared to strains with a high encystment rate higher nutrient levels allow for an even longer growth phase and thus a higher production of vegetative cells after the onset of encystment in nature eutrophication may indirectly further enhance cyst mortality by causing a lack of oxygen in bottom waters and sediments although cysts are generally considered to withstand anoxia a general loss of cyst revivability leading to decreased germination at population level has been observed for a number of species kremp and anderson 2000 lundholm et al 2011 thus also eutrophication can enhance the adaptive response in encystment summarizing regarding our research question 2 our model results do not exactly mirror the data from resurrection experiments but show a weaker change in encystment we therefore conclude that additional factors such as eutrophication and an increasing cyst mortality due to global warming could have enhanced the change in encystment in nature 5 summary and conclusions in this study we use an advanced ecosystem model to investigate for the first time how a life cycle trait may have been altered by global warming based on a case study on living sediment archives hinners et al 2017 we find that an increase in temperature can cause a decrease in encystment because a high encystment rate can prevent the formation of a spring bloom at an early stage whereas a lower encystment rate allows for the formation of an extensive spring bloom and is thereby more beneficial for the long term survival of the population consequently our results confirm that global warming can indeed cause an adaptive response of the population through changes in a life cycle trait since our results show a weaker change in encystment compared to the results from sediment archives we perform sensitivity experiments to identify potential further factors that could have enhanced the adaptive response in nature these sensitivity experiments reveal that eutrophication leads to a slightly enhanced change in encystment whereas an increasing cyst mortality due to global warming strongly enhances the adaptive response in nature by applying the advanced ecosystem model of beckmann et al 2019 we demonstrate that marine ecosystem modeling represents a powerful so far unexhausted approach to investigate the evolutionary potential of phytoplankton organisms including the evolutionary potential of phytoplankton into ecosystem models will in the short run provide a tool to further exemplify and understand results from resurrection experiments and experimental evolution and in the long run help improving the predictive force of ecosystem and earth system models moving from low to higher spatial dimensionality will moreover allow to evaluate the ecological consequences of phytoplankton evolution in more detail since phytoplankton adaptation to changing environmental conditions has the potential to severely alter phytoplankton phenology distribution and productivity its consideration will be important for realistic projections of ecosystem dynamics competing

25081,due to its crucial role in the ecosystem phytoplankton is incorporated in marine ecosystem models most models however neglect the evolutionary potential of phytoplankton previous resurrection experiments with a spring bloom dinoflagellate suggest that the past century of global warming has caused an adaptive response in an important life cycle trait the encystment rate here based on this resurrection case study we apply an advanced ecosystem model including selection and mutation to test whether a temperature increase could induce a change in encystment in line with the findings from resurrection experiments our results show that in warmer waters strains with a lower encystment rate benefit over those with a higher encystment rate the magnitude of change in encystment rate is however only reproduced if additional factors like eutrophication and a cyst mortality that increases with temperature are considered by using this ecosystem model including selection and mutation we demonstrate that ecosystem modeling represents a powerful approach to investigate the adaptive potential of phytoplankton keywords ecosystem model evolution global warming life cycle living sediment archives phytoplankton 1 introduction phytoplankton organisms represent the base of the marine food web they are an important component of biogeochemical cycles hutchins and fu 2017 and they even feed back on ocean physics sathyendranath et al 1991 kahru et al 1993 joehnk et al 2008 hense et al 2017 due to the importance of phytoplankton for the ecosystem they are explicitly considered in marine ecosystem models bruggeman and kooijman 2007 follows et al 2007 steinacher et al 2010 bopp et al 2013 dutkiewicz et al 2015 laufkötter et al 2015 owing to their large population sizes and short generation times phytoplankton have a high potential to rapidly adapt to environmental changes despite the growing body of research demonstrating this high evolutionary potential of phytoplankton it is so far disregarded in the vast majority of ecosystem models here we apply an advanced ecosystem model which allows for evolution by selection and mutation to investigate how phytoplankton may adapt to global warming through changes in a life cycle trait the high evolutionary potential of phytoplankton organisms has been previously described in many experimental evolution studies e g collins and bell 2004 lohbeck et al 2012 schaum et al 2018 there is also a number of conceptual and modelling studies that include evolutionary aspects one example focuses on thermal adaptation of phytoplankton in the global ocean grimaud et al 2015 denman 2017 simulates observed changes in the growth rate of the phytoplankton emiliania huxleyi under different temperature conditions assuming random mutations as well as plasticity collins 2016 explains with an individual based model how cellular damage and repair influence the change in cell division rates in phytoplankton under improved environmental conditions considering an explicit trade off of resource allocation between growth and repair these studies grimaud et al 2015 denman 2017 collins 2016 apply the theoretical knowledge to the real world but do not account for ecosystem dynamics apart from these more conceptual studies on phytoplankton evolution some ecosystem modeling studies exist which allow for mutation in form of trait diffusion mechanisms here mutation in trait values is described as a diffusion process over generations previous ecosystem models that consider mutation in form of trait diffusion focused on understanding species coexistence within a modeling framework simulating stable chemostat environmental conditions as well as fluctuating environmental conditions without a trend kremer and klausmeier 2013 merico et al 2014 smith et al 2016 sauterey et al 2017 only recently it was demonstrated that this modeling concept for mutation can also be applied to study adaptation to changing environmental conditions beckmann et al 2019 however this model concept has not been applied to real data yet in contrast to these modeling studies which consider evolution by mutation and selection there are numerous ecosystem models which prescribe functional groups and or strains with fixed traits and only allow for selection among those traits follows et al 2007 steinacher et al 2010 bopp et al 2013 dutkiewicz et al 2015 laufkötter et al 2015 bruggeman and kooijman 2007 regard trait distribution and its changes by immigration but also ignore evolutionary changes by mutation thus none of the above mentioned ecosystem models has applied a mutation selection model to real data to investigate phytoplankton adaptation to changing environmental conditions lately life cycle trait changes were detected in resurrected phytoplankton resting stages from the sediment in the gulf of finland n baltic sea hinners et al 2017 over the past hundred years the temperature in the gulf of finland has increased significantly by 0 3 c per decade laakso et al 2018 temperature tolerance experiments with revived strains of the spring bloom dinoflagellate apocalathium malmogiense suggest that in consequence of increasing temperatures changes in resting stage formation encystment have already occurred the encystment rate of recent strains was almost 5 times lower compared to the encystment rate of historic 100 years old strains hinners et al 2017 encystment is an annually occurring life cycle process which terminates the spring bloom of a malmogiense and thus has an important effect on its phenology see section 2 for a detailed description of the life cycle of a malmogiense the authors hypothesized that the lowered encystment rate represents an adaptation to global warming allowing for spring bloom formation even if the temperature threshold for encystment is already exceeded they assumed that under warming conditions natural selection favours strains with a lower encystment rate here based on data from a case study on resurrected a malmogiense resting stages we apply for the first time a state of the art ecosystem model that includes selection and mutation as well as life cycle processes specifically we investigate bloom formation and encystment of a model dinoflagellate population over a period of 200 years of global warming 1900 2100 the population comprises a number of strains competing with each other for nutrients and light and differing only in their encystment rate apart from this incorporation of selection we also include mutation in form of trait diffusion following beckmann et al 2019 using this advanced model approach we are able to trace concretely if and how a phytoplankton trait responds to global warming moreover we explore additional factors that could have influenced the adaptive response the first factor we consider for this purpose is cyst mortality cysts are known to play an important role in bloom formation klais et al 2013 lee et al 2018 and the survival potential of resting stages can be affected under elevated temperatures ellegaard and ribeiro 2017 we therefore study the sensitivity of the adaptive response under global warming and a concurrent increase in cyst mortality the second factor we investigate is eutrophication the baltic sea has experienced a significant eutrophication over the past century which has led to a higher primary production rönnberg and bonsdorff 2004 gustafsson et al 2012 the higher nutrient levels may have affected spring bloom dynamics and in turn also evolutionary dynamics all in all we investigate 1 whether the hypothesis that global warming causes an adaptive response in the encystment rate is confirmed by using an advanced marine ecosystem model and 2 whether our model reflects the data from resurrection experiments as well as how additional factors influence the adaptive response 2 model description 2 1 life cycle ecosystem model our life cycle ecosystem model is similar to the dinoflagellate life cycle model in warns et al 2012 and includes 3 life cycle stages of a malmogiense vegetative cells v gametes g and resting cysts c as well as nutrients n and detritus d see fig 1 a all components are in nitrogen units in mmol n m 3 and mass conservation is ensured our model system represents the natural spring bloom phenology for the dominating dinoflagellate complex in the gulf of finland which includes a malmogiense see fig 1 b cysts germinate in early spring after a dormancy period of several months when they are resuspended into the water column kremp 2001 kremp and parrow 2006 in the 0 dimensional model used here we simplified this process by prescribing germination to a certain time window in early spring as long as the water temperature is below freezing point growth of vegetative cells is inhibited when the freezing temperature is exceeded vegetative cells take up nutrients and form a spring bloom which lasts from march to may kremp and heiskanen 1999 kremp et al 2005 fleming and kaitala 2006 olli and trunov 2010 gamete production takes place under nutrient replete low temperature conditions hinners et al 2017 but it is not known what triggers the fusion of gametes to a planozygote and whether planozygotes form new vegetative cells or cysts since most cysts are produced asexually kremp and parrow 2006 we assume that sexual reproduction plays a minor role in the life cycle of a malmogiense we therefore do not consider this process in detail but account for the losses of vegetative cells to gametes the formation of resting cysts takes place when spring temperatures rise above a certain threshold kremp and parrow 2006 hinners et al 2017 the concentration of cysts peaks at the end of may and decreases again over fall and winter due to burial and cyst mortality kremp and heiskanen 1999 kremp et al 2005 a mortality rate for all life cycle stages is assumed filling the detritus pool detritus is subsequently remineralized into nutrients the changes in life cycle stages nutrients and detritus in time are given by 1 dv dt gr v τ cv τ vc τ vg mort v dc dt τ vc τ cv mort c dg dt τ vg mort g dd dt

in comparison to strains revived from a recent sediment layer from 2013 0 2 yrs hinners et al 2017 therefore we include an encystment factor x c into cyst formation which varies between 0 1 and 9 8

simulated year is fixed at 360 days to solve our differential equations we use a predictor corrector method the irradiance i l during the seasonal cycle is adapted from stramska and zuzewicz 2013 with lower values during winter and higher values during summer months 11 i l i 1 i 2 cos 2 π t 180 24 360 24 the pre industrial annual temperature curve is obtained from a high resolution reconstruction of atmospheric forcing hiresaff for northern europe schenk and zorita 2012 the mean climatic temperature curve for 1900 is calculated based on the air temperature data from 1885 to 1915 from station ll7 in the central gulf of finland latitude 59 51 longitude 24 50 and a cos function eq 3 is fitted to this climatic temperature curve 12 t 1900 7 5 10 5 cos 2 π day 35 360 to analyze the effect of global warming a continuous increase of 0 3 c decade is applied following laakso et al 2018 which is similar to the ipcc scenario rcp8 5 pachauri et al 2015 additionally since environmental fluctuations can alter and accelerate adaptive responses in phytoplankton traits schaum et al 2016 2018 we include short term temperature fluctuations in form of daily oscillations and weekly random fluctuations into the temperature forcing the extent of these daily oscillations and weekly fluctuations were obtained as well from the hiresaff data set schenk and zorita 2012 daily oscillations comprise 0 75 c weekly fluctuations are set to random values in the range of 6 c once per week and interpolated linearly in between the resulting temperature forcing is illustrated in supplementary s1 to account for the varying effect of short term temperature fluctuations on the model results in single years we performed an ensemble of 30 runs and averaged the results the effect of short term temperature fluctuations on the adaptive response in comparison to a steady increase in temperature are analyzed in supplementary s3 2 3 basic evolution model experiment in this evolution experiment we use an advanced model approach which allows for mutation and selection eq 13 to investigate how an a malmogiense population may adapt to increasing temperatures for a more detailed description of the mutation selection model approach the reader is referred to beckmann et al 2019 we consider a number of strains with fixed characteristics that differ only in one life cycle trait the encystment rate in order to represent the effects of mutation part of the newly grown biomass in each strain v i is transferred to the neighboring strains v i 1 and v i 1 this transfer is symmetric for all strains except for the first and last v 1 and v n and penalty free no trade off since it is unclear whether the cost for producing a cyst is significantly different from that for a vegetative cell the transfer in form of trait diffusion allows for evolution by small steps following the assumption that most mutations have a small effect on the fitness of organisms fisher 1930 orr 2005 matuszewski et al 2014 all strains are in competition for nutrients leading to selection of the strain with the most favorable encystment rate for the prevailing temperature regime in a warming environment the population will continuously adjust to the temperature change the effect of simulating evolution including both selection and mutation in comparison to selection alone is analyzed in supplementary s4

our experiment we have chosen n 98 strains with encystment rates expressed by the encystment factor x c times the basic encystment rate α vc and times a temperature dependent term see eq 7 the encystment factor ranges from x c1 0 1 to x cn 9 8 with an interval of 0 1 three percent δ 0 03 of the biomass from a strain is transferred after mutation to each of the neighboring strains for the first and last strain this transfer is one sided only since each strain also receives biomass from its neighboring strains the change in net biomass resulting from mutation ranges between 0 and 6 of the growth term initial concentrations were set to n 5 9 mmol n m 3 and v 46 1 1 mmol n m 3 v 46 corresponds to the strain with an encystment factor x c 4 6 measured in revived historic cultures all other strain concentrations were set to zero the model is forced for 20 years with the historic temperature curve for 1900 to allow for model spin up and subsequently for 200 years with increasing temperatures of 0 3 c decade the first 20 years of simulations are excluded from analysis 2 4 modified evolution model experiments to explore possible additional reasons for the decrease in encystment rate observed in revived a malmogiense strains we investigate the influence of two factors a temperature dependent cyst mortality and eutrophication on the adaptive response in encystment the motivation for exploring these two factors is described in detail in section 4 to analyze the influence of a temperature dependent cyst mortality we assume that the cyst mortality is not constant see eq 9 but proportional to the temperature increase of 0 3 c decade laakso et al 2018 see eq 14 14 mort c m c 1 0 5 t inc t c to investigate the development of encystment under eutrophied nutrient conditions the model was run for 200 years of global warming plus 20 years for model spin up with high initial nutrient concentrations for this purpose the model was initialized with a doubled nutrient concentration n 12 0 mmol n m 3 this nutrient concentration lies in the range of recently measured dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the gulf of finland suikkanen et al 2013 3 results here we use our advanced ecosystem model approach to investigate adaptation to global warming we confirmed that our model is able to represent the natural spring bloom phenology in the gulf of finland characterized by a bloom period from march to may and a subsequent formation of resting cysts kremp and heiskanen 1999 fleming and kaitala 2006 warns et al 2013 lee et al 2018 see fig 1 b we illustrate the evolutionary changes of the encystment rate expressed by the encystment factor which according to observations should range from 4 6 in 100 years old to 1 0 of recent strains hinners et al 2017 3 1 basic evolution experiment in an evolution model experiment we analyze how the mean encystment factor of a population responds to increasing temperatures in comparison to a control experiment which excludes an increase in temperature the control evolution experiment is initiated with the same biomass for all strains without global warming the population evolves to a comparably high encystment rate see fig 2 a the mean encystment factor after 200 years lies at x c 4 56 and close to the encystment factor of x c 4 6 measured in revived historic strains the basic evolution experiment including global warming is initiated with the strain characterized by a high encystment factor x c 4 60 with warming the population adapts to higher temperatures by a gradual and accelerating decrease of the mean encystment factor over 200 years fig 2 b the encystment rate is significantly lower under warm conditions x c 3 74 at the end of the experiment but not as low as the resurrection experiments of hinners et al 2017 indicated 3 2 modified evolution experiments in modified evolution experiments we investigate how two other factors namely a temperature dependent cyst mortality and high nutrient conditions alter the adaptive response in encystment a temperature dependent cyst mortality causes a stronger decrease in the mean encystment factor in response to increasing temperatures down to x c 1 75 see fig 3 a eutrophied nutrient concentrations in comparison lead only to a slightly stronger decrease in the encystment factor over 200 years of global warming to x c 3 71 fig 3 b when compared to the basic evolution experiment 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge this ecosystem model approach is the first one analyzing potential adaptation in phytoplankton to increasing temperatures based on experimental data from a case study on living sediment archives hinners et al 2017 4 1 basic evolution model experiment our basic evolution model experiment shows a decrease in the encystment factor over 200 years of global warming thus our modeling results qualitatively agree with results from resurrection experiments an increase in temperature causes a decrease in the encystment rate but how can this decrease in the encystment rate evolve a large inoculum formed by extensive cyst beds is argued to be one major reason why dinoflagellates can compete with the faster growing diatoms klais et al 2013 lee et al 2018 the large inoculum of cysts ready to germinate as soon as conditions become favorable lead to a rapid input of vegetative cells which can outcompete less abundant vegetative cells of other strains or species in the water column in a previous resurrection study hinners et al 2017 hypothesized that under cold conditions strains with a higher encystment rate have a competitive advantage over those which form less cysts vice versa they hypothesize that under warm conditions strains with a lower encystment rate benefit since their bloom continues even if the threshold temperature for encystment is exceeded leading to larger blooms of strains with a low encystment rate our model results confirm this hypothesis without prescribing the encystment rate our simulations show that strains with a high encystment rate are dominant under cold conditions see fig 2 a while strains with a lower encystment rate become more abundant under warm conditions see fig 2 b under cold conditions strains with a high encystment rate have enough time over the entire spring period to grow and form a bloom such that after the onset of encystment a major part of the biomass of vegetative cells is transferred to resting stages forming a large cyst pool see upper left panel in fig 4 in the following year the high cyst pool leads to a high inoculum after germination resulting in a larger bloom a lower encystment rate will result in smaller cyst pool and thus a smaller inoculum for the onset of the next spring bloom upper right panel in fig 4 consequently strains with a high encystment rate become dominant under cold conditions in contrast under warm conditions the temperature threshold for encystment is exceeded early in time before nutrients become exhausted leading to high biomass transfer from vegetative cells to cysts early in spring due to the high encystment rate thereby severely shortening the bloom time span lower left panel of fig 4 a lower encystment rate however will cause a prolonged spring bloom since the onset of encystment does not directly terminate the spring bloom lower right panel of fig 4 making use of the remaining nutrients more vegetative cells are produced and as a consequence the inoculum of newly formed cysts becomes larger even though the encystment rate is lower this higher inoculum of cysts formed by strains with a low encystment rate represents an advantage in the following year because it allows for a higher amount of germinating cells therefore in response to global warming strains with a low encystment rate will gradually make up a larger fraction of the population and the mean encystment rate of the population will decrease by showing a gradual decrease in the mean encystment factor for our model population in response to global warming our model results support this theory thus regarding our research hypothesis 1 our model confirms that global warming may cause an adaptive response in the encystment rate 4 2 modified evolution experiments even though our results qualitatively agree with the results from resurrection experiments they show some quantitative difference the magnitude of change in encystment in our evolution model experiment is smaller than the change in encystment observed in resurrection experiments which showed a change in the encystment factor from x c 4 6 to x c 1 0 within the past 100 years hence we test whether further factors not yet captured in this model could have enhanced the adaptive response in nature for this purpose we first look at cyst mortality cysts are known to have a large influence on the spring bloom formation klais et al 2013 lee et al 2018 but it is unclear how cyst mortality might be influenced by global warming a decrease in the survival potential of resting stages due to elevated temperatures has been previously observed in different phytoplankton species ellegaard and ribeiro 2017 since not only the sea surface but also deeper water layers warmed over the past century laakso et al 2018 this temperature increase may have caused an increase in cyst mortality over the past 100 years we therefore study the sensitivity of the adaptive response under increasing temperature conditions and a simultaneously increasing cyst mortality indeed this experiment shows a stronger decrease in the mean encystment factor in response to increasing temperatures a temperature dependent cyst mortality can thus amplify the adaptive response to global warming by representing an additional selection pressure towards a smaller encystment rate for further exemplification see also supplementary s2 another possible explanation for a stronger change in encystment in nature may lie in the eutrophication which the baltic sea experienced over the past century gustafsson et al 2012 and which could have influenced spring bloom dynamics and thereby also evolutionary dynamics our model experiment with eutrophied conditions shows a slightly stronger decrease in the encystment factor compared to the basic evolution experiment this stronger adaptive response develops since strains with a lower encystment rate benefit more from eutrophied conditions compared to strains with a high encystment rate higher nutrient levels allow for an even longer growth phase and thus a higher production of vegetative cells after the onset of encystment in nature eutrophication may indirectly further enhance cyst mortality by causing a lack of oxygen in bottom waters and sediments although cysts are generally considered to withstand anoxia a general loss of cyst revivability leading to decreased germination at population level has been observed for a number of species kremp and anderson 2000 lundholm et al 2011 thus also eutrophication can enhance the adaptive response in encystment summarizing regarding our research question 2 our model results do not exactly mirror the data from resurrection experiments but show a weaker change in encystment we therefore conclude that additional factors such as eutrophication and an increasing cyst mortality due to global warming could have enhanced the change in encystment in nature 5 summary and conclusions in this study we use an advanced ecosystem model to investigate for the first time how a life cycle trait may have been altered by global warming based on a case study on living sediment archives hinners et al 2017 we find that an increase in temperature can cause a decrease in encystment because a high encystment rate can prevent the formation of a spring bloom at an early stage whereas a lower encystment rate allows for the formation of an extensive spring bloom and is thereby more beneficial for the long term survival of the population consequently our results confirm that global warming can indeed cause an adaptive response of the population through changes in a life cycle trait since our results show a weaker change in encystment compared to the results from sediment archives we perform sensitivity experiments to identify potential further factors that could have enhanced the adaptive response in nature these sensitivity experiments reveal that eutrophication leads to a slightly enhanced change in encystment whereas an increasing cyst mortality due to global warming strongly enhances the adaptive response in nature by applying the advanced ecosystem model of beckmann et al 2019 we demonstrate that marine ecosystem modeling represents a powerful so far unexhausted approach to investigate the evolutionary potential of phytoplankton organisms including the evolutionary potential of phytoplankton into ecosystem models will in the short run provide a tool to further exemplify and understand results from resurrection experiments and experimental evolution and in the long run help improving the predictive force of ecosystem and earth system models moving from low to higher spatial dimensionality will moreover allow to evaluate the ecological consequences of phytoplankton evolution in more detail since phytoplankton adaptation to changing environmental conditions has the potential to severely alter phytoplankton phenology distribution and productivity its consideration will be important for realistic projections of ecosystem dynamics competing

25082,environmental and anthropogenic stressors can interact e g drought harvest or herbivory to shape plant demography and evolutionary strategies with implications for sustainable resource management plans harvest or recurrent biomass removal can act as a selective force however our understanding of how harvest and changes in climate can synergistically shape plant evolutionary strategies is limited we used age from stage matrix modeling to investigate how chronic anthropogenic disturbance severe foliage and bark harvest affects age specific mortality trajectories of a tropical tree khaya senegalensis in two contrasting climatic regions dry versus moist in west africa we then developed a stochastic model to test if changes in disturbance regime and the environmental conditions in which a cohort is born may alter stochastic age specific mortality rates the effect of harvest on age specific mortality trajectories was modest and only noticeable in the moist region age specific mortality trajectories differed significantly between regions in the moist region mortality rates decreased with age for the first 30 years of life to a minimum rate and then increased gradually after to reach an old age mortality plateau in the dry region mortality rates decreased with age to reach a plateau asymptotically this difference in age specific mortality trajectory is due to a greater delay in reaching reproductive size age in the dry region our findings underscore intraspecific variation in age specific mortality schedules and indicate that climatic effect may override the impact of anthropogenic activities on plant demography harvest by favoring fast life stage transition to reproductive stages can buffer the effect of drought keywords climate change matrix models age from stage age specific mortality non timber forest products harvest 1 introduction understanding the age patterns of mortality has long been of fundamental interest for evolutionary ecologists because such patterns unveil selective forces and evolutionary history hamilton 1966 crews 1993 vaupel et al 1998 larson 2001 tuljapurkar et al 2007 evidence is accumulating that age specific mortality trajectories are highly diverse across the tree of life jones et al 2014 horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 metcalf et al 2009 salguero gómez et al 2013 baudisch et al 2013 ranging from trajectories with increasing to decreasing or constant mortality rates with age silvertown et al 2001 roach and gampe 2004 horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 garcia et al 2011 baudisch et al 2013 for stage structured populations these trajectories converge toward an asymptote a late age mortality plateau which represents the long term age specific mortality rate horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 our understanding of how global changes may alter species life history particularly intraspecific variation in age specific mortality trajectories in plants is limited salguero gómez et al 2013 existing studies mostly focus on vertebrate and bird species and show that individuals adapt to environmental conditions they experience throughout life by means of different age specific mortality schedules lemaître et al 2015 given that global change projections indicate frequent and longer drought spells allen et al 2010 knowledge about adaptive shaping of demographic patterns will be crucial to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant populations response to chronic anthropogenic disturbance under climate change scenarios a recent study examines how hunting as a form of harvest can alter the rate of senescence for lesser snow geese in the wild in canada and suggests no significant effect koons et al 2014 obviously hunting which is akin to logging trees removes individual from the population therefore the effect of this kind of lethal harvest on age specific mortality trajectories is rather direct and may not affect species aging patterns non lethal harvest of plants is widespread in the wild and this may offer a better opportunity to examine the ways in which chronic human disturbance affects life history and changes tree senescence gaoue et al 2013 non lethal harvesting of wild plants often involves removal of products such as fruits foliage bark and resin known as non timber forest products ntfp and which serve as important source of food medicine and contribute to the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide ticktin 2004 birch et al 2010 ntfp harvest does not always lead to direct death of harvested individuals however it can have far reaching ecological and evolutionary impacts both at the population and community levels moegenburg and levey 2002 trauernicht et al 2006 gaoue and ticktin 2010 non timber forest products harvest can reduce population growth rate in both constant schmidt et al 2011 and stochastic environments ticktin et al 2002 with significant changes to plant life history traits for example harvesting can alter plant leaf economics gaoue et al 2011b with further reduction of individual size and delay the onset of reproduction mcgraw 2001 law and salick 2005 gaoue et al 2013 the effects of non lethal harvest on plant life history can further be exacerbated by drought for example greater cost of adaptation to drought often leads to slower individual growth rate in dry areas tyree and ewers 1991 this reduction in growth can potentially delay reproduction and change the patterns of age specific mortality from that of populations in moist environments with faster individual growth in this study we investigated how climate and non lethal harvesting of wild plants for non timber forest products affect age specific mortality patterns studies on the age specific mortality of plants are rare roach et al 2009 roach 2012 this is partly due to difficulties in estimating individual plant age for relatively short lived plants it is possible to conduct experiments where multiple cohorts are planted and tracked over multiple years so as to describe the age specific demography see roach 2003 roach and gampe 2004 picó and retana 2008 however for long lived plants such as trees such experiment may not be feasible over a long enough time period to cover that lifespan other alternatives include using molecular based techniques ally et al 2010 or dendrochronology von arx et al 2006 to estimate plant age and then determine age specific mortality trajectories recent developments in matrix theory provide analytical tools to estimate age specific demographic mortality and reproductive rates in both deterministic and stochastic environments using stage structured projection matrices cochran and ellner 1992 horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 caswell and salguero gómez 2013 this approach has already been used to study the dynamics of age specific mortality in plants e g silvertown et al 2001 metcalf et al 2009 baudisch et al 2013 and provides rare opportunities to investigate how species ranking in the fast slow life history continuum predicts the rate of demographic senescence jones et al 2008 2014 using the age from stage modeling ultimately furthers our understanding of the evolution of senescence across the tree of life shefferson et al 2017 particularly the rarity of senescence in angiosperms and long lived plants species which were previously less understood baudisch et al 2013 however these studies either did not account for environmental stochasticity or consider among populations variation in age specific mortality rate here we used four years of demographic data from twelve populations with different harvesting histories and age from stage matrix modeling to estimate age specific mortality rate for khaya senegalensis meliaceae in two climatic regions of benin west africa k senegalensis is a tropical tree harvested for its bark as medicine and its foliage as an important source of fodder for cattle during the dry season gaoue and ticktin 2007 foliage and bark harvesting in most cases does not kill adult individuals but alter their growth and reproductive patterns gaoue et al 2011a bufford and gaoue 2015 because the ntfp harvest system we studied is particular and harvesting in this case is non lethal it is possible to model at the individual or population level different temporal sequences of foliage and bark harvest in previous studies gaoue et al 2011a and gaoue et al 2013 show that consistent with local harvesters practices see gaoue and ticktin 2009 turner et al 2000 the stochastic sequence of harvest intensities matters the intensity of foliage harvest by the fulani harvesters in a given year depends on previous year harvesting intensity gaoue and ticktin 2009 in addition a population harvested at high h intensity e g 90 of branches pruned for five consecutive years and then at low l intensity e g 10 of branches pruned for the next five years hhhhhlllll would respond differently from one that has experienced five years of high and five years of low harvest intensity but spread out over the 10 years time period hlhlhlhlhl consistent with this tuljapurkar and haridas 2006 show that temporal autocorrelation can have a sizable effect on population dynamics the effect of any sequence of harvest on population demography will depend on the ecological conditions in which harvesting takes places in this study we take advantage of a detailed demographic dataset on k senegalensis in two contrasting climatic regions of benin west africa to test the effects of climatic differences between regions dry vs moist and harvest strategies constant vs stochastically variable rate on its age specific risk of mortality we modeled the stochastic temporal sequence of harvest using a markov process which allows us to test the effect of varying harvest intensity for a given site by using a markov process to model the temporal sequence of fulani harvesting practices we assumed that harvesting is not done randomly but that there is a temporal autocorrelation in harvesting intensities over time caswell 2001 gaoue et al 2011a tuljapurkar et al 2003 our study indicates that difference in climate drives the dynamics of the age specific mortality trajectories whereas the impact of harvesting regardless of the strategy on these trajectories is modest 2 materials and methods 2 1 study system african mahogany k senegalensis meliaceae is a tropical tree distributed in africa across multiple habitats from gallery forests to savanna woodland between 8 and 14 n normand and sallenave 1958 ctft 1988 the tree is a semi deciduous shade intolerant monoecious tree with wind dispersed flat winged seeds and insect pollinated small white hermaphrodite flowers ctft 1988 k senegalensis is a slow growing tree that may reach up to 30 m in height in benin it reaches an observed maximum diameter at breast height dbh of 136 2 cm gaoue and ticktin 2007 gaoue et al 2014 which would be the equivalent of 187 years considering an average diameter increment of 0 73 cm yr for most tree species in the region see sokpon and biaou 2002 we studied the dynamics of k senegalensis populations in two contrasting ecological regions in benin west africa these two regions cover the latitudes 8 12 n at which the species is found in its distribution range in africa the sudanian region 9 30 12 n is dry with lower rainfall 800 1000 mm year fewer rainy months shorter plant growing season 145 days and higher mean temperature 2431 c than the moist sudano guinean region 7 30 9 30 n annual rainfall 1000 1300 mm year plant growing period 200 days temperature 25 29 c details about the ecological differences between the dry and moist regions are provided elsewhere gaoue and ticktin 2007 2010 k senegalensis was one of the first timber species exported from africa during the colonial era normand and sallenave 1958 commercial companies and local populations illegally harvested the timber to depletion in several part of its distribution range foliage is heavily harvested from remnant standing populations by indigenous fulani people across west africa to feed cattle during the peak dry season petit 2003 gaoue and ticktin 2007 the fulani specialize in raising cattle which are a vital source of income for them and an integral part of their culture gaoue and ticktin 2009 harvested k senegalensis trees often lose 80 of their canopy gaoue and ticktin 2007 and most of harvested populations have been pruned since the severe drought of the 1970s l hote et al 2002 2 2 demographic data we collected data on growth survival and fruit production of k senegalensis individuals over 4 years 2004 2007 in twelve 1 ha permanent plots equally distributed between the dry and moist regions k senegalensis only occurs in gallery forest in the dry region whereas in the moist region it is also found in dry dense forest and woodland we established our study populations to sample across the range of these differences in habitat and harvest intensity for each population we estimated the percent of trees harvested pruned and or debarked individuals trees were more likely pruned than debarked and we assumed the former would have stronger effects on population demography pruned trees often have 80 of their canopy harvested while at most 25 of trunk were debarked gaoue and ticktin 2007 using this harvesting data and following gaoue et al 2011a 2013 we categorized each population into one of three levels of harvest intensity low medium or high depending on the proportion of trees harvested for foliage and bark populations with fewer than 25 of trees harvested were classified as low harvest l medium harvest m populations were those with 25 50 of trees harvested and high harvest h populations had more than 50 of trees harvested in the moist region we were able to find and survey three low two medium and one high harvest populations while in the dry region there were three low one medium and two high harvest populations our study with 12 independent populations represents one of the largest sample sizes in demographic studies salguero gómez et al 2015 however such unbalanced design limited our ability to uncover any non linear response to harvest but still allowed to test for the global effect of harvest on age specific mortality 2 3 age from stage matrix model for each population and year we built a 5 5 stage based projection matrix a caswell 2001 we defined five life stages using the basal diameter for seedlings and saplings and diameter at breast height dbh for juvenile and adults based on previous results on the size specific survival and reproduction see gaoue and ticktin 2008 2010 for details seedlings basal diameter 2 cm saplings 2 5 cm juveniles 5 20 cm small reproductive 20 40 cm and large reproductive adults dbh 40 cm each matrix transition element was estimated only when we had more than 5 observations for transition elements for which we have less than 5 individuals we used values estimated from a pooled matrix across populations with similar climate and harvesting treatments we averaged the elements of the projection matrices across populations and years by harvest intensity to obtain three matrices low medium and high in each region we split each matrix a into a fertility matrix f and a transition matrix q the latter representing only transitions among stages of already existing individuals a q f the stage duration matrix n also known as the fundamental matrix which captures how much time an individual plant is expected to spend in each life stage before dying cochran and ellner 1992 1 n i q 1 where i is an 5 5 identity matrix we estimated mean survivorship to age x for populations harvested at constant rate over time following caswell 2001 2 l x e t q x where e t is a 5 1 column vector of ones used to sum up the columns of matrix q x by varying the age x we established the age specific stage structure which captures the variation in the proportion of each k senegalensis life stages over time see fig 1 we performed the above analysis for each of the six q matrices two climatic regions three harvest intensities we calculated the age specific mortality rate μ x the rate of decrease in survivorship as follows horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 3 μ x log l x log l x 1 where l x 1 is the survivorship to age x 1 the age specific mortality trajectory may show different patterns of increasing or decreasing rates with age but eventually will converge to an asymptote log λ where λ is the dominant eigenvalue of matrix q this asymptote is the mortality plateau and represents the long term rate of mortality horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 2 4 simulating stochastic harvest environments calculating the mean survivorship to age x when harvest intensity varies stochastically over time requires a markov chain model for the harvest dynamics essentially a model of environmental dynamics where each state of the environment corresponds to one of three harvest intensities low medium and high see for details gaoue et al 2011a 2013 we modeled the temporal sequence of harvest intensity as a stochastic markov process using 3 3 markov transition matrices c that define probability rules to generate a temporal sequence of harvest intensities that a given population will experience over the long run tuljapurkar et al 2003 gaoue et al 2013 each matrix element c αβ represents the probability that a population that is currently harvested at intensity β will be harvested at intensity α the next year to generate plausible temporal sequences of harvesting pressures for a given population we created 36 different 3 state markov chains c these chains were selected to each simulate a specific management option and to represent a range of harvesting pressure which was measured by their return times to high harvest each markov chain c can be characterized by its serial autocorrelation and a return time to high harvest which is the average number of years spent in each state of the environment before returning to a high harvest year to calculate the return time to high harvest for each markov chain model of harvest dynamics we use the environment level analogue to the fundamental matrix n in eq 1 see caswell 2001 tuljapurkar and horvitz 2006 for detailed method in this environmental state duration equation we considered high harvest intensity state h as the absorbing state or death that is to replace all the elements of the third row which represents high harvest state of markov matrix c with zeros then we determined the first passage time to the absorbing state h for populations starting at a high harvest intensity using the sum of the column h for high level of harvest intensity of the fundamental matrix of the modified markov chain the return times for the 36 markov chains ranged from 1 11 to 99 11 years smaller return times represent high harvesting pressure high frequency of high harvest years and larger values represent low pressure low frequency of high harvest years see gaoue et al 2013 2 5 age specific mortality in stochastic environments we then construct a model that includes environmental dynamics and life stage transitions in each state of the environment to determine the mean survivorship to age x of a cohort in the context of a dynamic harvesting environment since all individuals are born into one specific harvest environment or another specified as a we calculated l a x the average survivorship to age x for all individuals born in harvest environment a here l a x is calculated for each of the 3 harvest intensities a as the sum of the first column of the matrix on the right side of the following equation tuljapurkar and horvitz 2006 metcalf et al 2009 4 l a x e m x 1 q a 1 where the subscript 1 indicates the first column of the matrix e is a block matrix made up of a row of 3 blocks where each block is i q a is a block matrix made up of a column of 3 blocks where each block is an 5 5 matrix and only the ath block is nonzero and its corresponding q matrix and m is the 15 15 megamatrix that combines the population and environment level dynamics pascarella and horvitz 1998 tuljapurkar and horvitz 2006 5 m c i u a where u a is also a block matrix of 3 3 blocks each 5 5 with zeros everywhere except in the blocks that form the diagonal of the block matrix where the three q are inserted is the kronecker product and c is a 3 state harvest markov transition matrix as described above we provide r scripts to estimate the age specific survivorship and mortality risk both in constant and stochastic environments at https github com ogaoue age from stage the population mean matrices and markov chains used for these analyses are available in dryad digital data repository gaoue et al 2013 gaoue 2015 2016 3 results 3 1 age specific population structure cohorts of k senegalensis born in different environments differ markedly in the stages they were projected to attain by certain ages especially between dry and moist regions in the dry region most individuals remain in the juvenile stage even though they may attain 186 years of age fig 1 d e indicating a delay in reaching maturity nearly 100 of the old individuals in the low and medium harvest environments are juveniles while in the high harvest environment 20 of the survivors will be in the adult phase by this age fig 1 f in contrast in the moist region plants mature more rapidly than in the dry region by 186 years of age 20 100 and 100 of survivors are reproductive adults respectively in the low medium and high harvest environments fig 1 a c surprisingly the proportion of a cohort that attains reproductive status by late ages is lowest in the low harvest environments in both moist and dry regions fig 1 a d compared to the others all together harvest facilitated the transition to reproductive stages regardless of the environmental conditions however this process was the fastest in more challenging environmental conditions 3 2 effects of harvest and climate on age specific mortality in constant environments for populations harvested at constant rate over time patterns of age specific mortality rate varied between regions mortality trajectories plateaued at different ages depending upon harvesting intensity fig 2 a b in both regions the rate of mortality was higher at young ages and quickly declined within the first 20 years quicker in the dry region than in the moist in the moist region mortality trajectories in the low and high harvest populations showed a bathtub shape and plateaued from the bottom fig 2 a young individuals escaped juvenile mortality after about 20 years and risk of mortality gradually increased thereafter to reach a mortality plateau the long term rate of mortality individuals in low harvest populations escaped juvenile mortality after 10 years and their mortality trajectory plateaued at around 35 years the fastest but had a higher long term mortality rate than those in high harvest populations the mortality plateau was the same for high and medium harvest populations in the dry region age specific mortality rates declined quickly and plateaued from the top fig 2 b similar to the moist region the plateau was reached first in low harvest populations after 20 years then in the medium harvest populations after 30 years and later by high harvest populations after 50 years however contrary to the moist region the mortality plateau for low harvest populations was lower than the one in medium or high harvest populations 3 3 age specific mortality in stochastic environments for models with variable harvesting intensity over time age specific mortality trajectories showed more variance between harvest sequences in the moist fig 3 a than in the dry region fig 3 b in the dry region for each harvesting sequence mortality rate dropped gradually to reach a plateau fig 3 b the values of the mortality plateau were lower when harvesting pressure was high than when harvesting pressure decreased fig 3 c this suggests that the mortality plateau was reached earlier for populations under high harvest pressure than the ones that were allowed more time to recover in the moist region except for a few harvesting sequences mortality trajectories departed from the general trend found in dry region fig 3 a 4 discussion we studied the effects of climatic differences tree defoliation and bark removal by indigenous people on the dynamics of population structure and age specific mortality of african mahogany our results show a strong effect of climatic differences on the shape of age specific mortality trajectories and long term risk of mortality of k senegalensis as it is often the case for many overstory tree species nepstad et al 2007 phillips et al 2010 these differences were driven by the effect of climatic difference on the dynamics of age specific population structure fig 1 specifically individual residence time in juvenile life stage delay to reproduce drives the shape of the mortality trajectories in the dry region as a response to drought individuals reach reproductive size age later than in the moist region gaoue and ticktin 2008 this delay in reaching reproductive size age leads to juvenile dominated cohorts over the long term in contrast in the moist region where individual growth is relatively fast most individuals transition to the reproductive stage within 90 years fig 1 b c with the exception of low harvest populations where juveniles dominate the population consequently populations that experienced low harvest intensity in the moist region exhibit age specific mortality trajectories fig 2 a that are similar to those observed in the dry region fig 2 b our results illustrate that the extent of reproductive delay is critical in understanding the dynamics of age specific mortality the slight increase in mortality rate observed in the moist region when cohorts are dominated by newly reproductive trees may be due to the cost of accelerated juvenile growth see mangel and munch 2005 we found greater differences in age specific mortality trajectories between climatic regions than between harvesting intensities suggesting that climate has a stronger effect on age specific mortality than harvest as a result of delayed reproduction and subsequent overdominance of juveniles in the population structure over time in the dry region the mortality trajectories approached the plateau from high values while the contrary was true for the moist region previous studies of k senegalensis reported similar trends of a stronger effect of climate than non timber forest products harvest on population dynamics gaoue and ticktin 2010 gaoue et al 2011a these results are also consistent with recent reports on the significant role of climate rather than disturbance but see morrison et al 2016 on forest composition rugemalila et al 2016 diversity rito et al 2017 and dynamics martinez ramos et al 2009 mceachern et al 2009 toledo et al 2011 by comparing the two regions our results provide insights into how plants may respond to change in climate there is a gradual shift in climatic conditions in our study areas the current dry region is projected to become drier and future climates in the moist region are likely to resemble those in the current dry region paeth and hense 2004 under a drier climate scenario the age specific mortality trajectories of k senegalensis in the moist region will converge to the one currently observed in the dry region fig 2 b reproductive stages might become critically rare in most populations of the study species under increased drought in all the regions as demonstrated in our study see fig 1 harvest by favoring transition to reproductive stages both in the moist and dry regions might buffer the effect of drought previous studies indicated that ntfp harvest has negative effects on both the short gaoue 2016 and long term gaoue et al 2011a dynamics of our study species and other tropical plant species ghimire et al 2008 here we show that by investigating a different set of demographic parameters beyond population growth rate the effect of harvest may be beneficial see also fuller et al 2015 thom et al 2017 however it is simplistic to assume that this finding alone is evidence that harvesting must be encouraged as a strategy to limit the effect of climate change a more global analysis of how harvest affects a wide range of demographic parameters population growth rate age at first reproduction mortality trajectories damping ratio the yield and quality of harvested products is necessary to fully address this question gaoue et al 2013 a bathtub like age specific mortality trajectory is most commonly reported for iteroparous perennial plants silvertown et al 2001 however there is increasing evidence that a reduced mortality rate at older ages is more common than previously thought vaupel et al 2004 including in several tropical trees such as garcinia lucida guedje et al 2003 and cecropia obtusifolia alvarez buylla and martinez ramos 1992 several other studies provided empirical evidence of a diversity of age specific mortality trajectories in tropical and temperate trees silvertown et al 2001 horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 metcalf et al 2009 baudisch et al 2013 our results contribute to that body of work and indicate a climate driven within species variation in age specific mortality trajectories we demonstrate that at least for our study species such within species variation is related to the extent of delay in reproduction across populations one reason why most studies failed to elucidate the within species variation in mortality trajectories owe to the lack of spatial replication of study sites a limited number of sites are often studied within the same ecological region where species have similar dynamics of age specific mortality rate across sites one of the strengths of our study is that we took advantage of large demographic dataset covering a total of twelve independent populations this allowed us to examine the within species heterogeneity in mortality trajectories in fact by investigating how these trajectories change as a result of climatic difference and disturbance regimes that are frequent in our study region ntfp harvest we were able to show how harvest and climate related delay in reaching maturity size age see also souther and mcgraw 2014 may lead to a diversity of mortality trajectories for a given species our results underscore the importance of long term studies and of spatially heterogeneous data to further our understanding of population responses to disturbance climate change and their interactions acknowledgments this work was supported by a start up grant from the university of tennessee knoxville and the international

ecologists because such patterns unveil selective forces and evolutionary history hamilton 1966 crews 1993 vaupel et al 1998 larson 2001 tuljapurkar et al 2007 evidence is accumulating that age specific mortality trajectories are highly diverse across the tree of life jones et al 2014 horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 metcalf et al 2009 salguero gómez et al 2013 baudisch et al 2013 ranging from trajectories with increasing to decreasing or constant mortality rates with age silvertown et al 2001 roach and gampe 2004 horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 garcia et al 2011 baudisch et al 2013 for stage structured populations these trajectories converge toward an asymptote a late age mortality plateau which represents the long term age specific mortality rate horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 our understanding of how global changes may alter species life history particularly intraspecific variation in age specific mortality trajectories in plants is limited salguero gómez et al 2013 existing studies mostly focus on vertebrate and bird species and show that individuals adapt to environmental conditions they experience throughout life by means of different age specific mortality schedules lemaître et al 2015 given that global change projections indicate frequent and longer drought spells allen et al 2010 knowledge about adaptive shaping of demographic patterns will be crucial to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant populations response to chronic anthropogenic disturbance under climate change scenarios a recent study examines how hunting as a form of harvest can alter the rate of senescence for lesser snow geese in the wild in canada and suggests no significant effect koons et al 2014 obviously hunting which is akin to logging trees removes individual from the population therefore the effect of this kind of lethal harvest on age specific mortality trajectories is rather direct and may not affect species aging patterns non lethal harvest of plants is widespread in the wild and this may offer a better opportunity to examine the ways in which chronic human disturbance affects life history and changes tree senescence gaoue et al 2013 non lethal harvesting of wild plants often involves removal of products such as fruits foliage bark and resin known as non timber forest products ntfp and which serve as important source of food medicine and contribute to the livelihoods of millions of people worldwide ticktin 2004 birch et al 2010 ntfp harvest does not always lead to direct death of harvested individuals however it can have far reaching ecological and evolutionary impacts both at the population and community levels moegenburg and levey 2002 trauernicht et al 2006 gaoue and ticktin 2010 non timber forest products harvest can reduce population growth rate in both constant schmidt et al 2011 and stochastic environments ticktin et al 2002 with significant changes to plant life history traits for example harvesting can alter plant leaf economics gaoue et al 2011b with further reduction of individual size and delay the onset of reproduction mcgraw 2001 law and salick 2005 gaoue et al 2013 the effects of non lethal harvest on plant life history can further be exacerbated by drought for example greater cost of adaptation to drought often leads to slower individual growth rate in dry areas tyree and ewers 1991 this reduction in growth can potentially delay reproduction and change the patterns of age specific mortality from that of populations in moist environments with faster individual growth in this study we investigated how climate and non lethal harvesting of wild plants for non timber forest products affect age specific mortality patterns studies on the age specific mortality of plants are rare roach et al 2009 roach 2012 this is partly due to difficulties in estimating individual plant age for relatively short lived plants it is possible to conduct experiments where multiple cohorts are planted and tracked over multiple years so as to describe the age specific demography see roach 2003 roach and gampe 2004 picó and retana 2008 however for long lived plants such as trees such experiment may not be feasible over a long enough time period to cover that lifespan other alternatives include using molecular based techniques ally et al 2010 or dendrochronology von arx et al 2006 to estimate plant age and then determine age specific mortality trajectories recent developments in matrix theory provide analytical tools to estimate age specific demographic mortality and reproductive rates in both deterministic and stochastic environments using stage structured projection matrices cochran and ellner 1992 horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 caswell and salguero gómez 2013 this approach has already been used to study the dynamics of age specific mortality in plants e g silvertown et al 2001 metcalf et al 2009 baudisch et al 2013 and provides rare opportunities to investigate how species ranking in the fast slow life history continuum predicts the rate of demographic senescence jones et al 2008 2014 using the age from stage modeling ultimately furthers our understanding of the evolution of senescence across the tree of life shefferson et al 2017 particularly the rarity of senescence in angiosperms and long lived plants species which were previously less understood baudisch et al 2013 however these studies either did not account for environmental stochasticity or consider among populations variation in age specific mortality rate here we used four years of demographic data from twelve populations with different harvesting histories and age from stage matrix modeling to estimate age specific mortality rate for khaya senegalensis meliaceae in two climatic regions of benin west africa k senegalensis is a tropical tree harvested for its bark as medicine and its foliage as an important source of fodder for cattle during the dry season gaoue and ticktin 2007 foliage and bark harvesting in most cases does not kill adult individuals but alter their growth and reproductive patterns gaoue et al 2011a bufford and gaoue 2015 because the ntfp harvest system we studied is particular and harvesting in this case is non lethal it is possible to model at the individual or population level different temporal sequences of foliage and bark harvest in previous studies gaoue et al 2011a and gaoue et al 2013 show that consistent with local harvesters practices see gaoue and ticktin 2009 turner et al 2000 the stochastic sequence of harvest intensities matters the intensity of foliage harvest by the fulani harvesters in a given year depends on previous year harvesting intensity gaoue and ticktin 2009 in addition a population harvested at high h intensity e g 90 of branches pruned for five consecutive years and then at low l intensity e g 10 of branches pruned for the next five years hhhhhlllll would respond differently from one that has experienced five years of high and five years of low harvest intensity but spread out over the 10 years time period hlhlhlhlhl consistent with this tuljapurkar and haridas 2006 show that temporal autocorrelation can have a sizable effect on population dynamics the effect of any sequence of harvest on population demography will depend on the ecological conditions in which harvesting takes places in this study we take advantage of a detailed demographic dataset on k senegalensis in two contrasting climatic regions of benin west africa to test the effects of climatic differences between regions dry vs moist and harvest strategies constant vs stochastically variable rate on its age specific risk of mortality we modeled the stochastic temporal sequence of harvest using a markov process which allows us to test the effect of varying harvest intensity for a given site by using a markov process to model the temporal sequence of fulani harvesting practices we assumed that harvesting is not done randomly but that there is a temporal autocorrelation in harvesting intensities over time caswell 2001 gaoue et al 2011a tuljapurkar et al 2003 our study indicates that difference in climate drives the dynamics of the age specific mortality trajectories whereas the impact of harvesting regardless of the strategy on these trajectories is modest 2 materials and methods 2 1 study system african mahogany k senegalensis meliaceae is a tropical tree distributed in africa across multiple habitats from gallery forests to savanna woodland between 8 and 14 n normand and sallenave 1958 ctft 1988 the tree is a semi deciduous shade intolerant monoecious tree with wind dispersed flat winged seeds and insect pollinated small white hermaphrodite flowers ctft 1988 k senegalensis is a slow growing tree that may reach up to 30 m in height in benin it reaches an observed maximum diameter at breast height dbh of 136 2 cm gaoue and ticktin 2007 gaoue et al 2014 which would be the equivalent of 187 years considering an average diameter increment of 0 73 cm yr for most tree species in the region see sokpon and biaou 2002 we studied the dynamics of k senegalensis populations in two contrasting ecological regions in benin west africa these two regions cover the latitudes 8 12 n at which the species is found in its distribution range in africa the sudanian region 9 30 12 n is dry with lower rainfall 800 1000 mm year fewer rainy months shorter plant growing season 145 days and higher mean temperature 2431 c than the moist sudano guinean region 7 30 9 30 n annual rainfall 1000 1300 mm year plant growing period 200 days temperature 25 29 c details about the ecological differences between the dry and moist regions are provided elsewhere gaoue and ticktin 2007 2010 k senegalensis was one of the first timber species exported from africa during the colonial era normand and sallenave 1958 commercial companies and local populations illegally harvested the timber to depletion in several part of its distribution range foliage is heavily harvested from remnant standing populations by indigenous fulani people across west africa to feed cattle during the peak dry season petit 2003 gaoue and ticktin 2007 the fulani specialize in raising cattle which are a vital source of income for them and an integral part of their culture gaoue and ticktin 2009 harvested k senegalensis trees often lose 80 of their canopy gaoue and ticktin 2007 and most of harvested populations have been pruned since the severe drought of the 1970s l hote et al 2002 2 2 demographic data we collected data on growth survival and fruit production of k senegalensis individuals over 4 years 2004 2007 in twelve 1 ha permanent plots equally distributed between the dry and moist regions k senegalensis only occurs in gallery forest in the dry region whereas in the moist region it is also found in dry dense forest and woodland we established our study populations to sample across the range of these differences in habitat and harvest intensity for each population we estimated the percent of trees harvested pruned and or debarked individuals trees were more likely pruned than debarked and we assumed the former would have stronger effects on population demography pruned trees often have 80 of their canopy harvested while at most 25 of trunk were debarked gaoue and ticktin 2007 using this harvesting data and following gaoue et al 2011a 2013 we categorized each population into one of three levels of harvest intensity low medium or high depending on the proportion of trees harvested for foliage and bark populations with fewer than 25 of trees harvested were classified as low harvest l medium harvest m populations were those with 25 50 of trees harvested and high harvest h populations had more than 50 of trees harvested in the moist region we were able to find and survey three low two medium and one high harvest populations while in the dry region there were three low one medium and two high harvest populations our study with 12 independent populations represents one of the largest sample sizes in demographic studies salguero gómez et al 2015 however such unbalanced design limited our ability to uncover any non linear response to harvest but still allowed to test for the global effect of harvest on age specific mortality 2 3 age from stage matrix model for each population and year we built a 5 5 stage based projection matrix a caswell 2001 we defined five life stages using the basal diameter for seedlings and saplings and diameter at breast height dbh for juvenile and adults based on previous results on the size specific survival and reproduction see gaoue and ticktin 2008 2010 for details seedlings basal diameter 2 cm saplings 2 5 cm juveniles 5 20 cm small reproductive 20 40 cm and large reproductive adults dbh 40 cm each matrix transition element was estimated only when we had more than 5 observations for transition elements for which we have less than 5 individuals we used values estimated from a pooled matrix across populations with similar climate and harvesting treatments we averaged the elements of the projection matrices across populations and years by harvest intensity to obtain three matrices low medium and high in each region we split each matrix a into a fertility matrix f and a transition matrix q the latter representing only transitions among stages of already existing individuals a q f the stage duration matrix n also known as the fundamental matrix which captures how much time an individual plant is expected to spend in each life stage before dying cochran and ellner 1992 1 n i q 1 where i is an 5 5 identity matrix we estimated mean survivorship to age x for populations harvested at constant rate over time following caswell 2001 2 l x e t q x where e t is a 5 1 column vector of ones used to sum up the columns of matrix q x by varying the age x we established the age specific stage structure which captures the variation in the proportion of each k senegalensis life stages over time see fig 1 we performed the above analysis for each of the six q matrices two climatic regions three harvest intensities we calculated the age specific mortality rate μ x the rate of decrease in survivorship as follows horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 3 μ x log l x log l x 1 where l x 1 is the survivorship to age x 1 the age specific mortality trajectory may show different patterns of increasing or decreasing rates with age but eventually will converge to an asymptote log λ where λ is the dominant eigenvalue of matrix q this asymptote is the mortality plateau and represents the long term rate of mortality horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 2 4 simulating stochastic harvest environments calculating the mean survivorship to age x when harvest intensity varies stochastically over time requires a markov chain model for the harvest dynamics essentially a model of environmental dynamics where each state of the environment corresponds to one of three harvest intensities low medium and high see for details gaoue et al 2011a 2013 we modeled the temporal sequence of harvest intensity as a stochastic markov process using 3 3 markov transition matrices c that define probability rules to generate a temporal sequence of harvest intensities that a given population will experience over the long run tuljapurkar et al 2003 gaoue et al 2013 each matrix element c αβ represents the probability that a population that is currently harvested at intensity β will be harvested at intensity α the next year to generate plausible temporal sequences of harvesting pressures for a given population we created 36 different 3 state markov chains c these chains were selected to each simulate a specific management option and to represent a range of harvesting pressure which was measured by their return times to high harvest each markov chain c can be characterized by its serial autocorrelation and a return time to high harvest which is the average number of years spent in each state of the environment before returning to a high harvest year to calculate the return time to high harvest for each markov chain model of harvest dynamics we use the environment level analogue to the fundamental matrix n in eq 1 see caswell 2001 tuljapurkar and horvitz 2006 for detailed method in this environmental state duration equation we considered high harvest intensity state h as the absorbing state or death that is to replace all the elements of the third row which represents high harvest state of markov matrix c with zeros then we determined the first passage time to the absorbing state h for populations starting at a high harvest intensity using the sum of the column h for high level of harvest intensity of the fundamental matrix of the modified markov chain the return times for the 36 markov chains ranged from 1 11 to 99 11 years smaller return times represent high harvesting pressure high frequency of high harvest years and larger values represent low pressure low frequency of high harvest years see gaoue et al 2013 2 5 age specific mortality in stochastic environments we then construct a model that includes environmental dynamics and life stage transitions in each state of the environment to determine the mean survivorship to age x of a cohort in the context of a dynamic harvesting environment since all individuals are born into one specific harvest environment or another specified as a we calculated l a x the average survivorship to age x for all individuals born in harvest environment a here l a x is calculated for each of the 3 harvest intensities a as the sum of the first column of the matrix on the right side of the following equation tuljapurkar and horvitz 2006 metcalf et al 2009 4 l a x e m x 1 q a 1 where the subscript 1 indicates the first column of the matrix e is a block matrix made up of a row of 3 blocks where each block is i q a is a block matrix made up of a column of 3 blocks where each block is an 5 5 matrix and only the ath block is nonzero and its corresponding q matrix and m is the 15 15 megamatrix that combines the population and environment level dynamics pascarella and horvitz 1998 tuljapurkar and horvitz 2006 5 m c i u a where u a is also a block matrix of 3 3 blocks each 5 5 with zeros everywhere except in the blocks that form the diagonal of the block matrix where the three q are inserted is the kronecker product and c is a 3 state harvest markov transition matrix as described above we provide r scripts to estimate the age specific survivorship and mortality risk both in constant and stochastic environments at https github com ogaoue age from stage the population mean matrices and markov chains used for these analyses are available in dryad digital data repository gaoue et al 2013 gaoue 2015 2016 3 results 3 1 age specific population structure cohorts of k senegalensis born in different environments differ markedly in the stages they were projected to attain by certain ages especially between dry and moist regions in the dry region most individuals remain in the juvenile stage even though they may attain 186 years of age fig 1 d e indicating a delay in reaching maturity nearly 100 of the old individuals in the low and medium harvest environments are juveniles while in the high harvest environment 20 of the survivors will be in the adult phase by this age fig 1 f in contrast in the moist region plants mature more rapidly than in the dry region by 186 years of age 20 100 and 100 of survivors are reproductive adults respectively in the low medium and high harvest environments fig 1 a c surprisingly the proportion of a cohort that attains reproductive status by late ages is lowest in the low harvest environments in both moist and dry regions fig 1 a d compared to the others all together harvest facilitated the transition to reproductive stages regardless of the environmental conditions however this process was the fastest in more challenging environmental conditions 3 2 effects of harvest and climate on age specific mortality in constant environments for populations harvested at constant rate over time patterns of age specific mortality rate varied between regions mortality trajectories plateaued at different ages depending upon harvesting intensity fig 2 a b in both regions the rate of mortality was higher at young ages and quickly declined within the first 20 years quicker in the dry region than in the moist in the moist region mortality trajectories in the low and high harvest populations showed a bathtub shape and plateaued from the bottom fig 2 a young individuals escaped juvenile mortality after about 20 years and risk of mortality gradually increased thereafter to reach a mortality plateau the long term rate of mortality individuals in low harvest populations escaped juvenile mortality after 10 years and their mortality trajectory plateaued at around 35 years the fastest but had a higher long term mortality rate than those in high harvest populations the mortality plateau was the same for high and medium harvest populations in the dry region age specific mortality rates declined quickly and plateaued from the top fig 2 b similar to the moist region the plateau was reached first in low harvest populations after 20 years then in the medium harvest populations after 30 years and later by high harvest populations after 50 years however contrary to the moist region the mortality plateau for low harvest populations was lower than the one in medium or high harvest populations 3 3 age specific mortality in stochastic environments for models with variable harvesting intensity over time age specific mortality trajectories showed more variance between harvest sequences in the moist fig 3 a than in the dry region fig 3 b in the dry region for each harvesting sequence mortality rate dropped gradually to reach a plateau fig 3 b the values of the mortality plateau were lower when harvesting pressure was high than when harvesting pressure decreased fig 3 c this suggests that the mortality plateau was reached earlier for populations under high harvest pressure than the ones that were allowed more time to recover in the moist region except for a few harvesting sequences mortality trajectories departed from the general trend found in dry region fig 3 a 4 discussion we studied the effects of climatic differences tree defoliation and bark removal by indigenous people on the dynamics of population structure and age specific mortality of african mahogany our results show a strong effect of climatic differences on the shape of age specific mortality trajectories and long term risk of mortality of k senegalensis as it is often the case for many overstory tree species nepstad et al 2007 phillips et al 2010 these differences were driven by the effect of climatic difference on the dynamics of age specific population structure fig 1 specifically individual residence time in juvenile life stage delay to reproduce drives the shape of the mortality trajectories in the dry region as a response to drought individuals reach reproductive size age later than in the moist region gaoue and ticktin 2008 this delay in reaching reproductive size age leads to juvenile dominated cohorts over the long term in contrast in the moist region where individual growth is relatively fast most individuals transition to the reproductive stage within 90 years fig 1 b c with the exception of low harvest populations where juveniles dominate the population consequently populations that experienced low harvest intensity in the moist region exhibit age specific mortality trajectories fig 2 a that are similar to those observed in the dry region fig 2 b our results illustrate that the extent of reproductive delay is critical in understanding the dynamics of age specific mortality the slight increase in mortality rate observed in the moist region when cohorts are dominated by newly reproductive trees may be due to the cost of accelerated juvenile growth see mangel and munch 2005 we found greater differences in age specific mortality trajectories between climatic regions than between harvesting intensities suggesting that climate has a stronger effect on age specific mortality than harvest as a result of delayed reproduction and subsequent overdominance of juveniles in the population structure over time in the dry region the mortality trajectories approached the plateau from high values while the contrary was true for the moist region previous studies of k senegalensis reported similar trends of a stronger effect of climate than non timber forest products harvest on population dynamics gaoue and ticktin 2010 gaoue et al 2011a these results are also consistent with recent reports on the significant role of climate rather than disturbance but see morrison et al 2016 on forest composition rugemalila et al 2016 diversity rito et al 2017 and dynamics martinez ramos et al 2009 mceachern et al 2009 toledo et al 2011 by comparing the two regions our results provide insights into how plants may respond to change in climate there is a gradual shift in climatic conditions in our study areas the current dry region is projected to become drier and future climates in the moist region are likely to resemble those in the current dry region paeth and hense 2004 under a drier climate scenario the age specific mortality trajectories of k senegalensis in the moist region will converge to the one currently observed in the dry region fig 2 b reproductive stages might become critically rare in most populations of the study species under increased drought in all the regions as demonstrated in our study see fig 1 harvest by favoring transition to reproductive stages both in the moist and dry regions might buffer the effect of drought previous studies indicated that ntfp harvest has negative effects on both the short gaoue 2016 and long term gaoue et al 2011a dynamics of our study species and other tropical plant species ghimire et al 2008 here we show that by investigating a different set of demographic parameters beyond population growth rate the effect of harvest may be beneficial see also fuller et al 2015 thom et al 2017 however it is simplistic to assume that this finding alone is evidence that harvesting must be encouraged as a strategy to limit the effect of climate change a more global analysis of how harvest affects a wide range of demographic parameters population growth rate age at first reproduction mortality trajectories damping ratio the yield and quality of harvested products is necessary to fully address this question gaoue et al 2013 a bathtub like age specific mortality trajectory is most commonly reported for iteroparous perennial plants silvertown et al 2001 however there is increasing evidence that a reduced mortality rate at older ages is more common than previously thought vaupel et al 2004 including in several tropical trees such as garcinia lucida guedje et al 2003 and cecropia obtusifolia alvarez buylla and martinez ramos 1992 several other studies provided empirical evidence of a diversity of age specific mortality trajectories in tropical and temperate trees silvertown et al 2001 horvitz and tuljapurkar 2008 metcalf et al 2009 baudisch et al 2013 our results contribute to that body of work and indicate a climate driven within species variation in age specific mortality trajectories we demonstrate that at least for our study species such within species variation is related to the extent of delay in reproduction across populations one reason why most studies failed to elucidate the within species variation in mortality trajectories owe to the lack of spatial replication of study sites a limited number of sites are often studied within the same ecological region where species have similar dynamics of age specific mortality rate across sites one of the strengths of our study is that we took advantage of large demographic dataset covering a total of twelve independent populations this allowed us to examine the within species heterogeneity in mortality trajectories in fact by investigating how these trajectories change as a result of climatic difference and disturbance regimes that are frequent in our study region ntfp harvest we were able to show how harvest and climate related delay in reaching maturity size age see also souther and mcgraw 2014 may lead to a diversity of mortality trajectories for a given species our results underscore the importance of long term studies and of spatially heterogeneous data to further our understanding of population responses to disturbance climate change and their interactions acknowledgments this work was supported by a start up grant from the university of tennessee knoxville and the international

25083,eutrophication is a major problem in the field of water environments at present and its main driving factors are light and nutrients in this paper the process of eutrophication in small artificial lake is studied according to the principle of water optics and conservation of mass the light and the nitrogen and phosphorus in water nutrients were selected as influencing factors and 16 different scenarios of light nutrients interaction conditions were designed by orthogonal experiment then water eutrophication model was used to analyze the process of eutrophication under different light nutrient scenarios according to the comparison of simulation results if the concentration of nutrients is increased under low light conditions the growth of algae will be inhibited and if the light condition is set to a fixed value the simulation results under different nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the water show that the effect of phosphorus on algae growth is greater than that of nitrogen in addition comparing the growth of algae under different light and phosphorus scenarios it can be seen that the light driven effect is more significant than that of phosphorus by simulating all the design scenarios and analyzing the results it can be found that the algae growth rate reaches a maximum when the light intensity and the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration increase to a certain range while continuing to increase the light and nutrient concentration exceeds a certain threshold range the rate of algae growth will be inhibited keywords eutrophication model interaction of light and nutrient algae bloom scenario analysis small artificial lake 1 introduction eutrophication is a process in which nitrogen n and phosphorus p nutrients are enriched in closed or semi closed water bodies such as lakes reservoirs or bays it will lead to increase of ecosystem productivity and cause some characteristic algae such as cyanophyta blue green algae and chlorophyta green algae to proliferate rapidly blooms which contributes further to water quality deterioration qin et al 2013 in recent years water eutrophication has become a hot issue in the field of water environments and the main cause of eutrophication is the excessive input of p and n schindler 2012 this is particularly true in rivers lakes and other water bodies influenced by high intensity human activities in the estuaries of some rivers the growth of aquatic organisms such as fish and oysters is seriously affected by prolonged eutrophication rikke et al 2018 moreover eutrophication even occurs in some coastal lagoons cenk et al 2017 excessive nutrients are a necessary condition for water eutrophication in which n is an important component of algae cells and p is involved in the photosynthesis and energy transformation processes of algae smayda 2007 the nitrogen concentration in a waterbody is strongly affected by algal growth and death processes and the external geochemical environment whereas the phosphorus concentration is more affected by seasonal hydrological processes oliver et al 2014 schindler 1977 therefore in order to effectively prevent and control eutrophication the mechanism of eutrophication and the key factors driving the rapid growth of algal populations need to be clarified first experimental observation and mathematical modeling are effective means to achieve this goal li et al 2016a b as a result more and more scholars in the field have carried out experiments to understand the mechanisms of water eutrophication and to find efficient methods to deal with this problem for example based on the role of n and p in water eutrophication a stable isotope framework was established to analyze the sources and fate of n and p in rivers as well as the importance of their roles in aquatic biological metabolism gooddy et al 2016 in the study of the relationship between n and p during eutrophication zhang et al 2016 the molar enthalpy of algae in water can be used to determine which portions of excessive n and p can be more effectively controlled to prevent the deterioration of water quality luo et al 2017 p can also be used to study the release pathways of nutrients in sediments to understand the mechanisms of organic matter enrichment and the relationship between the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles li et al 2016a b with this information relevant measures for the protection of aquatic environments can be implemented in addition light also plays an important role in eutrophication and surges in the growth of algae and aquatic plants zou et al 2013 according to the above research progress the formulation of relevant measures could play a greater role in improving water ecology and environments in this paper the research has explored the mechanisms by which light and nutrients influence the different aspects of algal growth of course the combination of temperature ph and other influencing factors can also be used to analyze eutrophication these will be carried out on the basis of this paper in the future this research considers that light is an important factor in the process of algal cell growth affecting the protein synthesis in cells harrison et al 1990 the work reported in this paper was mainly focused on study of the growth of algae in water and its effect on the eutrophication process of small artificial lakes due to the interaction of light and nutrient factors referring to the research results of previous scholars in the field of water environments lorenzen et al 1976 imboden and gachter 1978 nyholm 1978 cerco and cole 1993 dou et al 2002 alvarez vazquez and fernandez 2010 a lake eutrophication model is proposed herein that considers the interaction of light and nutrient light nutrient eutrophication model taking the small artificial lake meihu lake as the case the relationship between algae growth and its driving factors was obtained by studying the changes of light and nutrient conditions the research results can provide some guidance for prevention of eutrophication and for the management of lake environments 2 methods 2 1 study area and data collection taking meihu lake as the research object the algae growth process under different light and nutrient conditions was simulated and analyzed meihu lake is located in zhengzhou city of china and is a small artificial landscape lake with a water surface width of 30 60 m a length of about 500 m average water depth of about 1 5 m max water depth of about 1 9 m and water surface area of about 22 000 m2 in order to improve the flow of water some water circulation systems were built in meihu lake these include a local fountain located at the south end of the lake some vertical perforated pipe water circulation devices evenly distributed in the lake with the pipe mouths below the water surface and a circulation system running north to south the water supply sources include groundwater and rainwater in which groundwater recharge is the primary source and rainwater is stored in the lake after interception of large diameter materials and sediment of particulate matter the lake is divided into northern middle and southern sections the middle section is long where the water flow is slow and the terrain is relatively flat therefore under suitable weather conditions rapid algae growth in the lake can easily lead to the deterioration of water quality the terrain at the northern end of the lake is high with a high density of aquatic plants these plants play a certain role in water purification and help alleviate the deterioration of water quality there are some steps present at the south end and the southernmost part of the lake is the location of a fountain in section i there is a small island in the lake that is the area in which captive black swans are active because of the feeding waterfowl and the excrement they produce the water quality there is worse than in the other sections and more conducive to eutrophication to observe the changes in water quality five monitoring sections i ii iii iv v and 5 sampling points 1 2 3 4 5 were set in the lake the layout of the monitoring section and the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 and the longitude and latitude of the monitoring points are shown in table 1 ten on site experiments monitoring water quality and algae were conducted in sections i v of meihu lake from april to july 2015 the monitoring indicators include light intensity sd turbidity do water temperature chl a pyt water depth and flow velocity in the experiments 21 samples were collected at sampling points 1 5 on april 30 may 28 and june 29 and at sampling points 2 3 and 5 on may 16 and june 15 during the monitoring period the light is sufficient the temperature is stable at 20 30 and there is no dramatic climatic change it is suitable for algae growth the light intensity was detected using a portable light detector at 1 cm and 20

using a hach multi parameter water quality analyzer hach hydrolab ds5x the water quality indicators of water samples cod tp tn nh3 n and no3 n were tested according to relevant methods in the method for monitoring and analyzing water and wastewater other indicators were measured using the appropriate modules for water quality monitoring in the hach device boundary condition setting for hydrodynamic model and eutrophication model in this research 1 boundary conditions of hydrodynamic model the water in the lake is circulating and it is transported from the section ⅰ to the section v through the water pipe and flows into the lake from the section v in the hydrodynamic model section v is taken as the input boundary the discharge is output from section ⅰ there is a drainage outlet at section ⅰ and the water flows out through the drainage outlet and is lifted to section ⅰ by pumping station for recirculating recharge to the lake 2 boundary conditions of eutrophication model on the one hand water quality conditions flow into the lake from section v with water flow on the other hand point source diffusion is formed by feedstuff throwing at waterfowl farming area section 2 2 2 basic principles behind the creation of light nutrient eutrophication model the light nutrient eutrophication model developed in this study is composed of two parts a two dimensional 2 d hydrodynamic model 2 d hydrodynamic model briefly speaking in the process of simulating rivers lakes and other waters the velocity is set as two components to consider the movement of water flow for lakes li and shi 2007 and a eutrophication mechanism model driven by the light and nutrient factors of course the establishment of a three dimensional 3 d model can also clearly express such research for instance there is the improved 3 d hydrodynamic model reza et al 2016 to simulate lake conditions such as swamp wetlands or to simulate the flow of water combined with a wind and sediment transport model morales marin et al 2018 or to perform large scale spatial simulation chau et al 2002 the 3 d model could more specifically simulate the movement of natural waters but for various reasons such as small lake area shallow water depth and low flow rate this study was based on the 2 d hydrodynamic model to facilitate model construction and ensure the accuracy of the model simulation the hydrodynamic model is the basis for simulation of the process of solute transport and transformation with water flow it divides the calculation units according to the characteristics of water areas and simulates the process of change in the water level flow rate and velocity by using 2 d unsteady saint venant equations the model computational grid a and flow diagram b and c are shown in fig 2 based on the initial eutrophication model xia et al 2001 the light nutrient eutrophication model added the simulation of turbidity and transparency indexes and established a quantitative relationship between a light attenuation factor and transparency thereafter the description of the transformation mechanism among the dissolved suspended sedimented phases of the nutrients was also added to this model dou et al 2018 thus a light nutrient eutrophication model reflecting the effects of change in the light and nutrient conditions on algae growth and death processes was developed in the process of eutrophication model simulation the measured data of each monitoring section on april 30 was taken as the initial condition and the process of water quality change in monitoring section v was taken as the boundary condition the time step of the model was set to one day the relevant factors and transformation mechanisms included in the model are shown in table 2 and the internal mechanism of this model is shown in fig 3 the 2 d hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the lake flow state combined with the laws of mechanics and mass conservation and the evaporation and wind conditions were taken into account to establish the momentum equation of the 2 d hydrodynamic model li and shi 2007 1 h t u h x u h y α 0 2 u t u u x v u y f v g z x g u u 2 v 2 c 2 h ξ x 2 u τ x ρ h 3 v t u v x v v y f u

shear stress in the x and y direction respectively the mass transfer equation of migration diffusion is the basic equation of the eutrophication model which can describe the change law of water quality indexes in time and space in addition to the migration and diffusion terms the equation also includes some source sink terms the change of a material index in a unit volume of water in unit time is called the source sink term the increase of material concentration is called the source term and the decrease is called the sink term and could be caused by biological chemical and physical actions source sink term are referenced from water quality analysis simulation program wasp user s manual the basic equation of the water quality parameters is shown below 4 c t u c x v c y e x 2 c x 2 e y 2 c y 2 s where c is the content of the water quality index u and v are the flow velocity components in the direction of x and y respectively ex and ey are the diffusion coefficient components in the direction of x and y respectively and s is the total source sink term the dynamic process of algae growth plays an important role in the light nutrient eutrophication model and directly affects the transformation process of other water quality parameters the source sink term of the algae is as follows 5 s 1 g p 1 d p 1 k s 4 pyt where gp1 is the growth rate of algae dp1 is the death rate of algae ks4 is the degradation rate of algae pyt is the concentration of algae in the water and s 1 is the source sink term for algae the expression of the algal growth rate is a complex nonlinear function which is mainly controlled by external environmental conditions such as water temperature light intensity and nutrient concentration in some experiments chlorophyll a chl a was selected as the index of algal biomass calculation li et al 2015 or algal growth was calculated by observing the turbulence characteristics of the water bodies marshall and sala 2011 however these were not consistent with the analysis of influencing factors in this study di toro s research considered the influence of various factors such as light temperature and nutrients and showed that the algae growth rate can be expressed as the product of the above factors di tiro 1980 which is shown as follows 6 g p 1 g max g t g i g n where gmax is the maximum growth rate of algae g t is the temperature regulatory factor g t t t opi exp 1 t t opi t is the actual water temperature and topi is the best water temperature for algae growth g i is the light attenuation factor g i i i opi exp 1 i i opi while i is the actual light intensity under water surface and iopi is the best light intensity for the growth of algae g n is the nutrition restriction factor according to the minimum element

and kmp are the michaelis constant michaelis constant half rate coefficient the concentration of n and p in the water when the algae growth rate is equal to half of its maximum growth rate of n and p intake for algae growth respectively and tn and tp are the total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in the water respectively 2 3 driving mechanism of the light factor itself affected by factors such as weather water transparency and water depth the light intensity changes greatly under water and directly influences the growth of algae if the light energy effect is calculated from the aspect of light radiation zhang et al 2003 or if the relationship between the light absorbed by the particles in the water is used to describe the change of light song et al 2017 the relationship between light intensity and transparency cannot be linked in order to make the model more systematic the beer s law wang et al 2008 was used to express a law for the variation of underwater light intensity 7 i h i 0 exp λh where i 0 is the light intensity at the water surface ih is the light intensity at h water depth and λ is the attenuation coefficient of light which is inversely proportional to the transparency of the water some research zhang et al 2016 indicates that water transparency which is affected by the concentration of chl a cod and suspended matter plays a dominate role in the attenuation of light intensity in water therefore based on the actual monitored light intensity data at 1 cm and 20 cm under water the light attenuation coefficient of the study area was obtained by combining eq 7 and the mathematical relationship between the light attenuation coefficient and water transparency was established in order to study the change rule of water transparency the main water quality factors including turbidity do ph conductivity chl a pyt water depth velocity cod bod5 tp and tn that affect the change of transparency were first identified based on the experimental data and then the quantitative relationship between water transparency and the main factors was established finally the relationship was coupled with the eutrophication model of the lake with this the effect of light intensity change on the algae growth process could be simulated 2 4 driving mechanism of the nutrient factor the accumulation of nutrients such as n and p in water is an important condition driving water eutrophication and algae growth in this the process of nitrogen cycling begins with the intake of ip such as nh3 n and no3 n by algae from which the algae can obtain energy and synthesize its cell when the algae die they settle down as part of the sediment and decompose to release op the op is converted into nh3 n through mineralization finally it is further converted into no3 n by nitrification the source sink term of the various forms of nitrogen concentration can be expressed as follows 8 n h 3 n s 2 k 71 θ 71 t 20 on k 12 θ 12 t 20 n h 3 d p1 g p1 p n

n h 3 was referenced from wasp user s manual c4 is the carbon in algae cell vs is the deposition rate of algae d is the average water depth the source sink term of the tp concentration can be expressed as follows 13 tp s 5 d p 1 g p 1 a p c p y t 14 p in algae cells c 4 a p c t g p 1 d p 1 v s d c 4 a p c where apc is the ratio of phosphorus to carbon p c in the algae cells dissolved

to carbon o c in algae respiration d o s is saturated dissolved oxygen in addition there are many aquatic plants growing on the north side of the lake the research includes the purification of water by aquatic plants the absorption of nutrients by aquatic plants in water is similar to that of algae in water and this article discusses the effects of light and nutrients on eutrophication therefore the process of growth dynamics of aquatic plants is no longer introduced 2 5 design of the light nutrient interaction scenarios to comprehend the driving effect on algae growth of different light and nutrient conditions this experiment was carried out by combining orthogonal design and scenario simulation orthogonal design is an experimental design method that studies the effects of multiple factors some representative combinations of factors are selected from among those in a comprehensive experimental design to conduct experimental analysis tang and feng 2010 the characteristic of this method is that only a few representative experiments can be used to find out the degree of influence of each factor on the test result and a better combination of experimental conditions can be selected from these in order to describe the growth of algae under the interaction of light and nutrient factors four light conditions 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 times the original monitored light intensity and the tn or tp concentrations 1 4 times the original monitored water quality concentrations were set finally according to the principle of orthogonal design 16 scenarios of light and nutrient combinations involving three factors light intensity and the concentrations of tp and tn at four different levels were obtained scenario simulation is realized by means of the designed light nutrient eutrophication model when different scenarios are set up in the experiment the reference data were the detected values of light total nitrogen and total phosphorus then the algae growth concentration under the corresponding scenario was simulated by changing the multiple of the measured values and re inputting the model as the initial condition the scenario conditions are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 acquisition of the light attenuation coefficient the light attenuation coefficient is an important parameter for calculating the intensity of underwater light according to the experimental light intensity at 1 cm and 20 cm under water and eq 4 the light attenuation coefficient in the water was calculated the correlation between the light attenuation coefficient and the water transparency was analyzed and the fitting equation and the fit plot of the two were obtained the results are shown in eq 17 and fig 4 the fitting degree of the fitting equation was 0 89 which indicated that the correlation of the light attenuation coefficient with the water transparency was well as shown in eq 17 the two were negatively correlated which indicates that the light attenuation coefficient decreases when the water transparency increases 17 λ 1 70842 s d 0 00056 on the basis of the measured data and the correlation analysis between water transparency and other water quality indicators there was significant correlation between water transparency and turbidity chl a cod and tn and the correlation coefficient was relatively large moreover based on the relationship between water transparency and other factors multiple linear regression analysis was performed on the measured data this was done after processing by the following treatment methods water transparency was converted to a natural logarithm turbidity became the fourth root of the original chl a and cod were taken as logarithmic values and the logarithmic base was 10 when turbidity chl a cod and tn were used to obtain a multivariate linear fitting equation it was different from that obtained prior to data processing the non standard coefficients and significance of the factors and constants are shown in table 4 18 s d 85 422 0 03 x 1 0 44 x 2 0 785 x 3 12 83 x 4 19 ln s d 4 797 0 154 x 1 1 4 0 362 lg x 2 0 549 lg x 3 0 259 x 4 the multiple regression equation between the transparency of meihu lake and its influencing factors can be seen in table 4 where eq 18 is the multiple regression equation obtained using the original data and eq 19 is the multivariate regression equation obtained after the treatment of each factor by comparison it was found that the fitting degree of eq 18 was 0 703 and that of eq 19 was 0 717 both results were good but the latter result was better according to the regression equation before treatment the significance of the non standardized coefficient of turbidity and chl a was 0 089 and 0 222 respectively the significance levels were all greater than 0 05 which indicated that the significance of the non standardized coefficient of turbidity and chl a was not obvious in this equation however according to the regression analysis after data treatment the significance of non standardized coefficient of turbidity and chl a were 0 057 and 0 054 respectively and the significance level was close to 0 05 which indicated that the significance of the non standardized coefficient of turbidity and chl a were more obvious in the equation after data treatment therefore the multivariate linear regression equation obtained using the processed monitoring data was used to simulate the change of the transparency index of meihu lake in the subsequent calculation process turbidity is an important restrictive factor affecting the transparency of water and it is the reflection of the absorption and scattering of light by suspended matter in water the logarithmic fitting equation based on the relationship between suspended solids and transparency zhang et al 2003 or the correlation simulation method based on the reciprocal relationship between transparency and suspended solids yang et al 2003 can be proved this paper calculated the relationship between the transparency and fourth power root of turbidity which satisfies the results of the above methods and reflects the relationship between the transparency and turbidity of meihu lake chl a participates in the photosynthesis of algae and can be used as an indicator of the influence of algae on light intensity in this study we analyzed the relationship between chl a and light intensity and proved that there is a strong correlation between them and the two have a mutual effect in water dissolved organic matter also affects the transparency of water especially the complex chemical composition of colored soluble substances in this paper cod is used to analyze the correlation between dissolved organic matter and water transparency which shows a good significance the influence of tp and tn on water transparency is also remarkable the experiment shows that tn has a greater effect on water transparency than tp and has a negative correlation with water transparency if the concentration of tn increases the water transparency will decrease significantly 3 2 parameter calibration and model verification 3 2 1 parameter calibration and verification of the hydrodynamic model adopting the measured data for water flow and water level of meihu lake from april to july 2015 different lake bottom roughness and drag coefficients were selected monitoring section v was set as the inflow section and monitoring section i was set as the outflow section to simulate the hydrodynamic index values of the various monitoring sections through calibration of the model it can be shown that when the bottom roughness and drag coefficient of meihu lake was 0 024 and 0 6 respectively the simulation results of the water flow and level of the monitoring sections were ideal fig 5 shows the simulation results for the monitoring sections ii and iv the maximal relative error and the average relative error were used to analyze the simulation performance of the hydrodynamic model fig 5 the maximal relative errors of the flow of the monitoring sections ii and iv were 16 12 and 28 5 respectively and the average relative errors were 11 63 and 19 8 respectively the maximal relative errors of the water level of the monitoring sections ii and iv were 5 8 and 4 78 respectively and the average relative errors were 2 96 and 3 2 respectively in a word the error of the model calculation results was relatively small and the simulation accuracy met the reasonable conditions meihu lake is a small artificial lake with an area of more than 20 000 square meters the lake bed is built smoothly and the elevation difference between north and south is small therefore the water level is in a stable state the water flow is mainly driven by gravity caused by the elevation difference between north and south and the outflow pressure at the water supply outlet in the lake and the velocity is slow the established hydrodynamic model regards meihu lake as a small river flowing from north to south to simulate its flow characteristics therefore water level and velocity are taken as hydrodynamic parameters in this paper which accords with the actual situation and the results are reliable 3 2 2 parameter calibration and verification of the light nutrient eutrophication model because of the many parameters of the eutrophication model established this time it was cumbersome to calibrate them one by one thus to verify the parameters a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was carried out first and the initial values referred to the recommended values of the parameters given by the relevant research results after this the values of the sensitive parameters were continuously adjusted and their rationality was analyzed according to the simulation results in order to optimize the overall fitting of the model the sensitive parameters were adjusted as a whole during which the initial values of the insensitive parameters were maintained the parameters obtained according to the above method were the final values used in the calibration shown in table 5 the maximum growth rate of algae optimal water temperature of algae growth optimal light intensity of algae growth half speed constant of algae growth nitrogen intake and the half speed constant of algae growth phosphorus intake are referenced to the source of eq 6 di tiro 1980 the apc and anc of the algae were determined according to the wasp user s manual and the algae growth parameters of an eco tank experiment feng et al 2005 and then adjusted using the light nutrient eutrophication model after a review of research for existing results yang et al 2016 the other parameters were calibrated according to the combination of measured data and eqs 8 16 and then verified in the proposed model the parameters were determined repeatedly until the optimal value for each parameter was finally obtained the maximum relative error and average relative error were also used to analyze the simulation results of the water eutrophication model for the monitoring sections ii and iv the maximum and average relative error of pyt tn tp cod sd are shown in table 6 overall the error of the model calculation results was relatively small and the simulation accuracy were reasonable the results are shown in fig 6 according to the simulation results for monitoring sections ii and iv the average value of the simulated pyt tn tp cod and sd are shown in table 7 the simulated average value of the indicators for monitoring section ii is larger than for section iv probably due to black swan and ornamental fish were housed in monitoring section ii and many food items were put in the water thus the concentrations of cod tn and tp in the water increased and the total amount of sd decreased which promoted the growth of algae and increased the concentration of algae in the water of monitoring section ii in addition there were a large number of aquatic plants in monitoring section iv which had a certain purifying effect and diminished the related nutrient concentrations in the water which inhibited algae growth to some extent the pyt concentrations on the whole showed a gradual upward trend that was significantly higher in june than in may which may be due to the change of the meteorological conditions had a noticeable impact on algae growth furthermore the simulated results of the tn tp and cod concentrations for monitoring section ii showed a trend of first increasing then decreasing the reason may be that the gradual warming of the climate from april leads to the increasing activity of chemical reactions in water which is consistent with the trend of temperature changes caused by seasonal changes after june the concentration of these nutrients may begin to decrease due to the arrival of the rainy season the simulation results of the tn concentration for monitoring section iv showed an increasing trend but the total variation value of tn concentration is always less than that of section ii in the same period which indicates that the water quality of section iv is in a relatively better situation than that of section ii the variation trend of cod concentration decreases first and then increases but the basic situation is consistent with that of tn and the simulation result of the tp concentration showed first a decrease and then increase in monitoring section iv the sd tended to decrease overall while in monitoring section ii sd first showed a decrease and then increased however the transparency value of section ii is always less than that of section iv which shows that the water quality of section iv is better than section ⅱ in summary the comparison of section ii and iv shows that waterfowl and aquatic plants are the important factors that cause the difference between the two sections 3 3 analysis of the interaction of light and nutrients as a driver of algae growth there were 16 scenarios of light intensity and nutrients interactions in the orthogonal experimental design and the growth pattern of algae in meihu lake under these scenarios was simulated using the eutrophication model the simulation results of the algae growth in section ii under different scenarios are shown in fig 7 and the average and maximum values of algae concentration simulated for the 16 scenarios are shown in table 8 previous work shows that when the algae concentration exceeds 10 000 cells ml the lake will algae bloom dou et al 2002 li and shi 2007 from the peaks of algae concentration given in table 8 it can be seen that in scenarios 1 2 5 6 8 9 and scenarios 11 16 algae blooms appeared in a certain period during the simulation among these simulated scenarios the average and peak values of the algae concentration under scenario 15 were the highest 22 384 and 49 233 cell ml respectively in this scenario the light intensity was 89 6 klx and tp and tn concentrations were 0 168 and 2 72 mg l respectively the algae growth in meihu lake is very fast the average and peak values of the algae concentration under simulation scenario 4 were the lowest 3663 and 6261 cell ml respectively in this case the light intensity was 22 4 klx tp and tn concentrations were 0 224 and 5 44 mg l respectively the growth of algae in meihu lake was inhibited by low light intensity and high nutrient concentration moreover scenarios 1 4 show that when the average light intensity is 22 4 klx the simulated algae concentration decreases with increase of the tp and tn concentrations indicating that the increase of nutrient concentration has an inhibitory effect on algae growth under low light intensity that is the light intensity plays an important role in algae growth comparing scenarios 2 and 5 and scenarios 12 and 15 it was found that the average value of the simulated algae concentration was higher when the light intensity increased than when the tp concentration increased this indicated that the effect of light intensity on algae growth was greater than that of the tp concentration comparing scenarios 5 and 6 and scenarios 7 and 8 when the tp and tn concentrations increased by the same multiple the average value of the algae concentration associated with increasing tp concentration was higher than that associated with increasing tn concentration that is the effect of the tp concentration on algae growth was greater than that of the tn concentration therefore tp is the most important parameter affecting algae growth in meihu lake this phenomenon was also seen during comparison of the scenario pairs 9 and 11 10 and 12 13 and 16 and 14 and 15 scenarios 1 5 9 and 13 show that when the tp concentration is 0 056 mg l the average value of the algae concentration increases with increase of the light intensity and tn concentration within certain ranges while the algae concentration decreases when light intensity and the tn concentration exceed these ranges these results indicate that light intensity and tn concentration could promote algae growth within certain ranges but at a relatively high range could inhibit algae growth scenarios 3 7 11 and 15 show that when the tp concentration is 0 168 mg l the average value of the algae concentration in scenarios 3 and 7 is lower than that in scenarios 11 and 15 that is to say when the light intensity is higher and the tn concentration is lower the algae growth promotion effect is greater than that when the light intensity is lower and the tn concentration is higher the results show that when the tp concentration increases to a certain extent the inhibition of algae growth by low light intensity and high tn concentration becomes more obvious scenarios 1 6 11 and 16 show that when the tn concentration is 1 36 mg l the average algae concentration value increases with increase of the light intensity and tp concentrations within certain ranges but the algae concentration value decreases when the light intensity and tp concentration exceed these ranges the results show that the light intensity and tp concentration could promote algae growth within a certain range but could inhibit algae growth over a relatively wide range scenarios 4 7 10 and 13 show that when tn concentration is 5 44 mg l the average value of the algae concentration under scenarios 4 and 7 is lower than that under scenarios 10 and 13 the results show that when the light intensity is higher and the tp concentration is lower the growth of algae is promoted more than when the light intensity is lower and the concentration of tp is higher this indicates that when the concentration of tn increases to a certain extent the inhibition effect of low light intensity and high tp concentration on algae growth become more significant in general high nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in water can cause high intensity and high frequency eutrophication tang et al 2016 algae will grow at maximum under certain light conditions bouterfas et al 2002 or algae production will be reduced when the light intensity is not in this condition gu and wyatt 2016 therefore when the light intensity and nutrient concentration are within the appropriate ranges the growth of algae is promoted and when the light intensity or nutrient concentration exceeds these ranges algae growth is inhibited through the above comparative analysis it can be seen that the effect of light intensity on algae growth is greater than that of nutrients and the effect of tp on algae growth is greater than that of tn 4 conclusion the effects of light intensity and nutrients on algae growth are mainly divided into three conditions under the insufficient condition the algae growth rate is low and water quality is better due to the limitation of light and nutrient conditions that support algae growth under the appropriate condition the light conditions are optimal and the nutrient concentrations meet the reasonable conditions for the fastest rate of algae growth in this case the water is turbid and its transparency is reduced these conditions are not conducive to the growth of aquatic organisms under the excessive condition nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the water exceed the nutrient limits of algae growth under a certain light condition which curbs the growth rate of algae and reduces its concentration although the algae concentration decreases the water quality conditions at this time are relatively poor due to high nutrient concentrations some conclusions can be drawn from this research by combining basic models of hydrodynamics and eutrophication and drawing on the mathematical relationship between water transparency and the light attenuation coefficient and other major influencing factors a mathematical model of lake eutrophication considering the interaction of light and nutrients was established and the parameters of the model were calibrated and verified using experimental data the verified results showed that the eutrophication model of meihu lake was accurate in simulating the hydrodynamic index and water eutrophication index and could describe the variation law of the eutrophication water quality index through the simulation of different light nutrient interaction scenarios the mechanism driving the effect of light nutrient interaction on algae growth was preliminarily understood this indicates that algae growth is promoted within suitable ranges of light intensity and nutrient concentration but when the light intensity and nutrient concentration exceed these ranges the growth of algae is inhibited in addition the results show that the effect of light intensity on algae growth is greater than that of nutrients and that the effect of change in the tp concentration on algae growth is greater than that of tn however the interactions between different levels of light intensity and nutrients have different effects on algae growth this paper mainly simulated the growth of algae by setting different light nutrient interaction scenarios therefore if we want to know more about the effects of light intensity and nutrient interaction on algae growth more detailed work is needed first it is necessary to extend the monitoring data series to make the eutrophication model more accurate second it is necessary to increase the levels of light intensity and nutrients to explain their effects on algae growth through more light nutrient interaction scenarios acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 51679218

25083,eutrophication is a major problem in the field of water environments at present and its main driving factors are light and nutrients in this paper the process of eutrophication in small artificial lake is studied according to the principle of water optics and conservation of mass the light and the nitrogen and phosphorus in water nutrients were selected as influencing factors and 16 different scenarios of light nutrients interaction conditions were designed by orthogonal experiment then water eutrophication model was used to analyze the process of eutrophication under different light nutrient scenarios according to the comparison of simulation results if the concentration of nutrients is increased under low light conditions the growth of algae will be inhibited and if the light condition is set to a fixed value the simulation results under different nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the water show that the effect of phosphorus on algae growth is greater than that of nitrogen in addition comparing the growth of algae under different light and phosphorus scenarios it can be seen that the light driven effect is more significant than that of phosphorus by simulating all the design scenarios and analyzing the results it can be found that the algae growth rate reaches a maximum when the light intensity and the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration increase to a certain range while continuing to increase the light and nutrient concentration exceeds a certain threshold range the rate of algae growth will be inhibited keywords eutrophication model interaction of light and nutrient algae bloom scenario analysis small artificial lake 1 introduction eutrophication is a process in which nitrogen n and phosphorus p nutrients are enriched in closed or semi closed water bodies such as lakes reservoirs or bays it will lead to increase of ecosystem productivity and cause some characteristic algae such as cyanophyta blue green algae and chlorophyta green algae to proliferate rapidly blooms which contributes further to water quality deterioration qin et al 2013 in recent years water eutrophication has become a hot issue in the field of water environments and the main cause of eutrophication is the excessive input of p and n schindler 2012 this is particularly true in rivers lakes and other water bodies influenced by high intensity human activities in the estuaries of some rivers the growth of aquatic organisms such as fish and oysters is seriously affected by prolonged eutrophication rikke et al 2018 moreover eutrophication even occurs in some coastal lagoons cenk et al 2017 excessive nutrients are a necessary condition for water eutrophication in which n is an important component of algae cells and p is involved in the photosynthesis and energy transformation processes of algae smayda 2007 the nitrogen concentration in a waterbody is strongly affected by algal growth and death processes and the external geochemical environment whereas the phosphorus concentration is more affected by seasonal hydrological processes oliver et al 2014 schindler 1977 therefore in order to effectively prevent and control eutrophication the mechanism of eutrophication and the key factors driving the rapid growth of algal populations need to be clarified first experimental observation and mathematical modeling are effective means to achieve this goal li et al 2016a b as a result more and more scholars in the field have carried out experiments to understand the mechanisms of water eutrophication and to find efficient methods to deal with this problem for example based on the role of n and p in water eutrophication a stable isotope framework was established to analyze the sources and fate of n and p in rivers as well as the importance of their roles in aquatic biological metabolism gooddy et al 2016 in the study of the relationship between n and p during eutrophication zhang et al 2016 the molar enthalpy of algae in water can be used to determine which portions of excessive n and p can be more effectively controlled to prevent the deterioration of water quality luo et al 2017 p can also be used to study the release pathways of nutrients in sediments to understand the mechanisms of organic matter enrichment and the relationship between the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles li et al 2016a b with this information relevant measures for the protection of aquatic environments can be implemented in addition light also plays an important role in eutrophication and surges in the growth of algae and aquatic plants zou et al 2013 according to the above research progress the formulation of relevant measures could play a greater role in improving water ecology and environments in this paper the research has explored the mechanisms by which light and nutrients influence the different aspects of algal growth of course the combination of temperature ph and other influencing factors can also be used to analyze eutrophication these will be carried out on the basis of this paper in the future this research considers that light is an important factor in the process of algal cell growth affecting the protein synthesis in cells harrison et al 1990 the work reported in this paper was mainly focused on study of the growth of algae in water and its effect on the eutrophication process of small artificial lakes due to the interaction of light and nutrient factors referring to the research results of previous scholars in the field of water environments lorenzen et al 1976 imboden and gachter 1978 nyholm 1978 cerco and cole 1993 dou et al 2002 alvarez vazquez and fernandez 2010 a lake eutrophication model is proposed herein that considers the interaction of light and nutrient light nutrient eutrophication model taking the small artificial lake meihu lake as the case the relationship between algae growth and its driving factors was obtained by studying the changes of light and nutrient conditions the research results can provide some guidance for prevention of eutrophication and for the management of lake environments 2 methods 2 1 study area and data collection taking meihu lake as the research object the algae growth process under different light and nutrient conditions was simulated and analyzed meihu lake is located in zhengzhou city of china and is a small artificial landscape lake with a water surface width of 30 60 m a length of about 500 m average water depth of about 1 5 m max water depth of about 1 9 m and water surface area of about 22 000 m2 in order to improve the flow of water some water circulation systems were built in meihu lake these include a local fountain located at the south end of the lake some vertical perforated pipe water circulation devices evenly distributed in the lake with the pipe mouths below the water surface and a circulation system running north to south the water supply sources include groundwater and rainwater in which groundwater recharge is the primary source and rainwater is stored in the lake after interception of large diameter materials and sediment of particulate matter the lake is divided into northern middle and southern sections the middle section is long where the water flow is slow and the terrain is relatively flat therefore under suitable weather conditions rapid algae growth in the lake can easily lead to the deterioration of water quality the terrain at the northern end of the lake is high with a high density of aquatic plants these plants play a certain role in water purification and help alleviate the deterioration of water quality there are some steps present at the south end and the southernmost part of the lake is the location of a fountain in section i there is a small island in the lake that is the area in which captive black swans are active because of the feeding waterfowl and the excrement they produce the water quality there is worse than in the other sections and more conducive to eutrophication to observe the changes in water quality five monitoring sections i ii iii iv v and 5 sampling points 1 2 3 4 5 were set in the lake the layout of the monitoring section and the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 and the longitude and latitude of the monitoring points are shown in table 1 ten on site experiments monitoring water quality and algae were conducted in sections i v of meihu lake from april to july 2015 the monitoring indicators include light intensity sd turbidity do water temperature chl a pyt water depth and flow velocity in the experiments 21 samples were collected at sampling points 1 5 on april 30 may 28 and june 29 and at sampling points 2 3 and 5 on may 16 and june 15 during the monitoring period the light is sufficient the temperature is stable at 20 30 and there is no dramatic climatic change it is suitable for algae growth the light intensity was detected using a portable light detector at 1 cm and 20 cm under water the transparency was measured using a secchi disc with a diameter of 20 cm sd 20 the turbidity was measured using a portable turbidimeter wgz 2b and the pyt and chl a were measured using a hach multi parameter water quality analyzer hach hydrolab ds5x the water quality indicators of water samples cod tp tn nh3 n and no3 n were tested according to relevant methods in the method for monitoring and analyzing water and wastewater other indicators were measured using the appropriate modules for water quality monitoring in the hach device boundary condition setting for hydrodynamic model and eutrophication model in this research 1 boundary conditions of hydrodynamic model the water in the lake is circulating and it is transported from the section ⅰ to the section v through the water pipe and flows into the lake from the section v in the hydrodynamic model section v is taken as the input boundary the discharge is output from section ⅰ there is a drainage outlet at section ⅰ and the water flows out through the drainage outlet and is lifted to section ⅰ by pumping station for recirculating recharge to the lake 2 boundary conditions of eutrophication model on the one hand water quality conditions flow into the lake from section v with water flow on the other hand point source diffusion is formed by feedstuff throwing at waterfowl farming area section 2 2 2 basic principles behind the creation of light nutrient eutrophication model the light nutrient eutrophication model developed in this study is composed of two parts a two dimensional 2 d hydrodynamic model 2 d hydrodynamic model briefly speaking in the process of simulating rivers lakes and other waters the velocity is set as two components to consider the movement of water flow for lakes li and shi 2007 and a eutrophication mechanism model driven by the light and nutrient factors of course the establishment of a three dimensional 3 d model can also clearly express such research for instance there is the improved 3 d hydrodynamic model reza et al 2016 to simulate lake conditions such as swamp wetlands or to simulate the flow of water combined with a wind and sediment transport model morales marin et al 2018 or to perform large scale spatial simulation chau et al 2002 the 3 d model could more specifically simulate the movement of natural waters but for various reasons such as small lake area shallow water depth and low flow rate this study was based on the 2 d hydrodynamic model to facilitate model construction and ensure the accuracy of the model simulation the hydrodynamic model is the basis for simulation of the process of solute transport and transformation with water flow it divides the calculation units according to the characteristics of water areas and simulates the process of change in the water level flow rate and velocity by using 2 d unsteady saint venant equations the model computational grid a and flow diagram b and c are shown in fig 2 based on the initial eutrophication model xia et al 2001 the light nutrient eutrophication model added the simulation of turbidity and transparency indexes and established a quantitative relationship between a light attenuation factor and transparency thereafter the description of the transformation mechanism among the dissolved suspended sedimented phases of the nutrients was also added to this model dou et al 2018 thus a light nutrient eutrophication model reflecting the effects of change in the light and nutrient conditions on algae growth and death processes was developed in the process of eutrophication model simulation the measured data of each monitoring section on april 30 was taken as the initial condition and the process of water quality change in monitoring section v was taken as the boundary condition the time step of the model was set to one day the relevant factors and transformation mechanisms included in the model are shown in table 2 and the internal mechanism of this model is shown in fig 3 the 2 d hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the lake flow state combined with the laws of mechanics and mass conservation and the evaporation and wind conditions were taken into account to establish the momentum equation of the 2 d hydrodynamic model li and shi 2007 1 h t u h x u h y α 0 2 u t u u x v u y f v g z x g u u 2 v 2 c 2 h ξ x 2 u τ x ρ h 3 v t u v x v v y f u

shear stress in the x and y direction respectively the mass transfer equation of migration diffusion is the basic equation of the eutrophication model which can describe the change law of water quality indexes in time and space in addition to the migration and diffusion terms the equation also includes some source sink terms the change of a material index in a unit volume of water in unit time is called the source sink term the increase of material concentration is called the source term and the decrease is called the sink term and could be caused by biological chemical and physical actions source sink term are referenced from water quality analysis simulation program wasp user s manual the basic equation of the water quality parameters is shown below 4 c t u c x v c y e x 2 c x 2 e y 2 c y 2 s where c is the content of the water quality index u and v are the flow velocity components in the direction of x and y respectively ex and ey are the diffusion coefficient components in the direction of x and y respectively and s is the total source sink term the dynamic process of algae growth plays an important role in the light nutrient eutrophication model and directly affects the transformation process of other water quality parameters the source sink term of the algae is as follows 5 s 1 g p 1 d p 1 k s 4 pyt where gp1 is the growth rate of algae dp1 is the death rate of algae ks4 is the degradation rate of algae pyt is the concentration of algae in the water and s 1 is the source sink term for algae the expression of the algal growth rate is a complex nonlinear function which is mainly controlled by external environmental conditions such as water temperature light intensity and nutrient concentration in some experiments chlorophyll a chl a was selected as the index of algal biomass calculation li et al 2015 or algal growth was calculated by observing the turbulence characteristics of the water bodies marshall and sala 2011 however these were not consistent with the analysis of influencing factors in this study di toro s research considered the influence of various factors such as light temperature and nutrients and showed that the algae growth rate can be expressed as the product of the above factors di tiro 1980 which is shown as follows 6 g p 1 g max g t g i g n where gmax is the maximum growth rate of algae g t is the temperature regulatory factor g t t t opi exp 1 t t opi t is the actual water temperature and topi is the best water temperature for algae growth g i is the light attenuation factor g i i i opi exp 1 i i opi while i is the actual light intensity under water surface and iopi is the best light intensity for the growth of algae g n is the nutrition restriction factor according to the minimum element restriction rule of liebig dolman and wiedenr 2015 the growth of algae depends on the minimum amount of nutrients provided by the water environment g n min t p k mn t n t p k mp t p in this case kmn and kmp are the michaelis constant michaelis constant half rate coefficient the concentration of n and p in the water when the algae growth rate is equal to half of its maximum growth rate of n and p intake for algae growth respectively and tn and tp are the total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in the water respectively 2 3 driving mechanism of the light factor itself affected by factors such as weather water transparency and water depth the light intensity changes greatly under water and directly influences the growth of algae if the light energy effect is calculated from the aspect of light radiation zhang et al 2003 or if the relationship between the light absorbed by the particles in the water is used to describe the change of light song et al 2017 the relationship between light intensity and transparency cannot be linked in order to make the model more systematic the beer s law wang et al 2008 was used to express a law for the variation of underwater light intensity 7 i h i 0 exp λh where i 0 is the light intensity at the water surface ih is the light intensity at h water depth and λ is the attenuation coefficient of light which is inversely proportional to the transparency of the water some research zhang et al 2016 indicates that water transparency which is affected by the concentration of chl a cod and suspended matter plays a dominate role in the attenuation of light intensity in water therefore based on the actual monitored light intensity data at 1 cm and 20 cm under water the light attenuation coefficient of the study area was obtained by combining eq 7 and the mathematical relationship between the light attenuation coefficient and water transparency was established in order to study the change rule of water transparency the main water quality factors including turbidity do ph conductivity chl a pyt water depth velocity cod bod5 tp and tn that affect the change of transparency were first identified based on the experimental data and then the quantitative relationship between water transparency and the main factors was established finally the relationship was coupled with the eutrophication model of the lake with this the effect of light intensity change on the algae growth process could be simulated 2 4 driving mechanism of the nutrient factor the accumulation of nutrients such as n and p in water is an important condition driving water eutrophication and algae growth in this the process of nitrogen cycling begins with the intake of ip such as nh3 n and no3 n by algae from which the algae can obtain energy and synthesize its cell when the algae die they settle down as part of the sediment and decompose to release op the op is converted into nh3 n through mineralization finally it is further converted into no3 n by nitrification the source sink term of the various forms of nitrogen concentration can be expressed as follows 8 n h 3 n s 2 k 71 θ 71 t 20 on k 12 θ 12 t 20 n h 3 d p1 g p1 p n

algae cells c 4 a p c t g p 1 d p 1 v s d c 4 a n c where k 71 is the mineralization coefficient of organic nitrogen θ71 is the temperature coefficient of mineralization action k 12 is the nitrification coefficient θ 12 is the temperature coefficient of nitrification action and anc is the ratio of nitrogen to carbon n c in the algae cells p n h 3 is preference for ammonia uptake term p n h 3 was referenced from wasp user s manual c4 is the carbon in algae cell vs is the deposition rate of algae d is the average water depth the source sink term of the tp concentration can be expressed as follows 13 tp s 5 d p 1 g p 1 a p c p y t 14 p in algae cells c 4 a p c t g p 1 d p 1 v s d c 4 a p c where apc is the ratio of phosphorus to carbon p c in the algae cells dissolved

to carbon o c in algae respiration d o s is saturated dissolved oxygen in addition there are many aquatic plants growing on the north side of the lake the research includes the purification of water by aquatic plants the absorption of nutrients by aquatic plants in water is similar to that of algae in water and this article discusses the effects of light and nutrients on eutrophication therefore the process of growth dynamics of aquatic plants is no longer introduced 2 5 design of the light nutrient interaction scenarios to comprehend the driving effect on algae growth of different light and nutrient conditions this experiment was carried out by combining orthogonal design and scenario simulation orthogonal design is an experimental design method that studies the effects of multiple factors some representative combinations of factors are selected from among those in a comprehensive experimental design to conduct experimental analysis tang and feng 2010 the characteristic of this method is that only a few representative experiments can be used to find out the degree of influence of each factor on the test result and a better combination of experimental conditions can be selected from these in order to describe the growth of algae under the interaction of light and nutrient factors four light conditions 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 times the original monitored light intensity and the tn or tp concentrations 1 4 times the original monitored water quality concentrations were set finally according to the principle of orthogonal design 16 scenarios of light and nutrient combinations involving three factors light intensity and the concentrations of tp and tn at four different levels were obtained scenario simulation is realized by means of the designed light nutrient eutrophication model when different scenarios are set up in the experiment the reference data were the detected values of light total nitrogen and total phosphorus then the algae growth concentration under the corresponding scenario was simulated by changing the multiple of the measured values and re inputting the model as the initial condition the scenario conditions are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 acquisition of the light attenuation coefficient the light attenuation coefficient is an important parameter for calculating the intensity of underwater light according to the experimental light intensity at 1 cm and 20 cm under water and eq 4 the light attenuation coefficient in the water was calculated the correlation between the light attenuation coefficient and the water transparency was analyzed and the fitting equation and the fit plot of the two were obtained the results are shown in eq 17 and fig 4 the fitting degree of the fitting equation was 0 89 which indicated that the correlation of the light attenuation coefficient with the water transparency was well as shown in eq 17 the two were negatively correlated which indicates that the light attenuation coefficient decreases when the water transparency increases 17 λ 1 70842 s d 0 00056 on the basis of the measured data and the correlation analysis between water transparency and other water quality indicators there was significant correlation between water transparency and turbidity chl a cod and tn and the correlation coefficient was relatively large moreover based on the relationship between water transparency and other factors multiple linear regression analysis was performed on the measured data this was done after processing by the following treatment methods water transparency was converted to a natural logarithm turbidity became the fourth root of the original chl a and cod were taken as logarithmic values and the logarithmic base was 10 when turbidity chl a cod and tn were used to obtain a multivariate linear fitting equation it was different from that obtained prior to data processing the non standard coefficients and significance of the factors and constants are shown in table 4 18 s d 85 422 0 03 x 1 0 44 x 2 0 785 x 3 12 83 x 4 19 ln s d 4 797 0 154 x 1 1 4 0 362 lg x 2 0 549 lg x 3 0 259 x 4 the multiple regression equation between the transparency of meihu lake and its influencing factors can be seen in table 4 where eq 18 is the multiple regression equation obtained using the original data and eq 19 is the multivariate regression equation obtained after the treatment of each factor by comparison it was found that the fitting degree of eq 18 was 0 703 and that of eq 19 was 0 717 both results were good but the latter result was better according to the regression equation before treatment the significance of the non standardized coefficient of turbidity and chl a was 0 089 and 0 222 respectively the significance levels were all greater than 0 05 which indicated that the significance of the non standardized coefficient of turbidity and chl a was not obvious in this equation however according to the regression analysis after data treatment the significance of non standardized coefficient of turbidity and chl a were 0 057 and 0 054 respectively and the significance level was close to 0 05 which indicated that the significance of the non standardized coefficient of turbidity and chl a were more obvious in the equation after data treatment therefore the multivariate linear regression equation obtained using the processed monitoring data was used to simulate the change of the transparency index of meihu lake in the subsequent calculation process turbidity is an important restrictive factor affecting the transparency of water and it is the reflection of the absorption and scattering of light by suspended matter in water the logarithmic fitting equation based on the relationship between suspended solids and transparency zhang et al 2003 or the correlation simulation method based on the reciprocal relationship between transparency and suspended solids yang et al 2003 can be proved this paper calculated the relationship between the transparency and fourth power root of turbidity which satisfies the results of the above methods and reflects the relationship between the transparency and turbidity of meihu lake chl a participates in the photosynthesis of algae and can be used as an indicator of the influence of algae on light intensity in this study we analyzed the relationship between chl a and light intensity and proved that there is a strong correlation between them and the two have a mutual effect in water dissolved organic matter also affects the transparency of water especially the complex chemical composition of colored soluble substances in this paper cod is used to analyze the correlation between dissolved organic matter and water transparency which shows a good significance the influence of tp and tn on water transparency is also remarkable the experiment shows that tn has a greater effect on water transparency than tp and has a negative correlation with water transparency if the concentration of tn increases the water transparency will decrease significantly 3 2 parameter calibration and model verification 3 2 1 parameter calibration and verification of the hydrodynamic model adopting the measured data for water flow and water level of meihu lake from april to july 2015 different lake bottom roughness and drag coefficients were selected monitoring section v was set as the inflow section and monitoring section i was set as the outflow section to simulate the hydrodynamic index values of the various monitoring sections through calibration of the model it can be shown that when the bottom roughness and drag coefficient of meihu lake was 0 024 and 0 6 respectively the simulation results of the water flow and level of the monitoring sections were ideal fig 5 shows the simulation results for the monitoring sections ii and iv the maximal relative error and the average relative error were used to analyze the simulation performance of the hydrodynamic model fig 5 the maximal relative errors of the flow of the monitoring sections ii and iv were 16 12 and 28 5 respectively and the average relative errors were 11 63 and 19 8 respectively the maximal relative errors of the water level of the monitoring sections ii and iv were 5 8 and 4 78 respectively and the average relative errors were 2 96 and 3 2 respectively in a word the error of the model calculation results was relatively small and the simulation accuracy met the reasonable conditions meihu lake is a small artificial lake with an area of more than 20 000 square meters the lake bed is built smoothly and the elevation difference between north and south is small therefore the water level is in a stable state the water flow is mainly driven by gravity caused by the elevation difference between north and south and the outflow pressure at the water supply outlet in the lake and the velocity is slow the established hydrodynamic model regards meihu lake as a small river flowing from north to south to simulate its flow characteristics therefore water level and velocity are taken as hydrodynamic parameters in this paper which accords with the actual situation and the results are reliable 3 2 2 parameter calibration and verification of the light nutrient eutrophication model because of the many parameters of the eutrophication model established this time it was cumbersome to calibrate them one by one thus to verify the parameters a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was carried out first and the initial values referred to the recommended values of the parameters given by the relevant research results after this the values of the sensitive parameters were continuously adjusted and their rationality was analyzed according to the simulation results in order to optimize the overall fitting of the model the sensitive parameters were adjusted as a whole during which the initial values of the insensitive parameters were maintained the parameters obtained according to the above method were the final values used in the calibration shown in table 5 the maximum growth rate of algae optimal water temperature of algae growth optimal light intensity of algae growth half speed constant of algae growth nitrogen intake and the half speed constant of algae growth phosphorus intake are referenced to the source of eq 6 di tiro 1980 the apc and anc of the algae were determined according to the wasp user s manual and the algae growth parameters of an eco tank experiment feng et al 2005 and then adjusted using the light nutrient eutrophication model after a review of research for existing results yang et al 2016 the other parameters were calibrated according to the combination of measured data and eqs 8 16 and then verified in the proposed model the parameters were determined repeatedly until the optimal value for each parameter was finally obtained the maximum relative error and average relative error were also used to analyze the simulation results of the water eutrophication model for the monitoring sections ii and iv the maximum and average relative error of pyt tn tp cod sd are shown in table 6 overall the error of the model calculation results was relatively small and the simulation accuracy were reasonable the results are shown in fig 6 according to the simulation results for monitoring sections ii and iv the average value of the simulated pyt tn tp cod and sd are shown in table 7 the simulated average value of the indicators for monitoring section ii is larger than for section iv probably due to black swan and ornamental fish were housed in monitoring section ii and many food items were put in the water thus the concentrations of cod tn and tp in the water increased and the total amount of sd decreased which promoted the growth of algae and increased the concentration of algae in the water of monitoring section ii in addition there were a large number of aquatic plants in monitoring section iv which had a certain purifying effect and diminished the related nutrient concentrations in the water which inhibited algae growth to some extent the pyt concentrations on the whole showed a gradual upward trend that was significantly higher in june than in may which may be due to the change of the meteorological conditions had a noticeable impact on algae growth furthermore the simulated results of the tn tp and cod concentrations for monitoring section ii showed a trend of first increasing then decreasing the reason may be that the gradual warming of the climate from april leads to the increasing activity of chemical reactions in water which is consistent with the trend of temperature changes caused by seasonal changes after june the concentration of these nutrients may begin to decrease due to the arrival of the rainy season the simulation results of the tn concentration for monitoring section iv showed an increasing trend but the total variation value of tn concentration is always less than that of section ii in the same period which indicates that the water quality of section iv is in a relatively better situation than that of section ii the variation trend of cod concentration decreases first and then increases but the basic situation is consistent with that of tn and the simulation result of the tp concentration showed first a decrease and then increase in monitoring section iv the sd tended to decrease overall while in monitoring section ii sd first showed a decrease and then increased however the transparency value of section ii is always less than that of section iv which shows that the water quality of section iv is better than section ⅱ in summary the comparison of section ii and iv shows that waterfowl and aquatic plants are the important factors that cause the difference between the two sections 3 3 analysis of the interaction of light and nutrients as a driver of algae growth there were 16 scenarios of light intensity and nutrients interactions in the orthogonal experimental design and the growth pattern of algae in meihu lake under these scenarios was simulated using the eutrophication model the simulation results of the algae growth in section ii under different scenarios are shown in fig 7 and the average and maximum values of algae concentration simulated for the 16 scenarios are shown in table 8 previous work shows that when the algae concentration exceeds 10 000 cells ml the lake will algae bloom dou et al 2002 li and shi 2007 from the peaks of algae concentration given in table 8 it can be seen that in scenarios 1 2 5 6 8 9 and scenarios 11 16 algae blooms appeared in a certain period during the simulation among these simulated scenarios the average and peak values of the algae concentration under scenario 15 were the highest 22 384 and 49 233 cell ml respectively in this scenario the light intensity was 89 6 klx and tp and tn concentrations were 0 168 and 2 72 mg l respectively the algae growth in meihu lake is very fast the average and peak values of the algae concentration under simulation scenario 4 were the lowest 3663 and 6261 cell ml respectively in this case the light intensity was 22 4 klx tp and tn concentrations were 0 224 and 5 44 mg l respectively the growth of algae in meihu lake was inhibited by low light intensity and high nutrient concentration moreover scenarios 1 4 show that when the average light intensity is 22 4 klx the simulated algae concentration decreases with increase of the tp and tn concentrations indicating that the increase of nutrient concentration has an inhibitory effect on algae growth under low light intensity that is the light intensity plays an important role in algae growth comparing scenarios 2 and 5 and scenarios 12 and 15 it was found that the average value of the simulated algae concentration was higher when the light intensity increased than when the tp concentration increased this indicated that the effect of light intensity on algae growth was greater than that of the tp concentration comparing scenarios 5 and 6 and scenarios 7 and 8 when the tp and tn concentrations increased by the same multiple the average value of the algae concentration associated with increasing tp concentration was higher than that associated with increasing tn concentration that is the effect of the tp concentration on algae growth was greater than that of the tn concentration therefore tp is the most important parameter affecting algae growth in meihu lake this phenomenon was also seen during comparison of the scenario pairs 9 and 11 10 and 12 13 and 16 and 14 and 15 scenarios 1 5 9 and 13 show that when the tp concentration is 0 056 mg l the average value of the algae concentration increases with increase of the light intensity and tn concentration within certain ranges while the algae concentration decreases when light intensity and the tn concentration exceed these ranges these results indicate that light intensity and tn concentration could promote algae growth within certain ranges but at a relatively high range could inhibit algae growth scenarios 3 7 11 and 15 show that when the tp concentration is 0 168 mg l the average value of the algae concentration in scenarios 3 and 7 is lower than that in scenarios 11 and 15 that is to say when the light intensity is higher and the tn concentration is lower the algae growth promotion effect is greater than that when the light intensity is lower and the tn concentration is higher the results show that when the tp concentration increases to a certain extent the inhibition of algae growth by low light intensity and high tn concentration becomes more obvious scenarios 1 6 11 and 16 show that when the tn concentration is 1 36 mg l the average algae concentration value increases with increase of the light intensity and tp concentrations within certain ranges but the algae concentration value decreases when the light intensity and tp concentration exceed these ranges the results show that the light intensity and tp concentration could promote algae growth within a certain range but could inhibit algae growth over a relatively wide range scenarios 4 7 10 and 13 show that when tn concentration is 5 44 mg l the average value of the algae concentration under scenarios 4 and 7 is lower than that under scenarios 10 and 13 the results show that when the light intensity is higher and the tp concentration is lower the growth of algae is promoted more than when the light intensity is lower and the concentration of tp is higher this indicates that when the concentration of tn increases to a certain extent the inhibition effect of low light intensity and high tp concentration on algae growth become more significant in general high nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in water can cause high intensity and high frequency eutrophication tang et al 2016 algae will grow at maximum under certain light conditions bouterfas et al 2002 or algae production will be reduced when the light intensity is not in this condition gu and wyatt 2016 therefore when the light intensity and nutrient concentration are within the appropriate ranges the growth of algae is promoted and when the light intensity or nutrient concentration exceeds these ranges algae growth is inhibited through the above comparative analysis it can be seen that the effect of light intensity on algae growth is greater than that of nutrients and the effect of tp on algae growth is greater than that of tn 4 conclusion the effects of light intensity and nutrients on algae growth are mainly divided into three conditions under the insufficient condition the algae growth rate is low and water quality is better due to the limitation of light and nutrient conditions that support algae growth under the appropriate condition the light conditions are optimal and the nutrient concentrations meet the reasonable conditions for the fastest rate of algae growth in this case the water is turbid and its transparency is reduced these conditions are not conducive to the growth of aquatic organisms under the excessive condition nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in the water exceed the nutrient limits of algae growth under a certain light condition which curbs the growth rate of algae and reduces its concentration although the algae concentration decreases the water quality conditions at this time are relatively poor due to high nutrient concentrations some conclusions can be drawn from this research by combining basic models of hydrodynamics and eutrophication and drawing on the mathematical relationship between water transparency and the light attenuation coefficient and other major influencing factors a mathematical model of lake eutrophication considering the interaction of light and nutrients was established and the parameters of the model were calibrated and verified using experimental data the verified results showed that the eutrophication model of meihu lake was accurate in simulating the hydrodynamic index and water eutrophication index and could describe the variation law of the eutrophication water quality index through the simulation of different light nutrient interaction scenarios the mechanism driving the effect of light nutrient interaction on algae growth was preliminarily understood this indicates that algae growth is promoted within suitable ranges of light intensity and nutrient concentration but when the light intensity and nutrient concentration exceed these ranges the growth of algae is inhibited in addition the results show that the effect of light intensity on algae growth is greater than that of nutrients and that the effect of change in the tp concentration on algae growth is greater than that of tn however the interactions between different levels of light intensity and nutrients have different effects on algae growth this paper mainly simulated the growth of algae by setting different light nutrient interaction scenarios therefore if we want to know more about the effects of light intensity and nutrient interaction on algae growth more detailed work is needed first it is necessary to extend the monitoring data series to make the eutrophication model more accurate second it is necessary to increase the levels of light intensity and nutrients to explain their effects on algae growth through more light nutrient interaction scenarios acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 51679218

25084,the invasive emerald ash borer beetle agrilus planipennis eab has caused significant ash tree fraxinus spp mortality and cascading forest changes in the united states we quantitatively estimated the viability of a local green ash tree f pennsylvanica population to evaluate the magnitude of change caused by eab we developed historic and worst case stochastic stage based population scenarios to model changes in viability for a natural stand of green ash trees historic parameters were based on the literature and worst case parameters were based on field data and the literature during dates that reflect time periods before and after eab impacted the focal population in northwest ohio the worst case scenario assumed that parameters remained the same as the initial eab attack when many of the adult trees died after a few years the ash annual population growth rates were estimated as 0 99 and0 76 respectively in historic versus worst case scenarios the historic scenario had a population trajectory that dipped slightly at first and then reduced slowly over time this was not unexpected since we included stochasticity in plant survival and reproduction but it showed that the model may not account for ecological variation that stabilizes ash tree populations in forests under favorable conditions in the worst case scenario ash populations became locally extinct within 34 years and changes in the population growth rate were more sensitive to changes in the survival of the 1 cm diameter at breast height stage class caution is warranted given the high variability and stochasticity within the system and the trajectory can change if post eab population dynamics differ from initial eab invasion dynamics or if human intervention occurs the use of pva allows us to quickly identify factors that influence the population viability of species allowing for the development of strategies that prevent further species endangerment keywords invasive species population viability analysis fraxinus pennsylvanica agrilus planipennis model comparison 1 introduction population parameters can be utilized to build predictive models akçakaya et al 1999 that connect environmental and species interactions to population dynamics boyce 1992 population viability analysis pva is a method that uses a variety of data to quantitatively estimate the population viability of a species and evaluate potential threats with a goal of determining the likelihood of future persistence under a variety of conditions akçakaya and sjorgren gulve 2000 this type of method is especially useful in situations where species conservation is time sensitive a population model can be built using different approaches including individual based models structured unstructured or metapopulation models morris and doak 2002 these approaches relate intrinsic and extrinsic factors to changes in survival fecundity and or dispersal to estimate the population abundance over time morris and doak 2002 the model parameters in a population model include abundance survival and fecundity at each age or life stage as well as parameters for known factors that could change survival and fecundity the parameters of each life stage are used to simulate a change in the population over time through matrix projections caswell 2001 data from longer term studies or from the literature are used to refine model parameter estimates for parameters for which there is little or no information available research methods are utilized to collect parameter estimates or assumptions are made to estimate certain parameters from building matrix models we can also understand the degree of influence the environment and uncertainty in the parameters have on the accuracy of the model projections pvas importance in conservation efforts means it should be adjustable in its design for different species and there are a variety of ways to design pva models from simple to complex depending on data availability and the purpose of the model baseline models contain data that are helpful to compare with population outcomes under varying conditions models often produce results of minimum viable population size probability of extinction or population reduction and population trajectories akçakaya and raphael 1998 menges 1990 zeigler et al 2013 challenges in developing models for plants include species that have seed plant dormancy periodic recruitment and clonal growth but benefits include the ability to add stochasticity spatially explicit populations and create a range of scenarios menges 2000 these benefits allow for increased model reliability and a greater understanding of environmental drivers of population dynamics and stochasticity that influence the population s persistence crone et al 2011 pva is increasingly used with herbaceous plants but has been rarely used for tree species menges 1990 used models to estimate the viability of the endangered furbish s lousewort pedicularis furbishiae by incorporating demographic stochasticity and catastrophes in a review by crone et al 2011 half of all plant pvas contained research focused on life history and population ecology while the other half focused on management implications such as harvested and invasive plants and impacts of fire and grazing there are few viability models developed for tree species most research is focused on growth models since trees are a harvested resource for the endangered english yew tree taxus baccata models have explored management alternatives to create population viability risk management scenarios that assess which management strategy is most beneficial for species viability dhar et al 2008 in the case of big leaf mahogany swietenia macrophylla which is listed under the convention on international trade in endangered species cites an individual based model was developed to examine whether harvesting was detrimental to the population grogan et al 2014 for both trees there is a plethora of data available yet models were not included in analyses until after species were listed non endangered trees with pests and disease issues like whitebark pine pinus albicaulis are also evaluated with pva jules et al 2016 analyses such as pva are especially important to identify critical factors that influence long term viability of vulnerable species in a timely enough manner to develop strategies that prevent further endangerment one such vulnerable species is the green ash tree fraxinus pennsylvanica ash this ash species typically grows in bottomland areas survives 65 years on average and is adapted to a variety of areas across the eastern united states kennedy 1990 macfarlan and meyer 2005 stewart and krajicek 1973 the invasive emerald ash borer beetle agrilus planipennis eab has caused significant declines for all ash species and precipitated dramatic changes in north american forests herms and mccullough 2014 kashian and witter 2011 klooster et al 2014 knight et al 2013 eab was introduced near detroit michigan and is a specialist beetle from asia that feeds and reproduces on fraxinus species herms and mccullough 2014 eab adults feed on ash leaves while eab larvae feed on ash cambium underneath the bark eab can damage trees with a diameter at breast height dbh 1 37 m of 2 5 cm or larger cappaert et al 2005 after infestation the trees in the mid to lower canopy intermediate or suppressed or in lower ash density stands died the fastest and nearly 100 mortality of adult ash trees occurred within 6 years knight et al 2013 michigan floodplain forests infested by eab had greatly reduced densities of ash seedlings and seed banks kashian and witter 2011 klooster et al 2014 similar effects are expected throughout the rest of the ash species range prompting the international union for conservation of nature to apply the critically endangered status to many fraxinus species including green ash westwood et al 2017 after eab kills the majority of the ash trees in an area a small number of surviving ash trees may remain the future dynamics of these remnant populations are key to the persistence of the species surviving ash trees were first discovered in the oak openings region of northwest ohio which consisted of mostly green ash subsequently surviving ash trees were discovered elsewhere in ohio and michigan knight et al 2012 these surviving ash trees are called lingering ash when they remain healthy for 2 years after the area s ash mortality has reached 95 from eab and they have a diameter at breast height 10 cm knight et al 2012 the oak openings region is a mixed disturbance landscape containing rare natural ecosystems in a mosaic of small to large remnant habitat patches surrounded by a matrix of agriculture and urban development prior to human settlement the area was composed of oak savanna oak woodland oak barrens wet prairie floodplain forests and surrounded by the black swamp forest brewer and vankat 2004 the floodplain forest is primarily composed of green ash maple acer elm ulmus sycamore platanus and cottonwood populus species knight et al 2012 this region is a unique biodiversity hotspot abella et al 2004 that is undergoing large changes from eab invasion the goal of this study was to compare historic and worst case ash population dynamics within the floodplain forest we expected to find that when faced with persistent eab populations and increased stochastic events ash populations quickly decreased to extinction differences between models allowed us to assess parameters for degree of influence on long term viability in the face of large episodic changes like invasive pests that tree populations are likely to face in the future population viability analysis can provide critical insight into the dynamics of catastrophes and recovery 2 methods we developed stage based population models for green ash in the oak openings preserve metropark of northwest ohio 41 32 34 n x 83 50 51 w to compare historic versus worst case i e peak eab invasion conditions the models included ash abundance survival and fecundity at multiple life stages and were developed in ramas metapop setakaut ny usa each model scenario used a 50 year simulation based on 1 year time intervals with 10 000 replications ash trees are a sexually dimorphic species so we utilized a female only model for simplification as the ash sex ratio is typically 1 1 franklin 1981 zhang et al 2009 therefore males would not significantly change the population trajectory we used stage based models to avoid the need to estimate the age of each individual tree for parameter estimates aging trees adds more complexity to the matrix trees shorter than 1 m tall are difficult to age and larger trees would be damaged as they need to be cored to examine growth rings moreover ash tree susceptibility to eab appears to be size based rather than age based 2 1 model stages fecundity survival and the probability of growth to the next stage were needed for the model with each stage based on ash size fig 1 size classes were categorized to assess population demographics of the different life stages we separated size classes by trunk diameter at breast height dbh 1 37 m size classes included first year seedlings trees 1 cm dbh 1 9 9 cm dbh 10 19 9 cm dbh and 20 cm dbh size classes included first year seedlings since they tend to have high variability in mortality full reproduction capabilities start after trees have reached 20 cm dbh franklin 1981 and so only those 20 cm reproduce in our models the stages 1 9 9 cm and 10 19 9 cm were created for an even distribution of sizes between 1 20 cm seedlings 1 cm dbh were not separated further as our survival information was similar for sizes within that size class 2 2 model parameters we searched the literature for estimates of green ash population demographic parameters throughout time relevant search terms e g green ash survival fecundity population dynamics etc were entered in science based search engines including treesearch a us forest service search engine all estimates were based on research of green ash unless data on a size class were not available for example for our largest size class we utilized white ash fraxinus americana data since there were no specific data on green ash of that size we used research based documents to complete life stage matrices for pva models table 1 for the worst case model local population demographics were based on literature published from 2005 to 2008 and previously collected data by the us forest service from 2005 to 2008 kappler 2018 which represents the peak of eab populations and ash mortality in this area if a survival parameter had more than one estimate we used the geometric mean and its standard deviation for the vital rates in the models table 2 fecundity was estimated as the number of seeds per tree surviving to spring germination that were female our best estimate of seeds surviving to germination was found in literature that counted newly emergent ash on the forest floor identified by presence of cotyledons boerner and brinkman 1996 we assumed this value represented the number of seedlings produced from one female tree although only half of the seedlings would be female so the number of seedlings and its standard deviation were divided in half for our fecundity parameter the probability of remaining in a stage was based on yearly survival parameters which were estimated from the literature and with 3 years of us forest service survey data for the worst case scenario model the probability of growth or transition from one stage to another was based on average growth and ability to survive the number of years needed for growth into the next stage these data were gathered from the literature and us forest service survey data the vital rates were used to create a leslie matrix that was multiplied by the number of individuals in each stage at each time step to estimate how many would transition between each stage caswell 2001 emergent seedlings had a probability to grow into the next 1 cm stage which was based on emergent seedling first year survival research boerner and brinkman 1996 messaoud and houle 2006 we assumed that growth from established seedling to 1 37 m tall would take a minimum of 5 years bonner and karrfalt 2008 conner et al 2000 and with our post eab outbreak data on average it took 2 years for trees to grow from 0 1 to 1 0 cm dbh therefore in the model s trees stayed in life stage 1 cm for 7 years growth rates into new stages for trees larger than 1 cm dbh were based on average growth of even aged green ash stands from natural silty bottomland flats which was on average 2 5 cm per 4 years fitzgerald et al 1975 estimates from the literature showed decreases for survival in all size classes in the worst case scenario fig 1 2 3 model specifications other model elements included initial abundance initial stage structure density dependence and stochasticity historic scenario initial abundance was calculated from knight et al 2012 for the entire floodplain area where they estimated 11 894 24 375 ash trees 10 cm dbh within 50 m of swan creek the historic scenario s initial population started with half of the median value of the estimated abundance to represent female individuals in stages 10 cm dbh in the stable stage distribution based on the stage matrix there were 46 yearlings 41 seedlings 12 5 saplings 0 4 small adults and 0 01 reproducing adults we used the percentage per class and the estimated abundance of those 10 cm to estimate the initial abundance of 213 013 individuals 101 105 yearlings 55 637 seedlings 47 355 saplings 8077 young adults and 839 adults initial abundance of the worst case scenario was kept the same as the historic scenarios as well as starting with stable stage distribution the worst case scenario s initial stable stage structure distribution was 0 yearlings 79 seedlings 1 cm dbh 21 saplings 1 9 9 cm dbh 0 small adults 10 19 9 cm dbh and 0 were reproducing adults 20 cm dbh a ceiling type density dependence was included into the model for the entire population ceiling density dependence allowed the populations to vary independently of the density until they reached carrying capacity and was set to 214 000 stochasticity was added to the models as both demographic and environmentally related variation demographic stochasticity was modeled as the number of survivors from one year to the next sampled from a binomial distribution and the number of offspring and young sampled from a poisson distribution akçakaya 1991 demographic stochasticity had a negligible effect on survival since the population abundance was not small nor did it effect the fecundity distribution since fecundity was largely influenced by the environment rather than individual differences environmental stochasticity was modeled as a random sample from a lognormal distribution based on the average vital rates and standard deviation matrix akçakaya 1991 in creating a model based on the oak openings preserve ash population we assumed a closed population without immigration or emigration of ash trees 2 4 model analyses these model scenarios serve as baseline models which represent the historic and worst case scenarios applicable to the natural green ash population using elasticity analyses we assessed which parameters in the models were most influential when changed which indicated the size class that had the greatest impact on the population growth rate elasticity measures the proportional contribution of each demographic parameter in the model to the growth rate and all values calculated sum to one caswell 2001 population growth rates population trajectories and final abundances for both scenarios were estimated and reported a kolmogorov smirnov test was used to assess whether extinction risk curves among models were significantly different we estimated the time to quasi extinction as when the population fell below 10 individual female trees based on the minimum density required for successful pollination based on pollen dispersal characteristics beatty et al 2015 quasi extinction assumed that once the population of female trees fell below 10 the population would become extinct the predictions of the historic scenario were not only compared to the predictions of the worst case scenario but also to the estimated population abundance of ash trees in 2010 and 2015 data for the population estimates came from two data collection methods done in 2010 and 2015 trees 10 cm were surveyed in the entire floodplain and smaller size classes were surveyed in sampling plots knight et al 2012 kappler 2018 yearlings were estimated as the fecundity multiplied by number of 20 cm trees and size class 1 9 9 cm dbh were extrapolated from the plots sampled to the area of the floodplain total abundance was used for trees 10 19 9 cm and 20 cm dbh 3 results the ash annual population growth rates were estimated as 0 99 and 0 76 respectively in historic versus worst case scenarios where eab was absent or present over the next 50 years the population abundance declined slowly under historic conditions while the abundance steadily declined and was likely to crash under worst case conditions fig 2 in the historic model it was the adult 20 cm dbh survival that contributed the most whereas for the worst case scenario the ash population elasticities showed that only seedling 1 cm dbh survival contributed to changes that could occur in the population growth rate table 3 there was a significant difference in interval extinction risk between the historic and worst case scenarios p 0 001 d 0 99 the difference in the final minimum tree abundance between the two scenarios was 17 563 individuals the population under the worst case scenario had a 99 6 probability of extinction reaching on average 1 individual by year 45 and had a 50 probability of quasi extinction by year 34 fig 3 average initial and final stage abundances for the historic scenario were similarly distributed with more individuals in the 10 19 9 cm size class at the end of the simulation the final historic population had an average of 50 yearlings 24 for 1 cm 21 4 for 1 9 9 cm 3 8 for 10 19 9 cm and 0 4 for 20 cm dbh the projected trajectory of the worst case scenarios seems to mimic the field estimates from 2010 and 2015 from our surveys we estimated that there were 82 395 ash trees in the floodplain in 2010 in 2010 abundance estimates were 6600 for yearling with 74 478 individuals 1 cm and 2050 trees size 1 9 9 cm we found 212 trees size 10 19 9 cm and there were 55 trees 20 cm when comparing worst case scenario abundance to the estimated ash population abundance from 2010 survey data they were relatively similar at year 4 of the simulation 70 167 23 280 or 4 years post peak infestation in 2015 the floodplain had an estimated 15 539 individual ash trees present there were an estimated 8640 yearlings 6150 trees 1 cm and 470 trees 1 9 9 cm we found 207 trees size 10 19 9 cm and 72 trees 20 cm the worst case scenario abundance estimates at year 9 were similar to 2015 data at 17 661 8660 individuals 4 discussion the population models met our expectations where historic and worst case scenarios predicted different outcomes a 23 decline in population growth rate under invasion indicates the degree of overall population change the historic trajectory slowly decreased over time which indicates that the natural ash population was very close to but not completely stable the worst case trajectory predicted extinction likely within 34 41 years but caution is warranted given the high variability and stochasticity within this system as seen in the standard deviations around the curves fig 2 from each scenarios 10 000 replications we found that large adult trees were important to the population growth rate of the historic scenario e g had the greatest influence on population growth and that importance switched to seedlings 1 cm dbh in the worst case scenario the overall the population growth rate of the historical scenario was most sensitive to change in the survival of the adult ash size class 20 cm dbh which is likely from their contribution to the population via reproduction in comparison population growth rate in the worst case scenario was most sensitive to change in the survival of the seedling size class 1 cm dbh since this size class is not impacted by eab ash 2 5 cm dbh are damaged by eab they are a critical stage in the ash life cycle cappaert et al 2005 this differentiation between scenarios emphasizes the impact eab has on varying stages of ash life cycle and that recovery will be dependent on the stage structure of the population following invasion the younger stage could be the focus of future exploration into ash forest management research at the same location had shown leaf litter and ash basal area as important indicators of ash seedling presence kappler 2018 useful insights from pva results are important to any species management plan in the worst case scenario eab continued to have a major effect on tree survivorship over time and this was the factor that lead to a quasi extinction of the population by year 34 this scenario extrapolated the impact of eab during high ash mortality one in which no human intervention takes place and vital rates remain at peak ash mortality levels we expect our worst case scenario will not come to fruition but allows us to extrapolate the intensity of the change which occurred with the eab outbreak we hypothesize that current ash trees will grow over time with a lower eab infestation rate than the previous generation since we have witnessed the next cohort of ash infested when they are a smaller size kappler 2018 eab may not have enough food resources ash leaves and cambium to increase their population to the same size in the future as they had at the initial peak invasion especially with local and introduced predators adjusting to their presence lyons 2015 this does not mean that the next eab population increase will not cause similar devastating effects but it may take longer to do so eab showed a boom and bust cycle in its initial local population dynamics unpublished data which is typical for invasive species williams 1996 invasive species population information can be used in models to estimate how often catastrophic infestation events may occur in the future which we plan to incorporate in further model exploration future models that include variation in eab impacts will likely reveal the potential sensitivity to frequency and intensity of invasion and the vulnerability of ash populations in various stages of recovery kappler 2018 the worst case scenario 4th year was comparable to the 2010 survey abundance estimate as well as the 9th year comparison to the 2015 abundance estimate in 2010 our location had experienced a 99 loss of ash trees 10 cm which had occurred over 6 years knight et al 2013 therefore the modelled scenario closely mimics the actual events as such our model s quasi extinction of 34 years indicates that our location extinction would be around the year 2040 if high ash mortality conditions remain prevalent these results should be viewed with caution though as our 2010 survey data was extrapolated for the smaller size classes including yearlings which were found to have high variability in survival boerner and brinkman 1996 messaoud and houle 2006 these comparisons suggest that worst case model has captured much of the trend in ash abundance that was first observed which highlights the benefit in considering pva to facilitate understanding of these natural populations management has also continually increased its power to combat eab and improvements are still being made mccullough et al 2016 jones et al 2016 there are multiple hymenoptera parasitoids that use eab larvae as hosts for their eggs leluthia astigma oobius agrili spathius agrili spathius galinae and tetrastichus planipennisi have been documented parasitoids of which all but one are reared and released to help control eab populations gould et al 2012 natural control factors include intraspecific competition woodpeckers and bark foraging bird predation and environmental factors that limit eab dispersal fahrner et al 2015 b bassiana is a fungal species that has also been proven effective in controlling eab populations castrillo et al 2010 human management and natural factors will change the eab population and thus the impact they have on ash survival and the longevity of the population the historic scenario had a population trajectory that dipped slightly at first and then decrease slowly over time the decrease in the population abundance was not unexpected since we included stochasticity in plant survival and reproduction the trajectory showed that the ash tree population was unlikely to be sustainable forever under the conditions we initiated in subsequent analyses with longer time periods used our historic scenario had a quasi extinction at year 132 and when standard deviations were removed the population did not go extinct which indicates the variation in our parameters maybe too large to produce a stable ash population over time it is also possible that over 50 100 years habitat changes would influence ash parameters towards a different growth rate we did not explicitly account for other potential influences beyond what was inherent in the demographic estimates for our estimates we were able to find literature on adult ash survival in horticultural gardens which may or may not be accurately reflected in natural settings literature on ash and other economically important tree species are more prevalent than other plant species since humans are interested in them for harvesting and landscaping we found less literature though focused on natural ash germination seedlings and the oldest ash stage of growth especially for historic parameters a lack information on life history parameters limits the predictive power of the pva from which we may derive an understanding of potential future outcomes and species recovery our model scenarios were based on green ash in a floodplain or bottomland habitat and would likely have slightly different outcomes for ash species in different habitat types these baseline models will allow for comparisons to future models with different possible viability estimates of future ash generations under varying conditions e g continued eab presence additional disease or pests weather extremes land management changes and habitat limitations on carrying capacity in addition this stage based modeling approach is readily adaptable to other locations other species and other habitat types pva is very useful for organizing information assessing vulnerabilities and addressing specific questions about a species akçakaya and sjorgren gulve 2000 yet plant physiological traits such as their ability to reproduce clonally and disperse in multiple ways can limit plant population studies menges 2000 silvertown 1982 these traits make it potentially difficult to identify individuals and seperate populations while identifying individuals in our study was possible challenges in tree models include their long life span reproductive biology and ability to re sprout after the original trunk s death ash are also dioecious while other trees are often monoecious we assumed that the proportion of males was equal to females and that this would have no influence on the population growth rate however as adult ash tree populations fall to low densities it is possible that lack of pollination will limit the reproduction success of female trees further study is needed to account for impacts on model parameters from different proportions of males and females and increasing distance between trees as the number of trees decreases while plant species population models can be difficult to build trees can effectively be modeled with a stage structure matrix davelos and jarosz 2004 our model adds to the few population viability analyses developed for tree species other tree models have explored the long term influence of rapid impacts such as pest infestation or harvest in harvest scenarios for big leaf mahogany yields were severely depleted after 2 3 30 year harvest cycles and a tree density minimum was reported for sustainability grogan et al 2014 critical knowledge gaps can be identified with models and thus shed light on productive research avenues for example models of the whitebark pine pinus albicaulis revealed that pine beetle attacks had larger impacts on population growth than the whitebark pine disease blister rust jules et al 2016 like ash whitebark pine populations will improve with better pest management management options can be improved by first testing their potential outcomes in population models in the case of the english yew many management strategies were modelled to assess their impact on risk of extinction and population viability to then assess which combination of management strategies best improved the yew s outcome in the next 20 years dhar et al 2008 of the utmost importance is understanding what did and could occur with the eab invasion over time and pva can help accomplish this eab has been found in many other areas within the eastern n america ash tree range this research reveals how natural green ash tree population dynamics change in the face of an invasive pest outbreak we will be able to apply our results to future models that assist in adaptive management planning to improve natural ash population dynamics which may be applicable to other areas across the species range declaration of interest none acknowledgments we appreciate the permission

25084,the invasive emerald ash borer beetle agrilus planipennis eab has caused significant ash tree fraxinus spp mortality and cascading forest changes in the united states we quantitatively estimated the viability of a local green ash tree f pennsylvanica population to evaluate the magnitude of change caused by eab we developed historic and worst case stochastic stage based population scenarios to model changes in viability for a natural stand of green ash trees historic parameters were based on the literature and worst case parameters were based on field data and the literature during dates

the adult trees died after a few years the ash annual population growth rates were estimated as 0 99 and0 76 respectively in historic versus worst case scenarios the historic scenario had a population trajectory that dipped slightly at first and then reduced slowly over time this was not unexpected since we included stochasticity in plant survival and reproduction but it showed that the model may not account for ecological variation that stabilizes ash tree populations in forests under favorable conditions in the worst case scenario ash populations became locally extinct within 34 years and changes in the population growth rate were more sensitive to changes in the survival of the 1 cm diameter at breast height stage class caution is warranted given the high variability and stochasticity

convention on international trade in endangered species cites an individual based model was developed to examine whether harvesting was detrimental to the population grogan et al 2014 for both trees there is a plethora of data available yet models were not included in analyses until after species were listed non endangered trees with pests and disease issues like whitebark pine pinus albicaulis are also evaluated with pva jules et al 2016 analyses such as pva are especially important to identify critical factors that influence long term viability of vulnerable species in a timely enough manner to develop strategies that prevent further endangerment one such vulnerable species is the green ash tree fraxinus pennsylvanica ash this ash species typically grows in bottomland areas survives 65 years on average and is adapted to a variety of areas across the eastern united states kennedy 1990 macfarlan and meyer 2005 stewart and krajicek 1973 the invasive emerald ash borer beetle agrilus planipennis eab has caused significant declines for all ash species and precipitated dramatic changes in north american forests herms and mccullough 2014 kashian and witter 2011 klooster et al 2014 knight et al 2013 eab was introduced near detroit michigan and is a specialist beetle from asia that feeds and reproduces on fraxinus species herms and mccullough 2014 eab adults feed on ash leaves while eab larvae feed on ash cambium underneath the bark eab can damage trees with a diameter at breast height dbh 1 37 m of 2 5 cm or larger cappaert et al 2005 after infestation the trees in the mid to lower canopy intermediate or suppressed or in lower ash density stands died the fastest and nearly 100 mortality of adult ash trees occurred within 6 years knight et al 2013 michigan floodplain forests infested by eab had greatly reduced densities of ash seedlings and seed banks kashian and witter 2011 klooster et al 2014 similar effects are expected throughout the rest of the ash species range prompting the international union for conservation of nature to apply the critically endangered status to many fraxinus species including green ash westwood et al 2017 after eab kills the majority of the ash trees in an area a small number of surviving ash trees may remain the future dynamics of these remnant populations are key to the persistence of the species surviving ash trees were first discovered in the oak openings region of northwest ohio which consisted of mostly green ash subsequently surviving ash trees were discovered elsewhere in ohio and michigan knight et al 2012 these surviving ash trees are called lingering ash when they remain healthy for 2 years after the area s ash mortality has reached 95 from eab and they have a diameter at breast height 10 cm knight et al 2012 the oak openings region is a mixed disturbance landscape containing rare natural ecosystems in a mosaic of small to large remnant habitat patches surrounded by a matrix of agriculture and urban development prior to human settlement the area was composed of oak savanna oak woodland oak barrens wet prairie floodplain forests and surrounded by the black swamp forest brewer and vankat 2004 the floodplain forest is primarily composed of green ash maple acer elm ulmus sycamore platanus and cottonwood populus species knight et al 2012 this region is a unique biodiversity hotspot abella et al 2004 that is undergoing large changes from eab invasion the goal of this study was to compare historic and worst case ash population dynamics within the floodplain forest we expected to find that when faced with persistent eab populations and increased stochastic events ash populations quickly decreased to extinction differences between models allowed us to assess parameters for degree of influence on long term viability in the face of large episodic changes like invasive pests that tree populations are likely to face in the future population viability analysis can provide critical insight into the dynamics of catastrophes and recovery 2 methods we developed stage based population models for green ash in the oak openings preserve metropark of northwest ohio 41 32 34 n x 83 50 51 w to compare historic versus worst case i e peak eab invasion conditions the models included ash abundance survival and fecundity at multiple life stages and were developed in ramas metapop setakaut ny usa each model scenario used a 50 year simulation based on 1 year time intervals with 10 000 replications ash trees are a sexually dimorphic species so we utilized a female only model for simplification as the ash sex ratio is typically 1 1 franklin 1981 zhang et al 2009 therefore males would not significantly change the population trajectory we used stage based models to avoid the need to estimate the age of each individual tree for parameter estimates aging trees adds more complexity to the matrix trees shorter than 1 m tall are difficult to age and larger trees would be damaged as they need to be cored to examine growth rings moreover ash tree susceptibility to eab appears to be size based rather than age based 2 1 model stages fecundity survival and the probability of growth to the next stage were needed for the model with each stage based on ash size fig 1 size classes were categorized to assess population demographics of the different life stages we separated size classes by trunk diameter at breast height dbh 1 37 m size classes included first year seedlings trees 1 cm dbh 1 9 9 cm dbh 10 19 9 cm dbh and 20 cm dbh size classes included first year seedlings since they tend to have high variability in mortality full reproduction capabilities start after trees have reached 20 cm dbh franklin 1981 and so only those 20 cm reproduce in our models the stages 1 9 9 cm and 10 19 9 cm were created for an even distribution of sizes between 1 20 cm seedlings 1 cm dbh were not separated further as our survival information was similar for sizes within that size class 2 2 model parameters we searched the literature for estimates of green ash population demographic parameters throughout time relevant search terms e g green ash survival fecundity population dynamics etc were entered in science based search engines including treesearch a us forest service search engine all estimates were based on research of green ash unless data on a size class were not available for example for our largest size class we utilized white ash fraxinus americana data since there were no specific data on green ash of that size we used research based documents to complete life stage matrices for pva models table 1 for the worst case model local population demographics were based on literature published from 2005 to 2008 and previously collected data by the us forest service from 2005 to 2008 kappler 2018 which represents the peak of eab populations and ash mortality in this area if a survival parameter had more than one estimate we used the geometric mean and its standard deviation for the vital rates in the models table 2 fecundity was estimated as the number of seeds per tree surviving to spring germination that were female our best estimate of seeds surviving to germination was found in literature that counted newly emergent ash on the forest floor identified by presence of cotyledons boerner and brinkman 1996 we assumed this value represented the number of seedlings produced from one female tree although only half of the seedlings would be female so the number of seedlings and its standard deviation were divided in half for our fecundity parameter the probability of remaining in a stage was based on yearly survival parameters which were estimated from the literature and with 3 years of us forest service survey data for the worst case scenario model the probability of growth or transition from one stage to another was based on average growth and ability to survive the number of years needed for growth into the next stage these data were gathered from the literature and us forest service survey data the vital rates were used to create a leslie matrix that was multiplied by the number of individuals in each stage at each time step to estimate how many would transition between each stage caswell 2001 emergent seedlings had a probability to grow into the next 1 cm stage which was based on emergent seedling first year survival research boerner and brinkman 1996 messaoud and houle 2006 we assumed that growth from established seedling to 1 37 m tall would take a minimum of 5 years bonner and karrfalt 2008 conner et al 2000 and with our post eab outbreak data on average it took 2 years for trees to grow from 0 1 to 1 0 cm dbh therefore in the model s trees stayed in life stage 1 cm for 7 years growth rates into new stages for trees larger than 1 cm dbh were based on average growth of even aged green ash stands from natural silty bottomland flats which was on average 2 5 cm per 4 years fitzgerald et al 1975 estimates from the literature showed decreases for survival in all size classes in the worst case scenario fig 1 2 3 model specifications other model elements included initial abundance initial stage structure density dependence and stochasticity historic scenario initial abundance was calculated from knight et al 2012 for the entire floodplain area where they estimated 11 894 24 375 ash trees 10 cm dbh within 50 m of swan creek the historic scenario s initial population started with half of the median value of the estimated abundance to represent female individuals in stages 10 cm dbh in the stable stage distribution based on the stage matrix there were 46 yearlings 41 seedlings 12 5 saplings 0 4 small adults and 0 01 reproducing adults we used the percentage per class and the estimated abundance of those 10 cm to estimate the initial abundance of 213 013 individuals 101 105 yearlings 55 637 seedlings 47 355 saplings 8077 young adults and 839 adults initial abundance of the worst case scenario was kept the same as the historic scenarios as well as starting with stable stage distribution the worst case scenario s initial stable stage structure distribution was 0 yearlings 79 seedlings 1 cm dbh 21 saplings 1 9 9 cm dbh 0 small adults 10 19 9 cm dbh and 0 were reproducing adults 20 cm dbh a ceiling type density dependence was included into the model for the entire population ceiling density dependence allowed the populations to vary independently of the density until they reached carrying capacity and was set to 214 000 stochasticity was added to the models as both demographic and environmentally related variation demographic stochasticity was modeled as the number of survivors from one year to the next sampled from a binomial distribution and the number of offspring and young sampled from a poisson distribution akçakaya 1991 demographic stochasticity had a negligible effect on survival since the population abundance was not small nor did it effect the fecundity distribution since fecundity was largely influenced by the environment rather than individual differences environmental stochasticity was modeled as a random sample from a lognormal distribution based on the average vital rates and standard deviation matrix akçakaya 1991 in creating a model based on the oak openings preserve ash population we assumed a closed population without immigration or emigration of ash trees 2 4 model analyses these model scenarios serve as baseline models which represent the historic and worst case scenarios applicable to the natural green ash population using elasticity analyses we assessed which parameters in the models were most influential when changed which indicated the size class that had the greatest impact on the population growth rate elasticity measures the proportional contribution of each demographic parameter in the model to the growth rate and all values calculated sum to one caswell 2001 population growth rates population trajectories and final abundances for both scenarios were estimated and reported a kolmogorov smirnov test was used to assess whether extinction risk curves among models were significantly different we estimated the time to quasi extinction as when the population fell below 10 individual female trees based on the minimum density required for successful pollination based on pollen dispersal characteristics beatty et al 2015 quasi extinction assumed that once the population of female trees fell below 10 the population would become extinct the predictions of the historic scenario were not only compared to the predictions of the worst case scenario but also to the estimated population abundance of ash trees in 2010 and 2015 data for the population estimates came from two data collection methods done in 2010 and 2015 trees 10 cm were surveyed in the entire floodplain and smaller size classes were surveyed in sampling plots knight et al 2012 kappler 2018 yearlings were estimated as the fecundity multiplied by number of 20 cm trees and size class 1 9 9 cm dbh were extrapolated from the plots sampled to the area of the floodplain total abundance was used for trees 10 19 9 cm and 20 cm dbh 3 results the ash annual population growth rates were estimated as 0 99 and 0 76 respectively in historic versus worst case scenarios where eab was absent or present over the next 50 years the population abundance declined slowly under historic conditions while the abundance steadily declined and was likely to crash under worst case conditions fig 2 in the historic model it was the adult 20 cm dbh survival that contributed the most whereas for the worst case scenario the ash population elasticities showed that only seedling 1 cm dbh survival contributed to changes that could occur in the population growth rate table 3 there was a significant difference in interval extinction risk between the historic and worst case scenarios p 0 001 d 0 99 the difference in the final minimum tree abundance between the two scenarios was 17 563 individuals the population under the worst case scenario had a 99 6 probability of extinction reaching on average 1 individual by year 45 and had a 50 probability of quasi extinction by year 34 fig 3 average initial and final stage abundances for the historic scenario were similarly distributed with more individuals in the 10 19 9 cm size class at the end of the simulation the final historic population had an average of 50 yearlings 24 for 1 cm 21 4 for 1 9 9 cm 3 8 for 10 19 9 cm and 0 4 for 20 cm dbh the projected trajectory of the worst case scenarios seems to mimic the field estimates from 2010 and 2015 from our surveys we estimated that there were 82 395 ash trees in the floodplain in 2010 in 2010 abundance estimates were 6600 for yearling with 74 478 individuals 1 cm and 2050 trees size 1 9 9 cm we found 212 trees size 10 19 9 cm and there were 55 trees 20 cm when comparing worst case scenario abundance to the estimated ash population abundance from 2010 survey data they were relatively similar at year 4 of the simulation 70 167 23 280 or 4 years post peak infestation in 2015 the floodplain had an estimated 15 539 individual ash trees present there were an estimated 8640 yearlings 6150 trees 1 cm and 470 trees 1 9 9 cm we found 207 trees size 10 19 9 cm and 72 trees 20 cm the worst case scenario abundance estimates at year 9 were similar to 2015 data at 17 661 8660 individuals 4 discussion the population models met our expectations where historic and worst case scenarios predicted different outcomes a 23 decline in population growth rate under invasion indicates the degree of overall population change the historic trajectory slowly decreased over time which indicates that the natural ash population was very close to but not completely stable the worst case trajectory predicted extinction likely within 34 41 years but caution is warranted given the high variability and stochasticity within this system as seen in the standard deviations around the curves fig 2 from each scenarios 10 000 replications we found that large adult trees were important to the population growth rate of the historic scenario e g had the greatest influence on population growth and that importance switched to seedlings 1 cm dbh in the worst case scenario the overall the population growth rate of the historical scenario was most sensitive to change in the survival of the adult ash size class 20 cm dbh which is likely from their contribution to the population via reproduction in comparison population growth rate in the worst case scenario was most sensitive to change in the survival of the seedling size class 1 cm dbh since this size class is not impacted by eab ash 2 5 cm dbh are damaged by eab they are a critical stage in the ash life cycle cappaert et al 2005 this differentiation between scenarios emphasizes the impact eab has on varying stages of ash life cycle and that recovery will be dependent on the stage structure of the population following invasion the younger stage could be the focus of future exploration into ash forest management research at the same location had shown leaf litter and ash basal area as important indicators of ash seedling presence kappler 2018 useful insights from pva results are important to any species management plan in the worst case scenario eab continued to have a major effect on tree survivorship over time and this was the factor that lead to a quasi extinction of the population by year 34 this scenario extrapolated the impact of eab during high ash mortality one in which no human intervention takes place and vital rates remain at peak ash mortality levels we expect our worst case scenario will not come to fruition but allows us to extrapolate the intensity of the change which occurred with the eab outbreak we hypothesize that current ash trees will grow over time with a lower eab infestation rate than the previous generation since we have witnessed the next cohort of ash infested when they are a smaller size kappler 2018 eab may not have enough food resources ash leaves and cambium to increase their population to the same size in the future as they had at the initial peak invasion especially with local and introduced predators adjusting to their presence lyons 2015 this does not mean that the next eab population increase will not cause similar devastating effects but it may take longer to do so eab showed a boom and bust cycle in its initial local population dynamics unpublished data which is typical for invasive species williams 1996 invasive species population information can be used in models to estimate how often catastrophic infestation events may occur in the future which we plan to incorporate in further model exploration future models that include variation in eab impacts will likely reveal the potential sensitivity to frequency and intensity of invasion and the vulnerability of ash populations in various stages of recovery kappler 2018 the worst case scenario 4th year was comparable to the 2010 survey abundance estimate as well as the 9th year comparison to the 2015 abundance estimate in 2010 our location had experienced a 99 loss of ash trees 10 cm which had occurred over 6 years knight et al 2013 therefore the modelled scenario closely mimics the actual events as such our model s quasi extinction of 34 years indicates that our location extinction would be around the year 2040 if high ash mortality conditions remain prevalent these results should be viewed with caution though as our 2010 survey data was extrapolated for the smaller size classes including yearlings which were found to have high variability in survival boerner and brinkman 1996 messaoud and houle 2006 these comparisons suggest that worst case model has captured much of the trend in ash abundance that was first observed which highlights the benefit in considering pva to facilitate understanding of these natural populations management has also continually increased its power to combat eab and improvements are still being made mccullough et al 2016 jones et al 2016 there are multiple hymenoptera parasitoids that use eab larvae as hosts for their eggs leluthia astigma oobius agrili spathius agrili spathius galinae and tetrastichus planipennisi have been documented parasitoids of which all but one are reared and released to help control eab populations gould et al 2012 natural control factors include intraspecific competition woodpeckers and bark foraging bird predation and environmental factors that limit eab dispersal fahrner et al 2015 b bassiana is a fungal species that has also been proven effective in controlling eab populations castrillo et al 2010 human management and natural factors will change the eab population and thus the impact they have on ash survival and the longevity of the population the historic scenario had a population trajectory that dipped slightly at first and then decrease slowly over time the decrease in the population abundance was not unexpected since we included stochasticity in plant survival and reproduction the trajectory showed that the ash tree population was unlikely to be sustainable forever under the conditions we initiated in subsequent analyses with longer time periods used our historic scenario had a quasi extinction at year 132 and when standard deviations were removed the population did not go extinct which indicates the variation in our parameters maybe too large to produce a stable ash population over time it is also possible that over 50 100 years habitat changes would influence ash parameters towards a different growth rate we did not explicitly account for other potential influences beyond what was inherent in the demographic estimates for our estimates we were able to find literature on adult ash survival in horticultural gardens which may or may not be accurately reflected in natural settings literature on ash and other economically important tree species are more prevalent than other plant species since humans are interested in them for harvesting and landscaping we found less literature though focused on natural ash germination seedlings and the oldest ash stage of growth especially for historic parameters a lack information on life history parameters limits the predictive power of the pva from which we may derive an understanding of potential future outcomes and species recovery our model scenarios were based on green ash in a floodplain or bottomland habitat and would likely have slightly different outcomes for ash species in different habitat types these baseline models will allow for comparisons to future models with different possible viability estimates of future ash generations under varying conditions e g continued eab presence additional disease or pests weather extremes land management changes and habitat limitations on carrying capacity in addition this stage based modeling approach is readily adaptable to other locations other species and other habitat types pva is very useful for organizing information assessing vulnerabilities and addressing specific questions about a species akçakaya and sjorgren gulve 2000 yet plant physiological traits such as their ability to reproduce clonally and disperse in multiple ways can limit plant population studies menges 2000 silvertown 1982 these traits make it potentially difficult to identify individuals and seperate populations while identifying individuals in our study was possible challenges in tree models include their long life span reproductive biology and ability to re sprout after the original trunk s death ash are also dioecious while other trees are often monoecious we assumed that the proportion of males was equal to females and that this would have no influence on the population growth rate however as adult ash tree populations fall to low densities it is possible that lack of pollination will limit the reproduction success of female trees further study is needed to account for impacts on model parameters from different proportions of males and females and increasing distance between trees as the number of trees decreases while plant species population models can be difficult to build trees can effectively be modeled with a stage structure matrix davelos and jarosz 2004 our model adds to the few population viability analyses developed for tree species other tree models have explored the long term influence of rapid impacts such as pest infestation or harvest in harvest scenarios for big leaf mahogany yields were severely depleted after 2 3 30 year harvest cycles and a tree density minimum was reported for sustainability grogan et al 2014 critical knowledge gaps can be identified with models and thus shed light on productive research avenues for example models of the whitebark pine pinus albicaulis revealed that pine beetle attacks had larger impacts on population growth than the whitebark pine disease blister rust jules et al 2016 like ash whitebark pine populations will improve with better pest management management options can be improved by first testing their potential outcomes in population models in the case of the english yew many management strategies were modelled to assess their impact on risk of extinction and population viability to then assess which combination of management strategies best improved the yew s outcome in the next 20 years dhar et al 2008 of the utmost importance is understanding what did and could occur with the eab invasion over time and pva can help accomplish this eab has been found in many other areas within the eastern n america ash tree range this research reveals how natural green ash tree population dynamics change in the face of an invasive pest outbreak we will be able to apply our results to future models that assist in adaptive management planning to improve natural ash population dynamics which may be applicable to other areas across the species range declaration of interest none acknowledgments we appreciate the permission
