14670,micro nano plastics widely detected in aquatic environments have caused serious threat to water quality security however as a potential important source of micro nano plastics in surface water during the covid 19 pandemic the ecological risks of face mask waste to aquatic environments remain poorly understood herein we comprehensively characterized the micro nano plastics and organic compounds released from four daily used face masks in aqueous environments and further evaluated their potential impacts on aquatic ecosystem safety by quantitative genotoxicity assay results from spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrum showed that plastic microfibers particles 11 83 and leachable organic compounds 15 87 were dominantly emitted pollutants which were significantly higher than nanoplastics 5 based on mass of carbon additionally a toxicogenomics approach using green fluorescence protein fused whole cell array revealed that membrane stress was the primary response upon the exposure to micro nano plastics whereas the emitted organic chemicals were mainly responsible for dna damage involving most of the dna repair pathways e g base nucleotide excision repair mismatch repair double strand break repair implying their severe threat to membrane structure and dna replication of microorganisms therefore the persistent release of discarded face masks derived pollutants might exacerbate water quality and even adversely affect aquatic microbial functions these findings would contribute to unraveling the potential effects of face mask waste on aquatic ecosystem security and highlight the necessity for more developed management regulations in face mask disposal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquatic environment face mask micro nano plastics leachate toxicogenomics assay 1 introduction plastics are high molecular polymers and widely used in all aspect of daily life sheridan et al 2022 however due to improper waste management regulations large fraction of the used plastic products was released into environment and mostly ending up in the aquatic systems along with precipitation and surface runoff shammi et al 2021 plastics in aquatic environment undergo various natural processes e g mechanical abrasion photo oxidation and microbial degradation and are broken down into particles of different sizes such as microplastics mps 5 mm and nanoplastics nps 1000 nm ter halle et al 2016 at present micro nano plastics derived from degradation of plastic waste are considered as emerging contaminants in aquatic environments due to their potential threat to aquatic biota and public water safety li et al 2018 prior studies revealed that micro nano plastics could be mistakenly ingested by aquatic organisms e g zooplankton fish and crab resulting in adverse health effects including mechanical injury inflammatory response and metabolic disturbance cole et al 2013 wardrop et al 2016 watts et al 2015 micro nano plastics can also affect the fate and transport of antibiotic resistance genes human opportunistic pathogens and chemical pollutants e g organic contaminants and heavy metals in aquatic system due to their huge specific surface area and hydrophobicity liu et al 2023 mato et al 2001 wu et al 2019 as a such the plastic waste and their related pollutants deserved more attention notably the explosive growth of face mask usage and improper waste management regulations significantly aggravate the issues of plastic waste in aquatic system during the covid 19 global pandemic macintyre and wang 2020 according to the data reported by the worldwide fund for nature incorrect disposal methods would result in approximately 10 million face masks being discarded into aquatic environments per month which is equivalent to approximately 30 40 tons of plastic waste wwf 2020 recent studies of their frequent occurrence in aqueous environment e g lakes rivers oceans and coasts have raised increasing public concerns chowdhury et al 2021 li et al 2023 lian et al 2023 sullivan et al 2021 while the potential aquatic environmental risks induced by discarded face masks and their derived pollutants remain unclear different from other plastic products e g plastic bag plastic water bottles and take out food containers the commonly used face masks are mostly made from non woven fabrics and possess loose structure zafar et al 2016 hence once released into natural aquatic environment these plastic fibers were subject to various aging process and easily fragmented into smaller plastic fibers which have been reported to have higher ecotoxicity to aquatic biota ziajahromi et al 2017 in addition various additives e g plasticizer flame retardants and surfactants added in face masks to improve their performance can also be released into water bodies by different ways such as leaching uv irradiation and microbial degradation gewert et al 2018 liu et al 2019 sullivan et al 2021 the intake of micro nano plastics and leachable organic compounds by organisms might lead to acute toxicity or chronic damage with the trophic transfer via the food web obiakor et al 2017 therefore compared with face mask itself mps nps and leachable organics derived from face mask might pose higher potential risks to aquatic biota and water quality security whereas little data on the release amount and environmental responses for mps nps and leachable chemicals originated from various face masks can be obtained previously sound evidences for toxicity of microplastics and their derived contaminants e g nanoplastics and leachates have been provided using in vivo whole animal based testing or traditional in vitro cell based assays chen et al 2022a dong et al 2020 klein et al 2021 snape et al 2004 nevertheless these traditional methods have certain deficiencies such as resource intensive time consuming and deep mechanism at the genetic level remain unknow gou et al 2010 great knowledge gaps between toxicological information and environment risks of microplastics and their associated contaminants still exist toxicogenomics as a new in vitro cell based toxicity bioassay could monitor thousands of genes corresponded to external stressors in transcription and expression levels and provide significant and comprehensive information to reveal the pollutant specific toxicity mechanisms and pathways gou et al 2010 moreover compared with traditional cytotoxicity assays this toxicogenomics based toxicity assessment approach can test the whole toxicity level using one single assay within two hours which dramatically decreases the test time resources and cost furthermore this method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the subcytotoxic changes since cellular responses are preferentially activated than the detectable phenotype effects under environmental stressors gou et al 2010 overall this kind of in vitro bioassay is rapid sensitive dependable and high throughput which makes it feasible to screen various emerging contaminants such as nanomaterials and organic pollutants in aquatic environment to evaluate their genotoxicity and potential environmental risks gou et al 2014 lan et al 2014 lan et al 2018 therefore we supposed that the genotoxicity assessment can be also suitable for environmental risk evaluation of micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals derived from face masks the objective of this study was to investigate the potential ecological effects of face mask pollution on water quality safety by deciphering release characteristics and genotoxicity of micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals derived from the commonly used face masks firstly the basic physiochemical properties of various face masks i e surgical mask sm n95 respirator nr polyurethane mask pm and cloth mask cm were demonstrated subsequently the release process of face mask derived microplastics nanoplastics and organic chemicals and the physiochemical properties of these pollutants were systematically characterized lastly a quantitative toxicogenomics based assay was employed to reveal their genotoxicity and intrinsic mechanisms at the molecular level overall our results would reveal the potential environmental risks of the commonly used face masks to aquatic systems promoting the more reasonable management for discarded face masks 2 material and methods 2 1 materials four types of commonly used face masks were purchased from local market and related characteristics e g infrared spectroscopy contact angle and surface morphology were provided in the supporting information surgical masks and n95 respirators are widely used during the covid 19 pandemic while polyurethane masks and cloth masks are commonly used to prevent pollen allergy and cold weather in our daily life ma et al 2022 martinez et al 2021 hence to make a full scale comparison they were all investigated in this study other chemicals of analytical grade

combusted at 400 for 2 h before used 2 2 contaminant release experiments due to the difference in raw material the filtering layer and earloop of sm and nr were individually investigated but not for pm and cm their filtering layer and earloop were made from same raw material of polyurethane and polyester respectively the leaching experiment was conducted following the similar procedures as reported by wang et al 2021 briefly for each used face mask wearing two days and placed in a moving pockets the metal nose bridge for sm and nr was removed firstly and then the remaining part including filtering layers and earloop were separated and submerged in 500 ml beaker containing artificial freshwater solution and then agitated by magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm to ensure entirely exposure under dark at room temperature artificial freshwater without mask strips was used as the blank samples were withdrawn at pre determined time for later tests contaminant leaching experiments and all relevant measurements were both conducted in triplicates 2 3 characterizations of micro nano plastics and leachates 2 3 1 turbidity and weight measurements the suspension containing plastic particles was withdrawn on 12 24 48 60 and 72 h and analyzed with turbidimeter wgz 1b shanghai xinrui instrument co ltd china to determine the relative content of released plastic particles additionally to further quantify the specific value of the emitted microplastics the suspended solution at the endpoint was filtered through a 1 μm pre weighted filter and transferred to clean petri dishes for 48 h drying at 30 in the vacuum drying oven dzf 6020 shanghai boxun industry commerce co ltd china and then weighted in an electronic balance ms205du mettler toledo switzerland with precision of 0 01 mg to make a directed comparison the turbidity and weight of released particles were normalized by the weight of each face mask including filtering layers and earloops all measurements were conducted in triplicates to increase the statistical power for data analysis furthermore the suspension was also filtered through 0 1 μm membrane and dried to obtain the combination of mps and nps 2 3 2 size and morphology measurements the size and morphology of mps and nps were characterized with scanning electron microscope sem and dynamic light scattering dls mask strips were removed from the solutions at the endpoint and the remaining suspension was successively passed through 1 μm and 0 1 μm filters and the mp and np particles were obtained on the membrane surface respectively for sem analysis the filter coated with mps and nps was cut into small piece and fixed on the carbon tape and then examined with a tungsten hairpin filament sem prox phenom world netherlands and a field emission sem geminisem 500 zeiss germany respectively in addition all mps in sem images were measured using nano measurer software to obtained the size distribution while the hydrodynamic diameter of nps passing through 1 μm membrane was measured on a zetasizer nano zs instrument malvern instruments uk operated with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and scattering angle of 173 2 3 3 spectrometry and total organic carbon analyses to clarify the polymer types of original face masks and released micro nano plastics the major characteristic peaks were recorded

calculated and tentatively identified components were obtained by searching in chemspider and open database detailed data process was provided in the supporting information 2 4 sample preparation and toxicogenomics bioassay the samples including plastic fibers particles mps and nps and leachable chemicals were subjected to the toxicity assessment due to the relatively lower content of nps 5 mps and nps were investigated together in this study the tested concentration of micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals were 10 mg l and 10 mg c l respectively detailed sample preparation procedures are presented in the supporting information in this study we employed transcriptional effect level index teli profiling analysis that uses a green fluorescent protein gfp fused whole cell array of escherichia coli e coli k12 mg1655 to conduct a toxicogenomics based toxicity assessment which can convert the information rich toxicogenomic data into integrated and quantitative endpoints the selected cell library with transcriptional gfp fusions monitors the promoter activities of genes associated with various known cellular stress response pathways e g oxidative stress protein stress

statistical power for data analysis after that the obtained data needed to be processed to determine the teli value according to the previous studies gou et al 2010 gou et al 2014 lan et al 2014 lan et al 2018 more detailed calculation procedure is presented in the supporting information 2 5 statistical analysis data of particle weight toc content and genotoxicity between triplicated treatments were statistically analyzed using a one way anova in spss 25 software a difference was considered significant at p 0 05 or 0 01 principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed using canoco 5 0 to evaluate the similarity of genotoxicity profiles based on bray curtis distance 3 results 3 1 physiochemical properties of original face masks the chemical composition hydrophobicity and surface morphology of four selected face masks were compared using an ftir py gc ms contact angle measurement and sem observation as shown in fig 1a the typical adsorption peaks e g 3297 2870 2952 1637 and 1539 cm 1 of four face masks were observed and summarized in table 1 which indicated that sm layer sm earloop nr layer nr earloop pm and cm were made from polypropylene pp polyamide 6 pa6 pp polyester pet polyurethane pu and pet respectively based on ftir analysis with match rates ranging from 79 49 to 95 50 falco et al 2019 mintenig et al 2020 ullah et al 2020 furthermore the typical compounds such as trimer 2 4 dimethyl 1 heptene caprolactam benzoic acid toluene diisocynate ribeiro et al 2020 were obtained from py gc ms analysis which belong to the characteristic pyrolysis products of pp pa6 pet pu respectively fig 1b and table s5 therefore in agreement with ftir the results of py gc ms further confirmed the polymer types of various face masks and their earloops as presented in fig 1c the contact angles of sm and nr layers reached to about 120 which were far more than those of their earloops with contact angles of 6 15 and 74 48 respectively different from the above two masks pm and cm all presented hydrophilic property with contact angles in the range of 50 80 furthermore the surface morphology of face masks was examined by sem figs 1d and s4 and results showed that sm and nr including their layers and earloops as well as cm were woven from microfibers with diameter of 25 μm while pm was made from non uniform porous polymer with 150 μm pore and smooth surface such physiochemical properties might alter the contact interface between various face masks and water and thereby affect the release of pollutants 3 2 characterization of micro nano plastics released from face masks the release potential of plastic fibers particles from various face masks sm layer sm earloop nr layer nr earloop pm and cm were individually evaluated in simulated freshwater condition as shown in fig 2a and 2b the weight normalized turbidity and weight of released plastic microfibers exhibited similar trends with more mps were emitted from earloop than those from their filtering layers the weights of mps for nr earloop and sm earloop showed maximum with the values of 5 45 and 4 54 mg g respectively which were significantly higher than those from their corresponding filtering layers and other two face masks p 0 05 the representativeness of emitted mps was further verified by ftir and py gc ms analyses in figs 2c and s5 showing consistent results with those obtained for original face masks fig 1a and b furthermore the size distribution of released mps was obtained using nano measurer software based on sem images fig s6 as shown in fig 2d the sizes of mps derived from sm layer and nr layer ranged from 10 to 300 µm while those obtained for sm earloop and nr earloop showed higher length range from 100 to 1000 µm the mps released from pm and cm possessed the middle size distribution ranging from 10 to 700 µm moreover the possibility of existence of smaller plastic particles e g nps with size bellow 1000 nm was also considered the dls results showed that nps derived from cm and sm layer had the smallest diameters with an average d h of 246 6 nm and 291 1 nm respectively while other nps e g from sm earloop nr layer nr earloop and pm exhibited similar diameter of 450 nm fig s7a b and table s7 which was further confirmed visually by high resolution sem images fig s8 after that these particles were also lyophilized and analyzed by ftir showing the similar spectra with the virgin face mask layer or earloop as reflected in fig s7c which further identified the release of nanoplastics from face masks 3 3 identification of leachates with spectroscopic and high resolution mass spectrometry the organic chemicals leached from diverse face masks were also collected and analyzed to assess their release potentials in water the overall leaching content of dissolved organic compounds in solution were measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer which all increased with time extended and reached a maximum at endpoint 72 h figs 3 a and s9 similar to the trends of mp release the earloops of sm and nr also emitted the highest amount of organic chemicals at approximately 7 5 and 3 7 mg c g respectively meanwhile large amounts of chemicals were also emitted from pm mask with toc content of 3 5 mg c g which was about 10 times higher than those from other three face masks moreover the relative abundance of mps nps and organic compounds liberated from various face masks was evaluated using unified carbon mass as shown in fig s10 the fragmented microplastics 11 83 and leachable organic compounds 15 87 were main pollutants which were significantly higher than nanoplastics 5 in addition the release kinetics of chemicals from various face masks were also monitored using uv vis spectroscopy which showed the similar trends with toc results figs 3b and s11 moreover several characteristic peaks e g 245 280 and 250 nm were observed in leachates of sm earloop pm and cm which might be related with benzene ring or double bonds of the released compounds in solution fu et al 2016 to further determine the chemical compounds of leachates the nontarget analysis was conducted using a hplc qtof ms and relevant results were displayed in figs 3c d s12 and tables s8 9 total ion chromatogram could reflect overall signal intensity to some extent as shown in fig s12 compared with blank sample significantly increased signal intensities were noticed at the range of 5 to 15 min for compounds liberated from leachates of face masks furthermore molecular formulae were assigned by masterview software and the number of compounds identified during each step is shown in table s8 17 45 13 52 36 and 50 tentative chemicals were obtained for sm layer sm earloop nr layer nr earloop pm and cm respectively they were further presented in the form of van krevelen diagram fig 3c the unique characteristics of h c and o c indicated their difference in aromaticity unsaturated degree and oxygen containing groups for each face mask layer or earloop leachates after searching in chemspider or open databases all possible identified molecules with structure were obtained and summarized in table s9 for example lots of chemicals such as dibutyl adipate dba c14h26o4 yellow inhibitor hn 150 c21h28n4o2 and 17 hydroxy 3 6 9 12 15 pentaoxaheptadec 1 yl laurate c24h48o8 which were used as typical additives during the plastic production were detected in face mask leachates furthermore according to their properties or application these compounds were classified into five categories including synthetic materials or intermediates plasticizers surfactants other additives and unknown compounds which account for 41 4 13 8 10 3 22 4 and 12 1 respectively fig 3d 3 4 genotoxicity of micro nano plastics and organic chemicals liberated from various face masks transcriptional effect level index teli as a quantitative endpoint for toxicogenomics based toxicity assay was employed to probe the genotoxicity of emitted pollutants e g micro nano plastics and organic chemicals through various damage pathways i e oxidative protein membrane general and dna stresses to microbial cells the altered gene expression changes induced by leachable chemicals 10 mg c l fig 4 and micro nano plastics 10 mg l fig s13 exhibited completely different profiles overall lots of gene expressions e g katg sdhc flgm and recn were greatly altered by chemicals as reflected by teli heatmap fig 4a based on statistical analysis the total stresses were significantly induced by chemicals emitted from almost all face mask layers and earloops i e sm earloop nr layer nr earloop pm and cm p 0 01 fig 4b subsequently the transcriptional level response for each stress category was further quantified by calculating their individual teli values and results showed that the oxidative membrane and dna stress were main responses induced by these emitted chemicals among these face mask layers and earloops nr earloop and pm derived chemicals both exhibited significantly higher teli values for oxidative and membrane stress while cm only showed membrane damage p 0 01 fig 4c and e however neither of leachates showed protein and general stress fig 4d and f notably the released organic compounds from various face mask layers and earloops except for sm layer all induced a significant dna stress with p 0 01 fig 4g similar phenomenon was observed in analysis of stress response pathways figs s14 and s15 which showed that more severe dna stresses were induced by most of mask layers and earloops derived leachates except sm layer compared with oxidative and membrane stress compared to the emitted chemicals the released micro nano plastics from face mask layers and earloops exhibited relatively lower genotoxicity except for cm as represented in fig s13a and b for almost all individual damage pathways most of tested face mask layers and earloops except cm failed to induce significant variations fig s13 noticeably only membrane damage was significantly caused by micro nano plastics derived from nr layer pm and cm p 0 05 and related gene expressions e g daca marc emre sdhc and flgm were strongly affected fig s13e particularly micro nano plastics liberated from cm also displayed significant oxidative general and protein stress p 0 05 while sm layer only induced general stress fig s13c and d moreover the pcoa analysis exhibited that the genotoxicity induced by organic chemicals were clearly clustered into one group except for sm layer and separated from control group along the first principal coordinate while micro nano plastics clustered with control group except for cm indicating their distinctive toxicity responses and mechanisms fig s16 4 discussion 4 1 face masks act as a potentially vital source of micro nano plastics and organic chemicals in aqueous systems according to the data reported by the world wide fund for nature even if only 1 of the total used masks was discarded the incorrect disposal methods would result in that around 10 million face masks were discarded into aquatic environments per month wwf 2020 based on the normalized values in fig 2b these wasted masks can release about 16 128 kg of microplastics each month which was equivalent to 4 41 1011 2 92 1012 plastic particles table s10 detailed calculation processes were provided in supporting information such numbers were remarkably higher than those for other plastic products e g plastic water bottles take out food containers and polymer ropes etc du et al 2020 welden and cowie 2017 winkler et al 2019 indicating discarded face masks might possess more adverse effects on aquatic eco environments the mps released from face masks were similar to plankton in size and might be mistakenly ingested by aquatic organisms such as zooplankton fish and crab leading to potential adverse health effects chen et al 2022b moreover the mps released from face masks were mainly composed with fibers fig s6 which have been reported to have higher toxicity to organisms than plastic particles ziajahromi et al 2017 additionally some recent studies demonstrated that micro nano plastics can act as vector for environmental pollutants antibiotic resistance genes human opportunistic pathogens and chemicals and transfer through the trophic level into the food chain huang et al 2021 liu et al 2023 wu et al 2019 as a result micro nano plastics released from face masks might affect fate and transport of environmental contaminants and even potentially enter the food web via aquatic food products posing more serious threat on aquatic biota and even human health furthermore various plastic additives such as plasticizers surfactants cross linking agent etc would also be liberated when face masks were discharged into water environments hence we also estimated the total content of organic chemicals liberated from selected face masks per month which ranged from 10 45 to 92 64 kg c per month table s10 notably although earloop merely occupied 15 of total weight for each face mask sm and np the organic compounds released from their earloops accounted for around 69 78 of total organic matter indicating more emitted toxin and higher potential environmental risks might be induced by face mask earloop the persistent input of these degradation resistant organic pollutants would put a huge burden on natural water quality and subsequent drinking water treatment gunaalan et al 2020 in addition as a result of mechanical abrasion the raw material of face mask was fragmented and released micro nano plastics and organic compounds into water such behavior also occurred in natural aqueous environments and weathering factors e g uv irradiation thermal oxidation and microbial degradation could synergistically accelerate this process liu et al 2022 song et al 2017 and thereby more pollutants might be emitted from discarded face masks in actual condition therefore the discarded face masks potentially serve as an important source of micro nano plastics and organic chemicals in aqueous systems which induced serious threat to aquatic ecosystem and water quality security 4 2 genotoxicity and ecological risks induced by face mask derived micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals in aquatic environments in this study the genotoxicity of micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals derived from various face masks were demonstrated via tolxicogenomics based assessment and the in depth toxicity mechanisms were simultaneously proposed in fig 5 the results showed membrane damage was identified as the main toxicity mechanism upon expose to micro nano plastics the plastic debris with smaller size sharp edge and higher hydrophobicity from face mask layers were more easily adhere to bacterial surface and hence resulted in more severe membrane damage figs 1b 2d and s6 8 such phenomenon was consistent with previous reports that mps induced cytotoxicity was attributed to membrane injury membrane potential collapse and lipid peroxidation chen et al 2022a salimi et al 2022 moreover our teli based toxicity assessment further revealed that the specific gene expressions e g sdhc cyoa marr emre cls and flgm associated with synthesis and metabolism of lipid main component of cell membrane were significantly altered by face mask derived micro nano plastics figs s13a and s15a which might alter the cell membrane permeability the increased cell membrane permeability could facilitate the uptake of exogenous dna by bacteria and then enhance the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes wang et al 2022 compared with micro nano plastics leachable chemicals with much smaller molecules might adhere to bacterial surface e g surfactants or get inside cell e g plasticizer and synthetic materials or intermediates etc and consequently result in oxidative membrane and dna stresses fig s14 many genes connected with ros sensor e g soxs superoxide dismutase e g soda and catalase e g kate and katg were significantly upregulated under leachate exposure indicating that leachable chemicals e g plasticizers and surfactants from most of daily used masks are toxic to microorganisms and could trigger the oxidative stress defending mechanisms figs s14 and s15 the overproduction of ros further induced more serious dna damage which involve almost all of the dna repair pathways e g base excision repair ber excision repair ner mismatch repair mmr double strand break repair dbr figs 4g and s14 gou et al 2014 on the one hand the unexpected oxidation of double strand dna e g guanine might lead to cytotoxicity and even bacteria death foti et al 2012 imposing an adverse impact to microbial diversity and functions in aquatic systems on the other hand the presence of multi repair mechanisms might increase the possibility of base mismatch and further result in gene mutation and the appearance of resistant bacteria garcia et al 2020 maiques et al 2006 which might pose more serious threat to aquatic ecosystem safety and even human health 5 conclusions plastic waste and their derived pollutants e g micro nano plastics and additives severely threatens water quality safety results from this study clearly demonstrated that the massive usage and improper management of face masks during the covid 19 global pandemic aggravated the issues of plastic waste via releasing micro nano plastics as well as organic chemicals in aquatic environments the discarded face masks worldwide are estimated to release about 4 41 1011 2 92 1012 plastic particles and 10 45 to 92 64 kg c organic chemicals to water body per month which were remarkably higher than those for other plastic products including plastic water bottles and take out food containers furthermore genotoxicity assessments revealed that membrane stress e g genes sdhc marr emre and flgm and dna damage e g genes reca polb ssb and recn were main primary responses when exposed to micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals respectively such abundant micro nano plastics and organic compounds released from the discarded face masks might induce serious threat to water quality security and aquatic biota by increasing pollutant content and damaging microbial functions noticeably discarded face mask may undergo various aging processes and thereby potentially aggravate the release and toxicity of pollutants from face masks in the aquatic environment which need further systematic experiments in future studies data availability data will be made available on request declaration of competing

concerns chowdhury et al 2021 li et al 2023 lian et al 2023 sullivan et al 2021 while the potential aquatic environmental risks induced by discarded face masks and their derived pollutants remain unclear different from other plastic products e g plastic bag plastic water bottles and take out food containers the commonly used face masks are mostly made from non woven fabrics and possess loose structure zafar et al 2016 hence once released into natural aquatic environment these plastic fibers were subject to various aging process and easily fragmented into smaller plastic fibers which have been reported to have higher ecotoxicity to aquatic biota ziajahromi et al 2017 in addition various additives e g plasticizer flame retardants and surfactants added in face masks to improve their performance can also be released into water bodies by different ways such as leaching uv irradiation and microbial degradation gewert et al 2018 liu et al 2019 sullivan et al 2021 the intake of micro nano plastics and leachable organic compounds by organisms might lead to acute toxicity or chronic damage with the trophic transfer via the food web obiakor et al 2017 therefore compared with face mask itself mps nps and leachable organics derived from face mask might pose higher potential risks to aquatic biota and water quality security whereas little data on the release amount and environmental responses for mps nps and leachable chemicals originated from various face masks can be obtained previously sound evidences for toxicity of microplastics and their derived contaminants e g nanoplastics and leachates have been provided using in vivo whole animal based testing or traditional in vitro cell based assays chen et al 2022a dong et al 2020 klein et al 2021 snape et al 2004 nevertheless these traditional methods have certain deficiencies such as resource intensive time consuming and deep mechanism at the genetic level remain unknow gou et al 2010 great knowledge gaps between toxicological information and environment risks of microplastics and their associated contaminants still exist toxicogenomics as a new in vitro cell based toxicity bioassay could monitor thousands of genes corresponded to external stressors in transcription and expression levels and provide significant and comprehensive information to reveal the pollutant specific toxicity mechanisms and pathways gou et al 2010 moreover compared with traditional cytotoxicity assays this toxicogenomics based toxicity assessment approach can test the whole toxicity level using one single assay within two hours which dramatically decreases the test time resources and cost furthermore this method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the subcytotoxic changes since cellular responses are preferentially activated than the detectable phenotype effects under environmental stressors gou et al 2010 overall this kind of in vitro bioassay is rapid sensitive dependable and high throughput which makes it feasible to screen various emerging contaminants such as nanomaterials and organic pollutants in aquatic environment to evaluate their genotoxicity and potential environmental risks gou et al 2014 lan et al 2014 lan et al 2018 therefore we supposed that the genotoxicity assessment can be also suitable for environmental risk evaluation of micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals derived from face masks the objective of this study was to investigate the potential ecological effects of face mask pollution on water quality safety by deciphering release characteristics and genotoxicity of micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals derived from the commonly used face masks firstly the basic physiochemical properties of various face masks i e surgical mask sm n95 respirator nr polyurethane mask pm and cloth mask cm were demonstrated subsequently the release process of face mask derived microplastics nanoplastics and organic chemicals and the physiochemical properties of these pollutants were systematically characterized lastly a quantitative toxicogenomics based assay was employed to reveal their genotoxicity and intrinsic mechanisms at the molecular level overall our results would reveal the potential environmental risks of the commonly used face masks to aquatic systems promoting the more reasonable management for discarded face masks 2 material

provided in the supporting information surgical masks and n95 respirators are widely used during the covid 19 pandemic while polyurethane masks and cloth masks are commonly used to prevent pollen allergy and cold weather in our daily life ma et al 2022 martinez et al 2021 hence to make a full scale comparison they were all investigated in this study other chemicals of analytical grade

combusted at 400 for 2 h before used 2 2 contaminant release experiments due to the difference in raw material the filtering layer and earloop of sm and nr were individually investigated but not for pm and cm their filtering layer and earloop were made from same raw material of polyurethane and polyester respectively the leaching experiment was conducted following the similar procedures as reported by wang et al 2021 briefly for each used face mask wearing two days and placed in a moving pockets the metal nose bridge for sm and nr was removed firstly and then the remaining part including filtering layers and earloop were separated and submerged in 500 ml beaker containing artificial freshwater solution and then agitated by magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm to ensure entirely exposure under dark at room temperature artificial freshwater without mask strips was used as the blank samples were withdrawn at pre determined time for later tests contaminant leaching experiments and all relevant measurements were both conducted in triplicates 2 3 characterizations of micro nano plastics and leachates 2 3 1 turbidity and weight measurements the suspension containing plastic particles was withdrawn on 12 24 48 60 and 72 h and analyzed with turbidimeter wgz 1b shanghai xinrui instrument co ltd china to determine the relative content of released plastic particles additionally to further quantify the specific value of the emitted microplastics the suspended solution at the endpoint was filtered through a 1 μm pre weighted filter and transferred to clean petri dishes for 48 h drying at 30 in the vacuum drying oven dzf 6020 shanghai boxun industry commerce co ltd china and then weighted in an electronic balance ms205du mettler toledo switzerland with precision of 0 01 mg to make a directed comparison the turbidity and weight of released particles were normalized by the weight of each face mask including filtering layers and earloops all measurements were conducted in triplicates to increase the statistical power for data analysis furthermore the suspension was also filtered through 0 1 μm membrane and dried to obtain the combination of mps and nps 2 3 2 size and morphology measurements the size and morphology of mps and nps were characterized with scanning electron microscope sem and dynamic light scattering dls mask strips were removed from the solutions at the endpoint and the remaining suspension was successively passed through 1 μm and 0 1 μm filters and the mp and np particles were obtained on the membrane surface respectively for sem analysis the filter coated with mps and nps was cut into small piece and fixed on the carbon tape and then examined with a tungsten hairpin filament sem prox phenom world netherlands and a field emission sem geminisem 500 zeiss germany respectively in addition all mps in sem images were measured using nano measurer software to obtained the size distribution while the hydrodynamic diameter of nps passing through 1 μm membrane was measured on a zetasizer nano zs instrument malvern instruments uk operated with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and scattering

calculated and tentatively identified components were obtained by searching in chemspider and open database detailed data process was provided in the supporting information 2 4 sample preparation and toxicogenomics bioassay the samples including plastic fibers particles mps and nps and leachable chemicals were subjected to the toxicity assessment due to the relatively lower content of nps 5 mps and nps were investigated together in this study the tested concentration of micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals were 10 mg l and 10 mg c l respectively detailed sample preparation procedures are presented in the supporting information in this study we employed transcriptional effect level index teli profiling analysis that uses a green fluorescent protein gfp fused whole cell array of escherichia coli e coli k12 mg1655 to conduct a toxicogenomics based toxicity assessment which can convert the information rich toxicogenomic data into integrated and quantitative endpoints the

statistical power for data analysis after that the obtained data needed to be processed to determine the teli value according to the previous studies gou et al 2010 gou et al 2014 lan et al 2014 lan et al 2018 more detailed calculation procedure is presented in the supporting information 2 5 statistical analysis data of particle weight toc content and genotoxicity between triplicated treatments were statistically analyzed using a one way anova in spss 25 software a difference was considered significant at p 0 05 or 0 01 principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed using canoco 5 0 to evaluate the similarity of genotoxicity profiles based on bray curtis distance 3 results 3 1 physiochemical properties of original face masks the chemical composition hydrophobicity and surface morphology of four selected face masks were compared using an ftir py gc ms contact angle measurement and sem observation as shown in fig 1a the typical adsorption peaks e g 3297 2870 2952 1637 and 1539 cm 1 of four face masks were observed and summarized in table 1 which indicated that sm layer sm earloop nr layer nr earloop pm and cm were made from polypropylene pp polyamide 6 pa6 pp polyester pet polyurethane pu and pet respectively based on ftir analysis with match rates ranging from 79 49 to 95 50 falco et al 2019 mintenig et al 2020 ullah et al 2020 furthermore the typical compounds such as trimer 2 4 dimethyl 1 heptene caprolactam benzoic acid toluene diisocynate ribeiro et al 2020 were obtained from py gc ms analysis which belong to the characteristic pyrolysis products of pp pa6 pet pu respectively fig 1b and table s5 therefore in agreement with ftir the results of py gc ms further confirmed the polymer types of various face masks and their earloops as presented in fig 1c the contact angles of sm and nr layers reached to about 120 which were far more than those of their earloops with contact angles of 6 15 and 74 48 respectively different from the above two masks pm and cm all presented hydrophilic property with contact angles in the range of 50 80 furthermore the surface morphology of face masks was examined by sem figs 1d and s4 and results showed that sm and nr including their layers and earloops as well as cm were woven from microfibers with diameter of 25 μm while pm was made from non uniform porous polymer with 150 μm pore and smooth surface such physiochemical properties might alter the contact interface between various face masks and water and thereby affect the release of pollutants 3 2 characterization of micro nano plastics released from face masks the release potential of plastic fibers particles from various face masks sm layer sm earloop nr layer nr earloop pm and cm were individually evaluated in simulated freshwater condition as shown in fig 2a and 2b the weight normalized turbidity and weight of released plastic microfibers exhibited similar trends with more mps were emitted from earloop than those from their filtering layers the weights of mps for nr earloop and sm earloop showed maximum with the values of 5 45 and 4 54 mg g respectively which were significantly higher than those from their corresponding filtering layers and other two face masks p 0 05 the representativeness of emitted mps was further verified by ftir and py gc ms analyses in figs 2c and s5 showing consistent results with those obtained for original face masks fig 1a and b furthermore the size distribution of released mps was obtained using nano measurer software based on sem images fig s6 as shown in fig 2d the sizes of mps derived from sm layer and nr layer ranged from 10 to 300 µm while those obtained for sm earloop and nr earloop showed higher length range from 100 to 1000 µm the mps released from pm and cm possessed the middle size distribution ranging from 10 to 700 µm moreover the possibility of existence of smaller plastic particles e g nps with size bellow 1000 nm was also considered the dls results showed that nps derived from cm and sm layer had the smallest diameters with an average d h of 246 6 nm and 291 1 nm respectively while other nps e g from sm earloop nr layer nr earloop and pm exhibited similar diameter of 450 nm fig s7a b and table s7 which was further confirmed visually by high resolution sem images fig s8 after that these particles were also lyophilized and analyzed by ftir showing the similar spectra with the virgin face mask layer or earloop as reflected in fig s7c which further identified the release of nanoplastics from face masks 3 3 identification of leachates with spectroscopic and high resolution mass spectrometry the organic chemicals leached from diverse face masks were also collected and analyzed to assess their release potentials in water the overall leaching content of dissolved organic compounds in solution were measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer which all increased with time extended and reached a maximum at endpoint 72 h figs 3 a and s9 similar to the trends of mp release the earloops of sm and nr also emitted the highest amount of organic chemicals at approximately 7 5 and 3 7 mg c g respectively meanwhile large amounts of chemicals were also emitted from pm mask with toc content of 3 5 mg c g which was about 10 times higher than those from other three face masks moreover the relative abundance of mps nps and organic compounds liberated from various face masks was evaluated using unified carbon mass as shown in fig s10 the fragmented microplastics 11 83 and leachable organic compounds 15 87 were main pollutants which were significantly higher than nanoplastics 5 in addition the release kinetics of chemicals from various face masks were also monitored using uv vis spectroscopy which showed the similar trends with toc results figs 3b and s11 moreover several characteristic peaks e g 245 280 and 250 nm were observed in leachates of sm earloop pm and cm which might be related with benzene ring or double bonds of the released compounds in solution fu et al 2016 to further determine the chemical compounds of leachates the nontarget analysis was conducted using a hplc qtof ms and relevant results were displayed in figs 3c d s12 and tables s8 9 total ion chromatogram could reflect overall signal intensity to some extent as shown in fig s12 compared with blank sample significantly increased signal intensities were noticed at the range of 5 to 15 min for compounds liberated from leachates of face masks furthermore molecular formulae were assigned by masterview software and the number of compounds identified during each step is shown in table s8 17 45 13 52 36 and 50 tentative chemicals were obtained for sm layer sm earloop nr layer nr earloop pm and cm respectively they were further presented in the form of van krevelen diagram fig 3c the unique characteristics of h c and o c indicated their difference in aromaticity unsaturated degree and oxygen containing groups for each face mask layer or earloop leachates after searching in chemspider or open databases all possible identified molecules with structure were obtained and summarized in table s9 for example lots of chemicals such as dibutyl adipate dba c14h26o4 yellow inhibitor hn 150 c21h28n4o2 and 17 hydroxy 3 6 9 12 15 pentaoxaheptadec 1 yl laurate c24h48o8 which were used as typical additives during the plastic production were detected in face mask leachates furthermore according to their properties or application these compounds were classified into five categories including synthetic materials or intermediates plasticizers surfactants other additives and unknown compounds which account for 41 4 13 8 10 3 22 4 and 12 1 respectively fig 3d 3 4 genotoxicity of micro nano plastics and organic chemicals liberated from various face masks transcriptional effect level index teli as a quantitative endpoint for toxicogenomics based toxicity assay was employed to probe the genotoxicity of emitted pollutants e g micro nano plastics and organic chemicals through various damage pathways i e oxidative protein membrane general and dna stresses to microbial cells the altered gene expression changes induced by leachable chemicals 10 mg c l fig 4 and micro nano plastics 10 mg l fig s13 exhibited completely different profiles overall lots of gene expressions e g katg sdhc flgm and recn were greatly altered by chemicals as reflected by teli heatmap fig 4a based on statistical analysis the total stresses were significantly induced by chemicals emitted from almost all face mask layers and earloops i e sm earloop nr layer nr earloop pm and cm p 0 01 fig 4b subsequently the transcriptional level response for each stress category was further quantified by calculating their individual teli values and results showed that the oxidative membrane and dna stress were main responses induced by these emitted chemicals among these face mask layers and earloops nr earloop and pm derived chemicals both exhibited significantly higher teli values for oxidative and membrane stress while cm only showed membrane damage p 0 01 fig 4c and e however neither of leachates showed protein and general stress fig 4d and f notably the released organic compounds from various face mask layers and earloops except for sm layer all induced a significant dna stress with p 0 01 fig 4g similar phenomenon was observed in analysis of stress response pathways figs s14 and s15 which showed that more severe dna stresses were induced by most of mask layers and earloops derived leachates except sm layer compared with oxidative and membrane stress compared to the emitted chemicals the released micro nano plastics from face mask layers and earloops exhibited relatively lower genotoxicity except for cm as represented in fig s13a and b for almost all individual damage pathways most of tested face mask layers and earloops except cm failed to induce significant variations fig s13 noticeably only membrane damage was significantly caused by micro nano plastics derived from nr layer pm and cm p 0 05 and related gene expressions e g daca marc emre sdhc and flgm were strongly affected fig s13e particularly micro nano plastics liberated from cm also displayed significant oxidative general and protein stress p 0 05 while sm layer only induced general stress fig s13c and d moreover the pcoa analysis exhibited that the genotoxicity induced by organic chemicals were clearly clustered into one group except for sm layer and separated from control group along the first principal coordinate while micro nano plastics clustered with control group except for cm indicating their distinctive toxicity responses and mechanisms fig s16 4 discussion 4 1 face masks act as a potentially vital source of micro nano plastics and organic chemicals in aqueous systems according to the data reported by the world wide fund for nature even if only 1 of the total used masks was discarded the incorrect disposal methods would result in that around 10 million face masks were discarded into aquatic environments per month wwf 2020 based on the normalized values in fig 2b these wasted masks can release about 16 128 kg of microplastics each month which was equivalent to 4 41 1011 2 92 1012 plastic particles table s10 detailed calculation processes were provided in supporting information such numbers were remarkably higher than those for other plastic products e g plastic water bottles take out food containers and polymer ropes etc du et al 2020 welden and cowie 2017 winkler et al 2019 indicating discarded face masks might possess more adverse effects on aquatic eco environments the mps released from face masks were similar to plankton in size and might be mistakenly ingested by aquatic organisms such as zooplankton fish and crab leading to potential adverse health effects chen et al 2022b moreover the mps released from face masks were mainly composed with fibers fig s6 which have been reported to have higher toxicity to organisms than plastic particles ziajahromi et al 2017 additionally some recent studies demonstrated that micro nano plastics can act as vector for environmental pollutants antibiotic resistance genes human opportunistic pathogens and chemicals and transfer through the trophic level into the food chain huang et al 2021 liu et al 2023 wu et al 2019 as a result micro nano plastics released from face masks might affect fate and transport of environmental contaminants and even potentially enter the food web via aquatic food products posing more serious threat on aquatic biota and even human health furthermore various plastic additives such as plasticizers surfactants cross linking agent etc would also be liberated when face masks were discharged into water environments hence we also estimated the total content of organic chemicals liberated from selected face masks per month which ranged from 10 45 to 92 64 kg c per month table s10 notably although earloop merely occupied 15 of total weight for each face mask sm and np the organic compounds released from their earloops accounted for around 69 78 of total organic matter indicating more emitted toxin and higher potential environmental risks might be induced by face mask earloop the persistent input of these degradation resistant organic pollutants would put a huge burden on natural water quality and subsequent drinking water treatment gunaalan et al 2020 in addition as a result of mechanical abrasion the raw material of face mask was fragmented and released micro nano plastics and organic compounds into water such behavior also occurred in natural aqueous environments and weathering factors e g uv irradiation thermal oxidation and microbial degradation could synergistically accelerate this process liu et al 2022 song et al 2017 and thereby more pollutants might be emitted from discarded face masks in actual condition therefore the discarded face masks potentially serve as an important source of micro nano plastics and organic chemicals in aqueous systems which induced serious threat to aquatic ecosystem and water quality security 4 2 genotoxicity and ecological risks induced by face mask derived micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals in aquatic environments in this study the genotoxicity of micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals derived from various face masks were demonstrated via tolxicogenomics based assessment and the in depth toxicity mechanisms were simultaneously proposed in fig 5 the results showed membrane damage was identified as the main toxicity mechanism upon expose to micro nano plastics the plastic debris with smaller size sharp edge and higher hydrophobicity from face mask layers were more easily adhere to bacterial surface and hence resulted in more severe membrane damage figs 1b 2d and s6 8 such phenomenon was consistent with previous reports that mps induced cytotoxicity was attributed to membrane injury membrane potential collapse and lipid peroxidation chen et al 2022a salimi et al 2022 moreover our teli based toxicity assessment further revealed that the specific gene expressions e g sdhc cyoa marr emre cls and flgm associated with synthesis and metabolism of lipid main component of cell membrane were significantly altered by face mask derived micro nano plastics figs s13a and s15a which might alter the cell membrane permeability the increased cell membrane permeability could facilitate the uptake of exogenous dna by bacteria and then enhance the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes wang et al 2022 compared with micro nano plastics leachable chemicals with much smaller molecules might adhere to bacterial surface e g surfactants or get inside cell e g plasticizer and synthetic materials or intermediates etc and consequently result in oxidative membrane and dna stresses fig s14 many genes connected with ros sensor e g soxs superoxide dismutase e g soda and catalase e g kate and katg were significantly upregulated under leachate exposure indicating that leachable chemicals e g plasticizers and surfactants from most of daily used masks are toxic to microorganisms and could trigger the oxidative stress defending mechanisms figs s14 and s15 the overproduction of ros further induced more serious dna damage which involve almost all of the dna repair pathways e g base excision repair ber excision repair ner mismatch repair mmr double strand break repair dbr figs 4g and s14 gou et al 2014 on the one hand the unexpected oxidation of double strand dna e g guanine might lead to cytotoxicity and even bacteria death foti et al 2012 imposing an adverse impact to microbial diversity and functions in aquatic systems on the other hand the presence of multi repair mechanisms might increase the possibility of base mismatch and further result in gene mutation and the appearance of resistant bacteria garcia et al 2020 maiques et al 2006 which might pose more serious threat to aquatic ecosystem safety and even human health 5 conclusions plastic waste and their derived pollutants e g micro nano plastics and additives severely threatens water quality safety results from this study clearly demonstrated that the massive usage and improper management of face masks during the covid 19 global pandemic aggravated the issues of plastic waste via releasing micro nano plastics as well as organic chemicals in aquatic environments the discarded face masks worldwide are estimated to release about 4 41 1011 2 92 1012 plastic particles and 10 45 to 92 64 kg c organic chemicals to water body per month which were remarkably higher than those for other plastic products including plastic water bottles and take out food containers furthermore genotoxicity assessments revealed that membrane stress e g genes sdhc marr emre and flgm and dna damage e g genes reca polb ssb and recn were main primary responses when exposed to micro nano plastics and leachable chemicals respectively such abundant micro nano plastics and organic compounds released from the discarded face masks might induce serious threat to water quality security and aquatic biota by increasing pollutant content and damaging microbial functions noticeably discarded face mask may undergo various aging processes and thereby potentially aggravate the release and toxicity of pollutants from face masks in the aquatic environment which need further systematic experiments in future studies data availability data will be made available on request declaration of competing

14671,the impact of nitrogen n on water eutrophication is well known but the specific influence of hydrodynamic factors on n occurrence in aquatic systems has remained unclear this lack of understanding has hindered our ability to assess the self purification function of aquatic ecosystems and address water pollution problem here we collected overlying water and sediment samples from different aquatic ecosystems ditch pond river and reservoir in the danjiangkou reservoir area and compared the variation characteristics of various n components and further conducted an incubation experiment to investigate the rate of n removal we found that the concentration of total n and its n components decreased from ditches and ponds to rivers and reservoirs indicating that n removal occurred during water flow with up to 43 of total n concentration reduction rate additionally we observed higher heterogeneity in eco stoichiometric characteristics of n components in ditches and ponds compared to rivers and reservoirs interestingly the ditches and ponds exhibited stronger interactions between overlying water and sediment with higher rates of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox our findings highlight the need to focus on the upper reaches of agricultural catchments such as ditches and ponds for n removal and emphasize the importance of developing region specific conservation strategies to mitigate n pollution and protect water resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen nitrogen removal denitrification anammox danjiangkou reservoir 1 introduction nitrogen n is an indispensable element for sustaining life however its excessive presence poses a significant threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems schulte uebbing et al 2022 the accumulation of nitrogenous pollutants in watersheds is a major cause of eutrophication in aquatic systems qin et al 2017 human activities such as agriculture urbanization and industrial processes generate significant amounts of nitrogenous pollutants that can be transported to rivers and lakes via various processes lin et al 2020 including surface runoff wastewater discharge atmospheric deposition and biological propagation howarth et al 1996 jiang et al 2020 excessive n in water can yield devastating consequences for aquatic ecosystems it can trigger the proliferation of harmful algal blooms which in turn diminish light penetration and deplete dissolved oxygen ultimately resulting in habitat degradation and the demise of aquatic flora and fauna herbert et al 2015 additionally the excessive presence of n in water can lead to deteriorating water quality such as acidification and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions further endangering human health and well being thus it is of paramount importance to implement rigorous measures to control and mitigate n pollution in water systems schulte uebbing et al 2022 the biogeochemical cycle of n in water is a multidimensional and intricate process characterized by dynamic transformations of various n forms and valences mgelwa et al 2020 wang et al 2022 this cycle operates at both macro and micro levels at the macro level n enters aquatic systems through diverse sources such as agricultural and urban runoff atmospheric deposition and sewage discharge xia et al 2016 biological uptake and sediment deposition can temporarily fix n in aquatic ecosystems but the release of nutrients from dead organisms and sediment can contribute to n pollution in water at the micro level several key processes including nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium play a vital role in the n cycle of aquatic ecosystems stoliker et al 2016 denitrification and anammox serve as important pathways for n removal in aquatic environments wang et al 2019 the biogeochemical cycle of n in water involves the migration and transformation processes between sediment water suspended particles and aquatic organisms understanding the fate of n in water and the factors that influence its removal from aquatic environments is of utmost importance cheng et al 2018 the temporal and spatial distribution of n in aquatic ecosystems is influenced by a multitude of biological and abiotic factors jiang et al 2020 lin et al 2020 aquatic animals and plants including fish algae and macrophytes play a crucial role in n cycling by serving as both sources and sinks of n taylor et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi are responsible for the conversion of n between different forms including ammonium n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n and organic n on and can thus impact the availability and distribution of n in water stoliker et al 2016 in addition to the biological factors abiotic factors such as hydrology climate and landscape pattern also have significant impacts on n distribution in aquatic ecosystems nilsson and jansson 2002 zhang et al 2020 hydrological variability including events like floods and droughts can influence the transport of n from land to water bodies stoliker et al 2016 furthermore aquatic environmental factors such as water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand transparency and conductivity can regulate the temporal and spatial distribution of n li et al 2021 understanding the temporal and spatial distribution of n concentrations in aquatic ecosystems is crucial for accurately assessing the current status of n pollution and ecological risks in water aquatic ecosystems including ditches ponds rivers lakes and reservoirs are interconnected through hydrological processes forming a continuum of material and energy flows that are crucial for maintaining nutrient balance including n cai et al 2022 tatariw et al 2021 however the occurrence and removal efficiency of n can vary significantly among different types of aquatic ecosystems due to their distinct hydrodynamic characteristics shen et al 2023 shen et al 2021 in free flowing water bodies such as rivers and ditches the enhanced diffusion of oxygen and extracellular enzymes facilitates the nitrification process wherein ammonium is converted into nitrate powers et al 2017 in contrast static hydrological conditions observed in ponds and reservoirs offer greater potential for n removal thanks to longer water retention times cai et al 2022 shen et al 2023 in these systems the extended retention time allows for more extensive contact between water and sediment promoting denitrification and other n removal processes shen et al 2021 while some factors influencing n occurrence and removal in aquatic ecosystems are well understood a quantitative assessment of these factors is still lacking further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of the complex relationships among hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes in different types of aquatic ecosystems the danjiangkou djk reservoir along with the upper reaches of the hanjiang river serves as a crucial freshwater source for the middle route project of the south to north water transfer in china catering to the water needs of millions of people in the northern region of china however the escalating levels of n in the djk reservoir pose a significant challenge to the water source area and the reservoir itself since the 1990s the total n concentration in the djk reservoir has consistently exceeded the permissible limit of 1 0 mg l 1 tan et al 2015 in certain months the total n concentration has even reached as high as 1 9 mg l 1 despite extensive efforts to control point source pollution non point source pollution has emerged as the primary contributor of pollutants in the djk reservoir zhuang et al 2016 this is largely attributed to the underdeveloped and extensive nature of agriculture in the water source area where agricultural practices involving pesticides fertilizers and other inputs have contributed to significant n runoff into the reservoir liu et al 2012 additionally water and soil loss due to deforestation land use change and other factors have also contributed to the inflow of n from the land to the reservoir jiang et al 2020 failure to address these issues could have severe consequences not only for the water source area and the djk reservoir but also for the millions of people who depend on the water from the south to north water transfer project to investigate the spatial distribution of n occurrence and removal and identify the factors influencing the n cycle in different aquatic ecosystems around the djk reservoir overlying water and sediment samples were collected from four different types of aquatic ecosystems including ditches ponds rivers and reservoirs the study analyzed the concentrations of various n components in the water samples including nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n dissolved organic nitrogen don total dissolved nitrogen tdn particulate nitrogen pn and total nitrogen tn additionally the study also evaluated the n removal efficiency of these ecosystems by measuring the denitrification and anammox rates to understand the key factors influencing the n cycle the study also analyzed other parameters e g nutrient oxygen chlorophyll chla ph in both water and sediment samples this study is significant because it is the first large scale investigation of n occurrence and removal in aquatic ecosystems around the djk reservoir 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area the djk reservoir and its surrounding area present a complex and diverse landscape with a rich hydrological net and a variety of aquatic ecosystems such as ditches ponds rivers and reservoirs the catchment area encompasses a wide range of elevations from 150 m to 500 m and includes different geomorphic types such as middle mountainous low mountainous hilly and valley basins mountains are the predominant landform comprising 92 4 of the area while hills and plains represent 5 5 and 2 1 respectively the djk reservoir lies in the northern subtropical monsoon region and serves as a transitional zone between the northern and southern climatic boundaries of china as such the area experiences a moderate climate with an average annual temperature of 15 8 c and an average annual rainfall of 805 mm the majority of the rainfall occurs between july and september which accounts for about half of the total annual rainfall the region is a crucial intersection of various climate zones and thus represents an important area for scientific research and ecological conservation efforts with outstanding water conservation capabilities and a wide variety of rare animals and plants it is an important ecological treasure trove in china overall the djk reservoir and its surrounding area are not only an important source of water for the south to north water transfer project but also a critical component of china s ecological and environmental systems 2 2 field sampling in this study we conducted extensive sampling of surface water and sediment around the djk reservoir as depicted in fig 1 s a total of 228 sampling points were selected and categorized into four distinct types based on their hydrological characteristics as illustrated in fig 2 s the sample types included ditches n 67 ponds n 36 rivers n 68 and reservoirs n 57 ponds in the area predominantly exist within small watersheds and serve as collection points for rainfall and water retention ditches on the other hand refer to small agricultural drainage and irrigation channels that directly receive agricultural runoff rivers in comparison are larger watercourses formed through the confluence of multiple ditches it is important to note that the direction of water flow within the system follows a path from ditches or ponds to rivers and eventually to the reservoir in terms of the overall watershed dynamics the ditches and ponds represent the upper reaches of hydrographic net in contrast the reservoir serves as the central catchment area for the entire watershed s drainage as such the rivers play a crucial role as conduits facilitating the transfer of water and nutrients from the upper reaches to the reservoir lower reaches the sampling for this study was conducted in january 2021 which corresponds to the dry season in the study area during this period there is typically minimal rainfall reducing the influence of exogenous n inputs from rainfall runoff the n migration process encompasses the entire journey from the source ditches ponds to the river and ultimately to the reservoir the focus on the dry season allows for a more accurate assessment of the n removal and self purification effects of the watershed aquatic ecosystems since the primary n sources originate from soil and human wastewater the sampling points were selected using a combination of randomization and accessibility principles to ensure representative coverage of the study area at each sampling site approximately 500 ml of overlying water and 500 g of sediment were collected using plastic bottles standardized collection protocols were followed to maintain consistency and ensure the reliability of the results during the sampling process important information such as the longitude and latitude water depth flow rate fig 2s chla and do fig 3 s were recorded at each site to maintain the integrity of the samples they were transported back to the laboratory on the same day of collection and stored in a refrigerator at 18 c the samples were also frozen away from light to minimize any potential degradation of the samples all samples were tested within one month of collection to avoid deterioration of the water samples to assess the rate of denitrification and anammox in different aquatic ecosystems this study collected undisturbed sediment column samples from 10 representative river basins encompassing a total of 40 sites across a range of aquatic environments including ditches ponds rivers and reservoirs as illustrated in fig 1s to collect the sediment samples a cylindrical sludge collector made of pvc with an internal diameter of 80 mm was utilized the sediment column was collected to a height of approximately 10 cm and three duplicates were collected at each site to ensure the accuracy of the results in addition to the sediment samples 50 l of surface water was also collected from the same sites for indoor cultivation experiments 2 3 water and sediment samples chemical analysis to determine the concentrations of total and dissolved constituents in the collected water samples a two part division approach was employed the first part of each sample was used to analyze the levels of total nitrogen tn total carbon tc and total phosphorus tp the second part underwent treatment with a needle filter equipped with a 0 45 μm acetate fiber membrane to isolate and analyze the dissolved constituents standard analytical methods were employed to measure the concentrations of these constituents the specific water sample analysis method can be found in table 1s which provides detailed information on the methods used for each constituent analysis the variations in tc tp chla and do in the overlying water of different aquatic ecosystems are visually presented in fig 3s after air drying the sediment samples collected in this study were analyzed to determine the contents of tc tn available n an available phosphorus ap and ph standard protocols were followed for the measurement of sediment properties and detailed descriptions of the methods can be found in table 2s the results obtained from these analyses were plotted in fig 4 s to visually represent the variations in the contents of tc an ap and ph across the different aquatic ecosystems studied this figure provides a graphical depiction of the distribution and differences in these sediment properties among the various sampling sites 2 4 denitrification and anammox rate determination to determine the rate of n denitrification and anammox membrane injection mass spectrometry mims was used in this study as described by she et al 2019 this method allowed for the direct determination of the ratio of n2 ar dissolved in water with high accuracy 0 03 by combining this technique with an isotope matching method denitrification and anammox rates could be distinguished specifically the isotope matching incubation experiment was performed on the four parallel samples collected after 48 h of simulated in situ pre incubation in the laboratory which consumed oxygen and nox in the sediment in the incubation experiment three groups of parallel samples were injected with 100 μmol l 1 n isotopes 15no3 99 29 abundance 15nh4 98 2 abundance proving that the nitrate consumption of the sample was complete and 15nh4 14no3 proving the existence of anammox reaction the other group was set as a control without isotope addition after treatment the samples were incubated in a closed flow incubation system until the sample was stable as measured by membrane injection mass spectrometry water samples were then taken at specific time intervals and the changes in the concentrations of dissolved n2 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 were measured using this data the rate of change of n2 concentration in the overlying water sediment systems μmol l 1 h 1 was calculated based on the n2 concentration and time of different incubation times the n removal rate in the system μmol m 2 h 1 was then obtained by combining the cross sectional area of the sediment column m2 and the volume of the overlying water l finally the denitrification and anammox rates were calculated and distinguished using the following formula 1 d t o t a l p 30 f n 2 2 a t o t a l f n 1 p 29 2 1 f n 1 p 30 where dtotal and atotal are the n2 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 produced by denitrification and anammox respectively p 29 and p 30 are the production rates of 29n2 and 30n2 respectively fn is the abundance of 15n in the added nitrate 99 29 2 5 statistical analyses in this study we compared and analyzed the water quality indicators of different types of water samples using software tools and statistical methods the spatial distribution map of n concentrations and removal rate were created using arcgis 10 2 software which is a widely used tool for mapping and spatial analysis for statistical analysis the water samples in the study were divided into four different types of water bodies including ditches ponds rivers and reservoirs the results were then characterized using box plots scatter plots and lorentz fitted distribution curves to analyze the size concentration trend and distribution of sample n components and removal rates one way analysis of variance anova was used to assess the effect of water body type on n constituents and removal rate the least significant difference lsd statistic with a p value threshold of 0 05 was employed to identify significant differences between the various aquatic ecosystem types additionally spearman correlation analysis ca was used to determine the correlation between different parameters the origin 2021 software was used to conduct some of the mapping and analyses 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of tn of water and sediment in various aquatic ecosystems fig 1 visually represents the spatial distribution of tn in both the overlying water and sediment of various aquatic ecosystems surrounding the djk reservoir the maps reveal striking variations in tn concentrations in the overlying water ranging from 1 03 to 12 99 mg l 1 fig 1a these findings underscore the significance of n as a key risk factor for water eutrophication in the region alarmingly none of the water samples met the chinese national water quality standard for class iii which specifies a tn concentration of less than 1 0 mg l 1 notably the tn concentrations exhibited distinct levels across different aquatic ecosystem types ditches displayed the highest tn concentration 3 71 mg l 1 while reservoirs exhibited the lowest 2 12 mg l 1 fig 1c furthermore statistical analysis revealed a significant p 0 05 difference in tn concentrations between ditches and rivers or reservoirs these results provide evidence of natural n removal and self purification processes within the hydrographic network as water flows from the upper reaches ditches and ponds to the lower reaches rivers and reservoirs tn concentrations experience a substantial reduction rate reaching up to 43 this reduction highlights the critical role played by natural purification processes in mitigating the detrimental impacts of n pollution in aquatic ecosystems in the sediment tn contents were found to be in the range of 0 21 to 3 75 g kg 1 fig 1b with the highest content recorded in the ponds and ditches fig 1d the tn content of the sediment was significantly p 0 05 higher in these ecosystems than in the rivers or reservoirs and the lowest value was observed in the rivers 3 2 variation of n components of overlying water in various aquatic ecosystems the results of the study revealed significant variations in the concentrations of different n components in the overlying water of various aquatic ecosystems no3 n nh4 n don tdn and pn exhibited a similar trend as tn fig 2 notably the concentrations of all measured n components were significantly higher in the ditches compared to other water body types particularly the reservoirs the rates of n reduction for each n component were also calculated with don showing the highest reduction rate of 63 and nh4 n showing the lowest of 34 moreover the contribution of each n component to different water types was significantly different with no3 n accounting for the highest proportion in reservoir water while nh4 n and pn were enriched in ponds fig 2f and the proportion of don in the reservoir was significantly lower than that in the other water types the study aimed to explore the intricate relationship between tn concentration in water and the eco stoichiometric ratio of the three n components namely no3 n nh4 n and don using a state of the art ternary diagram as illustrated in fig 3 each vertex of the triangle represents one n component with nh4 n dominating the top corner no3 n the bottom right and don the bottom left the varying shades of color indicate the tn concentration the results indicated that high tn concentration was linked to a relatively high proportion of nh4 n and don while a relatively high proportion of no3 n was linked to low tn concentration fig 3b this trend was particularly apparent in ditches and ponds as depicted in fig 3c and d further the study revealed that the heterogeneity of the no3 n nh4 n don ratio was relatively high in ditch water reflecting the instability of the aquatic ecosystem the sample point distribution in the reservoir sample points was relatively concentrated indicating that the eco stoichiometric ratio of the three components of n was more homogeneous in the reservoirs as shown in fig 3f 3 3 interaction between overlying water and sediment in various aquatic ecosystems a spearman correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between overlying water and sediment characteristics in four distinct aquatic ecosystem types ponds ditches rivers and reservoirs fig 4 the results indicated that significant correlations existed between water and sediment variables in ditches and ponds suggesting a higher level of interaction between the overlying water and sediment in these ecosystem types in contrast the correlations in rivers and reservoirs were not as pronounced specifically in river ecosystems positive correlations were observed between nh4 n don tdn pn and tn concentrations in water and sediment an and tc however the relationships between other indicators were not found to be statistically significant fig 4c on the other hand no significant correlations were observed between the indicators of overlying water and sediment in the reservoir fig 4d this lack of correlation could be attributed to the fact that reservoir water was collected from different sources including ditches ponds and rivers the mixing of water from multiple sources may have diminished the influence of sediment on the overlying water in the reservoir 3 4 variation of denitrification and anammox in various aquatic ecosystems efficiency in the removal of n from aquatic ecosystems is crucial for effective water quality management in this study we investigated n removal efficiency by measuring denitrification and anammox rates at 40 sample points across 10 representative river basins the findings revealed a wide range of denitrification rates ranging from 11 1 to 161 1 μmol m 2 h 1 with an average rate of 59 7 μmol m 2 h 1 fig 5 a similarly the anammox rates varied from 4 8 to 62 0 μmol m 2 h 1 with an average of 20 2 μmol m 2 h 1 fig 5b the results indicated that denitrification was the primary contributor to n removal accounting for 78 in ditches 69 in ponds and 75 in rivers and reservoirs respectively fig 5e this highlights the significant role of denitrification in removing n from these aquatic ecosystems furthermore the denitrification rates were higher in ponds and ditches compared to reservoirs and rivers fig 5c suggesting that n removal predominantly occurs in the upper reaches of the aquatic ecosystems in contrast the anammox rates exhibited considerable spatial variability and did not show significant differences among the four aquatic ecosystem types fig 5d the intricate processes of denitrification and anammox in aquatic ecosystems are influenced by various environmental factors as depicted in fig 6 the results demonstrate significant and positive correlations between denitrification and anammox rates and all n components in both water and sediment including no3 n nh4 n don tdn pn and tn these components serve as important substrates that fuel denitrification and anammox processes in aquatic ecosystems furthermore the presence of c in both water and sediment was found to have a substantial contribution p 0 05 to the occurrence of denitrification and anammox c acts as an important energy source for these processes supporting the microbial activity involved interestingly sediment ph and do levels in the overlying water exhibited negative correlations with denitrification and anammox specifically water do had the most significant effect on denitrification while sediment ph had the most significant effect on anammox p 0 05 these findings suggest that optimal ph conditions and adequate do levels are crucial for supporting efficient denitrification and anammox processes in aquatic ecosystems however the study observed that tp chla in water and ap in sediment had little to no effect on denitrification and anammox 4 discussion 4 1 n levels and sources in water bodies of djk reservoir area the djk reservoir area is known to have high n concentrations in its water as supported by previous studies guo et al 2022 tan et al 2015 our current study further reinforces these findings as the tn concentration in the aquatic ecosystems ranged from 1 03 to 12 99 mg l 1 these concentrations align with the results of other research conducted in the same region jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 li et al 2022 for instance li et al 2022 investigated the n pollution characteristics of the jinshui river which is a tributary of the hanjiang river and discovered that the concentrations of no3 n nh4 n don and tdn all exceeded 1 0 mg l 1 notably the concentration of n was highest during the summer season with no3 n and don being the dominant components in both high and low flow seasons further analysis using a multiple isotope approach estimated that the contribution of soil organic n and fertilizer loss to tn pollution load exceeded 50 in the jinqian river basin which is the largest sub basin of the hanjiang river basin jiang et al 2021 these findings clearly suggest that agricultural nonpoint source pollution is one of the primary causes of water n eutrophication in the djk reservoir area zhuang et al 2016 therefore there is an urgent need to implement effective measures to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution and mitigate the harmful effects of n eutrophication on the aquatic ecosystems in the region 4 2 hydrodynamic controls on n distribution in aquatic ecosystems in this study the concentration of n in water was found to vary depending on the type of water bodies including ditches or ponds rivers and reservoirs these variations were attributed to the hydrodynamic conditions and the sources of n input in aquatic ecosystems song et al 2022 specifically ditches were identified as major recipients of agricultural drainage and rural domestic sewage leading to high n concentrations in the water moreover the increased concentration of no3 n in the water of rivers and reservoirs could be associated with higher levels of do as aerobic conditions favor organic n mineralization and nitrification liu et al 2023 the swift flow of water in rivers enhances the transfer of oxygen facilitating the breakdown and mineralization of don and resulting in the accumulation of no3 n song et al 2022 xia et al 2016 in contrast ponds which are partially independent of the ditch river reservoir continuum exhibited high levels of n concentration primarily in the form of nh4 n this can be attributed to their proximity to rural residential areas where they experience constant pressure from domestic sewage leading to a significant increase in n pollution the static and closed hydrological conditions of ponds are not conducive to n discharge into open water resulting in n accumulation the study concluded that the hydrodynamic conditions of different aquatic systems played a crucial role in determining the composition and concentration of n stoliker et al 2016 n exists in various forms in water including don nh4 no3 and no2 and the concentration of n in water is not entirely independent of its eco stoichiometry taylor and townsend 2010 our study found that higher tn concentration in water was typically associated with a higher proportion of nh4 n and don whereas lower tn concentration was often linked to a higher proportion of no3 n hydrodynamic conditions determine the stoichiometric relationships of n forms nilsson and jansson 2002 interestingly our research also showed that different aquatic ecosystems exhibit varying degrees of heterogeneity in terms of n composition ditches and ponds exhibited higher levels of heterogeneity whereas the n composition in reservoir water showed a clear trend towards homogenization these differences can be attributed to two factors firstly the different components of n sources lead to variations in n stoichiometric ratios cui et al 2023 and secondly hydrodynamic conditions regulate n biogeochemical cycles resulting in the accumulation of n cycle intermediates dominated by specific n cycling processes mgelwa et al 2020 the former factor is primarily related to n sources while the latter is associated with the n biogeochemical cycle in aquatic ecosystems nilsson and jansson 2002 the results of this study demonstrate that the input of different types of n pollutants and the heterogeneity of hydrodynamic conditions contribute to the spatial differentiation of n occurrence forms and concentrations in ditches and ponds however in reservoir waters the influence of hydrodynamic conditions and biogeochemical processes outweigh the impact of exogenous n inputs indicating the dominance of the latter mechanism in aquatic ecosystems our research emphasizes the importance of different n pollutant inputs and the heterogeneity of hydrodynamic conditions in determining the spatial differentiation of n occurrence forms and concentrations in aquatic ecosystems 4 3 hydrodynamic controls on interactions between overlying water and sediment in aquatic ecosystems the findings of this study reveal a clear pattern of stronger interactions between overlying water and sediment in ditches and ponds compared to rivers and reservoirs as evidenced by more frequent and stronger correlations several factors can explain this observation firstly the larger contact area between water and sediment in ditches and the longer retention time of water in ponds facilitate increased material exchange and energy flow leading to a higher degree of interaction between water and sediment in these water bodies wang et al 2022 secondly ditches and ponds being smaller water bodies are more susceptible to environmental influences which further enhances their interactions shen et al 2021 in contrast reservoirs exhibit a stronger environmental buffering capacity due to their extensive water storage capacity thirdly the dilution effect of upstream water weakens to some extent the interaction between overlying water and sediment in rivers and reservoirs mgelwa et al 2020 therefore the observed differentiation in correlations among different aquatic ecosystems highlights the significant influence of biogeochemical and hydrological factors such as reaction area retention time buffer capacity and dilution effect in shaping n occurrence processes in water shen et al 2021 wang et al 2022 4 4 hydrodynamic controls on n removal in aquatic ecosystems aquatic ecosystems play a crucial role in various processes including the migration transformation and degradation of organic and inorganic n compounds as well as other pollutants qin et al 2017 additionally these ecosystems are essential for n removal a critical process for maintaining the health of aquatic environments schmadel et al 2018 the data in this study reveal a decreasing trend in n concentration along the water flow direction from ditches and ponds to rivers and reservoirs suggesting that n removal processes occur during water flow recent research has also demonstrated that freshwater river system possess an impressive average n removal capacity of 26 3 71 3 μmol m 2 h 1 zhao et al 2017 furthermore it is worth noting that the runoff from terrestrial water networks exhibits a remarkable removal rate of over 75 with the remaining 10 25 of artificially introduced n entering the marine system howarth et al 1996 the n present in water can undergo denitrification and anammox processes leading to the release of n2 or n2o into the atmosphere wang et al 2019 the study employed simulation experiments to investigate n removal rates in various aquatic systems revealing a wide ranging variability of n removal rates across various aquatic systems as seen in fig 5 the variability spans over two orders of magnitude indicating the presence of considerable spatial variability in n removal from aquatic ecosystems lin et al 2016 zhou et al 2021 notably ditches exhibited higher rates of n removal compared to rivers and reservoirs this can be attributed to the availability of substrates for microbial mineralization and abiotic reactions nikolenko et al 2018 which may be more abundant in the water and sediments of ditches and ponds due to higher nutrient concentrations additionally the presence of a large water sediment contact area in shallow water environments such as ditches and ponds provides a favorable habitat for microbial activity shen et al 2021 so the water and sediments of ditches and ponds often harbor diverse microorganisms that contribute to the efficient cycling of n in the ecosystem martinez espinosa et al 2021 these findings have significant implications for understanding the role of ditches in the n cycle of watershed systems herbert et al 2015 by extending the contact area and time between water and sediment the conditions for n transformation and removal can be optimized slowing down the flow rate of ditch water and increasing the retention time of polluted water within the ditch system can potentially serve as an effective approach to mitigate n pollution in watershed systems shen et al 2023 the denitrification and anammox processes are not only influenced by the substrate n and c content but also by other factors such as do and ph in the overlying water and sediment zhao et al 2017 our correlation analysis as shown in fig 6 revealed that the substrate content has the greatest influence on the n removal efficiency of aquatic ecosystems it is noteworthy that the denitrification rate with nh4 n concentration and the anammox rate with no3 n concentration showed a significant positive correlation p 0 05 although this correlation might seem unreasonable at first glance it is in fact reasonable as in natural water environments the mineralization of organic n nitrification and denitrification reactions often occur simultaneously martinez espinosa et al 2021 furthermore different forms or components of n in the water can be transformed into each other which are in a dynamic equilibrium within a certain range song et al 2022 another important factor affecting the rate of n removal in water is do yang et al 2012 most denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria are anaerobic bacteria which are very sensitive to oxygen zhang et al 2022 low do levels can therefore promote the growth and activity of these anaerobic bacteria and increase the rate of n removal in water feng et al 2012 the interplay between these factors along with other environmental variables underscores the complexity of the n removal processes in aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusion the findings of our study provide valuable insights into the hydrodynamic conditions that control the distribution and removal of n in aquatic ecosystems these processes have important implications for the conservation of water resources and the reduction of n pollution we found that the agricultural catchment of the basin played a crucial role in removing n from water as evidenced by the decreasing trend in tn and its components along the water flow direction especially the ditches and ponds exhibited stronger interactions between overlying water and sediment with higher rates of denitrification and anammox our findings highlight the need to focus on the upper reaches of agricultural catchments such as ditches and ponds for n removal and emphasize the importance of developing region specific conservation strategies to mitigate n pollution and protect water resources however we also acknowledge that predicting n occurrence in different seasons and scales is challenging and requires careful consideration of various hydrological and biological factors as well as agricultural non point source pollution loads nevertheless we believe that the potential removal of activated n from aquatic systems is a significant part of the self purification process and cannot be ignored when designing conservation strategies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14671,the impact of nitrogen n on water eutrophication is well known but the specific influence of hydrodynamic factors on n occurrence in aquatic systems has remained unclear this lack of understanding has hindered our ability to assess the self purification function of aquatic ecosystems and address water pollution problem here we collected overlying water and sediment samples from different aquatic ecosystems ditch pond river and reservoir in the danjiangkou reservoir area and compared the variation characteristics of various n components and further conducted an incubation experiment to investigate the rate of n removal we found that the concentration of total n and its n components decreased from ditches and ponds to rivers and reservoirs indicating that n removal occurred during water flow with up to 43 of total n concentration reduction rate additionally we observed higher heterogeneity in eco stoichiometric characteristics of n components in ditches and ponds compared to rivers and reservoirs interestingly the ditches and ponds exhibited stronger interactions between overlying water and sediment with higher rates of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox our findings highlight the need to focus on the upper reaches of agricultural catchments such as ditches and ponds for n removal and emphasize the importance of developing region specific conservation strategies to mitigate n pollution and protect water resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen nitrogen removal denitrification anammox danjiangkou reservoir 1 introduction nitrogen n is an indispensable element for sustaining life however its excessive presence poses a significant threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems schulte uebbing et al 2022 the accumulation of nitrogenous pollutants in watersheds is a major cause of eutrophication in aquatic systems qin et al 2017 human activities such as agriculture urbanization and industrial processes generate significant amounts of nitrogenous pollutants that can be transported to rivers and lakes via various processes lin et al 2020 including surface runoff wastewater discharge atmospheric deposition and biological propagation howarth et al 1996 jiang et al 2020 excessive n in water can yield devastating consequences for aquatic ecosystems it can trigger the proliferation of harmful algal blooms which in turn diminish light penetration and deplete dissolved oxygen ultimately resulting in habitat degradation and the demise of aquatic flora and fauna herbert et al 2015 additionally the excessive presence of n in water can lead to deteriorating water quality such as acidification and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions further endangering human health and well being thus it is of paramount importance to implement rigorous measures to control and mitigate n pollution in water systems schulte uebbing et al 2022 the biogeochemical cycle of n in water is a multidimensional and intricate process characterized by dynamic transformations of various n forms and valences mgelwa et al 2020 wang et al 2022 this cycle operates at both macro and micro levels at the macro level n enters aquatic systems through diverse sources such as agricultural and urban runoff atmospheric deposition and sewage discharge xia et al 2016 biological uptake and sediment deposition can temporarily fix n in aquatic ecosystems but the release of nutrients from dead organisms and sediment can contribute to n pollution in water at the micro level several key processes including nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium play a vital role in the n cycle of aquatic ecosystems stoliker et al 2016 denitrification and anammox serve as important pathways for n removal in aquatic environments wang et al 2019 the biogeochemical cycle of n in water involves the migration and transformation processes between sediment water suspended particles and aquatic organisms understanding the fate of n in water and the factors that influence its removal from aquatic environments is of utmost importance cheng et al 2018 the temporal and spatial distribution of n in aquatic ecosystems is influenced by a multitude of biological and abiotic factors jiang et al 2020 lin et al 2020 aquatic animals and plants including fish algae and macrophytes play a crucial role in n cycling by serving as both sources and sinks of n taylor et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi are responsible for the conversion of n between different forms including ammonium n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n and organic n on and can thus impact the availability and distribution of n in water stoliker et al 2016 in addition to the biological factors abiotic factors such as hydrology climate and landscape pattern also have significant impacts on n distribution in aquatic ecosystems nilsson and jansson 2002 zhang et al 2020 hydrological variability including events like floods and droughts can influence the transport of n from land to water bodies stoliker et al 2016 furthermore aquatic environmental factors such as water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand transparency and conductivity can regulate the temporal and spatial distribution of n li et al 2021 understanding the temporal and spatial distribution of n concentrations in aquatic ecosystems is crucial for accurately assessing the current status of n pollution and ecological risks in water aquatic ecosystems including ditches ponds rivers lakes and reservoirs are interconnected through hydrological processes forming a continuum of material and energy flows that are crucial for maintaining nutrient balance including n cai et al 2022 tatariw et al 2021 however the occurrence and removal efficiency of n can vary significantly among different types of aquatic ecosystems due to their distinct hydrodynamic characteristics shen et al 2023 shen et al 2021 in free flowing water bodies such as rivers and ditches the enhanced diffusion of oxygen and extracellular enzymes facilitates the nitrification process wherein ammonium is converted into nitrate powers et al 2017 in contrast static hydrological conditions observed in ponds and reservoirs offer greater potential for n removal thanks to longer water retention times cai et al 2022 shen et al 2023 in these systems the extended retention time allows for more extensive contact between water and sediment promoting denitrification and other n removal processes shen et al 2021 while some factors influencing n occurrence and removal in aquatic ecosystems are well understood a quantitative assessment of these factors is still lacking further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of the complex relationships among hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes in different types of aquatic ecosystems the danjiangkou djk reservoir along with the upper reaches of the hanjiang river serves as a crucial freshwater source for the middle route project of the south to north water transfer in china catering to the water needs of millions of people in the northern region of china however the escalating levels of n in the djk reservoir pose a significant challenge to the water source area and the reservoir itself since the 1990s the total n concentration in the djk reservoir has consistently exceeded the permissible limit of 1 0 mg l 1 tan et al 2015 in certain months the total n concentration has even reached as high as 1 9 mg l 1 despite extensive efforts to control point source pollution non point source pollution has emerged as the primary contributor of pollutants in the djk reservoir zhuang et al 2016 this is largely attributed to the underdeveloped and extensive nature of agriculture in the water source area where agricultural practices involving pesticides fertilizers and other inputs have contributed to significant n runoff into the reservoir liu et al 2012 additionally water and soil loss due to deforestation land use change and other factors have also contributed to the inflow of n from the land to the reservoir jiang et al 2020 failure to address these issues could have severe consequences not only for the water source area and the djk reservoir but also for the millions of people who depend on the water from the south to north water transfer project to investigate the spatial distribution of n occurrence and removal and identify the factors influencing the n cycle in different aquatic ecosystems around the djk reservoir overlying water and sediment samples were collected from four different types of aquatic ecosystems including ditches ponds rivers and reservoirs the study analyzed the concentrations of various n components in the water samples including nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n dissolved organic nitrogen don total dissolved nitrogen tdn particulate nitrogen pn and total nitrogen tn additionally the study also evaluated the n removal efficiency of these ecosystems by measuring the denitrification and anammox rates to understand the key factors influencing the n cycle the study also analyzed other parameters e g nutrient oxygen chlorophyll chla ph in both water and sediment samples this study is significant because it is the first large scale investigation of n occurrence and removal in aquatic ecosystems around the djk reservoir 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area the djk reservoir and its surrounding area present a complex and diverse landscape with a rich hydrological net and a variety of aquatic ecosystems such as ditches ponds rivers and reservoirs the catchment area encompasses a wide range of elevations from 150 m to 500 m and includes different geomorphic types such as middle mountainous low mountainous hilly and valley basins mountains are the predominant landform comprising 92 4 of the area while hills and plains represent 5 5 and 2 1 respectively the djk reservoir lies in the northern subtropical monsoon region and serves as a transitional zone between the northern and southern climatic boundaries of china as such the area experiences a moderate climate with an average annual temperature of 15 8 c and an average annual rainfall of 805 mm the majority of the rainfall occurs between july and september which accounts for about half of the total annual rainfall the region is a crucial intersection of various climate zones and thus represents an important area for scientific research and ecological conservation efforts with outstanding water conservation capabilities and a wide variety of rare animals and plants it is an important ecological treasure trove in china overall the djk reservoir and its surrounding area are not only an important source of water for the south to north water transfer project but also a critical component of china s ecological and environmental systems 2 2 field sampling in this study we conducted extensive sampling of surface water and sediment around the djk reservoir as depicted in fig 1 s a total of 228 sampling points were selected and categorized into four distinct types based on their hydrological characteristics as illustrated in fig 2 s the sample types included ditches n 67 ponds n 36 rivers n 68 and reservoirs n 57 ponds in the area predominantly exist within small watersheds and serve as collection points for rainfall and water retention ditches on the other hand refer to small agricultural drainage and irrigation channels that directly receive agricultural runoff rivers in comparison are larger watercourses formed through the confluence of multiple ditches it is important to note that the direction of water flow within the system follows a path from ditches or ponds to rivers and eventually to the reservoir in terms of the overall watershed dynamics the ditches and ponds represent the upper reaches of hydrographic net in contrast the reservoir serves as the central catchment area for the entire watershed s drainage as such the rivers play a crucial role as conduits facilitating the transfer of water and nutrients from the upper reaches to the reservoir lower reaches the sampling for this study was conducted in january 2021 which corresponds to the dry season in the study area during this period there is typically minimal rainfall reducing the influence of exogenous n inputs from rainfall runoff the n migration process encompasses the entire journey from the source ditches ponds to the river and ultimately to the reservoir the focus on the dry season allows for a more accurate assessment of the n removal and self purification effects of the watershed aquatic ecosystems since the primary n sources originate from soil and human wastewater the sampling points were selected using a combination of randomization and accessibility principles to ensure representative coverage of the study area at each sampling site approximately 500 ml of overlying water and 500 g of sediment were collected using plastic bottles standardized collection protocols were followed to maintain consistency and ensure the reliability of the results during the sampling process important information such as the longitude and latitude water depth flow rate fig 2s chla and do fig 3 s were recorded at each site to maintain the integrity of the samples they were transported back to the laboratory on the same day of collection and stored in a refrigerator at 18 c the samples were also frozen away from light to minimize any potential degradation of the samples all samples were tested within one month of collection to avoid deterioration of the water samples to assess the rate of denitrification and anammox in different aquatic ecosystems this study collected undisturbed sediment column samples from 10 representative river basins encompassing a total of 40 sites across a range of aquatic environments including ditches ponds rivers and reservoirs as illustrated in fig 1s to collect the sediment samples a cylindrical sludge collector made of pvc with an internal diameter of 80 mm was utilized the sediment column was collected to a height of approximately 10 cm and three duplicates were collected at each site to ensure the accuracy of the results in addition to the sediment samples 50 l of surface water was also collected from the same sites for indoor cultivation experiments 2 3 water and sediment samples chemical analysis to determine the concentrations of total and dissolved constituents in the collected water samples a two part division approach was employed the first part of each sample was used to analyze the levels of total nitrogen tn total carbon tc and total phosphorus tp the second part underwent treatment with a needle filter equipped with a 0 45 μm acetate fiber membrane to isolate and analyze the dissolved constituents standard analytical methods were employed to measure the concentrations of these constituents the specific water sample analysis method can be found in table 1s which provides detailed information on the methods used for each constituent analysis the variations in tc tp chla and do in the overlying water of different aquatic ecosystems are visually presented in fig 3s after air drying the sediment samples collected in this study were analyzed to determine the contents of tc tn available n an available phosphorus ap and ph standard protocols were followed for the measurement of sediment properties and detailed descriptions of the methods can be found in table 2s the results obtained from these analyses were plotted in fig 4 s to visually represent the variations in the contents of tc an ap and ph across the different aquatic ecosystems studied this figure provides a graphical depiction of the distribution and differences in these sediment properties among the various sampling sites 2 4 denitrification and anammox rate determination to determine the rate of n denitrification and anammox membrane injection mass spectrometry mims was used in this study as described by she et al 2019 this method allowed for the direct determination of the ratio of n2 ar dissolved in water with high accuracy 0 03 by combining this technique with an isotope matching method denitrification and anammox rates could be distinguished specifically the isotope matching incubation experiment was performed on the four parallel samples collected after 48 h of simulated in situ pre incubation in the laboratory which consumed oxygen and nox in the sediment in the incubation experiment three groups of parallel samples were injected with 100 μmol l 1 n isotopes 15no3 99 29 abundance 15nh4 98 2 abundance proving that the nitrate consumption of the sample was complete and 15nh4 14no3 proving the existence of anammox reaction the other group was set as a control without isotope addition after treatment the samples were incubated in a closed flow incubation system until the sample was stable as measured by membrane injection mass spectrometry water samples were then taken at specific time intervals and the changes in the concentrations of dissolved n2 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 were measured using this data the rate of change of n2 concentration in the overlying water sediment systems μmol l 1 h 1 was calculated based on the n2 concentration and time of different incubation times the n removal rate in the system μmol m 2 h 1 was then obtained by combining the cross sectional area of the sediment column m2 and the volume of the overlying water l finally the denitrification and anammox rates were calculated and distinguished using the following formula 1 d t o t a l p 30 f n 2 2 a t o t a l f n 1 p 29 2 1 f n 1 p 30 where dtotal and atotal are the n2 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 produced by denitrification and anammox respectively p 29 and p 30 are the production rates of 29n2 and 30n2 respectively fn is the abundance of 15n in the added nitrate 99 29 2 5 statistical analyses in this study we compared and analyzed the water quality indicators of different types of water samples using software tools and statistical methods the spatial distribution map of n concentrations and removal rate were created using arcgis 10 2 software which is a widely used tool for mapping and spatial analysis for statistical analysis the water samples in the study were divided into four different types of water bodies including ditches ponds rivers and reservoirs the results were then characterized using box plots scatter plots and lorentz fitted distribution curves to analyze the size concentration trend and distribution of sample n components and removal rates one way analysis of variance anova was used to assess the effect of water body type on n constituents and removal rate the least significant difference lsd statistic with a p value threshold of 0 05 was employed to identify significant differences between the various aquatic ecosystem types additionally spearman correlation analysis ca was used to determine the correlation between different parameters the origin 2021 software was used to conduct some of the mapping and analyses 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of tn of water and sediment in various aquatic ecosystems fig 1 visually represents the spatial distribution of tn in both the overlying water and sediment of various aquatic ecosystems surrounding the djk reservoir the maps reveal striking variations in tn concentrations in the overlying water ranging from 1 03 to 12 99 mg l 1 fig 1a these findings underscore the significance of n as a key risk factor for water eutrophication in the region alarmingly none of the water samples met the chinese national water quality standard for class iii which specifies a tn concentration of less than 1 0 mg l 1 notably the tn concentrations exhibited distinct levels across different aquatic ecosystem types ditches displayed the highest tn concentration 3 71 mg l 1 while reservoirs exhibited the lowest 2 12 mg l 1 fig 1c furthermore statistical analysis revealed a significant p 0 05 difference in tn concentrations between ditches and rivers or reservoirs these results provide evidence of natural n removal and self purification processes within the hydrographic network as water flows from the upper reaches ditches and ponds to the lower reaches rivers and reservoirs tn concentrations experience a substantial reduction rate reaching up to 43 this reduction highlights the critical role played by natural purification processes in mitigating the detrimental impacts of n pollution in aquatic ecosystems in the sediment tn contents were found to be in the range of 0 21 to 3 75 g kg 1 fig 1b with the highest content recorded in the ponds and ditches fig 1d the tn content of the sediment was significantly p 0 05 higher in these ecosystems than in the rivers or reservoirs and the lowest value was observed in the rivers 3 2 variation of n components of overlying water in various aquatic ecosystems the results of the study revealed significant variations in the concentrations of different n components in the overlying water of various aquatic ecosystems no3 n nh4 n don tdn and pn exhibited a similar trend as tn fig 2 notably the concentrations of all measured n components were significantly higher in the ditches compared to other water body types particularly the reservoirs the rates of n reduction for each n component were also calculated with don showing the highest reduction rate of 63 and nh4 n showing the lowest of 34 moreover the contribution of each n component to different water types was significantly different with no3 n accounting for the highest proportion in reservoir water while nh4 n and pn were enriched in ponds fig 2f and the proportion of don in the reservoir was significantly lower than that in the other water types the study aimed to explore the intricate relationship between tn concentration in water and the eco stoichiometric ratio of the three n components namely no3 n nh4 n and don using a state of the art ternary diagram as illustrated in fig 3 each vertex of the triangle represents one n component with nh4 n dominating the top corner no3 n the bottom right and don the bottom left the varying shades of color indicate the tn concentration the results indicated that high tn concentration was linked to a relatively high proportion of nh4 n and don while a relatively high proportion of no3 n was linked to low tn concentration fig 3b this trend was particularly apparent in ditches and ponds as depicted in fig 3c and d further the study revealed that the heterogeneity of the no3 n nh4 n don ratio was relatively high in ditch water reflecting the instability of the aquatic ecosystem the sample point distribution in the reservoir sample points was relatively concentrated indicating that the eco stoichiometric ratio of the three components of n was more homogeneous in the reservoirs as shown in fig 3f 3 3 interaction between overlying water and sediment in various aquatic ecosystems a spearman correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between overlying water and sediment characteristics in four distinct aquatic ecosystem types ponds ditches rivers and reservoirs fig 4 the results indicated that significant correlations existed between water and sediment variables in ditches and ponds suggesting a higher level of interaction between the overlying water and sediment in these ecosystem types in contrast the correlations in rivers and reservoirs were not as pronounced specifically in river ecosystems positive correlations were observed between nh4 n don tdn pn and tn concentrations in water and sediment an and tc however the relationships between other indicators were not found to be statistically significant fig 4c on the other hand no significant correlations were observed between the indicators of overlying water and sediment in the reservoir fig 4d this lack of correlation could be attributed to the fact that reservoir water was collected from different sources including ditches ponds and rivers the mixing of water from multiple sources may have diminished the influence of sediment on the overlying water in the reservoir 3 4 variation of denitrification and anammox in various aquatic ecosystems efficiency in the removal of n from aquatic ecosystems is crucial for effective water quality management in this study we investigated n removal efficiency by measuring denitrification and anammox rates at 40 sample points across 10 representative river basins the findings revealed a wide range of denitrification rates ranging from 11 1 to 161 1 μmol m 2 h 1 with an average rate of 59 7 μmol m 2 h 1 fig 5 a similarly the anammox rates varied from 4 8 to 62 0 μmol m 2 h 1 with an average of 20 2 μmol m 2 h 1 fig 5b the results indicated that denitrification was the primary contributor to n removal accounting for 78 in ditches 69 in ponds and 75 in rivers and reservoirs respectively fig 5e this highlights the significant role of denitrification in removing n from these aquatic ecosystems furthermore the denitrification rates were higher in ponds and ditches compared to reservoirs and rivers fig 5c suggesting that n removal predominantly occurs in the upper reaches of the aquatic ecosystems in contrast the anammox rates exhibited considerable spatial variability and did not show significant differences among the four aquatic ecosystem types fig 5d the intricate processes of denitrification and anammox in aquatic ecosystems are influenced by various environmental factors as depicted in fig 6 the results demonstrate significant and positive correlations between denitrification and anammox rates and all n components in both water and sediment including no3 n nh4 n don tdn pn and tn these components serve as important substrates that fuel denitrification and anammox processes in aquatic ecosystems furthermore the presence of c in both water and sediment was found to have a substantial contribution p 0 05 to the occurrence of denitrification and anammox c acts as an important energy source for these processes supporting the microbial activity involved interestingly sediment ph and do levels in the overlying water exhibited negative correlations with denitrification and anammox specifically water do had the most significant effect on denitrification while sediment ph had the most significant effect on anammox p 0 05 these findings suggest that optimal ph conditions and adequate do levels are crucial for supporting efficient denitrification and anammox processes in aquatic ecosystems however the study observed that tp chla in water and ap in sediment had little to no effect on denitrification and anammox 4 discussion 4 1 n levels and sources in water bodies of djk reservoir area the djk reservoir area is known to have high n concentrations in its water as supported by previous studies guo et al 2022 tan et al 2015 our current study further reinforces these findings as the tn concentration in the aquatic ecosystems ranged from 1 03 to 12 99 mg l 1 these concentrations align with the results of other research conducted in the same region jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 li et al 2022 for instance li et al 2022 investigated the n pollution characteristics of the jinshui river which is a tributary of the hanjiang river and discovered that the concentrations of no3 n nh4 n don and tdn all exceeded 1 0 mg l 1 notably the concentration of n was highest during the summer season with no3 n and don being the dominant components in both high and low flow seasons further analysis using a multiple isotope approach estimated that the contribution of soil organic n and fertilizer loss to tn pollution load exceeded 50 in the jinqian river basin which is the largest sub basin of the hanjiang river basin jiang et al 2021 these findings clearly suggest that agricultural nonpoint source pollution is one of the primary causes of water n eutrophication in the djk reservoir area zhuang et al 2016 therefore there is an urgent need to implement effective measures to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution and mitigate the harmful effects of n eutrophication on the aquatic ecosystems in the region 4 2 hydrodynamic controls on n distribution in aquatic ecosystems in this study the concentration of n in water was found to vary depending on the type of water bodies including ditches or ponds rivers and reservoirs these variations were attributed to the hydrodynamic conditions and the sources of n input in aquatic ecosystems song et al 2022 specifically ditches were identified as major recipients of agricultural drainage and rural domestic sewage leading to high n concentrations in the water moreover the increased concentration of no3 n in the water of rivers and reservoirs could be associated with higher levels of do as aerobic conditions favor organic n mineralization and nitrification liu et al 2023 the swift flow of water in rivers enhances the transfer of oxygen facilitating the breakdown and mineralization of don and resulting in the accumulation of no3 n song et al 2022 xia et al 2016 in contrast ponds which are partially independent of the ditch river reservoir continuum exhibited high levels of n concentration primarily in the form of nh4 n this can be attributed to their proximity to rural residential areas where they experience constant pressure from domestic sewage leading to a significant increase in n pollution the static and closed hydrological conditions of ponds are not conducive to n discharge into open water resulting in n accumulation the study concluded that the hydrodynamic conditions of different aquatic systems played a crucial role in determining the composition and concentration of n stoliker et al 2016 n exists in various forms in water including don nh4 no3 and no2 and the concentration of n in water is not entirely independent of its eco stoichiometry taylor and townsend 2010 our study found that higher tn concentration in water was typically associated with a higher proportion of nh4 n and don whereas lower tn concentration was often linked to a higher proportion of no3 n hydrodynamic conditions determine the stoichiometric relationships of n forms nilsson and jansson 2002 interestingly our research also showed that different aquatic ecosystems exhibit varying degrees of heterogeneity in terms of n composition ditches and ponds exhibited higher levels of heterogeneity whereas the n composition in reservoir water showed a clear trend towards homogenization these differences can be attributed to two factors firstly the different components of n sources lead to variations in n stoichiometric ratios cui et al 2023 and secondly hydrodynamic conditions regulate n biogeochemical cycles resulting in the accumulation of n cycle intermediates dominated by specific n cycling processes mgelwa et al 2020 the former factor is primarily related to n sources while the latter is associated with the n biogeochemical cycle in aquatic ecosystems nilsson and jansson 2002 the results of this study demonstrate that the input of different types of n pollutants and the heterogeneity of hydrodynamic conditions contribute to the spatial differentiation of n occurrence forms and concentrations in ditches and ponds however in reservoir waters the influence of hydrodynamic conditions and biogeochemical processes outweigh the impact of exogenous n inputs indicating the dominance of the latter mechanism in aquatic ecosystems our research emphasizes the importance of different n pollutant inputs and the heterogeneity of hydrodynamic conditions in determining the spatial differentiation of n occurrence forms and concentrations in aquatic ecosystems 4 3 hydrodynamic controls on interactions between overlying water and sediment in aquatic ecosystems the findings of this study reveal a clear pattern of stronger interactions between overlying water and sediment in ditches and ponds compared to rivers and reservoirs as evidenced by more frequent and stronger correlations several factors can explain this observation firstly the larger contact area between water and sediment in ditches and the longer retention time of water in ponds facilitate increased material exchange and energy flow leading to a higher degree of interaction between water and sediment in these water bodies wang et al 2022 secondly ditches and ponds being smaller water bodies are more susceptible to environmental influences which further enhances their interactions shen et al 2021 in contrast reservoirs exhibit a stronger environmental buffering capacity due to their extensive water storage capacity thirdly the dilution effect of upstream water weakens to some extent the interaction between overlying water and sediment in rivers and reservoirs mgelwa et al 2020 therefore the observed differentiation in correlations among different aquatic ecosystems highlights the significant influence of biogeochemical and hydrological factors such as reaction area retention time buffer capacity and dilution effect in shaping n occurrence processes in water shen et al 2021 wang et al 2022 4 4 hydrodynamic controls on n removal in aquatic ecosystems aquatic ecosystems play a crucial role in various processes including the migration transformation and degradation of organic and inorganic n compounds as well as other pollutants qin et al 2017 additionally these ecosystems are essential for n removal a critical process for maintaining the health of aquatic environments schmadel et al 2018 the data in this study reveal a decreasing trend in n concentration along the water flow direction from ditches and ponds to rivers and reservoirs suggesting that n removal processes occur during water flow recent research has also demonstrated that freshwater river system possess an impressive average n removal capacity of 26 3 71 3 μmol m 2 h 1 zhao et al 2017 furthermore it is worth noting that the runoff from terrestrial water networks exhibits a remarkable removal rate of over 75 with the remaining 10 25 of artificially introduced n entering the marine system howarth et al 1996 the n present in water can undergo denitrification and anammox processes leading to the release of n2 or n2o into the atmosphere wang et al 2019 the study employed simulation experiments to investigate n removal rates in various aquatic systems revealing a wide ranging variability of n removal rates across various aquatic systems as seen in fig 5 the variability spans over two orders of magnitude indicating the presence of considerable spatial variability in n removal from aquatic ecosystems lin et al 2016 zhou et al 2021 notably ditches exhibited higher rates of n removal compared to rivers and reservoirs this can be attributed to the availability of substrates for microbial mineralization and abiotic reactions nikolenko et al 2018 which may be more abundant in the water and sediments of ditches and ponds due to higher nutrient concentrations additionally the presence of a large water sediment contact area in shallow water environments such as ditches and ponds provides a favorable habitat for microbial activity shen et al 2021 so the water and sediments of ditches and ponds often harbor diverse microorganisms that contribute to the efficient cycling of n in the ecosystem martinez espinosa et al 2021 these findings have significant implications for understanding the role of ditches in the n cycle of watershed systems herbert et al 2015 by extending the contact area and time between water and sediment the conditions for n transformation and removal can be optimized slowing down the flow rate of ditch water and increasing the retention time of polluted water within the ditch system can potentially serve as an effective approach to mitigate n pollution in watershed systems shen et al 2023 the denitrification and anammox processes are not only influenced by the substrate n and c content but also by other factors such as do and ph in the overlying water and sediment zhao et al 2017 our correlation analysis as shown in fig 6 revealed that the substrate content has the greatest influence on the n removal efficiency of aquatic ecosystems it is noteworthy that the denitrification rate with nh4 n concentration and the anammox rate with no3 n concentration showed a significant positive correlation p 0 05 although this correlation might seem unreasonable at first glance it is in fact reasonable as in natural water environments the mineralization of organic n nitrification and denitrification reactions often occur simultaneously martinez espinosa et al 2021 furthermore different forms or components of n in the water can be transformed into each other which are in a dynamic equilibrium within a certain range song et al 2022 another important factor affecting the rate of n removal in water is do yang et al 2012 most denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria are anaerobic bacteria which are very sensitive to oxygen zhang et al 2022 low do levels can therefore promote the growth and activity of these anaerobic bacteria and increase the rate of n removal in water feng et al 2012 the interplay between these factors along with other environmental variables underscores the complexity of the n removal processes in aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusion the findings of our study provide valuable insights into the hydrodynamic conditions that control the distribution and removal of n in aquatic ecosystems these processes have important implications for the conservation of water resources and the reduction of n pollution we found that the agricultural catchment of the basin played a crucial role in removing n from water as evidenced by the decreasing trend in tn and its components along the water flow direction especially the ditches and ponds exhibited stronger interactions between overlying water and sediment with higher rates of denitrification and anammox our findings highlight the need to focus on the upper reaches of agricultural catchments such as ditches and ponds for n removal and emphasize the importance of developing region specific conservation strategies to mitigate n pollution and protect water resources however we also acknowledge that predicting n occurrence in different seasons and scales is challenging and requires careful consideration of various hydrological and biological factors as well as agricultural non point source pollution loads nevertheless we believe that the potential removal of activated n from aquatic systems is a significant part of the self purification process and cannot be ignored when designing conservation strategies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

study leveraging europium doped polystyrene ps eu we aim to quantify the uptake and transport of micro and nanoplastics in three typical freshwater plants representing submerged emergent and floating

translocation of micro and nanoplastics to simulate different environmental conditions v denseserrulata and i tectorum were exposed to the overlying water or sediment contaminated by ps eu while e crassipes were only exposed to the water contaminated by ps eu fig 1 after 8 weeks of chronic exposure the distribution and translocation of ps eu in plant tissues were verified by confocal laser

after exposure the chronic exposures to ps eu particles 5 μg ml in water or 5 μg g in sediment did not show any significant effect on the primary growth factors of aquatic plants including height and biomass table s4 moreover there were no significant differences in catalase activities of aquatic plants exposed to ps eu particles compared to the controls table s4 indicating a relatively high tolerance of aquatic plants in response to the exposure of ps eu particles 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first exploration to trace and quantify the absorption of micro and nanoplastics by aquatic plants using metal doped ps particles ps is the most used model polymer in laboratory experiments and represents one of the most common plastics found in freshwater environments yuan et al 2022 due to the current analytical challenges our understanding of the environmental and biological fates of nanoplastics remains rather limited mitrano et al 2019 developed a method to synthesize nanoplastics doped with metals which was successfully applied to investigate the fate of nanoplastics in a wastewater treatment plant lanthanide chelates are distinctly advantageous as they have long luminescence lifetimes large stokes shifts sharp emission profiles and visible light excitation wavelengths weissman 1942 our recent study has demonstrated labeling plastic particles with lanthanide chelates as an effective way to trace the uptake and translocation of submicrometre plastics in crop plants luo et al 2022 furthermore the eu element doping allows the indirect quantification of submicrometre plastics in plant and animal tissues by icp ms even at low concentrations together with previous studies the present research shows the high advantages and utility of eu doped plastic particles to investigate the biological fate and behavior of submicrometre plastics in aquatic plants nanoplastics effectively accumulated in the roots of aquatic plants and were transported to leaves in the present study fig 6 the uptake of nanoplastics was also observed by crop plants in our previous study in lettuce li et al 2020b in the root tip ps eu particles were mostly adsorbed on border cells and arranged along the root surface a large amount of red fluorescence was attached to the root surface and the intercellular space these results suggest that ps eu particles might be absorbed by the root in the maturation region and internalized into the stele via the apoplastic pathway sun et al 2020 consistent with the results of confocal imaging the presence of ps eu particles was further confirmed in root and shoot tissues by electron microscopy imaging mainly in epidermal cells and the catheter of the xylem as well as in the leaf vein comparing different types of aquatic plants i e submerged emergent and floating plants we found higher translocation and bioaccumulation of nanoplastics in floating plants which could be explained by the role of transpiration and different root structures particulate matter must cross a series of chemical and physiological barriers of plants before uptake and translocation which control the size exclusion limits sels eichert et al 2008 the root structures of different aquatic plant species may affect their uptake and translocation of micro and nanoplastics compared with other plants e crassipes have a more concise apoplastic path which may lead to easier transportation of plastic particles it is generally accepted that relatively large nanoparticles 100 nm can be taken up by plants despite the very small sels 20 nm of plant roots li et al 2020b lian et al 2020 sun et al 2021 one possible reason is that ps beads may compress and deform when being internalized because they are less stiff than the plant cell walls li et al 2020b this intrinsic property is essential for the migration of plastic particles within plant tissues enabling them to reach the root central cylinder and the vascular tissues and resulting in their upward movement to the aerial parts of the plant the bioaccumulation of micro and nanoplastics by aquatic plants is much higher than what was observed in terrestrial plants luo et al 2022 in particular the bcf of nanoplastics in e crassipes reached 306 5 after 8 weeks of exposure which is hundreds of times higher than those in crop pants 1 8 2 9 previous studies have investigated the bioaccumulation of micro and nanoplastics by various aquatic organisms including invertebrates kuehr et al 2022 zooplankton rist et al 2017 zoobenthos redondo hasselerharm et al 2021 shellfish al sid cheikh et al 2018 as well as with fish species kim et al 2021 although it is difficult to compare the bioaccumulation in different organisms floating plants like e crassipes show a higher plastic particle trapping potential than submersed or emersed plants under similar exposure concentrations of plastic particles the developed root system of e crassipes has a large contact area with water and its rhizosphere microorganisms and secretions might accelerate the aggregation and adsorption of plastic particles on the roots compared with e crassipes v denseserrulata and i tectorum showed a lower uptake efficiency of plastic particles yet bioaccumulation of nanoplastics was evident in particular the bcf values of these two plant species in the plastics contaminated sediment microcosms were higher than those in the water plastics contaminated water microcosms which is different from what has been observed for terrestrial plants in our previous study luo et al 2022 the bioaccumulation of plastic particles by roots of i tectorum was higher than in the case of v denseserrulata whereas the opposite was found for the leaves it should be noted that this study cannot rule out the absorption of nanoplastics by submerged leaves zhao et al 2017 indicated that cuo nanoparticles can be taken up by both roots and submerged leaves of e crassipes aquatic plants might internalize more plastic particles than terrestrial plants in a more efficient way as both roots and leaves of aquatic plants can interact with plastic particles also aquatic plants have more flexible cell wall structure and less developed vascular tissue making them easier to transfer plastic particles than terrestrial plants there is currently no information on the environmental concentrations of nanoplastics but the environmental water concentrations of submicrometre plastics is expected to be in the range of a few to several hundred µg l 1 al sid cheikh et al 2018 therefore the concentrations of micro and nano plastics used in this study 5 μg ml in water and 5 μg g in sediment may be close to or slightly higher than their actual concentration in the water environments the exposure concentrations of micro and nanoplastics have no observable negative impact on all aquatic plants during the chronic exposure period the effective bioaccumulation and enrichment of plastic particles by aquatic plants as well as their high tolerance to exposure to plastic particles make aquatic plants useful for potential phytoremediation of plastic pollution in aquatic environments in fact floating plants like e crassipes have been used to eliminate many other pollutants in water such as heavy metals mishra and tripathi 2008 organic pollutants de laet et al 2019 and antibiotics yan et al 2020 therefore the high tolerance of e crassipes to micro and nanoplastics makes the species a good candidate for plastic remediation while removing multiple pollutants from the water environment 5 conclusions the ps eu particles are used for accurately quantifying the bioaccumulation of micro and nanoplastics in different species of aquatic plants micro and nanoplastics mainly accumulated in the intercellular space of aquatic plants and were transported from roots to leaves via the apoplastic path and vascular bundle e crassipes has the highest absorption capacity of plastic particles among the three plants investigated a large amount of submicrometre plastic particles accumulated in the roots of aquatic plants which have a far higher enrichment performance than known information in terrestrial plants prolonged exposure to relatively high concentrations of plastic particles has no significant adverse impact on the growth of aquatic plants suggesting a low health risk of plastic particles at currently predicted environmental concentrations the unique advantages of aquatic plants in absorbing nanoplastics and high tolerance to nanoplastic exposure show their great potential for the phytoremediation of nanoplastics in freshwater environments the use of metal doped plastic particles in plant uptake experiments also enables reliable screening for hyper

in roots with a bioconcentration factor of 306 5 depending on exposure routes and plant species owing to their excellent capture capability and high tolerance to plastic exposures floating plants like

the growing demands for human use maity and pramanick 2020 although the benefits of plastics are far reaching mismanagement and improper disposal of plastic waste are escalating plastic pollution worldwide it is estimated that only 9 of the 9 billion metric tons of plastic ever produced has been recycled and that most plastic ends its life in landfills and the natural environment geyer et al

deterioration and fragmentation into microplastics 5 mm and nanoplastics 1 µm by physicochemical processes in the natural environment da costa et al 2016 although the actual concentrations of

bcfs reached 45 3 and 43 3 for v denseserrulata and i tectorum respectively table s3 the bcfs of microplastics were several orders of magnitude lower than those of nanoplastics fig 5b the translocation factors tlfs of ps eu particles ranged from 0 048 to 0 245 fig 5c d among them the tlfs of ps eu particles in e crassipes 0 236 0 245 were higher than those in v denseserrulata and i tectorum 0 048 0 187 at the end of the exposure higher bioaccumulation was found in the water polluted microcosm than in the sediment polluted microcosm fig 5e g most of the ps eu particles 78 24 91 56 accumulated in the roots of plants while fewer particles 8 44 21 76 accumulated in the plant leaves fig s4 the concentration of ps eu particles was also measured in the overlaying water in the microcosms where it decreased by 11 9 13 8 and 32 7 for the v denseserrulata i tectorum and e crassipes after 8 weeks of exposure to 5 μg ml ps eu particles respectively fig s5 3 4 biological effects after exposure the chronic exposures to ps eu particles 5 μg ml in water or 5 μg g in sediment did not show any significant effect on the primary growth factors of aquatic plants including height and biomass table s4 moreover there were no significant differences in catalase activities of aquatic plants exposed to ps eu particles compared to the controls table s4 indicating a relatively high tolerance of aquatic plants in response to the exposure of ps eu particles 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first exploration to trace and quantify the absorption of micro and nanoplastics by aquatic plants using metal doped ps particles ps is the most used model polymer in laboratory experiments and represents one of the most common plastics found in freshwater environments yuan et al 2022 due to the current analytical challenges our understanding of the environmental and biological fates of nanoplastics remains rather limited mitrano et al 2019 developed a method to synthesize nanoplastics doped with metals which was successfully applied to investigate the fate of nanoplastics in a wastewater treatment plant lanthanide chelates are distinctly advantageous as they have long luminescence lifetimes large stokes shifts sharp emission profiles and visible light excitation wavelengths weissman 1942 our recent study has demonstrated labeling plastic particles with lanthanide chelates as an effective way to trace the uptake and translocation of submicrometre plastics in crop plants luo et al 2022 furthermore the eu element doping allows the indirect quantification of submicrometre plastics in plant and animal tissues by icp ms even at low concentrations together with previous studies the present research shows the high advantages and utility of eu doped plastic particles to investigate the biological fate and behavior of submicrometre plastics in aquatic plants nanoplastics effectively accumulated in the roots of aquatic plants and were transported to leaves in the present study fig 6 the uptake of nanoplastics was also observed by crop plants in our previous study in lettuce li et al 2020b in the root tip ps eu particles were mostly adsorbed on border cells and arranged along the root surface a large amount of red fluorescence was attached to the root surface and the intercellular space these results suggest that ps eu particles might be absorbed by the root in the maturation region and internalized into the stele via the apoplastic pathway sun et al 2020 consistent with the results of confocal imaging the presence of ps eu particles was further confirmed in root and shoot tissues by electron microscopy imaging mainly in epidermal cells and the catheter of the xylem as well as in the leaf vein comparing different types of aquatic plants i e submerged emergent and floating plants we found higher translocation and bioaccumulation of nanoplastics in floating plants which could be explained by the role of transpiration and different root structures particulate matter must cross a series of chemical and physiological barriers of plants before uptake and translocation which control the size exclusion limits sels eichert et al 2008 the root structures of different aquatic plant species may affect their uptake and translocation of micro and nanoplastics compared with other plants e crassipes have a more concise apoplastic path which may lead to easier transportation of plastic particles it is generally accepted that relatively large nanoparticles 100 nm can be taken up by plants despite the very small sels 20 nm of plant roots li et al 2020b lian et al 2020 sun et al 2021 one possible reason is that ps beads may compress and deform when being internalized because they are less stiff than the plant cell walls li et al 2020b this intrinsic property is essential for the migration of plastic particles within plant tissues enabling them to reach the root central cylinder and the vascular tissues and resulting in their upward movement to the aerial parts of the plant the bioaccumulation of micro and nanoplastics by aquatic plants is much higher than what was observed in terrestrial plants luo et al 2022 in particular the bcf of nanoplastics in e crassipes reached 306 5 after 8 weeks of exposure which is hundreds of times higher than those in crop pants 1 8 2 9 previous studies have investigated the bioaccumulation of micro and nanoplastics by various aquatic organisms including invertebrates kuehr et al 2022 zooplankton rist et al 2017 zoobenthos redondo hasselerharm et al 2021 shellfish al sid cheikh et al 2018 as well as with fish species kim et al 2021 although it is difficult to compare the bioaccumulation in different organisms floating plants like e crassipes show a higher plastic particle trapping potential than submersed or emersed plants under similar exposure concentrations of plastic particles the developed root system of e crassipes has a large contact area with water and its rhizosphere microorganisms and secretions might accelerate the aggregation and adsorption of plastic particles on the roots compared with e crassipes v denseserrulata and i tectorum showed a lower uptake efficiency of plastic particles yet bioaccumulation of nanoplastics was evident in particular the bcf values of these two plant species in the plastics contaminated sediment microcosms were higher than those in the water plastics contaminated water microcosms which is different from what has been observed for terrestrial plants in our previous study luo et al 2022 the bioaccumulation of plastic particles by roots of i tectorum was higher than in the case of v denseserrulata whereas the opposite was found for the leaves it should be noted that this study cannot rule out the absorption of nanoplastics by submerged leaves zhao et al 2017 indicated that cuo nanoparticles can be taken up by both roots and submerged leaves of e crassipes aquatic plants might internalize more plastic particles than terrestrial plants in a more efficient way as both roots and leaves of aquatic plants can interact with plastic particles also aquatic plants have more flexible cell wall structure and less developed vascular tissue making them easier to transfer plastic particles than terrestrial plants there is currently no information on the environmental concentrations of nanoplastics but the environmental water concentrations of submicrometre plastics is expected to be in the range of a few to several hundred µg l 1 al sid cheikh et al 2018 therefore the concentrations of micro and nano plastics used in this study 5 μg ml in water and 5 μg g in sediment may be close to or slightly higher than their actual concentration in the water environments the exposure concentrations of micro and nanoplastics have no observable negative impact on all aquatic plants during the chronic exposure period the effective bioaccumulation and enrichment of plastic particles by aquatic plants as well as their high tolerance to exposure to plastic particles make aquatic plants useful for potential phytoremediation of plastic pollution in aquatic environments in fact floating plants like e crassipes have been used to eliminate many other pollutants in water such as heavy metals mishra and tripathi 2008 organic pollutants de laet et al 2019 and antibiotics yan et al 2020 therefore the high tolerance of e crassipes to micro and nanoplastics makes the species a good candidate for plastic remediation while removing multiple pollutants from the water environment 5 conclusions the ps eu particles are used for accurately quantifying the bioaccumulation of micro and nanoplastics in different species of aquatic plants micro and nanoplastics mainly accumulated in the intercellular space of aquatic plants and were transported from roots to leaves via the apoplastic path and vascular bundle e crassipes has the highest absorption capacity of plastic particles among the three plants investigated a large amount of submicrometre plastic particles accumulated in the roots of aquatic plants which have a far higher enrichment performance than known information in terrestrial plants prolonged exposure to relatively high concentrations of plastic particles has no significant adverse impact on the growth of aquatic plants suggesting a low health risk of plastic particles at currently predicted environmental concentrations the unique advantages of aquatic plants in absorbing nanoplastics and high tolerance to nanoplastic exposure show their great potential for the phytoremediation of nanoplastics in freshwater environments the use of metal doped plastic particles in plant uptake experiments also enables reliable screening for hyper

14673,the three dimensional 3d structure of the cake layer which could be influenced by water quality factors plays a significant role in the ultrafiltration uf efficiency of water purification however it remains challenging to precisely reveal the variation of cake layer 3d structures and water channel characteristics herein we systematically report the variation in the cake layer 3d structure at the nanoscale induced by key water quality factors and reveal its influence on water transport in particular the abundance of water channels within the cake layer in comparison with ph and na ca2 played more significant role in determining cake layer structures the sandwich like cake layer which was induced by the asynchronous deposition of humic acids and sodium alginate sa shifted to an isotropic structure when ca2 was present due to the ca2 bridging in comparison with the sandwich like structure the isotropic cake layer has higher fractions of free volume voids and more water channels leading to a 147 improvement in the water transport coefficient 60 reduction in the cake layer resistance and 21 increase in the final membrane specific flux our work elucidates a structure property relationship where improving the isotropy of the cake layer 3d structure is conducive to the optimization of water channels and water transport within cake layers this could inspire tailored

water channel fouling behavior 1 introduction to solve the global challenge of clean water shortages culp et al 2021 kim et al 2010 mauter et al 2018 shannon et al 2008 ultrafiltration uf has received increasing attention owing to its high permeate quality and low energy consumption alvarez et al 2018 werber et al 2016 the global uf market reached 887 million euro eur in 2017 and it is expected to reach 2 billion eur in 2023 aani et al 2020 however membrane fouling substantially restricts uf applications park et al 2017 wood et al 2016 the membrane lifetime is reduced to about one third because of membrane fouling leading to a triplication of membrane replacement cost flemming 2020 the formation of cake layers which are mainly composed of natural organic matter nom dramatically decreases uf efficiency during drinking water treatment zhang et al 2013 and it is the predominant reason for membrane fouling during long term operation although multiple approaches e g coagulation and oxidation have been applied to regulate cake layers ajmani et al 2012 ang et al 2011 cheng et al 2018 lee et al 2015 malczewska and benjamin 2016 peleato et al 2017 zhou and meng 2016 cake layer formation is inevitable over time choi and dempsey 2004 resosudarmo et al 2013 the three dimensional 3d structure of a cake layer plays a significant role in the water transport within the cake layer and is crucial for the related uf water flux the 3d distribution of functional groups influences water transport because of their distinct interactions with water molecules additionally the 3d distribution of matter density can also influence water transport which has been reported for desalination membranes culp et al 2021 therefore to enhance the efficiency of uf for water production a comprehensive understanding of the 3d structure of a cake layer and its influence on water channel characteristics and water transport behavior within the cake layer is necessary lu et al 2021 nevertheless obtaining in depth insights into the 3d structure of a cake layer remains challenging correspondingly the water channels and water transport within such cake layers are also unclear resulting in a lack of a theoretical basis for the precise regulation of the cake layer typical water quality factors e g ph and concentration of specific ions influence the 3d structure of a cake layer by affecting the properties of organic foulants and their interactions lee et al 2017 wang and tang 2011 leading to variations in the water transport efficiency the water quality factors of source water are complex and vary with season in practical drinking water treatments childress and elimelech 1996 in previous studies the effects of water quality factors on cake layer fouling during uf based water purification remained unclear to a certain extent for instance increased ph has been observed to reduce cake layer fouling in certain cases lee et al 2017 lin et al 2015 whereas the reduction of cake layer resistance was observed when decreasing ph in other cases neemann et al 2013 the presence of cations was reported to aggravate cake layer fouling lee et al 2017 wang et al 2015 whereas low packing density of cake layers i e fouling alleviation was observed when ca2 was present in other studies wu et al 2014 owing to the limited understanding of the variation in the precise 3d structure of a cake layer the mechanisms underlying the influence of water quality factors on uf membrane fouling remain unclear traditional characterization approaches for cake layers fail to analyze their precise 3d structures particularly in depth with a high resolution at the nanoscale chen et al 2018 with optical coherence tomography dreszer et al 2014 scanning electron microscopy sem ajmani et al 2012 and atomic force microscopy wang et al 2013 it is difficult to discriminate organic foulants within the cake layers spectroscopic techniques such as infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy wang et al 2015 raman spectroscopy virtanen et al 2017 and front face excitation emission matrix spectroscopy yu et al 2019 can be used to identify different foulants however they lack the capacity to provide depth profiling of the cake layer confocal laser scanning microscopy depth resolution several hundred nanometers lin et al 2019 marroquin et al 2014 and stimulated raman scattering microscopy depth resolution several micrometers chen et al 2017 fail to explore precise 3d structures at the nanoscale because of their low depth resolution in our previous study wu et al 2021 we demonstrated that time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims was appropriate for precisely analyzing the 3d structure of a cake layer owing to its nanoscale depth resolution 5 nm and applicability for organic matter bruycker et al 2020 ievlev et al 2019 quilettes et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the depth distributions of different foulants in the cake layer can be obtained simultaneously through moderate layer by layer etching furthermore the lateral distributions resolution 5 μm can be obtained by scanning the x y plane between two etching steps in this study we applied tof sims to reveal the variation in the cake layer 3d structure at the nanoscale induced by key water quality factors i e ph na and ca2 based on their content range in natural surface water li et al 2009 moreover we conducted molecular dynamics md simulations to elucidate the influence of the cake layer 3d structure on water channel characteristics and water transport behavior humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa which are commonly considered representations of humic substances hs proteins and polysaccharides wang et al 2013 respectively were used as model foulants to investigate cake layers formed by nom contreras et al 2011 the investigation was also applicable to cake layers formed by extracellular polymeric substances eps because proteins and polysaccharides are also major components of eps hao et al 2013 during uf cake layers were formed by binary foulant mixtures to simulate different source waters and raw water obtained from the beijing section of the south to north water diversion project china analyzing the water channel characteristics water transport behavior and related uf water fluxes within cake layers of different 3d structures elucidated the structure property relationship between the cake layer structure and uf efficiency for purified water production 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the information of chemicals uf membranes and raw water is shown in supporting information si method s1 the detailed procedure for ca2 removal from raw water is described in si method s2 the specific characteristics of the raw water and raw water with ca2 removed are listed in si table s1 2 2 uf experiments the 300 ml solutions of ha sa ha bsa or bsa sa mixtures were filtered the detailed procedures are shown in si method s3 the absolute membrane flux jt as a function of filtration time was recorded using a balance with a data logger ar2202cn ohaus nj usa and the membrane specific flux jt j0 was calculated where j0 was the initial absolute membrane flux for uf experiments with raw water 1 l of raw water or raw water with ca2 removed were filtered other procedures were the same as described above after the uf experiments the fouled membranes were naturally dried and stored in petri dishes for subsequent tof sims analysis 2 3 tof sims depth profiling the depth profiles of the cake layers were determined by tof sims v ion tof gmbh münster germany the detailed procedure of depth profiling is shown in si method s4 the intensities of the representative secondary ions were normalized to the total ion intensity and the normalized intensities as a function of sputter time were plotted as depth profiles the corresponding 3d images of the cake layer structures were reconstructed from the depth profile data data acquisition data processing and data analysis were performed using surfacelab 7 ion tof gmbh 2 4 md simulations md simulations of water transport in the small mw ha large mw ha small large mw ha sa and ha sa ca2 systems were performed using material studio and the compass ii force field was used sun 1998 moreover md simulations of water permeation through the three layer sandwich like cake layer and isotropic cake layer were conducted using gromacs 2018 the visualization was achieved using visual molecular dynamics humphrey et al 1996 the detailed procedures of md simulation are presented in si method s5 2 5 other measurements all measurements were repeated three times and the detailed measurement methods are described in si method s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation in cake layer structures and water transport induced by ph based on the predetermined representative secondary ions of each foulant and the uf membrane si figure s1 wu et al 2021 we found that the variation in cake layer structures was negligible under high ph conditions fig 1a and si figures s2 s3 and s4 the cake layer formed by the ha sa mixture was sandwich like a three layer structure ha at the top and bottom sa in the middle at both ph 7 and 9 owing to the limited interaction between the different foulants si figure s5 and their asynchronous deposition on the membrane wu et al 2021 in addition the cake layer formed by the ha bsa or bsa sa mixtures was always isotropic because of the aggregation of ha and bsa si figure s6 or the miscibility of bsa and sa si figure s7 see the detailed discussion in si text s1 guan et al 2018 kruif et al 2004 myat et al 2014 corresponding to the negligible variation in the cake layer structure we measured the membrane specific fluxes the ratio of the absolute flux at time t to the initial absolute flux jt j0 the initial absolute fluxes are provided in si text s2 similar final membrane specific fluxes after 60 min the same below unless specified were observed the values were 0 67 at ph 7 and 0 66 at ph 9 for ha sa 7 1 mass ratio the same below fig 1b and si figure s8 the uf flux reduction was mostly contributed by cake layers in this work because the average proportion of the cake layer resistance in the total membrane fouling resistance was as high as 96 2 2 7 the difference in the cake layer resistances at ph 7 2 58 0 33 1012 m 1 for ha sa 7 1 and ph 9 2 65 0 24 1012 m 1 for ha sa 7 1 was also negligible our observations indicate that the water channel characteristics and water transport behavior within a similar cake layer structure were identical however we further observed variations in the 3d structure of the cake layer under low ph conditions the three layer sandwich like cake layer induced by the ha sa mixture shifted to a two layer structure at ph 5 fig 1a and si figure s2 the zeta potential of uf membrane surface was 12 7 2 5 mv at ph 7 and 9 1 1 6 mv at ph 5 the zeta potential of ha was 36 6 1 1 mv at ph 7 and 30 6 2 3 mv at ph 5 the negative charges carried by uf membrane surface and ha molecules were all reduced when ph decreased as a result the electrostatic repulsion between uf membrane surface and ha became slighter under lower ph condition additionally the solubility of ha was sharply reduced under lower ph condition childress and elimelech 1996 jucker and clark 1994 hence ha molecules were more easily precipitated and deposited onto the membrane surface under lower ph condition leading to the distribution at the bottom of the cake layer corresponding to the improvement in isotropy of the cake layer structure we observed an increase in the final membrane specific fluxes by 19 4 for ha sa 7 1 and a reduction in the cake layer resistances by 46 1 for ha sa 7 1 at ph 5 fig 1b and si figures s8a and s8b which demonstrates the enhancement of water channel formation and water transport within the cake layers a visualization of the above variations is shown in fig 1c for the ha bsa mixture the aggregation and encapsulation of bsa molecules by ha molecules were reduced at low ph conditions which was confirmed by further analysis where individual bsa molecules emerged at ph 5 si figure s6 ha bsa aggregates were preferentially deposited on the membrane surface and individual bsa molecules accumulated on the top of the cake layer thus the isotropic cake layer shifted to a two layer structure at ph 5 si figure s3 owing to the stronger fouling potential of individual bsa molecules in the two layer cake layer wu et al 2021 the final membrane specific fluxes decreased by 49 4 for ha bsa 1 3 and the cake layer resistances increased by 85 4 for ha bsa 1 3 at ph 5 si figures s8c and s8d therefore we infer that corresponding to the reduction in isotropy of the cake layer structure the free volume voids fraction and its connectivity within the cake layers were reduced leading to a decline in water channel abundance and water transport the isotropic cake layer induced by the bsa sa mixture at a higher ph value also developed into a two layer structure at ph 5 si figure s4 bsa was mainly distributed at the bottom whereas sa was observed in the entire cake layer predominantly at the top in contrast to the simple co solubility at ph 7 the bsa and sa molecules aggregated at ph 5 si figure s7 in addition the mass ratio of bsa to sa in the aggregates was high neemann et al 2013 indicating the presence of individual sa molecules bsa sa aggregates were preferentially deposited on the membrane and individual sa molecules accumulated on the top of the cake layer although the isotropy of the cake layer structure was reduced large aggregates emerged leading to an increase in membrane specific fluxes at ph 5 si figures s8e and s8f 3 2 cake layer structures and water transport in the presence of na in comparison to ph ions in water are also significant factors affecting uf efficiency miao et al 2017 sodium ions are the most common ions in surface water sources thus we investigated the cake layer structures under different na concentrations based on its actual concentration range in natural surface water 0 06 345 mg l meybeck and helmer 1989 we found that a negligible change in the cake layer structure was induced by na regardless of the nom mixture similar to the case in the absence of na the cake layer structure formed by the ha sa mixture remained sandwich like in the presence of 20 mm na si figure s9 and that formed by the ha bsa or bsa sa mixtures remained isotropic si figure s10 the potential reason for the negligible variation is that na ions cannot participate in foulant interactions and the aggregation behavior between different foulants is barely influenced by na to support our hypothesis we conducted a gel permeation chromatography analysis si figures s11a and s11b show that no new peak was observed when sa coexisted with ha or bsa indicating that no aggregation occurred for a ha sa mixture or bsa sa mixture regardless of the na concentration in addition when ha and bsa coexisted a new response in the larger molecular weight mw region emerged in both the absence and presence of na si figure s11c which demonstrates that na did not influence the encapsulation of bsa molecules by ha molecules myat et al 2014 and the formation of ha bsa aggregates owing to the similarity in the cake layer structure we observed a negligible difference in the final membrane specific fluxes for the ha bsa mixture when the na concentration increased 3 8 for ha bsa 3 1 20 mm na si figure s12 moreover for the ha sa or bsa sa mixtures sa molecules were less negatively charged when na was present si figure s13 leading to reduced electrostatic repulsion between sa molecules and the membrane surface membrane specific fluxes decreased with increasing na concentration however because of the limited change in the cake layer structure the decline in final membrane specific fluxes was relatively low by 8 1 for ha sa 3 1 and 9 4 for bsa sa 3 1 20 mm na si figures s14 and s15 our findings suggest similar water channel characteristics and water transport efficiency in similar cake layer structures under different na concentrations 3 3 isotropic cake layer structure and fast water transport induced by ca2 calcium ions can combine with organic matter and play a major role in uf membrane fouling zhang et al 2018 therefore we investigated the variation in the cake layer structure induced by ca2 notably the cake layers were all isotropic in the presence of ca2 regardless of the nom mixture fig 2a and si figure s16 ca2 ions can bind to the oxygen atoms of carboxylates in a highly ordered manner and act as bridges between the different nom molecules liu et al 2016 based on the ca2 bridges aggregation between different nom molecules occurs and an egg box shaped network is formed zhang et al 2018 under uf conditions different nom molecules were synchronously deposited on the membrane surface in the form of aggregates thus in addition to the isotropic cake layers formed by the ha bsa or bsa sa mixtures the three layer sandwich like cake layer ha top and bottom sa middle formed by the ha sa mixture also shifted to an isotropic structure when ca2 was present both ha and sa were uniformly distributed within the cake layer to investigate the variation in water channels and water transport along with the increase in isotropy of the cake layer structure fig 2b we measured membrane specific fluxes under different ca2 concentrations fig 2c and si figure s17 show that the membrane specific fluxes increased when ca2 was present the final membrane specific flux for ha sa 7 1 increased by 20 9 in the presence of 1 mm ca2 and the cake layer resistance decreased by 59 7 when ca2 was present the porosity of cake layer increased from 1 1 to 7 6 for the ha sa mixture fig 2d from 1 7 to 5 1 for the ha bsa mixture figure s18a and from 0 4 to 3 6 for the bsa sa mixture figure s18b as a results looser and more porous cake layers were formed when ca2 was present owing to the formation of larger aggregates moreover we note that the increase in membrane specific fluxes was larger when the proportion of sa was higher and that of bsa was lower by 47 8 for bsa sa 1 3 and 7 8 for bsa sa 3 1 the potential cause was that a regular and highly ordered network was more easily formed by sa molecules with a molecular conformation of chains compared with bsa molecules with a molecular conformation of spheres zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 based on our observations we propose an inferred structure property relationship where along with the increase in the isotropy of the cake layer structure the fraction of water channels within the cake layer was enhanced see section 3 4 for quantitative details and the efficiency of water transport was therefore improved in comparison to the reduction of negative charges carried by nom molecules indicating reduced electrostatic repulsion between nom molecules and the membrane surface si figure s13 the variation in the cake layer structures plays a predominant role in water transport 3 4 computational investigation of water transport within different cake layers to investigate the variation in water transport within different cake layer structures and related mechanisms we conducted md simulations for cake layers formed by ha sa mixtures because their structures were representative the actual uf process where the formation of a cake layer by foulant precipitation from feed water and the filtration of water through the cake layer occur simultaneously is difficult to accurately model and simulate therefore we simplified it to a process of water molecule transport within an already formed cake layer structure based on our previous study small and large mw ha were separately distributed within the cake layer at high ph value wu et al 2021 however they were mixed within the cake layer at low ph value see section 3 1 consequently we conducted md simulations for water molecule transport in the small mw ha large mw ha and small large mw ha i e small and large mw ha were mixed systems initial md models of different systems were constructed by mixing different mw ha chains temple northeastern birmingham model molecule and its pentamer davies et al 1997 with water molecules of similar mass percentages 2 57 0 32 si table s2 as shown in fig 3a fig 3b shows the free volume voids in the different systems during the water transport simulation the connected free volume constituted the water channels which play a decisive role in the efficiency of water transport the fraction of water channels in the large mw ha system were determined to be 65 6 lower than those in the small mw ha system fig 3b in addition in comparison with the small mw ha system 30 8 å and 1 38 10 9 m2 s 1 the mean square displacement msd of water molecules during the 300 ps simulation 11 5 å fig 3c and the transport coefficient of water molecules 5 17 10 10 m2 s 1 si table s2 were lower in the large mw ha system our simulations indicate that the large wm ha layer provided a stronger obstruction than the small mw ha layer to water transport at high ph owing to its denser structure further simulations in the small large mw ha system suggested that when the large mw ha was mixed with the small mw ha at low ph the isotropy of the cake layer structure was improved the obstruction by the layer was weakened the fraction of water channels in the small large mw ha system 19 1 was larger than those in the large mw ha system 15 3 fig 3b and the msd of the water molecules was improved by 31 8 fig 3c the transport coefficient of the water molecules also increased by 59 2 si table s2 because ha and sa were separately distributed in the cake layer ha top and bottom sa middle when ca2 was absent while they were uniformly distributed when ca2 was present because of ca2 bridging we further conducted md simulations of water molecule transport in the sa and ha sa ca2 i e ha and sa were mixed by ca2 bridging systems the initial md models are depicted in fig 3a where sa chains polymer consisting of alternating guluronate and mannuronate subunits stewart et al 2017 or ca2 bridged ha sa chains si figure s19 were mixed with water molecules of similar mass percentages 2 57 0 32 si table s2 notably the fraction of water channels in the sa system was the lowest which was 10 6 fig 3b the msd of water molecules was as low as 9 6 å during the 300 ps simulation fig 3c and the transport coefficient of water molecules was also the smallest i e 3 93 10 10 m2 s 1 si table s2 our simulations demonstrate that in the three layer sandwich like cake layer the sa layer plays a decisive role in restricting water transport however when the sa layer was mixed with the ha layer via ca2 an isotropic structure the ha sa ca2 system we observed a larger fraction of water channels 20 5 fig 3b the msd of water molecules reached 18 2 å fig 3c and the transport coefficient of water molecules was improved to 9 72 10 10 m2 s 1 si table s2 indicating a smaller restriction of water transport in the isotropic cake layer structure based on the simulated transport behavior of water molecules in different systems we proposed the distribution of water filtration resistance within different cake layer structures fig 3d for the three layer sandwich like cake layer at a high ph the filtration resistance in the sa layer was the highest followed by the large mw ha layer when the isotropy of the cake layer structure was improved at low ph two layer structure the obstruction in the mixed small large mw ha layer was weakened whereas a strong resistance in the sa layer remained when the isotropy of the cake layer structure was further improved in the presence of ca2 an isotropic structure the filtration resistance of the entire cake layer ha sa ca2 was low these simulation observations support our experimental findings which suggest that the rich water channels in the isotropic cake layer structure are more conducive to rapid water transport to investigate the overall process of water permeation through different cake layer structures we further conducted md simulations of water molecule transport from one surface of the cake layer to another for the initial md models fig 4a a three layer sandwich like cake layer was constructed using ha and sa chains ha top and bottom sa middle and the isotropic cake layer was constructed using ca2 bridged ha sa chains we placed cake layers on both sides and water molecules in the middle to ensure that the water molecules passed through the entire cake layer fig 4b shows that during the 60 ns simulation 37 water molecules passed through reaching the other surface of the cake layer the isotropic cake layer ha sa ca2 whereas only two water molecules passed through the three layer sandwich like cake layer ha sa in addition in comparison with the sandwich like cake layer the root mean square departure of the water molecule distribution in the isotropic cake layer was 5 9 higher at a 60 ns simulation time fig 4c indicating the stronger transport ability of water molecules that is the lower resistance of the isotropic foulant mixture ha sa ca2 toward water filtration compared with the segregated three layer arrangement of ha and sa we further visualized the permeation of water molecules through different cake layer structures notably none of the water molecules reached the other surface of the three layer sandwich like cake layer until a 50 ns simulation time fig 4d and si video s1 water channels connecting the two cake layer surfaces were not observed during the entire simulation in contrast water molecules exited from the other surface of the isotropic cake layer at a 20 ns simulation time and water channels were formed at a 40 ns simulation time fig 4e and si video s2 similar to our experimental findings our simulations indicate that improving the isotropy of the cake layer structure is beneficial for the optimization of water channels and the rapid transport of water 3 5 variation of cake layer structures formed by raw water to evaluate the practical value of our findings we conducted uf experiments using raw water collected from the beijing section of the south to north water diversion project china detailed characteristics are shown in si table s1 fig 5a shows that the cake layer formed by raw water at ph 7 was isotropic because of the bridging effect of ca2 ions between different nom molecules in raw water ca2 concentration 37 1 0 7 mg l hs proteins and polysaccharides were uniformly distributed in the cake layer which is consistent with our above observations fig 2a to validate the effect of ca2 we further performed uf experiments using raw water with ca2 removed at ph 7 the procedure for removing ca2 adding na2co3 is provided in si methods s1 and the resulting detailed water characteristics are shown in si table s1 interestingly the isotropic cake layer shifted to a two layer structure in the absence of ca2 fig 5b protein molecules were encapsulated by hs molecules and large aggregates were formed tomaszewski et al 2011 which was similar with that in synthetic solution of ha bsa mixture consequently large hs protein aggregates were preferentially deposited onto the membrane leading to the distribution at the bottom of the cake layer because polysaccharide molecules have negligible interaction with hs molecules similar with that in synthetic solution of ha sa mixture polysaccharides were separately deposited and distributed at the top of the cake layer moreover corresponding to the decline in isotropy of the cake layer structure the final membrane specific flux after 3 h and the cake layer resistance induced by raw water with ca2 removed were 17 9 lower and 50 8 higher than those induced by raw water respectively fig 5c these results suggest that the isotropic cake layer structure is more likely to develop rich water channels and rapid water transport this is in agreement with our above findings for model foulants fig 2b fig 5d shows a visual illustration of these variations to support our inference we conducted uf experiments at ph 5 using raw water and raw water with ca2 removed similar to our observations at ph 7 the cake layer formed by raw water was isotropic si figure s20a and the cake layer formed by raw water with ca2 removed had a two layer structure si figure s20b in addition the final membrane specific flux after 3 h caused by the raw water was 13 7 higher than that caused by raw water with ca2 removed fig 5c and the cake layer resistance was 38 2 lower our results support the inferred structure property relationship fig 2b suggesting that the increase in cake layer structure isotropy leads to the enhancement of fractions of water channels and the improvement of water transport within the cake layer because of the introduction of na during the ca2 removal process adding na2co3 we further utilized raw water with na added nacl na concentration was the same as that in raw water with ca2 removed as uf feed water at ph 7 to evaluate the predominant role of ca2 notably the cake layer remained isotropic when additional na was present si figure s20c demonstrating that ca2 was the key factor inducing variations in the cake layer structure corresponding to the identical cake layer structures the difference in the final membrane specific fluxes after 3 h between raw water and raw water with na added was negligible 1 3 fig 5c and the difference in cake layer resistances was as low as 8 3 our findings demonstrate that ca2 plays a dominant role in affecting the variation of the cake layer structure and ph plays a secondary role along with an almost negligible effect of na although cake layer 3d structures formed by raw water were coincident with those formed by synthetic solutions to some extent in this work actual surface water is various and complex the cake layer 3d structures formed by raw water are probably different with those formed by synthetic solutions consequently the analysis of cake layers formed by various raw water is worth conducting in further work to comprehensively investigate cake layer 3d structures 4 conclusion the variation of cake layer 3d structures induced by key water quality factors ph na ca2 was investigated and the influence on water channels and water transport within cake layers was clarified the three layer sandwich like cake layer was transformed to an isotropic structure in the presence of ca2 owing to its bridging effect the cake layer structures also varied when the ph was decreased whereas few changes were observed in the presence of na the significance of water quality factors can be ranked in the following order ca2 ph na and ca2 should be given more attention in uf more importantly the variation in the cake layer 3d structure plays a dominant role in determining the water transport efficiency in the three layer sandwich like cake layer the sa layer made a major contribution to the restriction of water transport followed by the large mw ha layer compared to the sandwich like cake layer the isotropic cake layer had a higher free volume voids fraction and richer water channels leading to faster water transport larger water flux and higher water production efficiency these findings suggest that improving the isotropy of the cake layer 3d structure contributes to optimized water channels and enhanced water transport within the cake layer this should inspire the development of tailored regulation strategies for cake layers to improve the uf efficiency for water purification and it can also be used as a reference

14673,the three dimensional 3d structure of the cake layer which could be influenced by water quality factors plays a significant role in the ultrafiltration uf efficiency of water purification however it remains challenging to precisely reveal the variation of cake layer 3d structures and water channel characteristics herein we systematically report the variation in the cake layer 3d structure at the nanoscale induced by key water quality factors and reveal its influence on water transport in particular the abundance of water channels within the cake layer in comparison with ph and na ca2 played more significant role in determining cake layer structures the sandwich like cake layer which was induced by the asynchronous deposition of humic acids and sodium alginate sa shifted to an isotropic structure when ca2 was present due to the ca2 bridging in comparison with the sandwich like structure the isotropic cake layer has higher fractions of free volume voids and more water channels leading to a 147 improvement in the water transport coefficient 60 reduction in the cake layer resistance and 21 increase in the final membrane specific flux our work elucidates a structure property relationship where improving the isotropy of the cake layer 3d structure is conducive to the optimization of water channels and water transport within cake layers this could inspire tailored regulation strategies for cake layers to enhance the uf efficiency of water purification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water ultrafiltration cake layer 3d structure water channel fouling behavior 1 introduction to solve the global challenge of clean water shortages culp et al 2021 kim et al 2010 mauter et al 2018 shannon et al 2008 ultrafiltration uf has received increasing attention owing to its high permeate quality and low energy consumption alvarez et al 2018 werber et al 2016 the global uf market reached 887 million euro eur in 2017 and it is expected to reach 2 billion eur in 2023 aani et al 2020 however membrane fouling substantially restricts uf applications park et al 2017 wood et al 2016 the membrane lifetime is reduced to about one third because of membrane fouling leading to a triplication of membrane replacement cost flemming 2020 the formation of cake layers which are mainly composed of natural organic matter nom dramatically decreases uf efficiency during drinking water treatment zhang et al 2013 and it is the predominant reason for membrane fouling during long term operation although multiple approaches e g coagulation and oxidation have been applied to regulate cake layers ajmani et al 2012 ang et al 2011 cheng et al 2018 lee et al 2015 malczewska and benjamin 2016 peleato et al 2017 zhou and meng 2016 cake layer formation is inevitable over time choi and dempsey 2004 resosudarmo et al 2013 the three dimensional 3d structure of a cake layer plays a significant role in the water transport within the cake layer and is crucial for the related uf water flux the 3d distribution of functional groups influences water transport because of their distinct interactions with water molecules additionally the 3d distribution of matter density can also influence water transport which has been reported for desalination membranes culp et al 2021 therefore to enhance the efficiency of uf for water production a comprehensive understanding of the 3d structure of a cake layer and its influence on water channel characteristics and water transport behavior within the cake layer is necessary lu et al 2021 nevertheless obtaining in depth insights into the 3d structure of a cake layer remains challenging correspondingly the water channels and water transport within such cake layers are also unclear resulting in a lack of a theoretical basis for the precise regulation of the cake layer typical water quality factors e g ph and concentration of specific ions influence the 3d structure of a cake layer by affecting the properties of organic foulants and their interactions lee et al 2017 wang and tang 2011 leading to variations in the water transport efficiency the water quality factors of source water are complex and vary with season in practical drinking water treatments childress and elimelech 1996 in previous studies the effects of water quality factors on cake layer fouling during uf based water purification remained unclear to a certain extent for instance increased ph has been observed to reduce cake layer fouling in certain cases lee et al 2017 lin et al 2015 whereas the reduction of cake layer resistance was observed when decreasing ph in other cases neemann et al 2013 the presence of cations was reported to aggravate cake layer fouling lee et al 2017 wang et al 2015 whereas low packing density of cake layers i e fouling alleviation was observed when ca2 was present in other studies wu et al 2014 owing to the limited understanding of the variation in the precise 3d structure of a cake layer the mechanisms underlying the influence of water quality factors on uf membrane fouling remain unclear traditional characterization approaches for cake layers fail to analyze their precise 3d structures particularly in depth with a high resolution at the nanoscale chen et al 2018 with optical coherence tomography dreszer et al 2014 scanning electron microscopy sem ajmani et al 2012 and atomic force microscopy wang et al 2013 it is difficult to discriminate organic foulants within the cake layers spectroscopic techniques such as infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy wang et al 2015 raman spectroscopy virtanen et al 2017 and front face excitation emission matrix spectroscopy yu et al 2019 can be used to identify different foulants however they lack the capacity to provide depth profiling of the cake layer confocal laser scanning microscopy depth resolution several hundred nanometers lin et al 2019 marroquin et al 2014 and stimulated raman scattering microscopy depth resolution several micrometers chen et al 2017 fail to explore precise 3d structures at the nanoscale because of their low depth resolution in our previous study wu et al 2021 we demonstrated that time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims was appropriate for precisely analyzing the 3d structure of a cake layer owing to its nanoscale depth resolution 5 nm and applicability for organic matter bruycker et al 2020 ievlev et al 2019 quilettes et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the depth distributions of different foulants in the cake layer can be obtained simultaneously through moderate layer by layer etching furthermore the lateral distributions resolution 5 μm can be obtained by scanning the x y plane between two etching steps in this study we applied tof sims to reveal the variation in the cake layer 3d structure at the nanoscale induced by key water quality factors i e ph na and ca2 based on their content range in natural surface water li et al 2009 moreover we conducted molecular dynamics md simulations to elucidate the influence of the cake layer 3d structure on water channel characteristics and water transport behavior humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa and sodium alginate sa which are commonly considered representations of humic substances hs proteins and polysaccharides wang et al 2013 respectively were used as model foulants to investigate cake layers formed by nom contreras et al 2011 the investigation was also applicable to cake layers formed by extracellular polymeric substances eps because proteins and polysaccharides are also major components of eps hao et al 2013 during uf cake layers were formed by binary foulant mixtures to simulate different source waters and raw water obtained from the beijing section of the south to north water diversion project china analyzing the water channel characteristics water transport behavior and related uf water fluxes within cake layers of different 3d structures elucidated the structure property relationship between the cake layer structure and uf efficiency for purified water production 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the information of chemicals uf membranes and raw water is shown in supporting information si method s1 the detailed procedure for ca2 removal from raw water is described in si method s2 the specific characteristics of the raw water and raw water with ca2 removed are listed in si table s1 2 2 uf experiments the 300 ml solutions of ha sa ha bsa or bsa sa mixtures were filtered the detailed procedures are shown in si method s3 the absolute membrane flux jt as a function of filtration time was recorded using a balance with a data logger ar2202cn ohaus nj usa and the membrane specific flux jt j0 was calculated where j0 was the initial absolute membrane flux for uf experiments with raw water 1 l of raw water or raw water with ca2 removed were filtered other procedures were the same as described above after the uf experiments the fouled membranes were naturally dried and stored in petri dishes for subsequent tof sims analysis 2 3 tof sims depth profiling the depth profiles of the cake layers were determined by tof sims v ion tof gmbh münster germany the detailed procedure of depth profiling is shown in si method s4 the intensities of the representative secondary ions were normalized to the total ion intensity and the normalized intensities as a function of sputter time were plotted as depth profiles the corresponding 3d images of the cake layer structures were reconstructed from the depth profile data data acquisition data processing and data analysis were performed using surfacelab 7 ion tof gmbh 2 4 md simulations md simulations of water transport in the small mw ha large mw ha small large mw ha sa and ha sa ca2 systems were performed using material studio and the compass ii force field was used sun 1998 moreover md simulations of water permeation through the three layer sandwich like cake layer and isotropic cake layer were conducted using gromacs 2018 the visualization was achieved using visual molecular dynamics humphrey et al 1996 the detailed procedures of md simulation are presented in si method s5 2 5 other measurements all measurements were repeated three times and the detailed measurement methods are described in si method s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation in cake layer structures and water transport induced by ph based on the predetermined representative secondary ions of each foulant and the uf membrane si figure s1 wu et al 2021 we found that the variation in cake layer structures was negligible under high ph conditions fig 1a and si figures s2 s3 and s4 the cake layer formed by the ha sa mixture was sandwich like a three layer structure ha at the top and bottom sa in the middle at both ph 7 and 9 owing to the limited interaction between the different foulants si figure s5 and their asynchronous deposition on the membrane wu et al 2021 in addition the cake layer formed by the ha bsa or bsa sa mixtures was always isotropic because of the aggregation of ha and bsa si figure s6 or the miscibility of bsa and sa si figure s7 see the detailed discussion in si text s1 guan et al 2018 kruif et al 2004 myat et al 2014 corresponding to the negligible variation in the cake layer structure we measured the membrane specific fluxes the ratio of the absolute flux at time t to the initial absolute flux jt j0 the initial absolute fluxes are provided in si text s2 similar final membrane specific fluxes after 60 min the same below unless specified were observed the values were 0 67 at ph 7 and 0 66 at ph 9 for ha sa 7 1 mass ratio the same below fig 1b and si figure s8 the uf flux reduction was mostly contributed by cake layers in this work because the average proportion of the cake layer resistance in the total membrane fouling resistance was as high as 96 2 2 7 the difference in the cake layer resistances at ph 7 2 58 0 33 1012 m 1 for ha sa 7 1 and ph 9 2 65 0 24 1012 m 1 for ha sa 7 1 was also negligible our observations indicate that the water channel characteristics and water transport behavior within a similar cake layer structure were identical however we further observed variations in the 3d structure of the cake layer under low ph conditions the three layer sandwich like cake layer induced by the ha sa mixture shifted to a two layer structure at ph 5 fig 1a and si figure s2 the zeta potential of uf membrane surface was 12 7 2 5 mv at ph 7 and 9 1 1 6 mv at ph 5 the zeta potential of ha was 36 6 1 1 mv at ph 7 and 30 6 2 3 mv at ph 5 the negative charges carried by uf membrane surface and ha molecules were all reduced when ph decreased as a result the electrostatic repulsion between uf membrane surface and ha became slighter under lower ph condition additionally the solubility of ha was sharply reduced under lower ph condition childress and elimelech 1996 jucker and clark 1994 hence ha molecules were more easily precipitated and deposited onto the membrane surface under lower ph condition leading to the distribution at the bottom of the cake layer corresponding to the improvement in isotropy of the cake layer structure we observed an increase in the final membrane specific fluxes by 19 4 for ha sa 7 1 and a reduction in the cake layer resistances by 46 1 for ha sa 7 1 at ph 5 fig 1b and si figures s8a and s8b which demonstrates the enhancement of water channel formation and water transport within the cake layers a visualization of the above variations is shown in fig 1c for the ha bsa mixture the aggregation and encapsulation of bsa molecules by ha molecules were reduced at low ph conditions which was confirmed by further analysis where individual bsa molecules emerged at ph 5 si figure s6 ha bsa aggregates were preferentially deposited on the membrane surface and individual bsa molecules accumulated on the top of the cake layer thus the isotropic cake layer shifted to a two layer structure at ph 5 si figure s3 owing to the stronger fouling potential of individual bsa molecules in the two layer cake layer wu et al 2021 the final membrane specific fluxes decreased by 49 4 for ha bsa 1 3 and the cake layer resistances increased by 85 4 for ha bsa 1 3 at ph 5 si figures s8c and s8d therefore we infer that corresponding to the reduction in isotropy of the cake layer structure the free volume voids fraction and its connectivity within the cake layers were reduced leading to a decline in water channel abundance and water transport the isotropic cake layer induced by the bsa sa mixture at a higher ph value also developed into a two layer structure at ph 5 si figure s4 bsa was mainly distributed at the bottom whereas sa was observed in the entire cake layer predominantly at the top in contrast to the simple co solubility at ph 7 the bsa and sa molecules aggregated at ph 5 si figure s7 in addition the mass ratio of bsa to sa in the aggregates was high neemann et al 2013 indicating the presence of individual sa molecules bsa sa aggregates were preferentially deposited on the membrane and individual sa molecules accumulated on the top of the cake layer although the isotropy of the cake layer structure was reduced large aggregates emerged leading to an increase in membrane specific fluxes at ph 5 si figures s8e and s8f 3 2 cake layer structures and water transport in the presence of na in comparison to ph ions in water are also significant factors affecting uf efficiency miao et al 2017 sodium ions are the most common ions in surface water sources thus we investigated the cake layer structures under different na concentrations based on its actual concentration range in natural surface water 0 06 345 mg l meybeck and helmer 1989 we found that a negligible change in the cake layer structure was induced by na regardless of the nom mixture similar to the case in the absence of na the cake layer structure formed by the ha sa mixture remained sandwich like in the presence of 20 mm na si figure s9 and that formed by the ha bsa or bsa sa mixtures remained isotropic si figure s10 the potential reason for the negligible variation is that na ions cannot participate in foulant interactions and the aggregation behavior between different foulants is barely influenced by na to support our hypothesis we conducted a gel permeation chromatography analysis si figures s11a and s11b show that no new peak was observed when sa coexisted with ha or bsa indicating that no aggregation occurred for a ha sa mixture or bsa sa mixture regardless of the na concentration in addition when ha and bsa coexisted a new response in the larger molecular weight mw region emerged in both the absence and presence of na si figure s11c which demonstrates that na did not influence the encapsulation of bsa molecules by ha molecules myat et al 2014 and the formation of ha bsa aggregates owing to the similarity in the cake layer structure we observed a negligible difference in the final membrane specific fluxes for the ha bsa mixture when the na concentration increased 3 8 for ha bsa 3 1 20 mm na si figure s12 moreover for the ha sa or bsa sa mixtures sa molecules were less negatively charged when na was present si figure s13 leading to reduced electrostatic repulsion between sa molecules and the membrane surface membrane specific fluxes decreased with increasing na concentration however because of the limited change in the cake layer structure the decline in final membrane specific fluxes was relatively low by 8 1 for ha sa 3 1 and 9 4 for bsa sa 3 1 20 mm na si figures s14 and s15 our findings suggest similar water channel characteristics and water transport efficiency in similar cake layer structures under different na concentrations 3 3 isotropic cake layer structure and fast water transport induced by ca2 calcium ions can combine with organic matter and play a major role in uf membrane fouling zhang et al 2018 therefore we investigated the variation in the cake layer structure induced by ca2 notably the cake layers were all isotropic in the presence of ca2 regardless of the nom mixture fig 2a and si figure s16 ca2 ions can bind to the oxygen atoms of carboxylates in a highly ordered manner and act as bridges between the different nom molecules liu et al 2016 based on the ca2 bridges aggregation between different nom molecules occurs and an egg box shaped network is formed zhang et al 2018 under uf conditions different nom molecules were synchronously deposited on the membrane surface in the form of aggregates thus in addition to the isotropic cake layers formed by the ha bsa or bsa sa mixtures the three layer sandwich like cake layer ha top and bottom sa middle formed by the ha sa mixture also shifted to an isotropic structure when ca2 was present both ha and sa were uniformly distributed within the cake layer to investigate the variation in water channels and water transport along with the increase in isotropy of the cake layer structure fig 2b we measured membrane specific fluxes under different ca2 concentrations fig 2c and si figure s17 show that the membrane specific fluxes increased when ca2 was present the final membrane specific flux for ha sa 7 1 increased by 20 9 in the presence of 1 mm ca2 and the cake layer resistance decreased by 59 7 when ca2 was present the porosity of cake layer increased from 1 1 to 7 6 for the ha sa mixture fig 2d from 1 7 to 5 1 for the ha bsa mixture figure s18a and from 0 4 to 3 6 for the bsa sa mixture figure s18b as a results looser and more porous cake layers were formed when ca2 was present owing to the formation of larger aggregates moreover we note that the increase in membrane specific fluxes was larger when the proportion of sa was higher and that of bsa was lower by 47 8 for bsa sa 1 3 and 7 8 for bsa sa 3 1 the potential cause was that a regular and highly ordered network was more easily formed by sa molecules with a molecular conformation of chains compared with bsa molecules with a molecular conformation of spheres zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 based on our observations we propose an inferred structure property relationship where along with the increase in the isotropy of the cake layer structure the fraction of water channels within the cake layer was enhanced see section 3 4 for quantitative details and the efficiency of water transport was therefore improved in comparison to the reduction of negative charges carried by nom molecules indicating reduced electrostatic repulsion between nom molecules and the membrane surface si figure s13 the variation in the cake layer structures plays a predominant role in water transport 3 4 computational investigation of water transport within different cake layers to investigate the variation in water transport within different cake layer structures and related mechanisms we conducted md simulations for cake layers formed by ha sa mixtures because their structures were representative the actual uf process where the formation of a cake layer by foulant precipitation from feed water and the filtration of water through the cake layer occur simultaneously is difficult to accurately model and simulate therefore we simplified it to a process of water molecule transport within an already formed cake layer structure based on our previous study small and large mw ha were separately distributed within the cake layer at high ph value wu et al 2021 however they were mixed within the cake layer at low ph value see section 3 1 consequently we conducted md simulations for water molecule transport in the small mw ha large mw ha and small large mw ha i e small and large mw ha were mixed systems initial md models of different systems were constructed by mixing different mw ha chains temple northeastern birmingham model molecule and its pentamer davies et al 1997 with water molecules of similar mass percentages 2 57 0 32 si table s2 as shown in fig 3a fig 3b shows the free volume voids in the different systems during the water transport simulation the connected free volume constituted the water channels which play a decisive role in the efficiency of water transport the fraction of water channels in the large mw ha system were determined to be 65 6 lower than those in the small mw ha system fig 3b in addition in comparison with the small mw ha system 30 8 å and 1 38 10 9 m2 s 1 the mean square displacement msd of water molecules during the 300 ps simulation 11 5 å fig 3c and the transport coefficient of water molecules 5 17 10 10 m2 s 1 si table s2 were lower in the large mw ha system our simulations indicate that the large wm ha layer provided a stronger obstruction than the small mw ha layer to water transport at high ph owing to its denser structure further simulations in the small large mw ha system suggested that when the large mw ha was mixed with the small mw ha at low ph the isotropy of the cake layer structure was improved the obstruction by the layer was weakened the fraction of water channels in the small large mw ha system 19 1 was larger than those in the large mw ha system 15 3 fig 3b and the msd of the water molecules was improved by 31 8 fig 3c the transport coefficient of the water molecules also increased by 59 2 si table s2 because ha and sa were separately distributed in the cake layer ha top and bottom sa middle when ca2 was absent while they were uniformly distributed when ca2 was present because of ca2 bridging we further conducted md simulations of water molecule transport in the sa and ha sa ca2 i e ha and sa were mixed by ca2 bridging systems the initial md models are depicted in fig 3a where sa chains polymer consisting of alternating guluronate and mannuronate subunits stewart et al 2017 or ca2 bridged ha sa chains si figure s19 were mixed with water molecules of similar mass percentages 2 57 0 32 si table s2 notably the fraction of water channels in the sa system was the lowest which was 10 6 fig 3b the msd of water molecules was as low as 9 6 å during the 300 ps simulation fig 3c and the transport coefficient of water molecules was also the smallest i e 3 93 10 10 m2 s 1 si table s2 our simulations demonstrate that in the three layer sandwich like cake layer the sa layer plays a decisive role in restricting water transport however when the sa layer was mixed with the ha layer via ca2 an isotropic structure the ha sa ca2 system we observed a larger fraction of water channels 20 5 fig 3b the msd of water molecules reached 18 2 å fig 3c and the transport coefficient of water molecules was improved to 9 72 10 10 m2 s 1 si table s2 indicating a smaller restriction of water transport in the isotropic cake layer structure based on the simulated transport behavior of water molecules in different systems we proposed the distribution of water filtration resistance within different cake layer structures fig 3d for the three layer sandwich like cake layer at a high ph the filtration resistance in the sa layer was the highest followed by the large mw ha layer when the isotropy of the cake layer structure was improved at low ph two layer structure the obstruction in the mixed small large mw ha layer was weakened whereas a strong resistance in the sa layer remained when the isotropy of the cake layer structure was further improved in the presence of ca2 an isotropic structure the filtration resistance of the entire cake layer ha sa ca2 was low these simulation observations support our experimental findings which suggest that the rich water channels in the isotropic cake layer structure are more conducive to rapid water transport to investigate the overall process of water permeation through different cake layer structures we further conducted md simulations of water molecule transport from one surface of the cake layer to another for the initial md models fig 4a a three layer sandwich like cake layer was constructed using ha and sa chains ha top and bottom sa middle and the isotropic cake layer was constructed using ca2 bridged ha sa chains we placed cake layers on both sides and water molecules in the middle to ensure that the water molecules passed through the entire cake layer fig 4b shows that during the 60 ns simulation 37 water molecules passed through reaching the other surface of the cake layer the isotropic cake layer ha sa ca2 whereas only two water molecules passed through the three layer sandwich like cake layer ha sa in addition in comparison with the sandwich like cake layer the root mean square departure of the water molecule distribution in the isotropic cake layer was 5 9 higher at a 60 ns simulation time fig 4c indicating the stronger transport ability of water molecules that is the lower resistance of the isotropic foulant mixture ha sa ca2 toward water filtration compared with the segregated three layer arrangement of ha and sa we further visualized the permeation of water molecules through different cake layer structures notably none of the water molecules reached the other surface of the three layer sandwich like cake layer until a 50 ns simulation time fig 4d and si video s1 water channels connecting the two cake layer surfaces were not observed during the entire simulation in contrast water molecules exited from the other surface of the isotropic cake layer at a 20 ns simulation time and water channels were formed at a 40 ns simulation time fig 4e and si video s2 similar to our experimental findings our simulations indicate that improving the isotropy of the cake layer structure is beneficial for the optimization of water channels and the rapid transport of water 3 5 variation of cake layer structures formed by raw water to evaluate the practical value of our findings we conducted uf experiments using raw water collected from the beijing section of the south to north water diversion project china detailed characteristics are shown in si table s1 fig 5a shows that the cake layer formed by raw water at ph 7 was isotropic because of the bridging effect of ca2 ions between different nom molecules in raw water ca2 concentration 37 1 0 7 mg l hs proteins and polysaccharides were uniformly distributed in the cake layer which is consistent with our above observations fig 2a to validate the effect of ca2 we further performed uf experiments using raw water with ca2 removed at ph 7 the procedure for removing ca2 adding na2co3 is provided in si methods s1 and the resulting detailed water characteristics are shown in si table s1 interestingly the isotropic cake layer shifted to a two layer structure in the absence of ca2 fig 5b protein molecules were encapsulated by hs molecules and large aggregates were formed tomaszewski et al 2011 which was similar with that in synthetic solution of ha bsa mixture consequently large hs protein aggregates were preferentially deposited onto the membrane leading to the distribution at the bottom of the cake layer because polysaccharide molecules have negligible interaction with hs molecules similar with that in synthetic solution of ha sa mixture polysaccharides were separately deposited and distributed at the top of the cake layer moreover corresponding to the decline in isotropy of the cake layer structure the final membrane specific flux after 3 h and the cake layer resistance induced by raw water with ca2 removed were 17 9 lower and 50 8 higher than those induced by raw water respectively fig 5c these results suggest that the isotropic cake layer structure is more likely to develop rich water channels and rapid water transport this is in agreement with our above findings for model foulants fig 2b fig 5d shows a visual illustration of these variations to support our inference we conducted uf experiments at ph 5 using raw water and raw water with ca2 removed similar to our observations at ph 7 the cake layer formed by raw water was isotropic si figure s20a and the cake layer formed by raw water with ca2 removed had a two layer structure si figure s20b in addition the final membrane specific flux after 3 h caused by the raw water was 13 7 higher than that caused by raw water with ca2 removed fig 5c and the cake layer resistance was 38 2 lower our results support the inferred structure property relationship fig 2b suggesting that the increase in cake layer structure isotropy leads to the enhancement of fractions of water channels and the improvement of water transport within the cake layer because of the introduction of na during the ca2 removal process adding na2co3 we further utilized raw water with na added nacl na concentration was the same as that in raw water with ca2 removed as uf feed water at ph 7 to evaluate the predominant role of ca2 notably the cake layer remained isotropic when additional na was present si figure s20c demonstrating that ca2 was the key factor inducing variations in the cake layer structure corresponding to the identical cake layer structures the difference in the final membrane specific fluxes after 3 h between raw water and raw water with na added was negligible 1 3 fig 5c and the difference in cake layer resistances was as low as 8 3 our findings demonstrate that ca2 plays a dominant role in affecting the variation of the cake layer structure and ph plays a secondary role along with an almost negligible effect of na although cake layer 3d structures formed by raw water were coincident with those formed by synthetic solutions to some extent in this work actual surface water is various and complex the cake layer 3d structures formed by raw water are probably different with those formed by synthetic solutions consequently the analysis of cake layers formed by various raw water is worth conducting in further work to comprehensively investigate cake layer 3d structures 4 conclusion the variation of cake layer 3d structures induced by key water quality factors ph na ca2 was investigated and the influence on water channels and water transport within cake layers was clarified the three layer sandwich like cake layer was transformed to an isotropic structure in the presence of ca2 owing to its bridging effect the cake layer structures also varied when the ph was decreased whereas few changes were observed in the presence of na the significance of water quality factors can be ranked in the following order ca2 ph na and ca2 should be given more attention in uf more importantly the variation in the cake layer 3d structure plays a dominant role in determining the water transport efficiency in the three layer sandwich like cake layer the sa layer made a major contribution to the restriction of water transport followed by the large mw ha layer compared to the sandwich like cake layer the isotropic cake layer had a higher free volume voids fraction and richer water channels leading to faster water transport larger water flux and higher water production efficiency these findings suggest that improving the isotropy of the cake layer 3d structure contributes to optimized water channels and enhanced water transport within the cake layer this should inspire the development of tailored regulation strategies for cake layers to improve the uf efficiency for water purification and it can also be used as a reference

14674,heavy metal contamination of waste activated sludge was is a key factor limiting the land application of sludge for nutrients recovery this study proposes a novel free nitrous acid fna assisted asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry fna aace process to achieve high efficiency decontamination of multi heavy metals cd pb and fe in was the optimal operating conditions the heavy metal removal performance of fna aace and the related mechanisms for maintaining the high performance were systematically investigated during the fna aace process fna treatment was optimal with an exposure time of 13 h at a ph of 2 9 and an fna concentration of 0 6 mg g tss then the sludge was washed with edta in a recirculating leaching system under asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry aace the 6 h working and the following electrode cleaning were defined as a working circle of aace after three cycles of working cleaning periods in aace treatment the cumulative removal efficiency of the toxic metals cd and pb reached over 97 and 93 respectively whilst that of fe was greater than 65 this surpasses most previously reported efficiencies and possesses a shorter treatment duration and sustainable edta circulation the mechanism analysis suggested that fna pretreatment provoked the migration of heavy metals for leaching enhancement as well as reduced the demand for edta eluent concentration and increased conductivity which can improve the aace efficiency meanwhile the aace process absorbed the anionic chelates of heavy metals and reduced them to zero valent particles on the electrode regenerating the edta eluent and maintaining its high extraction efficiency for heavy metals in addition fna aace could provide different electric field operation modes allowing it to have flexibility for the real application processes this proposed process is expected to be coupled with anaerobic digestion in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for high efficiency of heavy metal decontamination sludge reduction and resource energy recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular polymeric substances eps toxic metals alternating current ac field edta circulating leaching data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land application is one of the sustainable disposal routes of waste activated sludge was which can recover nitrogen phosphate and other micronutrients ding et al 2021 tang et al 2022 and has been generally used in the us and europe because of its low cost badgett and milbrandt 2020 abdulsada et al 2021 due to the abundant nutrients in was the fertilizer product from sludge can not only ameliorate the soil structure but also increase the soil nutrient content lloret et al 2016 however one of the unwanted effects that challenge its application is the heavy metals pollution in sludge wang et al 2022 in previous reports heavy metals such as cd cr cu hg ni and pb accounted for nearly 0 5 2 of the dry weight basis of was in some cases their proportions even reached 4 babel and dacera 2006 yang et al 2020 during land application heavy metals present in was are typically highly toxic or carcinogenic even at trace concentrations and can accumulate in biomass causing severe environmental pollution and human health risk zhou et al 2022 electrochemical processes such as electrokinetic process have attracted considerable attention for the removal of heavy metals from was owing to their modularity selectivity and low secondary pollution zeng et al 2022 liu et al 2019 generally this technology can remove heavy metals by inserting electrode arrays into the sludge and then applying a direct current dc electric field to migrate heavy metal species to the negative electrode through electroosmosis electromigration and electrodeposition fu et al 2017 geng et al 2020 to further improve the removal efficiency chemical leaching is usually used alongside electrochemistry to enhance the mobility of the heavy metals to the electrode and increase the conductivity chen et al 2021 wang et al 2022 however the efficiency of the dc process remains unsatisfactory owing to several factors one of which is the coulomb repulsion between the incoming ions and the adsorbed charged ions which makes the active sites ineffective another factor is the competition between heavy metal ions and other cations additionally unnecessary energy loss is caused by water splitting on the electrode surface due to the concentration polarization liu et al 2017 2019 recently an asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry aace concept may have the potential to circumvent the problems mentioned above and has been used instead of the dc process in the remediation of heavy metal polluted soil xu et al 2019 in aace the recirculating chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta extracts heavy metals and transports them to an amidoxime modified porous carbon ami pc electrode providing strong chelation sites and hydrophilicity to preferably compete for heavy metals with edta an asymmetrical alternating voltage is applied to the electrode when a positive bias is operated the ions in the electrolyte migrated to the ami pc electrode and established an electrical double layer while when the bias is reversed heavy metal cations are reduced to zero valent particles and fixed on the electrode surface resulting in the removal of heavy metals and the regeneration of edta this concept could fully utilize the active sites on the electrode surface relieve water splitting ensure the sustainable use of edta and achieved high removal efficiencies and fast kinetics in soil xu et al 2019 thus this method may act as a reference for improving was heavy metal decontamination although there are few related studies until now moreover compared to polluted soil was contains more organics and possesses a complex gel like structure which has a combined feature of colloidal gel and hydrogel in the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps dursun 2007 eps is considered the key domicile for heavy metals in was in previous studies several groups such as amino and carboxyl in eps were observed to have the robust binding abilities for heavy metal ions yu 2020 furthermore some of the absorbed metal ions transformed to other specific chemical forms under the eps mediated oxidation reduction and may form complex minerals kang et al 2017 which could cause further uptake of heavy metals mikutta et al 2012 due to the complex heavy metals eps interactions the cross linking of eps molecules may occur yielding large molecular eps chains with compact structures and small pore size in the matrix resulting in the retaining and preservation of heavy metals yu 2020 peng et al 2023 hindering the extraction efficiency of heavy metals by washing with chelating agent and adversely affecting the migration and solubility of heavy metals ren et al 2015 tang et al 2018 therefore these characteristics of was may challenge the high efficiencies and fast kinetics of the aace system reported in soil moreover the presence of eps and complex interactions with heavy metals may result in long washing times and high chelator concentrations for satisfactory extraction efficiency of heavy metals in the electrochemical system this may challenge the sustainability of edta in the aace process owing to the high concentration of edta could suppress the metal electrodeposition and reduction chen et al 2021 and then hinder the regeneration of edta in aace thus the aace system procedure should be further modified to match the feature of was particularly the complex interactions between eps and heavy metals this study developed a novel free nitrous acid fna assisted asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry fna aace to achieve high efficiency decontamination of multi heavy metals in was it has been reported that fna was effective in the breakdown of the macromolecules and ring structures thus causing the breaking of eps metal interactions and enhancing the release of heavy metals from was du et al 2015 furthermore fna can be able to passively pass through cell membranes and increase the proton permeability of membranes duan et al 2020 which likely contributed to enhancing the mobility of heavy metals to the outer layer of eps therefore in this study fna was designed to alleviate the contradiction between the high concentration of edta required for satisfactory leaching efficiency and the desired high electrochemical efficiency in aace the chelating reagent edta was employed as a carrier to transport the heavy metals to the amidoxime functionalized electrode driven by a circulating pump instead of the conventional electromigration or electroosmosis the reduction of heavy metals occurred at the electrode under aace with the regeneration of edta for recycling two different aace operation modes were compared in this study and their corresponding heavy metals decontamination performance was systematically evaluated the objectives of this study were to a investigate the feasibility of fna aace for high efficiency decontamination of heavy metals in was and b reveal the corresponding mechanisms of fna aace 2 materials and methods 2 1 was samples was samples were collected from a secondary sedimentation tank at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in hebei province china this wwtp treats 120 000 m3 of municipal sewage and industrial wastewater from steel mills and power plants daily using an anaerobic anoxic oxic process the obtained was samples were transferred immediately to the laboratory within 6 h then concentrated by setting 4 h and stored at 4 c before use zhang et al 2022 table 1 lists the main characteristics and heavy metal contents in these was samples due to the unstable property was collected from the wwtp can only be stored for a week at one time therefore we used different was samples collected at different times during this study and each sample corresponded to a section of the experiments sample 1 was used in the optimization experiments of the fna aace process samples 2 3 and 4 were utilized in the experiments about performance testing and mechanisms investigation for the fna aace process 2 2 experimental procedure the main experimental procedure consists of two successive stages namely fna pretreatment and aace treatment fig 1a 1 fna pretreatment stage the batch experiments were performed at 22 1 in an incubator shaker at 135 rpm first different volumes of nitrite stock solution 2 g nano2 l were injected into several 500 ml beakers containing 250 ml was to achieve the targeted nitrite concentration the ph with range of 1 05 4 75 was manually controlled by adding 1 0 m hcl the fna concentration was calculated using the following equation 1 c f n a c n o 2 n e 2300 273 t 1 0 p h where c n o 2 n is nitrite concentration t is temperature thus concentration range of generated fna was 0 06 mg g tss 1 14 mg g tss in this study further 40 mm l edta disodium salt solution was cyclically infused by a pump to wash through the fna pretreated was for 24 h the ratio of edta to the dry solid was 3 2 mm g the heavy metal concentration in edta eluent without an asymmetrical alternating current field was measured to further evaluate the fna pretreatment effect response surface methodology rsm was used to optimize fna pretreatment parameters with a central composite design ccd 2 aace treatment stage 50 ml fna pretreated was with the concentration listed in table 1 was transferred to an aace unit and then 40 mm l edta disodium salt solution was cyclically infused by a pump to wash through the was at room temperature the ratio of edta to the dry solid was 3 2 mm g during washing as indicated in fig 1a the aace reduction unit was made of plexiglass with a sludge tank and an aace filtration chamber and their volumes were 60 mm 40 mm 25 mm and 60 mm 40 mm 60 mm respectively two pieces of nylon filter membrane 5 μm aperture were put on each side of the sludge tank to prevent sludge particles from being washed out the aace filtration chamber was put at the end of the aace unit and two self made amidoxime modified porous carbon ami pc electrodes liu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 were placed in parallel at an interval of 1 5 cm and connected to a power supply an asymmetrical alternating current was generated by the waveform generator rigol dg1022u as shown in fig 1b different voltages alternating between negative and positive with unequal durations namely the single stabilized ss mode and gradient increase gi mode were applied to test the heavy metal removal efficiency in the ss mode the working voltages were alternating between 5 and 10 v with durations of 0 5 and 2 ms respectively this condition remained stable with the electrochemical working time the applied voltages covered the electrochemical reduction voltage of most heavy metals in the previous reports xu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 therefore this mode may be useful for the simultaneous removal of multi heavy metals in sludge in the gi mode the working voltages in the asymmetrical alternating current field gradually increased with the electrochemical working time this mode may have the potential for selective recovery of a specific metal with recyclable value after working for a period the reduced heavy metals were deposited on the electrode thereby affecting the removal efficiency therefore the electrode was cleaned periodically with 0 1 m hcl under a direct current reverse bias of 5 v for the regeneration of the ami pc electrode xu et al 2019 each such period was defined as an electrochemical working cycle and there were three cycles in each operation mode of this study fig 1b for the fna aace process the ability of the electrode to recover heavy metals from the edta eluent defined as the electrochemical efficiency was conducted to determine the impact of the duration of the electrochemical working cycles the electrochemical efficiency was calculated as follows 2 η c 0 c a a c e c 0 100 where c 0 and caace are the heavy metal concentrations in the edta eluent before and after the aace reduction respectively 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 sequential extraction of heavy metals heavy metals species in was such as acid soluble reducible oxidizable and residual fractions were determined by the community bureau of reference bcr sequential extraction procedure according to the national standard of china gb t 25282 2010 the corresponding chemical extractants and operational methods are listed in table s1 2 3 2 analysis of was properties the analysis items of was properties include total suspended solids tss g l water content wc ph conductivity zeta potential concentrations of heavy metals and morphology of was flocs details are shown in text s1 2 3 3 eps fraction extraction and analysis centrifugation and ultrasonication methods were used to extract the different eps layers of was namely slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps details are illustrated in text s2 of the supporting information after extraction the eps was characterized by the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan with detailed procedures shown in text s3 and table s2 of the supporting information the concentrations of heavy metals in each eps layer were also measured 2 3 4 other analysis the morphology of the heavy metal recovery products on the electrode surface was observed by sem jsm 6301f jeol the electrode was cut into thin slices less than 1 mm thick and then coated with gold for sem observation a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer vector 22 bruke of the heavy metals recovery products was performed in the attenuated total reflectance mode lin et al 2018 the xps spectra of the heavy metals recovery products were collected using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha thermofisher with an al kα source cyclic voltammetry tests were employed by an electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instrument co with details in text s4 2 3 5 statistical analysis all determinations were performed with triplicates to ensure the reproducibility the results were shown as the mean values standard deviation from three independent samples statistical analyses were conducted to examine the significance of the prediction model in response surface methodology during the optimization process of fna pretreatment one way analysis of variation anova was used for statistical analysis with a confidence level of 95 a p value less than 0 05 suggests that the model is statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the fna aace process the fna aace process was optimized to investigate the feasibility of the removal of heavy metals from was since the toxic metal pb had a high content in was of this study the optimal conditions for pb leaching were selected as the operating conditions of the fna pretreatment namely ph of 2 9 fna concentration of 0 6 mg g tss and exposure time of 13 h detailed optimization process is shown in text s5 and table s3 s10 based on the optimum conditions for fna pretreatment we further examined the performance of aace and optimized the aace working time for the convenience of optimization pb was also selected as the representative metal fig 2 presents the variations of pb concentration in the edta eluent and the electrochemical efficiency with aace reduction time as indicated in fig 2 the pb concentration in the edta eluent increased rapidly within the first hour and then gradually increased with time when edta circulating washing without the asymmetrical alternating current field pb concentration in the edta eluent was 1 30 mg l at the 1st hour accounting for 70 of pb extracted by the edta eluent and 1 8 mg l at the 24th hour however the pb concentration in the edta eluent only raised to 0 32 mg l within the 1st hour under the aace reduction and then to 1 18 mg l at the 24th hour this difference implies that some pb2 ions in the edta eluent were removed during aace reduction furthermore the electrochemical efficiency of aace continuously decreased with increasing working time which may be explained by the accumulation of heavy metals and other pollutants on the electrode surface gradually preventing the further removal of pb2 xu et al 2019 in the fna aace process heavy metal recovery may depend on both edta extraction and subsequent electrode reduction therefore the considerable edta extraction capacity for heavy metals from was and timely electrode reduction may lead to highly efficient heavy metal removal recovery as shown in fig 2 the electrochemical efficiency above 60 may be feasible for the aace operation therefore a corresponding time of 6 h was selected as the cycle time of aace reduction in the following experiment exceeding the 6 h of operation time the electrode would be cleaned this working period was also confirmed in the removal of cd and fe whose electrochemical efficiencies were also both acceptable fig s1 3 2 performance of the fna aace process based on the optimization of fna aace two different operation modes ss and gi were performed to further confirm the high performance for heavy metals removal of the fna aace process 3 2 1 heavy metals removal efficiency fig 3 shows the variations in the cd pb and fe contents of the was at different fna aace stages along the fna aace process the contents of these three heavy metals in the was decreased at the fna pretreatment stage the contents of cd pb and fe in the was decreased by 35 38 9 19 and 12 14 respectively this indicates that fna pretreatment can lead to the migration of these heavy metals from the was to the edta eluent du et al 2015 showed that fna treatment reduced the contents of cu and zn in biosolids and the corresponding removal efficiencies were over 45 and 81 respectively in this study after fna pretreatment three 6 h cycles of acce treatment were performed and more cd pb and fe were observed to be removed from the was in the ss mode of aace the pb and cd contents in the was decreased rapidly at first and slowly afterward in contrast the content of these toxic metals steadily decreased in the gi mode at the end of the fna aace process the residual pb and cd contents in the was approached the same values in ss and gi modes for fe in was its decrease trend slowed down at the 3rd cycle of aace reduction and the gi mode led to a greater decrease in fe than the ss mode overall the removal efficiencies for cd pb and fe in was were 97 64 95 65 and 65 32 using the fna aace process in ss mode respectively and the corresponding values were 97 82 93 12 and 68 17 in gi mode respectively this suggests that a high removal efficiency was achieved in the fna aace process that exceeds most of the previous electrochemical system performances in the heavy metals decontamination of was with a significantly shorter treatment duration and lower applied electric field table 2 moreover after fna aace treatment the final contents of toxic metals cd and pb in was reached 1 59 and 24 73 mg kg tss in ss mode 1 35 and 39 62 mg kg tss in gi mode respectively which meets the national standard of grade a 3 mg kg tss for cd and 300 mg kg tss for pb in the control standards of pollutants in sludge products for land use gb 4284 2018 in china this also validates the feasibility of the fna aace process for heavy metals decontamination in was 3 2 2 distribution of heavy metals in fna aace during the fna aace treatment the migration of heavy metals in the was edta eluent and ami pc electrode surface as well as the distribution of heavy metals species in the was at different fna aace stages were further investigated for comparison the heavy metal species contents were normalized and expressed as the proportions of the total heavy metal contents in raw was as indicated in fig 4a c the original data of heavy metal contents were illustrated in fig s2 in raw was the reducible fraction of cd species accounted for 89 99 of total cd content fig 4a this result was in line with that of a previous study showing that cd in was was chiefly distributed in the exchangeable and the reducible fractions xiao et al 2015 after fna pretreatment the proportion of the acid soluble fraction in was increased to 67 77 and that of the reducible fraction decreased to 22 33 this change in cd speciation indicates that fna pretreatment could weaken the stability of cd in was tang et al 2021 demonstrated that the acid soluble fraction had a high risk but was easier to remove during the aace stage all fractions of cd particularly the acid soluble fraction were significantly removed fig 4a and transferred to the eluent and electrode surface fig 4d in both ss and gi modes after three working cycles however there are some differences between the ss and gi mode a considerable portion of the cd was deposited on the electrode during the initial 6 h of aace treatment in ss mode fig 4d while in gi mode only 2 48 of cd accumulated on the ami pc electrode surface and then it rapidly increased to 28 21 after the gradient increase of applied voltage at the second cycle this implies that the gi mode has the potential to selectively recover specific heavy metals moreover after three working cycles 51 05 cd was transferred to the electrode surface but there was 37 75 cd in gi mode due to the lower initial voltage fig 4d this suggests that the ss mode may have a faster removal performance as indicated in fig 4b the reducible fraction was also the main pb species in raw was with a content ratio of 72 80 after fna pretreatment a small amount of pb was converted into an acid soluble fraction this transformation in pb speciation differs from that of cd which is likely due to pb chemical properties and its insoluble inorganic compounds weng et al 2014 during the three cycles of aace treatment the contents of the four fractions almost continuously decreased this suggests that the edta in aace treatment can chelate pb from some inorganic compounds which is in line with hanay et al 2009 meanwhile pb was gradually deposited on the electrode in both ss and gi modes fig 4d similar to cd pb also exhibited a more rapid electrochemical deposition rate in the ss mode fig 4d fe was distributed primarily in the residual fraction with a ratio of 63 81 in raw was fig 4c the consistently predominant fe residual fraction indicates that fe is the least mobile metal in the was this finding agrees with the results of fuentes et al 2004 who reported that over 60 of total fe in four representative sludges existed in the residual phase the fna pretreatment resulted in a slight decrease in the fe residual fraction after aace treatment with three cycles all fe fractions decreased and the main fe species remained in the residual fraction accordingly the deposition rate of fe was low and finally 35 74 43 78 of fe was observed on the electrode fig 4d it is worth noting that the different features of the ss and gi modes may ensure the versatility and flexibility of fna aace for dealing with the complex scenarios in the real heavy metals removal process of was 3 3 mechanisms of high performance of the fna aace process 3 3 1 release and mobilization of heavy metals in was matrix the morphologies and characteristics of the was at different fna aace stages are shown in fig s3 and table s11 as shown in fig s3a the raw was exhibited a platy and flocculent surface and an intact cell structure this compact structure can result in a low specific area guo et al 2020 and may hinder the extraction and removal of heavy metals from was after fna pretreatment coarse surfaces and pore channels occurred in the pretreated was fig s3b implying that the was structure may have disintegrated due to the destruction of macromolecules in eps by fna zhang et al 2015 however due to proton coagulation under acidic ph conditions the size of the was flocs increased table s11 these phenomena are conducive to the release and dissolution of heavy metals in the was du et al 2015 meanwhile the higher conductivity and zeta potential of fna pre treated was compared to raw was indicates an increase in the migration capacity of heavy metals and the concentrations of mobile ions in the was matrix table s11 as aace progressed the was became loose and numerous small and irregular fragments occurred fig s3c this indicates that edta elution in the aace treatment damaged the was flocs and decreased their size d 50 which is in line with the results of d 50 in table s11 moreover the decreased conductivity and zeta potential as well as the increased ph table s11 indicated that the concentration of positively charged heavy metal ions and protons gradually declined during the aace cycle and the heavy metals in the was were successfully removed the eem spectra of eps fig s4 and the related fluorescence region integral fri analysis fig s5 can also confirm the destruction of was the entire region excitation emission area volumes φt n of the outer eps layers slime and lb eps decreased sharply after fna pretreatment in this context the percent fluorescence response pi n values of protein like substances regions i ii decreased whereas those of humic acid like substances regions v increased this phenomenon suggests that organic matter may migrate from the inner flocs to the outer eps layer with the disintegration of eps due to the proteins depolymerisation by fna zhang et al 2015 chislett et al 2021 significant changes in the eps may alter the distribution of metal ions and promote the release and mobilization of heavy metals yu 2020 peng et al 2023 the distributions of heavy metals in the eps layers of the was matrix were further determined as shown in fig s6 the total concentrations of heavy metals significantly increased in all eps layers after fna pretreatment especially in slime and lb eps moreover the highest pb and cd contents were observed in the slime after fna pretreatment a sharp increase of fe content occurred in slime and lb eps after fna pretreatment whilst a decrease occurred in that of tb eps which indicates that fe possibly migrated from the was biosolids to the outer eps layers thus the addition of fna can enhance the mobility of heavy metals in the was demonstrating that it is an effective pretreatment for aace we further compared the total concentrations and speciation distributions of cd pb and fe in the was after aace treatment with and without fna pretreatment fig 5 a c and investigated the dynamic variations in the corresponding heavy metals concentrations in the edta eluent during aace treatment fig 5d e when aace treatment was conducted alone without fna pretreatment only small amounts of cd pb and fe were removed from was with the removal efficiencies of 3 50 and 9 respectively in comparison after fna pretreatment the corresponding removal efficiencies of aace treatment increased to 80 75 and 50 respectively moreover the proportion of hardly extracted fraction of heavy metals in fna pre treated was exhibited a lower level than that in was without pretreatment fig 5a c which facilitates the extraction of heavy metals by the edta eluent and guarantees the aace efficiency fig 5d e overall the fna pretreatment shifted the distributions of heavy metals in was provoked the migration of heavy metals to the outer layer of eps and transformed the occurrence state of heavy metals into easy extracted speciation these mechanisms enhanced the release of heavy metals from the was into the edta eluent and increased the aace efficiency 3 3 2 adsorption and reduction of heavy metals in aace considering that there was no noticeable difference between the ss and gi modes in terms of the final heavy metal removal efficiency the ami pc electrode with a high accumulation of heavy metals in the ss mode was selected to explore the adsorption and reduction mechanisms involved in aace the morphologies of the ami pc electrodes before and after aace process are shown in fig 6 the surface of carbon fibers of the ami pc electrode before the aace process contained a significant number of nanoparticles which is in line with the results of the study by liu et al 2017 on amidoxime coating fig 6a the presence of amidoxime was also confirmed by ftir fig 6d in the ftir of ami pc electrode the peaks at 3300 3500 cm 1 3100 3300 cm 1 1635 cm 1 and 912 cm 1 represented the nh oh c n and no groups in amidoxime c nh2 no 2h2 respectively saeed et al 2008 it has been reported that the amidoxime groups can coordinate with heavy metal cations to form stable pentacyclic compounds which are stronger than other types of monodentate groups such as carboxyl groups wu et al 2019 thus when a positive bias was applied the anionic complexes of the heavy metal chelates were attracted and migrated to the surface of the ami pc electrode the chelation sites of amidoxime then compete with edta to bind with heavy metal ions as described in eq 3 and eq 4 where m represents the heavy metals 3 sludge m n edt a 4 sludge m edt a 4 n 4 m edt a 4 n solution c n h 2 no 2 h 2 m edt a 4 n ami pc the morphology of the ami pc electrodes at the end of the aace reduction stage was observed using sem as indicated in fig 6b and c the ami pc electrode was completely covered with micrometer sized particles they were spherical in shape varied in sizes and are regarded as different heavy metal particles liu et al 2019 to further cinfirm the electrodeposition process xps was performed to determine the valence state of the heavy metal species in these micrometer sized particles fig 6e after the fna aace treatment the observed peaks representing the pb cd and fe species in the ami pc electrodes shifted to the right indicating that the binding energies of the electrons inside the metals decreased thus pb cd and fe ions may have obvious tendencies to gain electrons during the aace reduction moreover the xps peak differentiation analysis results suggested that the extracted species of pb and cd were a mixture of zero valent and divalent states with most of the species existing in their metallic form these phenomena prove that when a negative bias is used in aace heavy metals could be successfully reduced to zero valent particles and fixed on the ami pc electrode eq 5 5 m edt a 4 n ami pc n e m 0 ami pc edt a 4 to further confirm the reconversion of edta4 via the mechanism modeled by eq 5 and to prove the sustainability of edta the differential derivative of the two constant model eq 6 was employed to describe the leaching dynamics of heavy metals from was by edta elution during the aace process wang et al 2020 mo et al 2022 6 ln v b 1 ln t ln b a where v denotes the extraction rate of heavy metals by edta t denotes the extraction time a and b are constants the term lnb a denotes the natural logarithm of the heavy metal extraction rate at 1 min and the term b 1 denotes the decline rate of extraction the greater the absolute value of b the faster the decrease in the edta extraction rate this model can reflect the variation of extraction rate with time as shown in fig 7a according to eq 6 the absolute value of the slope of the linear equation during the aace treatment was significantly less than that without aace suggesting that the extraction rate of heavy metals by edta did not decrease significantly in the aace system this indicates that the edta eluent can be regenerated and maintained a higher extraction efficiency during the aace process which supports the mechanism illustrated in eq 5 these mechanisms guarantee the efficient removal of heavy metals from was and reduced secondary pollution from the eluent 3 3 3 role of fna pretreatment in electrochemical reduction and deposition to further confirm the synergistic impact of fna pretreatment for the aace process the role of fna pretreatment in electrodeposition and reduction was investigated it is hypothesized that the fna pretreatment would alleviate the contradiction between the high concentration of edta required for satisfactory leaching efficiency and the desired high electrochemical efficiency in aace to prove this we used 150 ml edta with different concentrations to wash 50 ml was for 6 h and determined the heavy metals leaching efficiencies from sludge in the eluent as shown in fig s7 even if the edta concentration increased to 90 mm l the leaching efficiencies of cd pb and fe were all lower than the 40 mm l edta washing after fna pretreatment these results suggest that the fna pretreatment can promote the decrease of required edta concentration chen et al 2021 found that the metal electrodeposition decreased with the enhancement of the edta concentration because high edta concentration could affect the kinetic performance and deposit morphology the electrode photographs in aace after metal electrodeposition can also support their result as shown in fig s8 obvious metal electrodeposition spots in the electrode surface were observed after 40 mm l edta washing in aace however the spots gradually declined with the increase in edta concentration moreover we also found that the high concentration of edta also affected the heavy metals reduction in aace as shown in fig s9 the zero valent metals in the electrode surface demonstrated by the xps decreased with the growth of edta concentration this can be explained by the high concentration of edta may affect the desolvation of metal ions during electroreduction in aace chen et al 2021 ma et al 2022 these results suggest that the fna pretreatment can reduce the required edta concentration and thus promote the electrochemical reduction and deposition of heavy metals in aace in addition the fna pretreatment can disintegrate sludge and promote the release of ions which increases the conductivity table s11 this may enhance the reduction of heavy metals in aace the cyclic voltammetry experiments can support this deduction as shown in fig 7b the ami pc electrodes were immersed in the different eluents after washing and conducted the cyclic voltammetry tests a more obvious reduction peak was observed in the eluent group of edta washing after fna treatment in short the effect of fna pretreatment on electrochemical reduction and deposition can be concluded in two aspects firstly fna pretreatment reduced the demand for edta concentration during leaching thereby reducing the hindrance to electrochemical deposition and reduction secondly fna pretreatment increased conductivity and enhanced the electrochemical reduction capability in aace process 3 4 potential application of fna aace technology in wwtps 3 4 1 potential application mode of fna aace technology owing to the modularity of its electrochemistry fna aace could have a wide range of applications in wwtps one of the promising applications is coupled with anaerobic digestion ad for multi heavy metal decontamination and in situ production of fna as illustrated in fig 8 after pre dewatering was can be transferred to the fna aace unit this unit conducts toxic metals decontamination and maintains a safe level of heavy metals for subsequent ad and further land applications of digestion products detailed operation modes for heavy metal decontamination are discussed in text s6 meanwhile fna pretreatment improves the subsequent ad performance owing to the enhanced solubilization and digestibility of was duan et al 2020 li et al 2020 furthermore ad liquor can be returned to the fna aace tank for the in situ production and reuse of fna using an online ph controller wang et al 2021 avoiding secondary pollution and reducing the consumption cost of chemical reagents 3 4 2 economic assessment for fna aace technology the economic analysis of the potential application of fna aace in wwtp was also estimated the total cost of this technology was considered as the sum of electricity cost and agent cost during the aace treatment the electricity consumption is illustrated in fig s11 the calculated energy consumption per kilogram heavy metals removal is 100 86 kwh kg heavy metals removed table 3 and is lower than the traditional electro kinetic process which was about 387 kwh kg heavy metals removed park et al 2010 this phenomenon may be attributed to the shorter treatment duration of the fna aace process unlike the soil and sediment remediations it has been reported that the electrochemistry based process for metals removal from was was still in its early developing stages zeng et al 2022 the economic feasibility is one of the major factors that limited the applications zeng et al 2022 wang et al 2022 by addition of the agent cost the total cost of the fna aace technology is estimated as 11 96 us kg heavy metals removed table 3 and is cheaper than the previous report which is about 55 us kg heavy metals removed in a pilot scale electro kinetic process zagury et al 1999 this suggests that the proposed fna aace technology may take a step further in the application of the electrochemistry process the fna aace technology has the expected application in wwtp and may bring a promising sludge treatment process that embodies high efficiency multi heavy metal decontamination sludge reduction and resource energy recovery 4 conclusions in this study a novel fna aace process was proposed for the high efficiency decontamination of multi heavy metals in was the main conclusions are summarized as follows the optimum conditions of fna aace were an fna exposure time of 13 h with a ph of 2 9 and an fna concentration of 0 6 mg g tss followed by the aace process with one cycle time of 6 h the removal efficiencies of cd pb and fe were greater than 97 93 and 65 respectively after three cycles of aace no significant differences were observed in the final removal efficiencies of the gi and ss modes however the gi mode had the potential to selectively recover specific heavy metals the ss mode exhibited faster removal performance during the initial 6 h of aace treatment the fna pretreatment induced the migration of heavy metals to the outer layer of eps and transformed the occurrence state of heavy metals to the easy extracted speciation enhancing edta leaching in aace process moreover fna pretreatment reduced the demand for edta concentration during leaching and increased conductivity improving the electrochemical deposition and reduction capability in aace process the aace process absorbed the anionic chelates and reduced the heavy metals to zero valent particles on the electrode regenerating the edta eluent and causing it to maintain a high extraction efficiency for heavy metals these mechanisms guarantee the strong performance of fna aace for heavy metals decontamination of was credit authorship contribution statement zhibo han

14674,heavy metal contamination of waste activated sludge was is a key factor limiting the land application of sludge for nutrients recovery this study proposes a novel free nitrous acid fna assisted asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry fna aace process to achieve high efficiency decontamination of multi heavy metals cd pb and fe in was the optimal operating conditions the heavy metal removal performance of fna aace and the related mechanisms for maintaining the high performance were systematically investigated during the fna aace process fna treatment was optimal with an exposure time of 13 h at a ph of 2 9 and an fna concentration of 0 6 mg g tss then the sludge was washed with edta in a recirculating leaching system under asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry aace the 6 h working and the following electrode cleaning were defined as a working circle of aace after three cycles of working cleaning periods in aace treatment the cumulative removal efficiency of the toxic metals cd and pb reached over 97 and 93 respectively whilst that of fe was greater than 65 this surpasses most previously reported efficiencies and possesses a shorter treatment duration and sustainable edta circulation the mechanism analysis suggested that fna pretreatment provoked the migration of heavy metals for leaching enhancement as well as reduced the demand for edta eluent concentration and increased conductivity which can improve the aace efficiency meanwhile the aace process absorbed the anionic chelates of heavy metals and reduced them to zero valent particles on the electrode regenerating the edta eluent and maintaining its high extraction efficiency for heavy metals in addition fna aace could provide different electric field operation modes allowing it to have flexibility for the real application processes this proposed process is expected to be coupled with anaerobic digestion in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for high efficiency of heavy metal decontamination sludge reduction and resource energy recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular polymeric substances eps toxic metals alternating current ac field edta circulating leaching data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land application is one of the sustainable disposal routes of waste activated sludge was which can recover nitrogen phosphate and other micronutrients ding et al 2021 tang et al 2022 and has been generally used in the us and europe because of its low cost badgett and milbrandt 2020 abdulsada et al 2021 due to the abundant nutrients in was the fertilizer product from sludge can not only ameliorate the soil structure but also increase the soil nutrient content lloret et al 2016 however one of the unwanted effects that challenge its application is the heavy metals pollution in sludge wang et al 2022 in previous reports heavy metals such as cd cr cu hg ni and pb accounted for nearly 0 5 2 of the dry weight basis of was in some cases their proportions even reached 4 babel and dacera 2006 yang et al 2020 during land application heavy metals present in was are typically highly toxic or carcinogenic even at trace concentrations and can accumulate in biomass causing severe environmental pollution and human health risk zhou et al 2022 electrochemical processes such as electrokinetic process have attracted considerable attention for the removal of heavy metals from was owing to their modularity selectivity and low secondary pollution zeng et al 2022 liu et al 2019 generally this technology can remove heavy metals by inserting electrode arrays into the sludge and then applying a direct current dc electric field to migrate heavy metal species to the negative electrode through electroosmosis electromigration and electrodeposition fu et al 2017 geng et al 2020 to further improve the removal efficiency chemical leaching is usually used alongside electrochemistry to enhance the mobility of the heavy metals to the electrode and increase the conductivity chen et al 2021 wang et al 2022 however the efficiency of the dc process remains unsatisfactory owing to several factors one of which is the coulomb repulsion between the incoming ions and the adsorbed charged ions which makes the active sites ineffective another factor is the competition between heavy metal ions and other cations additionally unnecessary energy loss is caused by water splitting on the electrode surface due to the concentration polarization liu et al 2017 2019 recently an asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry aace concept may have the potential to circumvent the problems mentioned above and has been used instead of the dc process in the remediation of heavy metal polluted soil xu et al 2019 in aace the recirculating chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta extracts heavy metals and transports them to an amidoxime modified porous carbon ami pc electrode providing strong chelation sites and hydrophilicity to preferably compete for heavy metals with edta an asymmetrical alternating voltage is applied to the electrode when a positive bias is operated the ions in the electrolyte migrated to the ami pc electrode and established an electrical double layer while when the bias is reversed heavy metal cations are reduced to zero valent particles and fixed on the electrode surface resulting in the removal of heavy metals and the regeneration of edta this concept could fully utilize the active sites on the electrode surface relieve water splitting ensure the sustainable use of edta and achieved high removal efficiencies and fast kinetics in soil xu et al 2019 thus this method may act as a reference for improving was heavy metal decontamination although there are few related studies until now moreover compared to polluted soil was contains more organics and possesses a complex gel like structure which has a combined feature of colloidal gel and hydrogel in the presence of extracellular polymeric substances eps dursun 2007 eps is considered the key domicile for heavy metals in was in previous studies several groups such as amino and carboxyl in eps were observed to have the robust binding abilities for heavy metal ions yu 2020 furthermore some of the absorbed metal ions transformed to other specific chemical forms under the eps mediated oxidation reduction and may form complex minerals kang et al 2017 which could cause further uptake of heavy metals mikutta et al 2012 due to the complex heavy metals eps interactions the cross linking of eps molecules may occur yielding large molecular eps chains with compact structures and small pore size in the matrix resulting in the retaining and preservation of heavy metals yu 2020 peng et al 2023 hindering the extraction efficiency of heavy metals by washing with chelating agent and adversely affecting the migration and solubility of heavy metals ren et al 2015 tang et al 2018 therefore these characteristics of was may challenge the high efficiencies and fast kinetics of the aace system reported in soil moreover the presence of eps and complex interactions with heavy metals may result in long washing times and high chelator concentrations for satisfactory extraction efficiency of heavy metals in the electrochemical system this may challenge the sustainability of edta in the aace process owing to the high concentration of edta could suppress the metal electrodeposition and reduction chen et al 2021 and then hinder the regeneration of edta in aace thus the aace system procedure should be further modified to match the feature of was particularly the complex interactions between eps and heavy metals this study developed a novel free nitrous acid fna assisted asymmetrical alternating current electrochemistry fna aace to achieve high efficiency decontamination of multi heavy metals in was it has been reported that fna was effective in the breakdown of the macromolecules and ring structures thus causing the breaking of eps metal interactions and enhancing the release of heavy metals from was du et al 2015 furthermore fna can be able to passively pass through cell membranes and increase the proton permeability of membranes duan et al 2020 which likely contributed to enhancing the mobility of heavy metals to the outer layer of eps therefore in this study fna was designed to alleviate the contradiction between the high concentration of edta required for satisfactory leaching efficiency and the desired high electrochemical efficiency in aace the chelating reagent edta was employed as a carrier to transport the heavy metals to the amidoxime functionalized electrode driven by a circulating pump instead of the conventional electromigration or electroosmosis the reduction of heavy metals occurred at the electrode under aace with the regeneration of edta for recycling two different aace operation modes were compared in this study and their corresponding heavy metals decontamination performance was systematically evaluated the objectives of this study were to a investigate the feasibility of fna aace for high efficiency decontamination of heavy metals in was and b reveal the corresponding mechanisms of fna aace 2 materials and methods 2 1 was samples was samples were collected from a secondary sedimentation tank at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in hebei province china this wwtp treats 120 000 m3 of municipal sewage and industrial wastewater from steel mills and power plants daily using an anaerobic anoxic oxic process the obtained was samples were transferred immediately to the laboratory within 6 h then concentrated by setting 4 h and stored at 4 c before use zhang et al 2022 table 1 lists the main characteristics and heavy metal contents in these was samples due to the unstable property was collected from the wwtp can only be stored for a week at one time therefore we used different was samples collected at different times during this study and each sample corresponded to a section of the experiments sample 1 was used in the optimization experiments of the fna aace process samples 2 3 and 4 were utilized in the experiments about performance testing and mechanisms investigation for the fna aace process 2 2 experimental procedure the main experimental procedure consists of two successive stages namely fna pretreatment and aace treatment fig 1a 1 fna pretreatment stage the batch experiments were performed at 22 1 in an incubator shaker at 135 rpm first different volumes of nitrite stock solution 2 g nano2 l were injected into several 500 ml beakers containing 250 ml was to achieve the targeted nitrite concentration the ph with range of 1 05 4 75 was manually controlled by adding 1 0 m hcl the fna concentration was calculated using the following equation 1 c f n a c n o 2 n e 2300 273 t 1 0 p h where c n o 2 n is nitrite concentration t is temperature thus concentration range of generated fna was 0 06 mg g tss 1 14 mg g tss in this study further 40 mm l edta disodium salt solution was cyclically infused by a pump to wash through the fna pretreated was for 24 h the ratio of edta to the dry solid was 3 2 mm g the heavy metal concentration in edta eluent without an asymmetrical alternating current field was measured to further evaluate the fna pretreatment effect response surface methodology rsm was used to optimize fna pretreatment parameters with a central composite design ccd 2 aace treatment stage 50 ml fna pretreated was with the concentration listed in table 1 was transferred to an aace unit and then 40 mm l edta disodium salt solution was cyclically infused by a pump to wash through the was at room temperature the ratio of edta to the dry solid was 3 2 mm g during washing as indicated in fig 1a the aace reduction unit was made of plexiglass with a sludge tank and an aace filtration chamber and their volumes were 60 mm 40 mm 25 mm and 60 mm 40 mm 60 mm respectively two pieces of nylon filter membrane 5 μm aperture were put on each side of the sludge tank to prevent sludge particles from being washed out the aace filtration chamber was put at the end of the aace unit and two self made amidoxime modified porous carbon ami pc electrodes liu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 were placed in parallel at an interval of 1 5 cm and connected to a power supply an asymmetrical alternating current was generated by the waveform generator rigol dg1022u as shown in fig 1b different voltages alternating between negative and positive with unequal durations namely the single stabilized ss mode and gradient increase gi mode were applied to test the heavy metal removal efficiency in the ss mode the working voltages were alternating between 5 and 10 v with durations of 0 5 and 2 ms respectively this condition remained stable with the electrochemical working time the applied voltages covered the electrochemical reduction voltage of most heavy metals in the previous reports xu et al 2019 liu et al 2019 therefore this mode may be useful for the simultaneous removal of multi heavy metals in sludge in the gi mode the working voltages in the asymmetrical alternating current field gradually increased with the electrochemical working time this mode may have the potential for selective recovery of a specific metal with recyclable value after working for a period the reduced heavy metals were deposited on the electrode thereby affecting the removal efficiency therefore the electrode was cleaned periodically with 0 1 m hcl under a direct current reverse bias of 5 v for the regeneration of the ami pc electrode xu et al 2019 each such period was defined as an electrochemical working cycle and there were three cycles in each operation mode of this study fig 1b for the fna aace process the ability of the electrode to recover heavy metals from the edta eluent defined as the electrochemical efficiency was conducted to determine the impact of the duration of the electrochemical working cycles the electrochemical efficiency was calculated as follows 2 η c 0 c a a c e c 0 100 where c 0 and caace are the heavy metal concentrations in the edta eluent before and after the aace reduction respectively 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 sequential extraction of heavy metals heavy metals species in was such as acid soluble reducible oxidizable and residual fractions were determined by the community bureau of reference bcr sequential extraction procedure according to the national standard of china gb t 25282 2010 the corresponding chemical extractants and operational methods are listed in table s1 2 3 2 analysis of was properties the analysis items of was properties include total suspended solids tss g l water content wc ph conductivity zeta potential concentrations of heavy metals and morphology of was flocs details are shown in text s1 2 3 3 eps fraction extraction and analysis centrifugation and ultrasonication methods were used to extract the different eps layers of was namely slime loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps details are illustrated in text s2 of the supporting information after extraction the eps was characterized by the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 7000 hitachi japan with detailed procedures shown in text s3 and table s2 of the supporting information the concentrations of heavy metals in each eps layer were also measured 2 3 4 other analysis the morphology of the heavy metal recovery products on the electrode surface was observed by sem jsm 6301f jeol the electrode was cut into thin slices less than 1 mm thick and then coated with gold for sem observation a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer vector 22 bruke of the heavy metals recovery products was performed in the attenuated total reflectance mode lin et al 2018 the xps spectra of the heavy metals recovery products were collected using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha thermofisher with an al kα source cyclic voltammetry tests were employed by an electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instrument co with details in text s4 2 3 5 statistical analysis all determinations were performed with triplicates to ensure the reproducibility the results were shown as the mean values standard deviation from three independent samples statistical analyses were conducted to examine the significance of the prediction model in response surface methodology during the optimization process of fna pretreatment one way analysis of variation anova was used for statistical analysis with a confidence level of 95 a p value less than 0 05 suggests that the model is statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the fna aace process the fna aace process was optimized to investigate the feasibility of the removal of heavy metals from was since the toxic metal pb had a high content in was of this study the optimal conditions for pb leaching were selected as the operating conditions of the fna pretreatment namely ph of 2 9 fna concentration of 0 6 mg g tss and exposure time of 13 h detailed optimization process is shown in text s5 and table s3 s10 based on the optimum conditions for fna pretreatment we further examined the performance of aace and optimized the aace working time for the convenience of optimization pb was also selected as the representative metal fig 2 presents the variations of pb concentration in the edta eluent and the electrochemical efficiency with aace reduction time as indicated in fig 2 the pb concentration in the edta eluent increased rapidly within the first hour and then gradually increased with time when edta circulating washing without the asymmetrical alternating current field pb concentration in the edta eluent was 1 30 mg l at the 1st hour accounting for 70 of pb extracted by the edta eluent and 1 8 mg l at the 24th hour however the pb concentration in the edta eluent only raised to 0 32 mg l within the 1st hour under the aace reduction and then to 1 18 mg l at the 24th hour this difference implies that some pb2 ions in the edta eluent were removed during aace reduction furthermore the electrochemical efficiency of aace continuously decreased with increasing working time which may be explained by the accumulation of heavy metals and other pollutants on the electrode surface gradually preventing the further removal of pb2 xu et al 2019 in the fna aace process heavy metal recovery may depend on both edta extraction and subsequent electrode reduction therefore the considerable edta extraction capacity for heavy metals from was and timely electrode reduction may lead to highly efficient heavy metal removal recovery as shown in fig 2 the electrochemical efficiency above 60 may be feasible for the aace operation therefore a corresponding time of 6 h was selected as the cycle time of aace reduction in the following experiment exceeding the 6 h of operation time the electrode would be cleaned this working period was also confirmed in the removal of cd and fe whose electrochemical efficiencies were also both acceptable fig s1 3 2 performance of the fna aace process based on the optimization of fna aace two different operation modes ss and gi were performed to further confirm the high performance for heavy metals removal of the fna aace process 3 2 1 heavy metals removal efficiency fig 3 shows the variations in the cd pb and fe contents of the was at different fna aace stages along the fna aace process the contents of these three heavy metals in the was decreased at the fna pretreatment stage the contents of cd pb and fe in the was decreased by 35 38 9 19 and 12 14 respectively this indicates that fna pretreatment can lead to the migration of these heavy metals from the was to the edta eluent du et al 2015 showed that fna treatment reduced the contents of cu and zn in biosolids and the corresponding removal efficiencies were over 45 and 81 respectively in this study after fna pretreatment three 6 h cycles of acce treatment were performed and more cd pb and fe were observed to be removed from the was in the ss mode of aace the pb and cd contents in the was decreased rapidly at first and slowly afterward in contrast the content of these toxic metals steadily decreased in the gi mode at the end of the fna aace process the residual pb and cd contents in the was approached the same values in ss and gi modes for fe in was its decrease trend slowed down at the 3rd cycle of aace reduction and the gi mode led to a greater decrease in fe than the ss mode overall the removal efficiencies for cd pb and fe in was were 97 64 95 65 and 65 32 using the fna aace process in ss mode respectively and the corresponding values were 97 82 93 12 and 68 17 in gi mode respectively this suggests that a high removal efficiency was achieved in the fna aace process that exceeds most of the previous electrochemical system performances in the heavy metals decontamination of was with a significantly shorter treatment duration and lower applied electric field table 2 moreover after fna aace treatment the final contents of toxic metals cd and pb in was reached 1 59 and 24 73 mg kg tss in ss mode 1 35 and 39 62 mg kg tss in gi mode respectively which meets the national standard of grade a 3 mg kg tss for cd and 300 mg kg tss for pb in the control standards of pollutants in sludge products for land use gb 4284 2018 in china this also validates the feasibility of the fna aace process for heavy metals decontamination in was 3 2 2 distribution of heavy metals in fna aace during the fna aace treatment the migration of heavy metals in the was edta eluent and ami pc electrode surface as well as the distribution of heavy metals species in the was at different fna aace stages were further investigated for comparison the heavy metal species contents were normalized and expressed as the proportions of the total heavy metal contents in raw was as indicated in fig 4a c the original data of heavy metal contents were illustrated in fig s2 in raw was the reducible fraction of cd species accounted for 89 99 of total cd content fig 4a this result was in line with that of a previous study showing that cd in was was chiefly distributed in the exchangeable and the reducible fractions xiao et al 2015 after fna pretreatment the proportion of the acid soluble fraction in was increased to 67 77 and that of the reducible fraction decreased to 22 33 this change in cd speciation indicates that fna pretreatment could weaken the stability of cd in was tang et al 2021 demonstrated that the acid soluble fraction had a high risk but was easier to remove during the aace stage all fractions of cd particularly the acid soluble fraction were significantly removed fig 4a and transferred to the eluent and electrode surface fig 4d in both ss and gi modes after three working cycles however there are some differences between the ss and gi mode a considerable portion of the cd was deposited on the electrode during the initial 6 h of aace treatment in ss mode fig 4d while in gi mode only 2 48 of cd accumulated on the ami pc electrode surface and then it rapidly increased to 28 21 after the gradient increase of applied voltage at the second cycle this implies that the gi mode has the potential to selectively recover specific heavy metals moreover after three working cycles 51 05 cd was transferred to the electrode surface but there was 37 75 cd in gi mode due to the lower initial voltage fig 4d this suggests that the ss mode may have a faster removal performance as indicated in fig 4b the reducible fraction was also the main pb species in raw was with a content ratio of 72 80 after fna pretreatment a small amount of pb was converted into an acid soluble fraction this transformation in pb speciation differs from that of cd which is likely due to pb chemical properties and its insoluble inorganic compounds weng et al 2014 during the three cycles of aace treatment the contents of the four fractions almost continuously decreased this suggests that the edta in aace treatment can chelate pb from some inorganic compounds which is in line with hanay et al 2009 meanwhile pb was gradually deposited on the electrode in both ss and gi modes fig 4d similar to cd pb also exhibited a more rapid electrochemical deposition rate in the ss mode fig 4d fe was distributed primarily in the residual fraction with a ratio of 63 81 in raw was fig 4c the consistently predominant fe residual fraction indicates that fe is the least mobile metal in the was this finding agrees with the results of fuentes et al 2004 who reported that over 60 of total fe in four representative sludges existed in the residual phase the fna pretreatment resulted in a slight decrease in the fe residual fraction after aace treatment with three cycles all fe fractions decreased and the main fe species remained in the residual fraction accordingly the deposition rate of fe was low and finally 35 74 43 78 of fe was observed on the electrode fig 4d it is worth noting that the different features of the ss and gi modes may ensure the versatility and flexibility of fna aace for dealing with the complex scenarios in the real heavy metals removal process of was 3 3 mechanisms of high performance of the fna aace process 3 3 1 release and mobilization of heavy metals in was matrix the morphologies and characteristics of the was at different fna aace stages are shown in fig s3 and table s11 as shown in fig s3a the raw was exhibited a platy and flocculent surface and an intact cell structure this compact structure can result in a low specific area guo et al 2020 and may hinder the extraction and removal of heavy metals from was after fna pretreatment coarse surfaces and pore channels occurred in the pretreated was fig s3b implying that the was structure may have disintegrated due to the destruction of macromolecules in eps by fna zhang et al 2015 however due to proton coagulation under acidic ph conditions the size of the was flocs increased table s11 these phenomena are conducive to the release and dissolution of heavy metals in the was du et al 2015 meanwhile the higher conductivity and zeta potential of fna pre treated was compared to raw was indicates an increase in the migration capacity of heavy metals and the concentrations of mobile ions in the was matrix table s11 as aace progressed the was became loose and numerous small and irregular fragments occurred fig s3c this indicates that edta elution in the aace treatment damaged the was flocs and decreased their size d 50 which is in line with the results of d 50 in table s11 moreover the decreased conductivity and zeta potential as well as the increased ph table s11 indicated that the concentration of positively charged heavy metal ions and protons gradually declined during the aace cycle and the heavy metals in the was were successfully removed the eem spectra of eps fig s4 and the related fluorescence region integral fri analysis fig s5 can also confirm the destruction of was the entire region excitation emission area volumes φt n of the outer eps layers slime and lb eps decreased sharply after fna pretreatment in this context the percent fluorescence response pi n values of protein like substances regions i ii decreased whereas those of humic acid like substances regions v increased this phenomenon suggests that organic matter may migrate from the inner flocs to the outer eps layer with the disintegration of eps due to the proteins depolymerisation by fna zhang et al 2015 chislett et al 2021 significant changes in the eps may alter the distribution of metal ions and promote the release and mobilization of heavy metals yu 2020 peng et al 2023 the distributions of heavy metals in the eps layers of the was matrix were further determined as shown in fig s6 the total concentrations of heavy metals significantly increased in all eps layers after fna pretreatment especially in slime and lb eps moreover the highest pb and cd contents were observed in the slime after fna pretreatment a sharp increase of fe content occurred in slime and lb eps after fna pretreatment whilst a decrease occurred in that of tb eps which indicates that fe possibly migrated from the was biosolids to the outer eps layers thus the addition of fna can enhance the mobility of heavy metals in the was demonstrating that it is an effective pretreatment for aace we further compared the total concentrations and speciation distributions of cd pb and fe in the was after aace treatment with and without fna pretreatment fig 5 a c and investigated the dynamic variations in the corresponding heavy metals concentrations in the edta eluent during aace treatment fig 5d e when aace treatment was conducted alone without fna pretreatment only small amounts of cd pb and fe were removed from was with the removal efficiencies of 3 50 and 9 respectively in comparison after fna pretreatment the corresponding removal efficiencies of aace treatment increased to 80 75 and 50 respectively moreover the proportion of hardly extracted fraction of heavy metals in fna pre treated was exhibited a lower level than that in was without pretreatment fig 5a c which facilitates the extraction of heavy metals by the edta eluent and guarantees the aace efficiency fig 5d e overall the fna pretreatment shifted the distributions of heavy metals in was provoked the migration of heavy metals to the outer layer of eps and transformed the occurrence state of heavy metals into easy extracted speciation these mechanisms enhanced the release of heavy metals from the was into the edta eluent and increased the aace efficiency 3 3 2 adsorption and reduction of heavy metals in aace considering that there was no noticeable difference between the ss and gi modes in terms of the final heavy metal removal efficiency the ami pc electrode with a high accumulation of heavy metals in the ss mode was selected to explore the adsorption and reduction mechanisms involved in aace the morphologies of the ami pc electrodes before and after aace process are shown in fig 6 the surface of carbon fibers of the ami pc electrode before the aace process contained a significant number of nanoparticles which is in line with the results of the study by liu et al 2017 on amidoxime coating fig 6a the presence of amidoxime was also confirmed by ftir fig 6d in the ftir of ami pc electrode the peaks at 3300 3500 cm 1 3100 3300 cm 1 1635 cm 1 and 912 cm 1 represented the nh oh c n and no groups in amidoxime c nh2 no 2h2 respectively saeed et al 2008 it has been reported that the amidoxime groups can coordinate with heavy metal cations to form stable pentacyclic compounds which are stronger than other types of monodentate groups such as carboxyl groups wu et al 2019 thus when a positive bias was applied the anionic complexes of the heavy metal chelates were attracted and migrated to the surface of the ami pc electrode the chelation sites of amidoxime then compete with edta to bind with heavy metal ions as described in eq 3 and eq 4 where m represents the heavy metals 3 sludge m n edt a 4 sludge m edt a 4 n 4 m edt a 4 n solution c n h 2 no 2 h 2 m edt a 4 n ami pc the morphology of the ami pc electrodes at the end of the aace reduction stage was observed using sem as indicated in fig 6b and c the ami pc electrode was completely covered with micrometer sized particles they were spherical in shape varied in sizes and are regarded as different heavy metal particles liu et al 2019 to further cinfirm the electrodeposition process xps was performed to determine the valence state of the heavy metal species in these micrometer sized particles fig 6e after the fna aace treatment the observed peaks representing the pb cd and fe species in the ami pc electrodes shifted to the right indicating that the binding energies of the electrons inside the metals decreased thus pb cd and fe ions may have obvious tendencies to gain electrons during the aace reduction moreover the xps peak differentiation analysis results suggested that the extracted species of pb and cd were a mixture of zero valent and divalent states with most of the species existing in their metallic form these phenomena prove that when a negative bias is used in aace heavy metals could be successfully reduced to zero valent particles and fixed on the ami pc electrode eq 5 5 m edt a 4 n ami pc n e m 0 ami pc edt a 4 to further confirm the reconversion of edta4 via the mechanism modeled by eq 5 and to prove the sustainability of edta the differential derivative of the two constant model eq 6 was employed to describe the leaching dynamics of heavy metals from was by edta elution during the aace process wang et al 2020 mo et al 2022 6 ln v b 1 ln t ln b a where v denotes the extraction rate of heavy metals by edta t denotes the extraction time a and b are constants the term lnb a denotes the natural logarithm of the heavy metal extraction rate at 1 min and the term b 1 denotes the decline rate of extraction the greater the absolute value of b the faster the decrease in the edta extraction rate this model can reflect the variation of extraction rate with time as shown in fig 7a according to eq 6 the absolute value of the slope of the linear equation during the aace treatment was significantly less than that without aace suggesting that the extraction rate of heavy metals by edta did not decrease significantly in the aace system this indicates that the edta eluent can be regenerated and maintained a higher extraction efficiency during the aace process which supports the mechanism illustrated in eq 5 these mechanisms guarantee the efficient removal of heavy metals from was and reduced secondary pollution from the eluent 3 3 3 role of fna pretreatment in electrochemical reduction and deposition to further confirm the synergistic impact of fna pretreatment for the aace process the role of fna pretreatment in electrodeposition and reduction was investigated it is hypothesized that the fna pretreatment would alleviate the contradiction between the high concentration of edta required for satisfactory leaching efficiency and the desired high electrochemical efficiency in aace to prove this we used 150 ml edta with different concentrations to wash 50 ml was for 6 h and determined the heavy metals leaching efficiencies from sludge in the eluent as shown in fig s7 even if the edta concentration increased to 90 mm l the leaching efficiencies of cd pb and fe were all lower than the 40 mm l edta washing after fna pretreatment these results suggest that the fna pretreatment can promote the decrease of required edta concentration chen et al 2021 found that the metal electrodeposition decreased with the enhancement of the edta concentration because high edta concentration could affect the kinetic performance and deposit morphology the electrode photographs in aace after metal electrodeposition can also support their result as shown in fig s8 obvious metal electrodeposition spots in the electrode surface were observed after 40 mm l edta washing in aace however the spots gradually declined with the increase in edta concentration moreover we also found that the high concentration of edta also affected the heavy metals reduction in aace as shown in fig s9 the zero valent metals in the electrode surface demonstrated by the xps decreased with the growth of edta concentration this can be explained by the high concentration of edta may affect the desolvation of metal ions during electroreduction in aace chen et al 2021 ma et al 2022 these results suggest that the fna pretreatment can reduce the required edta concentration and thus promote the electrochemical reduction and deposition of heavy metals in aace in addition the fna pretreatment can disintegrate sludge and promote the release of ions which increases the conductivity table s11 this may enhance the reduction of heavy metals in aace the cyclic voltammetry experiments can support this deduction as shown in fig 7b the ami pc electrodes were immersed in the different eluents after washing and conducted the cyclic voltammetry tests a more obvious reduction peak was observed in the eluent group of edta washing after fna treatment in short the effect of fna pretreatment on electrochemical reduction and deposition can be concluded in two aspects firstly fna pretreatment reduced the demand for edta concentration during leaching thereby reducing the hindrance to electrochemical deposition and reduction secondly fna pretreatment increased conductivity and enhanced the electrochemical reduction capability in aace process 3 4 potential application of fna aace technology in wwtps 3 4 1 potential application mode of fna aace technology owing to the modularity of its electrochemistry fna aace could have a wide range of applications in wwtps one of the promising applications is coupled with anaerobic digestion ad for multi heavy metal decontamination and in situ production of fna as illustrated in fig 8 after pre dewatering was can be transferred to the fna aace unit this unit conducts toxic metals decontamination and maintains a safe level of heavy metals for subsequent ad and further land applications of digestion products detailed operation modes for heavy metal decontamination are discussed in text s6 meanwhile fna pretreatment improves the subsequent ad performance owing to the enhanced solubilization and digestibility of was duan et al 2020 li et al 2020 furthermore ad liquor can be returned to the fna aace tank for the in situ production and reuse of fna using an online ph controller wang et al 2021 avoiding secondary pollution and reducing the consumption cost of chemical reagents 3 4 2 economic assessment for fna aace technology the economic analysis of the potential application of fna aace in wwtp was also estimated the total cost of this technology was considered as the sum of electricity cost and agent cost during the aace treatment the electricity consumption is illustrated in fig s11 the calculated energy consumption per kilogram heavy metals removal is 100 86 kwh kg heavy metals removed table 3 and is lower than the traditional electro kinetic process which was about 387 kwh kg heavy metals removed park et al 2010 this phenomenon may be attributed to the shorter treatment duration of the fna aace process unlike the soil and sediment remediations it has been reported that the electrochemistry based process for metals removal from was was still in its early developing stages zeng et al 2022 the economic feasibility is one of the major factors that limited the applications zeng et al 2022 wang et al 2022 by addition of the agent cost the total cost of the fna aace technology is estimated as 11 96 us kg heavy metals removed table 3 and is cheaper than the previous report which is about 55 us kg heavy metals removed in a pilot scale electro kinetic process zagury et al 1999 this suggests that the proposed fna aace technology may take a step further in the application of the electrochemistry process the fna aace technology has the expected application in wwtp and may bring a promising sludge treatment process that embodies high efficiency multi heavy metal decontamination sludge reduction and resource energy recovery 4 conclusions in this study a novel fna aace process was proposed for the high efficiency decontamination of multi heavy metals in was the main conclusions are summarized as follows the optimum conditions of fna aace were an fna exposure time of 13 h with a ph of 2 9 and an fna concentration of 0 6 mg g tss followed by the aace process with one cycle time of 6 h the removal efficiencies of cd pb and fe were greater than 97 93 and 65 respectively after three cycles of aace no significant differences were observed in the final removal efficiencies of the gi and ss modes however the gi mode had the potential to selectively recover specific heavy metals the ss mode exhibited faster removal performance during the initial 6 h of aace treatment the fna pretreatment induced the migration of heavy metals to the outer layer of eps and transformed the occurrence state of heavy metals to the easy extracted speciation enhancing edta leaching in aace process moreover fna pretreatment reduced the demand for edta concentration during leaching and increased conductivity improving the electrochemical deposition and reduction capability in aace process the aace process absorbed the anionic chelates and reduced the heavy metals to zero valent particles on the electrode regenerating the edta eluent and causing it to maintain a high extraction efficiency for heavy metals these mechanisms guarantee the strong performance of fna aace for heavy metals decontamination of was credit authorship contribution statement zhibo han
