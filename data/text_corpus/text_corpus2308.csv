11540,over the last several decades there have been concerns worldwide about energy demand several alternatives to oil have emerged among them the use of plant biomass for fuel sugarcane saccharum spp l and corn zea mays l have exhibited excellent potential in this regard these crops are highly efficient in producing carbohydrates which can easily be fermented to produce ethanol proper irrigation practices providing the ideal amount of water that the plant needs to reach its full potential yield are needed to maximize income from these crops sugarcane and corn are of great economic importance to the state of são paulo where it is common to irrigate these crops this research aims to determine conditions for increased productivity and water availability for these crops in the region of piracicaba sp under future climate scenarios to achieve this goal two crop simulation models presented in dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat canegro and ceres maize were coupled with the marksim model for estimating data for current and future 1982 2012 and 2062 2092 respectively climate scenarios information from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc was used to generate data for current conditions as well as future conditions the a1b a middle term scenario which there are a fast economic growth and balance in the use of sources of fossil and non fossil fuels the a2 a pessimistic scenario which there are a heterogeneous world and an oriented regional economic world and the b1 a optimistic scenario which there are local solutions to economic social and environmental sustainability based on these results for future scenarios sugarcane cultivar rb86 7515 yield will be reduced by approximately 40 if the cultivars are not genetically improved to maintain the same yield levels of hybrid corn br201 these will be necessary to increase irrigation water by 81 keywords crop growth models relative productivity climate change 1 introduction the cultivation of sugarcane saccharum officinarum is of great importance for the brazilian economy contributing extensively to foreign exchange generation this contribution is predicated on the many uses for sugarcane it can be enjoyed fresh or used for fodder in animal feed or to produce sugar ethanol energy brandy brown sugar or molasses it is currently cultivated on approximately 8 6 million hectares in brazil with an average yield of 70 t ha 1 producing a total production of about 596 million tons year 1 companhia nacional de abastecimento conab 2013a b it is cultivated in the states of são paulo goiás minas gerais paraná mato grosso do sul alagoas and pernambuco são paulo with an area of 4 5 million hectares is the largest producer on average 50 of brazilian sugarcane production is converted into alcohol and 40 to sugar conab 2013a b corn zea mays is one of the main cereals grown more around the world providing widely used products for human and animal consumption and raw materials for industry this can be attributed mainly to the amount and nature of the accumulated energy reserves stored in the corn because of its many uses corn is of significant socio economic value in addition to being an essential raw material for various agro industrial complexes fancelli and dourado neto 2000 currently corn is grown on 14 7 million hectares in brazil with an average yield of 4 9 t ha 1 resulting in a total annual crop of slightly more than 72 million tons year 1 conab 2013a b in brazil corn is grown in paraná mato grosso goiás minas gerais mato grosso do sul sao paulo and rio grande do sul with nearly 17 million tons year 1 in paraná the state with the largest production conab 2013a b according to doorembos and kassam 1979 the water requirement of sugarcane is 1500 2500 mm per season and irrigation management should be based on recommended allowable water deficit in the soil during each period of the phenological cycle souza et al 1999 using a cannon type sprinkler irrigation system obtained maximum stalk yields of 155 8 126 9 and 141 9 t ha 1 for the rb72 454 rb76 418 and sp70 1011 varieties respectively with 13 months water application depths of 1 568 1 424 and 1 589 mm respectively daily sugarcane water consumption in the main producing areas of the country varies from 2 to 6 mm day 1 depending on variety the stage of crop development and evapotranspirative demand in general the crop requires 250 ml of water to form 1 g dry matter bernardo et al 2006 corn requires 500 800 mm of water depending on climate for good production in one season doorembos and kassam 1979 wilson and shaw 1977 analyzing the results obtained by different authors found that the seasonal consumptive water use for corn ranged from 410 to 610 mm while fancelli 1991 reports a minimum water requirement of 300 350 mm for satisfactory non irrigated production if the available water is evenly distributed over the crop cycle corn grown for the production of dried grains consumes 400 700 mm of water on average during the entire growth cycle depending on weather conditions resende et al 2003 during the early vegetative stages of growth in mild climates consumptive water use does not exceed 2 5 mm day 1 however water use rises to 6 5 7 5 mm day 1 during flowering and fruiting crop growth simulation models facilitate the evaluation of agricultural production under a range of possible environmental conditions the simulation of production under several different scenarios allows the producer to determine the best crops varieties and management practices to reduce losses due to adverse growing conditions the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat simulates growth and development of crops over time considering climate soil management and genetic aspects of culture it also assists in data organization jones et al 2003 for sugarcane production system the routine uses the dssat canegro model inman bamber 1991 singels et al 2008 it is based on the ceres maize model jones et al 1986 and developed in south africa in order to model the most relevant physiological processes of the south african sugar industry inman bamber 1991 the ceres maize model according to jones et al 1986 is able to predict details of phenological stages and number of corn leaves in six stages p1 emergency thermal time until the end of the juvenile phase c day p2 extension of the development delay for each hour of increment in the photoperiod above which the development proceeds at the maximum rate h p5 thermal time between female flowering and physiological maturity c day g2 maximum number of grains per plant g3 grain filling rate during linear phase under optimum conditions mg day 1 and phy interval corresponding to the phyllochron between the appearance of subsequent leaves sensitivity to photoperiod and high temperature effects on the final number of leaves are considered furthermore the three stages of vegetative growth leaf initiation and leaf primordia appearance of initiation of flowering male can be independently tested kiniry 1991 the ceres maize model is grouped in a decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and has been widely used around the world it considers water balance processes in the soil radiation interception by the canopy dry matter production and biomass partition kiniry et al 1997 version 3 1 provides information on the spatial performance of simulations and analysis of the results thornton et al 1997 climate change may have a significant impact on the world economy in the twenty first century houghton 1996 affecting all economic sectors to a certain degree agricultural production however is the most sensitive and vulnerable sector since the weather is a determining factor in crop productivity watson et al 1996 marin et al 2007 reported that the simulation of future scenarios is useful to quantify the vulnerability of the productive sectors and to plan actions according to these new conditions according to pachauri and reisinger 2007 the recent estimates of temperature will rise around the range of 1 8 3 6 c the co2 concentration will increase around 720 ppm in 2090 2099 depending on the scenario of greenhouse gases emissions considered in the climate models marin and nassif 2013 showed that the increase in temperature and concentration of co2 for sugarcane is good to soil plant atmosphere connection increasing the sugarcane productivity yield and irrigation will decrease in corn while the crop will suffer water stress minuzzi and lopes 2015 marksim is a model that has been used along with dssat to simulate future scenarios it is a third order markov precipitation generator jones and thornton 1993 1997 1999 2000 jones et al 2002 which was developed more than 20 years ago marksim is essentially a daily rain simulator that uses a third order markov chain process to predict the occurrence of a rainy day it supplies weather data based on geographical position for the a1b a2 and b1 climate change scenarios in the formats used by dssat for a specified geographical position marksim model uses current weather data along with intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc projections to generate weather data for future years currently it supplies weather projections up to 2095 the main objective of this study was to compare sugarcane and corn response to different levels of irrigation for piracicaba sp brazil by applying the dssat canegro and ceres maize models with future weather scenarios simulated by the marksim model 2 material and methods the research was conducted at the department of biosystems engineering college of agriculture luiz de queiroz esalq usp located in piracicaba sp with cwa climate according to the köppen classification 22 43 33 of south latitude and 47 38 00 w with 546 m height the research was conducted in three distinct stages 1 developing an understanding of dssat 4 6 specifically the models canegro and ceres maize and using developing a climate and edaphic database for the city of piracicaba sp for sugarcane and corn 2 understanding future scenarios and projections of the ipcc intergovernmental panel climate changes and using marksim to simulate different scenarios of climate change and 3 performing statistical analysis for the two crops sugarcane and corn to characterize their simulated responses using dssat canegro and ceres maize to irrigation management under current conditions 1982 2012 and under projected climate scenarios 2062 2092 climatic data for 31 years 1982 2012 were obtained from a database for a conventional weather station located on top of the college of agriculture luiz de queiroz usp in piracicaba sp these daily data solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 maximum and minimum air temperatures c relative humidity precipitation mm and wind velocity m s 1 were used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith equation eq 1 the water deficit for the crop and the potential and current yields of sugarcane and corn 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 es ea represents the vapor pressure deficit of the air kpa γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 u2 is the wind velocity m s 1 and ta is the average air temperature c dssat 4 6 has an interface called weatherman which generate reference evapotranspiration data according to eq 1 the soil in this research was an oxisol with 1 2 m depth situated in experimental field of the biosystems engineering department of luiz de queiroz college of agriculture the soil data necessary to the model are clay 61 silt 17 and sand 21 content color red drainage well drained runoff moderately low slope 12 depth carbon 1 4 and nitrogen 0 1 content exchange cations capacity ecc 100 mmolc kg 1 and water ph 5 0 both dssat canegro and ceres maize use water balance as input data based on crop growth modeling processes growth and development of sugarcane and corn phenology canopy development and biomass accumulation are the output of these two models singels et al 2008 the dssat canegro and the ceres maize models were calibrated to improve their performances dssat canegro was calibrated and parameterized for the specific variety of sugarcane chosen for this study rb86 7515 by nassif et al 2012 the authors found 0 98 for r2 determination coefficient 0 82 for d wilmott index and 0 59 for rmse root mean square deviation besides that the authors found canegro parametrized for rb 86 7515 variety presented dry matter data very close to observed data with r2 0 6 d 0 6 and rmse 9 56 in all there are 74 parameters 31 related to ecotype 20 related to cultivar and 23 related to species the plant life cycle averages 530 days close to a year and a half ceres maize was calibrated for the br201 variety for the genetic coefficients p1 p2 and p5 defining the phenology g2 and g3 related to grain development by gedanken et al 1998 and phy define by hoogenboom et al 1994 the authors found 0 95 for r2 determination coefficient 0 74 for d wilmott index and 0 62 for rmse root mean square deviation the plant life cycle averages 120 days almost 4 months the planting season was april for sugarcane and february for corn the crucial point for the efficiency of the marksim model in simulating the current precipitation variance observed in both tropical and temperate regions is its innovative way of using re sampling the markov process parameters to do this a correlation matrix of twelve baseline probabilities twelve monthly baseline transfer probabilities i e the probability of a rainy day and three consecutive dry days and the probability coefficients related to the effect of each of the previous three days were used marksim offers weather data in the exact form dssat can read with the most common and easy to use program units the a1b a2 and b1 scenarios of ipcc to be defined below were then obtained and only the geographical position of the locality was used in the models based on the geographic position of the locality the marksim model uses the current climatic data of the region and from the projections of the ipcc generates climatic data for future years the carbon dioxide was established in 720 ppm as in ipcc fourth report 2007 three scenarios from the ipcc 2007 fourth assessment report a1b a2 and b1 were simulated with the marksim for the 31 years from 2062 to 2092 their respective characteristics are as follows a1b an integrated and unsustainable world economic growth fast global population peaks in mid century and then starts to decline globalization to reduce regional differences reduction in regional differences in per capita incomes balanced in the use of sources of fossil and non fossil fuels a2 fragmented and unsustainable world maintenance of local identities continued population growth economic development oriented regional level fragmented technological development b1 integrated world local solutions to economic social and environmental sustainability consistently growing population however at lower rates economic and technological development accelerated and less diverse oriented towards environmental protection and social equality after obtaining the results of dry matter yield kg ha 1 grain yield kg ha 1 saccharose yield kg ha 1 crop water consumption mm day 1 water irrigation mm day 1 grain yield per water amount kg grains m 3 saccharose yield per water amount kg c12h22o11 m 3 statistical analyzes were performed comparing the averages by tukey method at the 5 probability level in order to determine if the irrigation management used currently can be applied in future scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate changes projections climate changes projections were made with marksim based in the piracicaba weather with the years 1982 2012 table 1 shows the average of meteorological variables maximum and minimum temperature c global radiation mj m 2 day 1 and rain mm for piracicaba for these years the highest values for global radiation rain and maximum and minimum temperature occurred from october to march which indicates a warm and humid summer the others months express the cold and dry winter november and december were the months which presented the highest values for global radiation 20 17 and 19 60 mj m 2 day 1 respectively february and march were the months which presented the highest values for maximum temperature 31 02 and 30 41 c respectively january and february were the months which presented the highest values for minimum temperature 19 51 and 19 48 c respectively january and december are the months which presented the highest values for rain 243 65 and 189 99 mm respectively on another hand may and june were the months which presented the lowest values for global radiation 13 38 and 12 34 mj m 2 day 1 respectively june and july were the months which presented the lowest values for maximum temperature 24 41 and 25 72 c respectively again june and july were the months which presented the lowest values for minimum temperature 11 06 and 10 69 c and july and august were the months which presented the lowest values for rain 33 93 and 30 71 mm the highest value of variation coefficient for global radiation presented was in august 16 83 for maximum temperature was in september 6 52 for minimum temperature was in july 13 39 and for rain was also in july 116 65 this information indicates the weather in winter is more unstable then in summer the climate changes projections were obtained after the simulations then it was possible to analyze meteorological data global radiation rain maximum and minimum temperature for thirty one years 2062 2092 for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios fig 1 shows the average meteorological data deviations for the three future scenarios for thirty one years 2062 2092 the highest values for global radiation deviation were obtained in march 4 38 4 98 and 4 98 mj m 2 day 1 for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the highest values for rain deviation were obtained in january 215 05 184 85 and 141 35 mm for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the highest values for maximum temperature deviation were obtained in november 3 30 3 30 and 2 70 c for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the highest values for minimum temperature deviation were also obtained in november 4 09 4 04 and 3 54 c for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively on another hand the lowest values for global radiation deviation were obtained in january for a1 b scenario 4 70 mj m 2 day 1 and december for a2 and b1 scenarios 4 40 and 3 60 mj m 2 day 1 respectively the lowest values for rain deviation were obtained in march 116 85 115 25 and 149 95 mm for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the lowest values for maximum temperature deviation were obtained in july 3 22 3 42 and 3 62 c for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the lowest values for minimum temperature deviation were also obtained in july 0 89 1 29 and 1 49 c for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively it was expected these deviations caused variations in sugarcane and corn yield in rainfed and irrigated conditions 3 2 sugarcane the three future scenarios are ipcc projections about the climate including changes in solar radiation temperature and rain sugarcane dry matter yield and saccharose yield will be reduced in whatever future scenario under rainfed or irrigated condition table 2 one way to compare sugarcane yields for these different scenarios is through the relative yield indices these indices are the ratio of future scenarios yield through current scenario yield fig 2 the dry matter yield of the current scenario under the rainfed condition was 116 923 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 77 963 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 66 7 for the relative yield indicating a 33 3 reduction this average ranges from 68 3 79 593 kg ha 1 for the a2 scenario to 65 6 76 776 kg ha 1 for b1 scenario fig 2a the same results were found for the irrigated conditions the dry matter yield of the current scenario under the irrigated condition was 136 329 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 90 001 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 66 0 for the relative yield indicating a 34 0 reduction this average ranges from 66 6 90 846 kg ha 1 for the a2 scenario to 65 1 88 774 kg ha 1 for b1 scenario fig 2c the dry matter yield increased 19 406 kg ha 1 in the current scenario when irrigation is used on the other hand the dry matter yield increases just 12 038 kg ha 1 in average in the future scenarios when irrigation is used likewise the saccharose yield of the current scenario under the rainfed condition was 20 146 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 14 003 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 69 5 indicating a 30 5 reduction this average ranges from 70 9 14 296 kg ha 1 for the a2 scenario to 68 1 13 725 kg ha 1 for a1b scenario fig 2b the saccharose yield of the current scenario under the irrigated condition was 23 557 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 15 885 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 67 4 indicating a 32 6 reduction this average ranges from 68 7 16 194 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to 66 4 13 725 kg ha 1 for a1 b scenario fig 2d the saccharose yield increases 3411 kg ha 1 in the current scenario when irrigation is used however the saccharose yield increases 1882 kg ha 1 in average in the future scenarios when irrigation is used table 3 shows the water amount used by sugarcane mm day 1 and the saccharose yield per absorbed water kg m 3 sugarcane absorbs 0 83 mm day 1 more water when irrigated in the current scenario however the saccharose yield decreases 1 kg m 3 when irrigation is used in this scenario in the a1b and a2 scenarios sugarcane absorbs 0 47 mm day 1 more water when irrigated moreover the saccharose yield decreases 0 2 kg m 3 when irrigation is used in these scenarios the only exception is the b1 scenario it presents the lowest addition in water absorbed when sugarcane is used 0 4 mm day 1 and it presents an increase of 0 3 kg m 3 with irrigation in the rainfed conditions the b1 scenario is the one that sugarcane absorbs more water in comparison with others however in the irrigated condition the b1 and the current scenario don t differ with 5 probability at tukey test on the other hand saccharose yield per absorbed water is higher in the current scenario 12 3 kg m 3 in rainfed condition and 11 3 kg m 3 in irrigated condition when compared with future scenarios 8 23 kg m 3 in rainfed condition and 8 2 kg m 3 in irrigated condition with 5 probability at tukey test this probably occurred because sugarcane had its water demand supplied in order to evaluate if current irrigation management can be used in the future scenarios to achieve current yield saccharose yield gain kg m 3 was compared between the current and the future scenarios table 4 the current scenario presents the highest saccharose yield at 5 probability at tukey test however the b1 scenario presents the higher saccharose yield gain 10 7 kg m 3 and the lower water depth 0 39 mm day 1 it means that the b1 scenario features the best environment to sugarcane crop compared with another future scenarios and current scenario with 5 probability at tukey test it is possible to observe the water applied by irrigation decreases while the water consumed by the plant remains the same this occurred because there is an increase in the amount of water coming by the rain in summer the b1 scenario has the lowest deviations when rain decreases that is why the water applied by irrigation decrease according fig 1 there are increases in global radiation around 5 mj m 2 day 1 in february and around 7 mj m 2 day 1 in march in minimum temperature around 2 c in february and march and in maximum temperature 0 5 c in february and 0 25 c in march in the season beginning this accelerates the crop growing and decreases the water needs in addition sugarcane needs water in the season beginning as the first development stages were shortened the water needs and the water applied decrease on the other hand there is large rain decrease in february around 125 mm which affects the water availability for sugarcane this fact corroborates with the irrigation necessity to get large yields finally if the same irrigation management were kept for any future scenarios there will be around 34 decrease in yield of sugarcane dry matter and 32 6 in yield of sugarcane saccharose according to simulations irrigation won t be an efficient practice to increase saccharose yield in the future scenarios yield will be reduced in whatever future scenario simulated even though there is irrigation the yields of future scenarios don t reach in the yield of current scenario therefore the current yield can t be achieved if only the irrigation practice is used 3 3 corn as in sugarcane corn dry matter yield and grains yield are presented for current and three future scenarios in rainfed and irrigated conditions table 5 the relative yield was also used to compare corn yields for these scenarios the indices are the ratio of future scenarios yield through current scenario yield fig 3 the dry matter yield of the current scenario under the rainfed condition was 13 929 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 8160 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 58 6 for the relative yield indicating a 41 4 reduction this average ranges from 64 8 9020 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to 55 4 7723 kg ha 1 for a2 scenario fig 3a on the other hand the dry matter yield of the current scenario under the irrigated condition was 17 772 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 17 343 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 97 6 for the relative yield indicating only a 2 4 reduction this average ranges from 100 8 17 910 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to 94 4 16 781 kg ha 1 for a1 b scenario fig 3c the dry matter yield increases 3843 kg ha 1 in the current scenario when irrigation is used but what is different here the dry matter yield increases 9182 kg ha 1 in average in the future scenarios when irrigation is used the grains yield of the current scenario under the rainfed condition was 4405 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 1944 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 44 1 indicating a 55 9 reduction this average ranges from 53 5 2358 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to38 5 1698 kg ha 1 for a2 scenario fig 3b the grains yield of the current scenario under the irrigated condition was 6510 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 7376 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 113 3 indicating a 13 3 increase this average ranges from 121 4 7902 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to 106 5 6931 kg ha 1 for a1 b scenario fig 3d the grains yield increases 1105 kg ha 1 in the current scenario when irrigation is used however the grains yield increases 5432 kg ha 1 in average in the future scenarios when irrigation is used table 6 shows the water amount used by corn mm day 1 and the grain yield per absorbed water kg m 3 corn absorbs 1 07 mm day 1 more water when irrigated in the current scenario the grains yield increases 1 1 kg ha 1 when irrigation is used in these scenarios in the a1b scenario corn absorbs 2 28 mm day 1 when irrigated and grains yield increases 5 0 kg m 3 in the a2 scenario corn absorbs 2 23 mm day 1 when irrigation is used however grains yield increases 6 6 kg m 3 likewise in the b1 scenario corn absorbs 1 95 mm day 1 when irrigation is used and grains yield increases 6 0 kg m 3 in the rainfed conditions current scenario is different from future scenarios with 5 probability at tukey test likewise in the irrigated conditions the current scenario is also different from future scenarios with 5 probability at tukey test on the other hand grains yield per absorbed water is lower in the a2 scenario 9 8 kg m 3 when compared with others scenarios with 5 probability at tukey test when irrigation is used grains yield per millimeter of absorbed water is higher in the future scenarios 16 3 kg m 3 in average for the future scenarios when compared to current scenario 11 9 kg m 3 with 5 probability at tukey test in order to evaluate if current irrigation management can be used in the future scenarios to achieve current yield grains yield gains kg m 3 was compared between the current and the future scenarios table 7 the b1 scenario presents the highest grains yield at 5 probability at tukey test in the corn crop the b1 scenario presents the higher grains yield gain 21 7 kg m 3 and the lower water depth applied 2 0 mm day 1 it means that the b1 scenario followed by the others future scenarios the best environment to corn crop compared with current scenario with 5 probability at tukey test likewise sugarcane it is possible to observe the water applied by irrigation decreases while the water consumed by the plant remains the same this occurred because there is an increase in the amount of water coming by the rain in summer the b1 scenario has the lowest deviations when rain decreases that is why the water applied by irrigation decrease again according to fig 1 there are increases in global radiation around 5 mj m 2 day 1 in february and around 7 mj m 2 day 1 in march in minimum temperature around 2 c in february and march and in maximum temperature 0 5 c in february and 0 25 c in march these facts reduce the corn lifetime when occur in season beginning on the other hand there is large rain decrease in february around 125 mm which affects the water availability for corn at this stage corn needs water to grow as faster as it can to sustain the flowering around 60 days after the plants emergence because of that irrigation supply the water needs in the corn beggining and decreases the water needs in the entire crop 4 conclusion dssat canegro and ceres maize were used to simulate sugarcane and corn growth respectively under current and simulated future scenarios in brazil in rainfed and irrigated conditions based on tukey test at 5 probability the conclusions are 1 sugarcane crop won t present the same dry matter and saccharose yields presented in the current scenario in the future scenarios the water requirements and the depth of water for irrigation won t change however the b1 scenario presents the high saccharose yield per water for irrigation depth 10 7 kg m 3 with 5 probability in tukey test 2 irrigation will help to stabilize sugarcane productivity it will also be necessary to explore other techniques such as new cultivar development and adoption of new technologies 3 supplemental irrigation will be of vital importance to maintain corn yield water should be managed as part of a comprehensive plan for water preservation and rational use 4 corn will need high water depths under the future scenarios on average 2 2 mm day 1 of water will be needed to maintain current levels of corn yield currency corn needs 1 2 mm day 1 5 the models dssat canegro and ceres maize are suitable tools for studying the performance of crops under future climate scenarios the marksim model is also of importance as it can be used to provide input climate data for future scenarios indicated by the ipcc for both models 6 this research is only a small part of major study about yield using crop growth modeling it will be necessary to carry out more studies with future weather conditions using different varieties or hybrids of crops and compare the modeled results with current data from farms

são paulo goiás minas gerais paraná mato grosso do sul alagoas and pernambuco são paulo with an area of 4 5 million hectares is the largest producer on average 50 of brazilian sugarcane production is converted into alcohol and 40 to sugar conab 2013a b corn zea mays is one of the main cereals grown more around the world providing widely used products for human and animal consumption and raw materials for industry this can be attributed mainly to the amount and nature of the accumulated energy reserves stored in the corn because of its many uses corn is of significant socio economic value in addition to being an essential raw material for various agro industrial complexes fancelli and dourado neto 2000 currently corn is grown on 14 7 million hectares in brazil with an average yield of

rio grande do sul with nearly 17 million tons year 1 in paraná the state with the largest production conab 2013a b according to doorembos and kassam 1979 the water requirement of sugarcane is 1500 2500 mm per season and irrigation management should be based on recommended allowable water deficit in the soil during each period of the phenological cycle souza et al 1999 using a cannon type sprinkler irrigation system obtained maximum stalk yields of 155 8 126 9 and 141 9 t ha 1 for the rb72 454 rb76 418 and sp70 1011 varieties respectively with 13 months water application depths of 1 568 1 424 and 1 589 mm respectively daily sugarcane water consumption in the main producing areas of the country varies from 2 to 6 mm day 1 depending on variety the stage of crop development and evapotranspirative demand in general the crop requires 250 ml of water to form 1 g dry matter bernardo et al 2006 corn requires 500 800 mm of water depending on climate for good production in one season doorembos and kassam 1979 wilson and shaw 1977 analyzing the results obtained by different authors found that the seasonal consumptive water use for corn ranged from 410 to 610 mm while fancelli 1991 reports a minimum water requirement of 300 350 mm for satisfactory non irrigated production if the available water is evenly distributed over the crop cycle corn grown for the production of dried grains consumes 400 700 mm of water on average during the entire growth cycle depending on weather conditions resende et al 2003 during the early vegetative stages of growth in mild climates consumptive water use does not exceed 2 5 mm day 1 however water use rises to 6 5 7 5 mm day 1 during flowering and fruiting crop growth simulation models facilitate the evaluation of agricultural production under a range of possible environmental conditions the simulation of production under several different scenarios allows the producer to determine the best crops varieties and management practices to reduce losses due to adverse growing conditions the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat simulates growth and development of crops over time considering climate soil management and genetic aspects of culture it also assists in data organization jones et al 2003 for sugarcane production system the routine uses the dssat canegro model inman bamber 1991 singels et al 2008 it is based on the ceres maize model jones et al 1986 and developed in south africa in order to model the most relevant physiological processes of the south african sugar industry inman bamber 1991 the ceres maize model according to jones et al 1986 is able to predict details of phenological stages and number of corn leaves in six stages p1 emergency thermal time until the end of the juvenile phase c day p2 extension of the development delay for each hour of increment in the photoperiod above which the development proceeds at the maximum rate h p5 thermal time between female flowering and physiological maturity c day g2 maximum number of grains per plant g3 grain filling rate during linear phase under optimum conditions mg day 1 and phy interval corresponding to the phyllochron between the appearance of subsequent leaves sensitivity to photoperiod and high temperature effects on the final number of leaves are considered furthermore the three stages of vegetative growth leaf initiation and leaf primordia appearance of initiation of flowering male can be independently tested kiniry 1991 the ceres maize model is grouped in a decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat and has been widely used around the world it considers water balance processes in the soil radiation interception by the canopy dry matter production and biomass partition kiniry et al 1997 version 3 1 provides information on the spatial performance of simulations and analysis of the results thornton et al 1997 climate change may have a significant impact on the world economy in the twenty first century houghton 1996 affecting all economic sectors to a certain degree agricultural production however is the most sensitive and vulnerable sector since the weather is a determining factor in crop productivity watson et al 1996 marin et al 2007 reported that the simulation of future scenarios is useful to quantify the vulnerability of the productive sectors and to plan actions according to these new conditions according to pachauri and reisinger 2007 the recent estimates of temperature will rise around the range of 1 8 3 6 c the co2 concentration will increase around 720 ppm in 2090 2099 depending on the scenario of greenhouse gases emissions considered in the climate models marin and nassif 2013 showed that the increase in temperature and concentration of co2 for sugarcane is good to soil plant atmosphere connection increasing the sugarcane productivity yield and irrigation will decrease in corn while the crop will suffer water stress minuzzi and lopes 2015 marksim is a model that has been used along with dssat to simulate future scenarios it is a third order markov precipitation generator jones and thornton 1993 1997 1999 2000 jones et al 2002 which was developed more than 20 years ago marksim is essentially a daily rain simulator that uses a third order markov chain process to predict the occurrence of a rainy day it supplies weather data based on geographical position for the a1b a2 and b1 climate change scenarios in the formats used by dssat for a specified geographical position marksim model uses current weather data along with intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc projections to generate weather data for future years currently it supplies weather projections up to 2095 the main objective of this study was to compare sugarcane and corn response to different levels of irrigation for piracicaba sp brazil by applying the dssat canegro and ceres maize models with future weather scenarios simulated by the marksim model 2 material and methods the research was conducted at the department of biosystems engineering college of agriculture luiz de queiroz esalq usp located in piracicaba sp with cwa climate according to the köppen classification 22 43 33 of south latitude and 47 38 00 w with 546 m height the research was conducted in three distinct stages 1 developing an understanding of dssat 4 6 specifically the models canegro and ceres maize and using developing a climate and edaphic database for the city of piracicaba sp for sugarcane and corn 2 understanding future scenarios and projections of the ipcc intergovernmental panel climate changes and using marksim to simulate different scenarios of climate change and 3 performing statistical analysis for the two crops sugarcane and corn to characterize their simulated responses using dssat canegro and ceres maize to irrigation management under current conditions 1982 2012 and under projected climate scenarios 2062 2092 climatic data for 31 years 1982 2012 were obtained from a database for a conventional weather station located on top of the college of agriculture luiz de queiroz usp in piracicaba sp these daily data solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 maximum and minimum air temperatures c relative humidity precipitation mm and wind velocity m s 1 were used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith equation eq 1 the water deficit for the crop and the potential and current yields of sugarcane and corn 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the

c 1 u2 is the wind velocity m s 1 and ta is the average air temperature c dssat 4 6 has an interface called weatherman which generate reference evapotranspiration data according to eq 1 the soil in this research was an oxisol with 1 2 m depth situated in experimental field of the biosystems engineering department of luiz de queiroz college of agriculture the soil data necessary to the model are clay 61 silt 17 and sand 21 content color red drainage well drained runoff moderately low slope 12 depth carbon 1 4 and nitrogen 0 1 content exchange cations capacity ecc 100 mmolc kg 1 and water ph 5 0 both dssat canegro and ceres maize use water balance as input data based on crop growth modeling processes growth and development of sugarcane and corn phenology canopy development and biomass accumulation are the output of these two models singels et al 2008 the dssat canegro and the ceres maize models were calibrated to improve their performances dssat canegro was calibrated and parameterized for the specific variety of sugarcane chosen for this study rb86 7515 by nassif et al 2012 the authors found 0 98 for r2 determination coefficient 0 82 for d wilmott index and 0 59 for rmse root mean square deviation besides that the authors found canegro parametrized for rb 86 7515 variety presented dry matter data very close to observed data with r2 0 6 d 0 6 and rmse 9 56 in all there are 74 parameters 31 related to ecotype 20 related to cultivar and 23 related to species the plant life cycle averages 530 days close to a year and a half ceres maize was calibrated for the br201 variety for the genetic coefficients p1 p2 and p5 defining the phenology g2 and g3 related to grain development by gedanken et al 1998 and phy define by hoogenboom et al 1994 the authors found 0 95 for r2 determination coefficient 0 74 for d wilmott index and 0 62 for rmse root mean square deviation the plant life cycle averages 120 days almost 4 months the planting season was april for sugarcane and february for corn the crucial point for the efficiency of the marksim model in simulating the current precipitation variance observed in both tropical and temperate regions is its innovative way of using re sampling the markov process parameters to do this a correlation matrix of twelve baseline probabilities twelve monthly baseline transfer probabilities i e the probability of a rainy day and three consecutive dry days and the probability coefficients related to the effect of each of the previous three days were used marksim offers weather data in the exact form dssat can read with the most common and easy to use program units the a1b a2 and b1 scenarios of ipcc to be defined below were then obtained and only the geographical position of the locality was used in the models based on the geographic position of the locality the marksim model uses the current climatic data of the region and from the projections of the ipcc generates climatic data for future years the carbon dioxide was established in 720 ppm as in ipcc fourth report 2007 three scenarios from the ipcc 2007 fourth assessment report a1b a2 and b1 were simulated with the marksim for the 31 years from 2062 to 2092 their respective characteristics are as follows a1b an integrated and unsustainable world economic growth fast global population peaks in mid century and then starts to decline globalization to reduce regional differences reduction in regional differences in per capita incomes balanced in the use of sources of fossil and non fossil fuels a2 fragmented and unsustainable world maintenance of local identities continued population growth economic development oriented regional level fragmented technological development b1 integrated world local solutions to economic social and environmental sustainability consistently growing population however at lower rates economic and technological development accelerated and less diverse oriented towards environmental protection and social equality after obtaining the results of dry matter yield kg ha 1 grain yield kg ha 1 saccharose yield kg ha 1 crop water consumption mm day 1 water irrigation mm day 1 grain yield per water

the irrigation management used currently can be applied in future scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate changes projections climate changes projections were made with marksim based in the piracicaba weather with the years 1982 2012 table 1 shows the average of meteorological variables maximum and minimum temperature c global radiation mj m 2 day 1 and rain mm for piracicaba for these years the highest values for global radiation rain and maximum and minimum temperature occurred from october to march which indicates a warm and humid summer the others months express the cold and dry winter november and december were the months which presented the highest values for global radiation 20 17 and 19 60 mj m 2 day 1 respectively february and march were the months which presented the highest values for maximum temperature 31 02 and 30 41 c respectively january and february were the months which presented the highest values for minimum temperature 19 51 and 19 48 c respectively january and december are the months which presented the highest values for rain 243 65 and 189 99 mm respectively on another hand may and june were the months which presented the lowest values for global radiation 13 38 and 12 34 mj m 2 day 1 respectively june and july were the months which presented the lowest values for maximum temperature 24 41 and 25 72 c respectively again june and july were the months which presented the lowest values for minimum temperature 11 06 and 10 69 c and july and august were the months which presented the lowest values for rain 33 93 and 30 71 mm the highest value of variation coefficient for global radiation presented was in august 16 83 for maximum temperature was in september 6 52 for minimum temperature was in july 13 39 and for rain was also in july 116 65 this information indicates the weather in winter is more unstable then in summer the climate changes projections were obtained after the simulations then it was possible to analyze meteorological data global radiation rain maximum and minimum temperature for thirty one years 2062 2092 for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios fig 1 shows the average meteorological data deviations for the three future scenarios for thirty one years 2062 2092 the highest values for global radiation deviation were obtained in march 4 38 4 98 and 4 98 mj m 2 day 1 for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the highest values for rain deviation were obtained in january 215 05 184 85 and 141 35 mm for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the highest values for maximum temperature deviation were obtained in november 3 30 3 30 and 2 70 c for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the highest values for minimum temperature deviation were also obtained in november 4 09 4 04 and 3 54 c for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively on another hand the lowest values for global radiation deviation were obtained in january for a1 b scenario 4 70 mj m 2 day 1 and december for a2 and b1 scenarios 4 40 and 3 60 mj m 2 day 1 respectively the lowest values for rain deviation were obtained in march 116 85 115 25 and 149 95 mm for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the lowest values for maximum temperature deviation were obtained in july 3 22 3 42 and 3 62 c for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively the lowest values for minimum temperature deviation were also obtained in july 0 89 1 29 and 1 49 c for a1b a2 and b1 scenarios respectively it was expected these deviations caused variations in sugarcane and corn yield in rainfed and irrigated conditions 3 2 sugarcane the three future scenarios are ipcc projections about the climate including changes in solar radiation temperature and rain sugarcane dry matter yield and saccharose yield will be reduced in whatever future scenario under rainfed or irrigated condition table 2 one way to compare sugarcane yields for these different scenarios is through the relative yield indices these indices are the ratio of future scenarios yield through current scenario yield fig 2 the dry matter yield of the current scenario under the rainfed condition was 116 923 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 77 963 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 66 7 for the relative yield indicating a 33 3 reduction this average ranges from 68 3 79 593 kg ha 1 for the a2 scenario to 65 6 76 776 kg ha 1 for b1 scenario fig 2a the same results were found for the irrigated conditions the dry matter yield of the current scenario under the irrigated condition was 136 329 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 90 001 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 66 0 for the relative yield indicating a 34 0 reduction this average ranges from 66 6 90 846 kg ha 1 for the a2 scenario to 65 1 88 774 kg ha 1 for b1 scenario fig 2c the dry matter yield increased 19 406 kg ha 1 in the current scenario when irrigation is used on the other hand the dry matter yield increases just 12 038 kg ha 1 in average in the future scenarios when irrigation is used likewise the saccharose yield of the current scenario under the rainfed condition was 20 146 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 14 003 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 69 5 indicating a 30 5 reduction this average ranges from 70 9 14 296 kg ha 1 for the a2 scenario to 68 1 13 725 kg ha 1 for a1b scenario fig 2b the saccharose yield of the current scenario under the irrigated condition was 23 557 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 15 885 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 67 4 indicating a 32 6 reduction this average ranges from 68 7 16 194 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to 66 4 13 725 kg ha 1 for a1 b scenario fig 2d the saccharose yield increases 3411 kg ha 1 in the current scenario when irrigation is used however the saccharose yield increases 1882 kg ha 1 in average in the future scenarios when irrigation is used table 3 shows the water amount used by sugarcane mm day 1 and the saccharose yield per absorbed water kg m 3 sugarcane absorbs 0 83 mm day 1 more water when irrigated in the current scenario however the saccharose yield decreases 1 kg m 3 when irrigation is used in this scenario in the a1b and a2 scenarios sugarcane absorbs 0 47 mm day 1 more water when irrigated moreover the saccharose yield decreases 0 2 kg m 3 when irrigation is used in these scenarios the only exception is the b1 scenario it presents the lowest addition in water absorbed when sugarcane is used 0 4 mm day 1 and it presents an increase of 0 3 kg m 3 with irrigation in the rainfed conditions the b1 scenario is the one that sugarcane absorbs more water in comparison with others however in the irrigated condition the b1 and the current scenario don t differ with 5 probability at tukey test on the other hand saccharose yield per absorbed water is higher in the current scenario 12 3 kg m 3 in rainfed condition and 11 3 kg m 3 in irrigated condition when compared with future scenarios 8 23 kg m 3 in rainfed condition and 8 2 kg m 3 in irrigated condition with 5 probability at tukey test this probably occurred because sugarcane had its water demand supplied in order to evaluate if current irrigation management can be used in the future scenarios to achieve current yield saccharose yield gain kg m 3 was compared between the current and the future scenarios table 4 the current scenario presents the highest saccharose yield at 5 probability at tukey test however the b1 scenario presents the higher saccharose yield gain 10 7 kg m 3 and the lower water depth 0 39 mm day 1 it means that the b1 scenario features the best environment to sugarcane crop compared with another future scenarios and current scenario with 5 probability at tukey test it is possible to observe the water applied by irrigation decreases while the water consumed by the plant remains the same this occurred because there is an increase in the amount of water coming by the rain in summer the b1 scenario has the lowest deviations when rain decreases that is why the water applied by irrigation decrease according fig 1 there are increases in global radiation around 5 mj m 2 day 1 in february and around 7 mj m 2 day 1 in march in minimum temperature around 2 c in february and march and in maximum temperature 0 5 c in february and 0 25 c in march in the season beginning this accelerates the crop growing and decreases the water needs in addition sugarcane needs water in the season beginning as the first development stages were shortened the water needs and the water applied decrease on the other hand there is large rain decrease in february around 125 mm which affects the water availability for sugarcane this fact corroborates with the irrigation necessity to get large yields finally if the same irrigation management were kept for any future scenarios there will be around 34 decrease in yield of sugarcane dry matter and 32 6 in yield of sugarcane saccharose according to simulations irrigation won t be an efficient practice to increase saccharose yield in the future scenarios yield will be reduced in whatever future scenario simulated even though there is irrigation the yields of future scenarios don t reach in the yield of current scenario therefore the current yield can t be achieved if only the irrigation practice is used 3 3 corn as in sugarcane corn dry matter yield and grains yield are presented for current and three future scenarios in rainfed and irrigated conditions table 5 the relative yield was also used to compare corn yields for these scenarios the indices are the ratio of future scenarios yield through current scenario yield fig 3 the dry matter yield of the current scenario under the rainfed condition was 13 929 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 8160 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 58 6 for the relative yield indicating a 41 4 reduction this average ranges from 64 8 9020 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to 55 4 7723 kg ha 1 for a2 scenario fig 3a on the other hand the dry matter yield of the current scenario under the irrigated condition was 17 772 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 17 343 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 97 6 for the relative yield indicating only a 2 4 reduction this average ranges from 100 8 17 910 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to 94 4 16 781 kg ha 1 for a1 b scenario fig 3c the dry matter yield increases 3843 kg ha 1 in the current scenario when irrigation is used but what is different here the dry matter yield increases 9182 kg ha 1 in average in the future scenarios when irrigation is used the grains yield of the current scenario under the rainfed condition was 4405 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 1944 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 44 1 indicating a 55 9 reduction this average ranges from 53 5 2358 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to38 5 1698 kg ha 1 for a2 scenario fig 3b the grains yield of the current scenario under the irrigated condition was 6510 kg ha 1 and the average of the yield for the three future scenarios under the same condition was 7376 kg ha 1 these numbers led to an average of 113 3 indicating a 13 3 increase this average ranges from 121 4 7902 kg ha 1 for the b1 scenario to 106 5 6931 kg ha 1 for a1 b scenario fig 3d the grains yield increases 1105 kg ha 1 in the current scenario when irrigation is used however the grains yield increases 5432 kg ha 1 in average in the future scenarios when irrigation is used table 6 shows the water amount used by corn mm day 1 and the grain yield per absorbed water kg m 3 corn absorbs 1 07 mm day 1 more water when irrigated in the current scenario the grains yield increases 1 1 kg ha 1 when irrigation is used in these scenarios in the a1b scenario corn absorbs 2 28 mm day 1 when irrigated and grains yield increases 5 0 kg m 3 in the a2 scenario corn absorbs 2 23 mm day 1 when irrigation is used however grains yield increases 6 6 kg m 3 likewise in the b1 scenario corn absorbs 1 95 mm day 1 when irrigation is used and grains yield increases 6 0 kg m 3 in the rainfed conditions current scenario is different from future scenarios with 5 probability at tukey test likewise in the irrigated conditions the current scenario is also different from future scenarios with 5 probability at tukey test on the other hand grains yield per absorbed water is lower in the a2 scenario 9 8 kg m 3 when compared with others scenarios with 5 probability at tukey test when irrigation is used grains yield per millimeter of absorbed water is higher in the future scenarios 16 3 kg m 3 in average for the future scenarios when compared to current scenario 11 9 kg m 3 with 5 probability at tukey test in order to evaluate if current irrigation management can be used in the future scenarios to achieve current yield grains yield gains kg m 3 was compared between the current and the future scenarios table 7 the b1 scenario presents the highest grains yield at 5 probability at tukey test in the corn crop the b1 scenario presents the higher grains yield gain 21 7 kg m 3 and the lower water depth applied 2 0 mm day 1 it means that the b1 scenario followed by the others future scenarios the best environment to corn crop compared with current scenario with 5 probability at tukey test likewise sugarcane it is possible to observe the water applied by irrigation decreases while the water consumed by the plant remains the same this occurred because there is an increase in the amount of water coming by the rain in summer the b1 scenario has the lowest deviations when rain decreases that is why the water applied by irrigation decrease again according to fig 1 there are increases in global radiation around 5 mj m 2 day 1 in february and around 7 mj m 2 day 1 in march in minimum temperature around 2 c in february and march and in maximum temperature 0 5 c in february and 0 25 c in march these facts reduce the corn lifetime when occur in season beginning on the other hand there is large rain decrease in february around 125 mm which affects the water availability for corn at this stage corn needs water to grow as faster as it can to sustain the flowering around 60 days after the plants emergence because of that irrigation supply the water needs in the corn beggining and decreases the water needs in the entire crop 4 conclusion dssat canegro and ceres maize were used to simulate sugarcane and corn growth respectively under current and simulated future scenarios in brazil in rainfed and irrigated conditions based on tukey test at 5 probability the conclusions are 1 sugarcane crop won t present the same dry matter and saccharose yields presented in the current scenario in the future scenarios the water requirements and the depth of water for irrigation won t change however the b1 scenario presents the high saccharose yield per water for irrigation depth 10 7 kg m 3 with 5 probability in tukey test 2 irrigation will help to stabilize sugarcane productivity it will also be necessary to explore other techniques such as new cultivar development and adoption of new technologies 3 supplemental irrigation will be of vital importance to maintain corn yield water should be managed as part of a comprehensive plan for water preservation and rational use 4 corn will need high water depths under the future scenarios on average 2 2 mm day 1 of water will be needed to maintain current levels of corn yield currency corn needs 1 2 mm day 1 5 the models dssat canegro and ceres maize are suitable tools for studying the performance of crops under future climate scenarios the marksim model is also of importance as it can be used to provide input climate data for future scenarios indicated by the ipcc for both models 6 this research is only a small part of major study about yield using crop growth modeling it will be necessary to carry out more studies with future weather conditions using different varieties or hybrids of crops and compare the modeled results with current data from farms

11541,determining the effect of different cultivation techniques on photosynthetic characteristics dry matter translocation and water use efficiency wue will provide insight for the development of water saving farming systems and exploiting the photosynthetic characteristics of winter wheat under deficit irrigation in the current study a mobile rainproof shelter was used to explore the potential role of two cultivation techniques 1 the ridge and furrow precipitation harvesting technique r and 2 the flat cultivation technique f under two levels of deficit irrigation 150 75 mm levels and three levels of rainfall 1 275 2 200 3 125 mm we found that cultivation technique had a significant effect on rainfall water harvesting and enhanced soil water content under all levels of deficit

f cultivation technique the r cultivation technique significantly improved photosynthetic characteristics such as pn gs tr ci and dry matter translocation in the later growth stage grain filling stage compared with the f cultivation technique at each irrigation and rainfall level furthermore these photosynthetic parameters were positively correlated with dry matter translocation soil water content and grain yield the greatest improvement in the photosynthetic characteristics translocation efficiency wue grain production and economic return was achieved when using the r cultivation technique with 150 mm deficit irrigation and 200 mm simulated rainfall r2150 therefore we conclude that the r2150 treatment is the best water saving management strategy for growing wheat crops in rain fed farming systems keywords cultivation techniques photosynthetic characteristics dry matter translocation water use efficiency deficit irrigation soil water content 1 introduction in semi arid regions of china water shortages low rainfall and drought occur regularly during wheat growing periods and are the major bottlenecks affecting wheat production and water use efficiency wue adverse dry weather during the winter wheat growing season is like to increase due to projected global ecological change and could have a harmful effect on crop production kang et al 2002 richards 2000 water deficiency is not only a serious ecological issue but a limiting factor affecting crop growth and production kang et al 2000 pampino et al 2006 the negative effects of water deficit on crop production along with the cost of pumping of irrigation water insufficient facilities for irrigation manufacturing and restricted water sources have forced several farmers to use irrigation water more efficiently cakir 2004 du et al 2010 in fact the only way to sustain cereal production in semi arid regions is to efficiently use irrigation water develop water saving farming strategies and improve wue kang et al 2002 one important water saving agricultural strategy is the use of deficit irrigation with plastic film mulching which decreases vegetative growth and increases crop yield and wue fabeiro et al 2001 du et al 2010 thus it is essential to study crop productivity and wue of winter wheat under different cultivation patterns and levels of deficit irrigation to develop water saving agriculture practices that enhance crop yields and rainwater management in semi arid regions rainfall is one of the main water resources in rain fed regions of china and rain fed farming systems occupy 80 of all cultivated land han et al 2004 however erratic and inadequate rainfall significantly affects wheat production and occasionally results in total crop failure thus it is essential to economically use erratic precipitation and increase water storage in this region liao et al 2003 the ridge and furrow rainfall water collecting system with plastic film mulching is one of the most efficient techniques to

2017 at the jointing stage the deficit irrigation volumes for the 150 and 75 mm treatments were determined according to the irrigation area the irrigation area for the f cultivation treatment was 6 3 m2 2 0 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volume was 0 95 and 0 47 m3 for the 150 and 75 mm irrigation levels respectively the irrigation area under the r treatment of the two furrows was 3 78 m2 1 2 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volumes were 0 57 and 0 28 m3 for the rf technique a ridge height of 15 cm was used with a furrow to ridge width ratio of 60 40 cm a plastic film was used to cover all ridges with hidden edges 4 5 cm deep in the soil four rows of wheat were sown in furrows fig 1 the length and width of each cemented pond plot was 3 15 m 2 0 m with and 3 m in depth and plots were split divided by 17 cm thick concrete walls to avoid the exchange of soil water contents between plots weeds were controlled manually during each growing season wheat cultivar xinong 979 was sown at the rate of 2 25 106 seeds ha 1 the seeds were planted with an inter row space of 20 cm on october 15 in 2015 and on october 10 in 2016 wheat was hand harvested on june 2 in 2016 and on may 27 in 2017 nitrogen urea diammonium phosphate at 225 kg ha 1 and phosphorus diammonium phosphate at 75 kg ha 1 were applied at the time of planting the levels of simulated rainfall were determined based on the distribution of rainfall in the semi arid regions of northern china over the past 48 years years period 1966 2014 three total amounts of simulated rainfall 125 200 and 275 mm corresponding to light 1 moderate 2 and heavy 3 simulated rain levels were applied as described in a previous study ali et al 2017 in this study a precipitation simulator was used to provide the crop water and no natural precipitation was allowed during the wheat growing season fig 2 complete details of the precipitation conditions can be seen in table 1 the amount of rainwater used in this study was similar to natural rainfall amounts 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 soil water content the swc was calculated at sowing jointing flowering grain filling and maturity during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 study years an access tube made of seamless aluminum alloy 50 cm internal diameter was fixed in the middle of each furrow for soil water content swc measurements the swc of 10 cm intervals of the 0 100 cm soil layer were recorded

set at 56 60 at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages nine leaves from five individual plants in each of the four replicates of each treatment were analyzed 2 3 3 dry matter measurements in each plot samples were collected from a 0 25 m2 area at flowering and maturity to estimate dry matter and its components the samples were dried at 60 c until they reached a constant weight different parameters related to dry matter were calculated according to liu et al 2016 1 dry matter translocation kg ha 1 dry matter at flowering dry matter at maturity excluding grains 2 d r y m a t t e r t r

statistical analysis the data were analysed using spss 18 0 and data obtained from each sampling event were analysed separately multiple comparisons were performed using duncan s new multiple range test if f tests were significant differences in mean values were evaluated through lsd 0 05 multiple comparison tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content and evapotranspiration during two consecutive years the swc at a depth of 1 100 cm was regularly determined during various growth stages of the winter wheat crop the r cultivation technique significantly improved the swc under the deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation concentrations compared with the f cultivation technique fig 3 in rain fed regions of china wheat production can be limited by poor photosynthetic characteristics due to water shortages and uneven rainfall distribution that lead to water deficiency during the reproductive growth stages wang et al 2009 the average swc at different growth stages differed significantly p 05 between two test years with treatments ranking as follows r1150 r2150 r175 r275 r3150 f1150 f2150 r375 f175 f275 f3150 f375 there was no significant variation in swc at the time of sowing among treatments in both years of the study at different growth stages the swc under the r1150 and r2150 treatments were significantly higher than under the f1150 and f2150 treatments in both years from the jointing to flowering stage swc significantly increased while from flowering to the grain filling stage swc significantly decreased for all treatments in both years under the r cultivation pattern swc was significantly higher 30 4 compared to the f cultivation pattern in both years the r cultivation technique can improve swc and extend the period of water availability by accumulating rainwater from light precipitation decreasing evaporation and promoting precipitation infiltration liu et al 2016 at the flowering stage the mean swc across the two years of the study was significantly higher under the r1150 r175 r2150 r275 r3150 and r375 treatments 35 1 32 0 30 0 36 5 37 4 and 50 9 higher respectively compared to the f1150 f175 f2150 f275 f3150 and f375 treatments fig 3 similar trends for the winter wheat et rate were observed each year the r cultivation technique significantly p 05 decreased the et rate compared with the f cultivation technique table 3 et was decreased by 150 mm 35 8 in 2015 2016 and by 100 mm 26 9 in 2016 2017 comparisons of the mean et rate across the two years of the study showed that et rates of the r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly decreased by 128 mm 28 1 and 123 mm 27 8 respectively compared to the f1150 and f175 treatments compared with the f2150 and f275 treatments mean et rates of the r2150 and r275 treatments were decreased by 127 mm 32 7 and 130 mm 33 7 respectively the et rate was significantly decreased by 114 mm 31 7 for r3150 treatment and 130 mm 37 3 for r375 treatment compared with the f3150 and f375 treatments respectively previous studies have shown that various ridge mulching materials can modify the water utilization pattern of winter wheat and change rainwater utilization from soil water evaporation into crop transpiration thereby improving the wheat productivity and wue zhu et al 2000 in addition the use of different mulching materials in combination with ridge and furrow planting can regularize the water utilization rate sun et al 2006 for example plastic film mulching on ridges and straw mulching on furrows can reduce evaporation from the uppermost soil layer and decrease the total water consumption fan et al 2001 2002 thus the decrease in et under the r cultivation pattern that we observed in this study was likely due to improved swc and reduced soil evaporation 3 2 net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance the pn and gs of flag leaves significantly increased with increasing levels of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation under both cultivation patterns at various wheat growth stages figs 4 and 5 this is consistent with the previous finding that the application of plastic film mulching with deficit irrigation at different wheat growth stages increased pn gs tr and ci this improvement was mainly due to increased gs which increased ci liu et al 2006 gs indicate the gas exchange capacity of leaves and are closely correlated with pn gs value is the conductive capacity of co2 as well as h2o at the leaf surface and as such is closely correlated with the ci and the rate of assimilation within the leaf increasing gs results in higher ci which sustains high pn fig 4 the pn and gs of winter wheat flag leaves significantly increased from jointing to flowering stages but rapidly decreased from the flowering to grain filling stages figs 4 and 5 in the two years of the same treatments the average pn and gs values under the r1150 r2150 and r3150 treatments were higher than those of the corresponding f treatments by 14 5 and 24 7 10 4 and 27 2 and 25 8 and 43 8 respectively pn and gs were significantly higher under the r1150 and r2150 treatments compared with the f1150 and f2150 treatments at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages in both study years under both cultivation patterns there were no significant differences in pn and gs values when 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall was supplied at different growth stages the r cultivation technique had a reasonably greater effect on the pn and gs of flag leaves at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level during the grain filling stage compared with the f cultivation technique under plastic film mulching co2 assimilation slightly increases due to higher gs but tr which increases linearly with gs also increases and as a result improves pn ma et al 2015 a previous study indicated that rainwater harvesting technology efficiently increases chlorophyll content pn and wue ding et al 2004 and many studies have shown that pn and gs in wheat increase under plastic film mulching li et al 1999 wang et al 2008 lower gs would only marginally decrease co2 assimilation but it would significantly decrease transpiration because transpiration increases linearly with gs due to the constant difference in the concentration of water vapor between the leaf and the air 3 3 transpiration rate and intercellular co2 concentration under both cultivation patterns the tr and ci of winter wheat flag leaves significantly increased with increasing deficit irrigation and simulated rainfall at different growth stages figs 6 amd 7 the highest tr and ci values were observed under the r1150 treatment at the flowering stage but there was no significant differ between the r1150 and r2150 treatments this finding is consistent with previous research that showed that increasing the amount of irrigation under plastic film mulching could enhance tr and ci and delay leaf senescence thus increasing pn at the flowering stage makino 2011 zhao et al 2007 flag leaf tr and ci significantly increased from the jointing to flowering stage but rapidly decreased from the flowering to grain filling stage figs 6 and 7 in both study years of the same treatments the r cultivation technique had a reasonably greater effect on tr and ci at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level at the flowering stage compared with the f cultivation technique this difference between tr and ci is likely due to irregular stomatal closure in response to water stress shao et al 2015 the mean tr and ci values under the r1150 r2150 and r3150 treatments were higher than under the corresponding f treatments by 18 4 and 1 6 9 3 and 4 0 and 20 7 and 19 3 respectively compared with the f1150 and f2150 treatments the tr and ci values under the r1150 and r2150 treatments were significantly higher at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages in both study years for both cultivation techniques there were no significant differences in tr and ci values when 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall was supplied at different growth stages water deficit conditions and decreased and swc have been shown to significantly reduce winter wheat pn and tr rouhi et al 2007 gao et al 2011 however the ridge furrow rainfall collecting technique combined with limited irrigation significantly improves soil water conservation which could lead to increased pn of wheat in dry land farming systems sui et al 2010 3 4 pre flowering assimilate translocation dry matter translocation dmt and the contribution of pre flowering assimilate to winter wheat grain are shown in table 2 the r cultivation technique significantly increased dmt translocation efficiency te and cpag compared with the f cultivation technique in each year of the experiment table 2 winter wheat production under rain fed farming systems is linked to the dry matter partitioning ercoli et al 2008 and the remobilization of pre flowering assimilates can be essential for winter wheat production kage et al 2004 zhao et al 2007 ma et al 2015 reported that dmt was significantly higher under plastic film mulching compared with flat planting cultivation comparisons of means across the two years of our study indicated that using the r cultivation technique improved swc and reduced soil evaporation and as a result significantly improved dmt 22 1 te 8 7 and cpag 6 6 compared with the f cultivation technique zhao et al 2007 reported that dry matter partitioning from the stem and leaves significantly increases under well watered conditions compared to water deficit conditions however wang et al 1994 showed that drought treatments could not promote the redistribution of pre flowering assimilates into grain in this study we found that mean dmt te and cpag across the two years of the study were significantly higher under the r1150 treatment 29 7 5 6 and 17 4 respectively compared with the f1150 treatment mean dmt te and cpag of the r2150 treatment were also significantly increased by 31 6 15 2 and 10 6 respectively compared with the f2150 treatment the mean dmt te and cpag of the r3150 treatment were significantly increased by 22 3 15 0 and 10 2 respectively compared with the f3150 treatment these results show that there was significant variation between the different cultivation techniques in the effects of the amount of deficit irrigation and simulated rainfall on dmt and cpag a previous study also showed that covering ridges with plastic film and planting in furrows significantly improved swc resulting in improved dmt wang et al 1994 however han et al 2004 reported that drought conditions could not promote the redistribution of pre flowering assimilate into seeds it was previously shown that dmt in crops could not be significantly improved using the f cultivation technique because this technique decreased pn reduced the period of photosynthesis and promoted flag leaf senescence cui et al 2015 3 5 wue and grain yield under both cultivation techniques the amount of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation had significant effects on wue and grain yield of the winter wheat crop table 3 both wue and grain yield significantly increased with increasing amounts of deficit irrigation and rainfall but variation in these traits was not significant when the amount of rainfall was greater than 200 mm wue under the r cultivation pattern increased by 58 6 in 2015 2016 and 78 4 in 2016 2017 compared with the f cultivation pattern han et al 2004 reported that rainwater collecting planting techniques can efficiently increase the water content reduce evaporation and improve wue hence plastic film can significantly boost soil water supply capacity during reproductive growth zhang et al 2000 compared with the f1150 and f175 treatments average wue under the r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly increased by 53 3 and 56 4 respectively mean wue of the r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly increased by 75 8 and 85 1 respectively compared to the f2150 and f275 treatments the mean wue of the r3150 and r375 treatments was significantly increased by 68 3 and 75 3 respectively compared with the f3150 and f355 treatments plastic film mulching was previously found to improve soil moisture content which enhanced pn during the later stages of wheat growth and resulted in a higher grain yield and wue the r cultivation technique led to higher grain yield than the f cultivation technique for all levels of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation comparison of the means across the two years of the study indicated that the r cultivation technique improved swc and reduced et as a result this technique led to a higher 0 79 t ha 1 grain yield than the f cultivation technique it has been reported that plastic film mulching prolongs the duration of photosynthesis and results in higher grain production and wue qiu et al 2008 the mean grain yields for the r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly increased by 1 19 t ha 1 and 1 15 t ha 1 respectively compared with the f2150 and f275 treatments earlier studies showed that plastic film can enhance production and soil nutrient status zhang et al 2007 shi et al 2014 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system improves soil water status and supplies sufficient water at different growth stages which affects crop dmt and grain yield yang et al 2000 3 6 economic benefit economic benefit is an effective indicator when evaluating crop management practices the r system requires more investment but this investment can be offset by increased crop yields and greater economic returns ren et al 2008 previously study indicated that the r system and deficit irrigation both had positive effects on profit liu et al 2006 here we found that the average total input cost averaged across the two years of the study for the different treatments ranked as follows r1150 r175 r2150 r275 r3150 r375 r30 f1150 f175 f2150 f275 f3150 f375 table 5 the essential outputs from the winter wheat crop are grain and straw yields the market prices for these outputs were stable within the two growing seasons of this study for the r2150 treatment there was a significant increase in mean net income 12 195 cny ha 1 or 23 4 o i ratio 2 65 and nid 2311 cny ha 1 were significantly higher compared with the f2150 treatment the mean net incomes across the two years of the study for the r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly increased by 704 cny ha 1 26 1 and 1236 cny ha 1 13 2 respectively compared with the f1150 and f175 treatments compared with the f2150 and f275 treatments the mean net incomes of the r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly increased by 2311 cny ha 1 23 4 and 2258 cny ha 1 32 7 respectively the net income was significantly increased by 773 cny ha 1 18 0 for the r3150 treatment and 38 cny ha 1 1 7 for the r375 treatment compared with f3150 and f375 treatments respectively the photosynthetic characteristics of winter wheat were positively correlated with dmt swc and grain yield table 4 we found that the r cultivation technique for all levels of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation had positive effects on economic benefit but excessive precipitation reduced economic benefit thus based on our results we conclude that the r2150 treatment is the best water saving management strategy for increasing the efficiency of moisture consumption and as a result increasing photosynthetic characteristics translocation efficiency wue grain yield and economic return of winter wheat crops grown in rain fed farming systems 4 conclusions we found that cultivation technique had a significant effect on rainwater harvesting and swc growing wheat under the r cultivation pattern with 150 mm deficit irrigation and 200 mm simulated rainfall improved moisture content and thus significantly increased pn gs dry matter distribution pre flowering assimilate translocation grain yield et and wue for all levels of irrigation and simulated precipitation the r cultivation technique significantly increased photosynthetic characteristics and dmt later in growth grain filling stage compared with the f cultivation technique the photosynthetic characteristics of winter wheat were positively correlated with the dmt swc and grain yield comparison of grain yields photosynthetic characteristics dmt wue et and efficient consumption of moisture indicated that the r2150 treatment was the best cultivation method for increasing grain yield wue and economic return of winter wheat grown in rain fed regions acknowledgements this study was

11541,determining the effect of different cultivation techniques on photosynthetic characteristics dry matter translocation and water use efficiency wue will provide insight for the development of water saving farming systems and exploiting the photosynthetic characteristics of winter wheat under deficit irrigation in the current study a mobile rainproof shelter was used to explore the potential role of two cultivation techniques 1 the ridge and furrow precipitation harvesting technique r and 2 the flat cultivation technique f under two levels of deficit irrigation 150 75 mm levels and three levels of rainfall 1 275 2 200 3 125 mm we found that cultivation technique had a significant effect on rainfall water harvesting and enhanced soil water content under all levels of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation under the r cultivation technique with 150 mm deficit irrigation and 200 mm simulated rainfall level can efficiently improve moisture content thus significantly increased the average net photosynthetic rate pn 10 4 stomatal conductance gs 27 2 transpiration rate tr 9 3 intercellular co2 concentration ci 4 0 dry matter translocation 31 6 translocation

f cultivation technique the r cultivation technique significantly improved photosynthetic characteristics such as pn gs tr ci and dry matter translocation in the later growth stage grain filling stage compared with the f cultivation technique at each irrigation and rainfall level furthermore these photosynthetic parameters were positively correlated with dry matter translocation soil water content and grain yield the greatest improvement in the photosynthetic characteristics translocation efficiency wue grain production and economic return was achieved when using the r cultivation technique with 150 mm deficit irrigation and 200 mm simulated rainfall r2150 therefore we conclude that the r2150 treatment is the best water saving management strategy for growing wheat crops in rain fed farming systems keywords cultivation techniques photosynthetic characteristics dry matter translocation water use efficiency deficit irrigation soil water content 1 introduction in semi arid regions of china water shortages low rainfall and drought occur regularly during wheat growing periods and are the major bottlenecks affecting wheat production and water use efficiency wue adverse dry weather during the winter wheat growing season is like to increase due to projected global ecological change and could have a harmful effect on crop production kang et al 2002 richards 2000 water deficiency is not only a serious ecological issue but a limiting factor affecting crop growth and production kang et al 2000 pampino et al 2006 the negative effects of water deficit on crop production along with the cost of pumping of irrigation water insufficient facilities for irrigation manufacturing and restricted water sources have forced several farmers to use irrigation water more efficiently cakir 2004 du et al 2010 in fact the only way to sustain cereal production in semi arid regions is to efficiently use irrigation water develop water saving farming strategies and improve wue kang et al 2002 one important water saving agricultural strategy is the use of deficit irrigation with plastic film mulching which decreases vegetative growth and increases crop yield and wue fabeiro et al 2001 du et al 2010 thus it is essential to study crop productivity and wue of winter wheat under different cultivation patterns and levels of deficit irrigation to develop water saving agriculture practices that enhance crop yields and rainwater management in semi arid regions rainfall is one of the main water resources in rain fed regions of china and rain fed farming systems occupy 80 of all cultivated land han et al 2004 however erratic and inadequate rainfall significantly affects wheat production and occasionally results in total crop failure thus it is essential to economically use erratic precipitation and increase water storage in this region liao et al 2003 the ridge and furrow rainfall water collecting system with plastic film mulching is one of the most efficient techniques to increase wheat production and wue in rain fed regions wang et al 2008 in recent years plastic film has been widely adopted in the rain fed regions of china to conserve rainwater in root zone of wheat crops tian et al 2003 a previous study revealed that plastic film mulching can decrease soil evaporation and enhance soil water storage and crop production zhang et al 2005 leib et al 2006 also reported that plastic film and supplemental irrigation significantly increases wheat production and net profits compared with flat planting without plastic film mulching photosynthetic characteristics

moisture content on the net photosynthetic rate pn dmt and grain yield of wheat yang et al 2000 luo et al 2011 it is generally recognized that increasing swc improves pn which contributes to increased grain filling rate and crop production wu et al 2014 cui et al 2015 previous studies revealed that water scarcity during the flowering stage can negatively impacts pn reduces the period of photosynthesis and considerably increases flag leaf senescence yang et al 2000 wu et al 2014 flag leaf senescence due to water deficit may in turn reduce the contribution of pre flowering assimilates to grains cpag xue et al 2006 during senescence the degradation of the inner structure of the plant and stored matter is accelerated so the premature senescence of flag leaves due to drought may benefit the mobilization and re translocation of the reserves accumulated pre flowering yang et al 2000 winter wheat is also very susceptible to drought stress during the reproductive growth stage ge et al 2012 photosynthesis which is the most essential process affecting crop production in semi arid regions of china is inhibited by water stress chen and hao 2015 under plastic film mulching winter wheat efficiently utilized rainwater and had improved photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation guoth et al 2009 liu et al 2011 wueί is related to the ability of plants to absorb maximum

2017 at the jointing stage the deficit irrigation volumes for the 150 and 75 mm treatments were determined according to the irrigation area the irrigation area for the f cultivation treatment was 6 3 m2 2 0 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volume was 0 95 and 0 47 m3 for the 150 and 75 mm irrigation levels respectively the irrigation area under the r treatment of the two furrows was 3 78 m2 1 2 m 3 15 m and the irrigation volumes were 0 57 and 0 28 m3 for the rf technique a ridge height of 15 cm was used with a furrow to ridge width ratio of 60 40 cm a plastic film was used to cover all ridges with hidden edges 4 5 cm deep in the soil four rows of wheat were sown in furrows fig 1 the length and width of each cemented pond plot was 3 15 m 2 0 m with and 3 m in depth and plots were split divided by 17 cm thick concrete walls to avoid the exchange of soil water contents between plots weeds were controlled manually during each growing season wheat cultivar xinong 979 was sown at the rate of 2 25 106 seeds ha 1 the seeds were planted with an inter row space of 20 cm on october 15 in 2015 and on october 10 in 2016 wheat was hand harvested on june 2 in 2016 and on may 27 in 2017 nitrogen urea diammonium phosphate at 225 kg ha 1 and phosphorus diammonium phosphate at 75 kg ha 1 were applied at the time of planting the levels of simulated rainfall were determined based on the distribution of rainfall in the semi arid regions of northern china over the past 48 years years period 1966 2014 three total amounts of simulated rainfall 125 200 and 275 mm corresponding to light 1 moderate 2 and heavy 3 simulated rain levels were applied as described in a previous study ali et al 2017 in this study a precipitation simulator was used to provide the crop water and no natural precipitation was allowed during the wheat growing season fig 2 complete details of the precipitation conditions can be seen in table 1 the amount of rainwater used in this study was similar to natural rainfall amounts 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 soil water content the swc was calculated at sowing jointing flowering grain filling and maturity during the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 study years an access tube made of seamless aluminum alloy 50 cm internal diameter was fixed in the middle of each furrow for soil water content swc measurements the swc of 10 cm intervals of the 0 100 cm soil layer were recorded using a time domain reflectometry tdr meter trase system soil moisture equipment corp germany 2 3 2 photosynthetic parameters pn gs tr and intercellular co2 concentration ci were measured using a li cor li 6400xt portable photosynthesis system li 6400xt li cor lincoln ne usa measurements from the fully expanded flag leaves were taken on sunny days between 9 00 and 11 00 a m while in operation the system had a leaf chamber temperature of 25 c the co2 concentration in the leaf chamber was set at 380 μmol mol 1 photosynthetic active radiation was set at 1100 μmol m 2 s 1 and relative humidity was set at 56 60 at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages nine leaves from five individual plants in each of the four replicates of each treatment were analyzed 2 3 3 dry matter measurements in each plot samples were collected from a 0 25 m2 area at flowering and maturity to estimate dry matter and its components the samples were dried at 60 c until they reached a constant weight different parameters related to dry matter were calculated according to liu et al 2016 1 dry matter translocation kg ha 1 dry matter at flowering dry matter at maturity excluding grains 2 d r y m a t t e r t r

statistical analysis the data were analysed using spss 18 0 and data obtained from each sampling event were analysed separately multiple comparisons were performed using duncan s new multiple range test if f tests were significant differences in mean values were evaluated through lsd 0 05 multiple comparison tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content and evapotranspiration during two consecutive years the swc at a depth of 1 100 cm was regularly determined during various growth stages of the winter wheat crop the r cultivation technique significantly improved the swc under the deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation concentrations compared with the f cultivation technique fig 3 in rain fed regions of china wheat production can be limited by poor photosynthetic characteristics due to water shortages and uneven rainfall distribution that lead to water deficiency during the reproductive growth stages wang et al 2009 the average swc at different growth stages differed significantly p 05 between two test years with treatments ranking as follows r1150 r2150 r175 r275 r3150 f1150 f2150 r375 f175 f275 f3150 f375 there was no significant variation in swc at the time of sowing among treatments in both years of the study at different growth stages the swc under the r1150 and r2150 treatments were significantly higher than under the f1150 and f2150 treatments in both years from the jointing to flowering stage swc significantly increased while from flowering to the grain filling stage swc significantly decreased for all treatments in both years under the r cultivation pattern swc was significantly higher 30 4 compared to the f cultivation pattern in both years the r cultivation technique can improve swc and extend the period of water availability by accumulating rainwater from light precipitation decreasing evaporation and promoting precipitation infiltration liu et al 2016 at the flowering stage the mean swc across the two years of the study was significantly higher under the r1150 r175 r2150 r275 r3150 and r375 treatments 35 1 32 0 30 0 36 5 37 4 and 50 9 higher respectively compared to the f1150 f175 f2150 f275 f3150 and f375 treatments fig 3 similar trends for the winter wheat et rate were observed each year the r cultivation technique significantly p 05 decreased the et rate compared with the f cultivation technique table 3 et was decreased by 150 mm 35 8 in 2015 2016 and by 100 mm 26 9 in 2016 2017 comparisons of the mean et rate across the two years of the study showed that et rates of the r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly decreased by 128 mm 28 1 and 123 mm 27 8 respectively compared to the f1150 and f175 treatments compared with the f2150 and f275 treatments mean et rates of the r2150 and r275 treatments were decreased by 127 mm 32 7 and 130 mm 33 7 respectively the et rate was significantly decreased by 114 mm 31 7 for r3150 treatment and 130 mm 37 3 for r375 treatment compared with the f3150 and f375 treatments respectively previous studies have shown that various ridge mulching materials can modify the water utilization pattern of winter wheat and change rainwater utilization from soil water evaporation into crop transpiration thereby improving the wheat productivity and wue zhu et al 2000 in addition the use of different mulching materials in combination with ridge and furrow planting can regularize the water utilization rate sun et al 2006 for example plastic film mulching on ridges and straw mulching on furrows can reduce evaporation from the uppermost soil layer and decrease the total water consumption fan et al 2001 2002 thus the decrease in et under the r cultivation pattern that we observed in this study was likely due to improved swc and reduced soil evaporation 3 2 net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance the pn and gs of flag leaves significantly increased with increasing levels of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation under both cultivation patterns at various wheat growth stages figs 4 and 5 this is consistent with the previous finding that the application of plastic film mulching with deficit irrigation at different wheat growth stages increased pn gs tr and ci this improvement was mainly due to increased gs which increased ci liu et al 2006 gs indicate the gas exchange capacity of leaves and are closely correlated with pn gs value is the conductive capacity of co2 as well as h2o at the leaf surface and as such is closely correlated with the ci and the rate of assimilation within the leaf increasing gs results in higher ci which sustains high pn fig 4 the pn and gs of winter wheat flag leaves significantly increased from jointing to flowering stages but rapidly decreased from the flowering to grain filling stages figs 4 and 5 in the two years of the same treatments the average pn and gs values under the r1150 r2150 and r3150 treatments were higher than those of the corresponding f treatments by 14 5 and 24 7 10 4 and 27 2 and 25 8 and 43 8 respectively pn and gs were significantly higher under the r1150 and r2150 treatments compared with the f1150 and f2150 treatments at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages in both study years under both cultivation patterns there were no significant differences in pn and gs values when 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall was supplied at different growth stages the r cultivation technique had a reasonably greater effect on the pn and gs of flag leaves at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level during the grain filling stage compared with the f cultivation technique under plastic film mulching co2 assimilation slightly increases due to higher gs but tr which increases linearly with gs also increases and as a result improves pn ma et al 2015 a previous study indicated that rainwater harvesting technology efficiently increases chlorophyll content pn and wue ding et al 2004 and many studies have shown that pn and gs in wheat increase under plastic film mulching li et al 1999 wang et al 2008 lower gs would only marginally decrease co2 assimilation but it would significantly decrease transpiration because transpiration increases linearly with gs due to the constant difference in the concentration of water vapor between the leaf and the air 3 3 transpiration rate and intercellular co2 concentration under both cultivation patterns the tr and ci of winter wheat flag leaves significantly increased with increasing deficit irrigation and simulated rainfall at different growth stages figs 6 amd 7 the highest tr and ci values were observed under the r1150 treatment at the flowering stage but there was no significant differ between the r1150 and r2150 treatments this finding is consistent with previous research that showed that increasing the amount of irrigation under plastic film mulching could enhance tr and ci and delay leaf senescence thus increasing pn at the flowering stage makino 2011 zhao et al 2007 flag leaf tr and ci significantly increased from the jointing to flowering stage but rapidly decreased from the flowering to grain filling stage figs 6 and 7 in both study years of the same treatments the r cultivation technique had a reasonably greater effect on tr and ci at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level at the flowering stage compared with the f cultivation technique this difference between tr and ci is likely due to irregular stomatal closure in response to water stress shao et al 2015 the mean tr and ci values under the r1150 r2150 and r3150 treatments were higher than under the corresponding f treatments by 18 4 and 1 6 9 3 and 4 0 and 20 7 and 19 3 respectively compared with the f1150 and f2150 treatments the tr and ci values under the r1150 and r2150 treatments were significantly higher at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages in both study years for both cultivation techniques there were no significant differences in tr and ci values when 275 mm and 200 mm simulated rainfall was supplied at different growth stages water deficit conditions and decreased and swc have been shown to significantly reduce winter wheat pn and tr rouhi et al 2007 gao et al 2011 however the ridge furrow rainfall collecting technique combined with limited irrigation significantly improves soil water conservation which could lead to increased pn of wheat in dry land farming systems sui et al 2010 3 4 pre flowering assimilate translocation dry matter translocation dmt and the contribution of pre flowering assimilate to winter wheat grain are shown in table 2 the r cultivation technique significantly increased dmt translocation efficiency te and cpag compared with the f cultivation technique in each year of the experiment table 2 winter wheat production under rain fed farming systems is linked to the dry matter partitioning ercoli et al 2008 and the remobilization of pre flowering assimilates can be essential for winter wheat production kage et al 2004 zhao et al 2007 ma et al 2015 reported that dmt was significantly higher under plastic film mulching compared with flat planting cultivation comparisons of means across the two years of our study indicated that using the r cultivation technique improved swc and reduced soil evaporation and as a result significantly improved dmt 22 1 te 8 7 and cpag 6 6 compared with the f cultivation technique zhao et al 2007 reported that dry matter partitioning from the stem and leaves significantly increases under well watered conditions compared to water deficit conditions however wang et al 1994 showed that drought treatments could not promote the redistribution of pre flowering assimilates into grain in this study we found that mean dmt te and cpag across the two years of the study were significantly higher under the r1150 treatment 29 7 5 6 and 17 4 respectively compared with the f1150 treatment mean dmt te and cpag of the r2150 treatment were also significantly increased by 31 6 15 2 and 10 6 respectively compared with the f2150 treatment the mean dmt te and cpag of the r3150 treatment were significantly increased by 22 3 15 0 and 10 2 respectively compared with the f3150 treatment these results show that there was significant variation between the different cultivation techniques in the effects of the amount of deficit irrigation and simulated rainfall on dmt and cpag a previous study also showed that covering ridges with plastic film and planting in furrows significantly improved swc resulting in improved dmt wang et al 1994 however han et al 2004 reported that drought conditions could not promote the redistribution of pre flowering assimilate into seeds it was previously shown that dmt in crops could not be significantly improved using the f cultivation technique because this technique decreased pn reduced the period of photosynthesis and promoted flag leaf senescence cui et al 2015 3 5 wue and grain yield under both cultivation techniques the amount of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation had significant effects on wue and grain yield of the winter wheat crop table 3 both wue and grain yield significantly increased with increasing amounts of deficit irrigation and rainfall but variation in these traits was not significant when the amount of rainfall was greater than 200 mm wue under the r cultivation pattern increased by 58 6 in 2015 2016 and 78 4 in 2016 2017 compared with the f cultivation pattern han et al 2004 reported that rainwater collecting planting techniques can efficiently increase the water content reduce evaporation and improve wue hence plastic film can significantly boost soil water supply capacity during reproductive growth zhang et al 2000 compared with the f1150 and f175 treatments average wue under the r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly increased by 53 3 and 56 4 respectively mean wue of the r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly increased by 75 8 and 85 1 respectively compared to the f2150 and f275 treatments the mean wue of the r3150 and r375 treatments was significantly increased by 68 3 and 75 3 respectively compared with the f3150 and f355 treatments plastic film mulching was previously found to improve soil moisture content which enhanced pn during the later stages of wheat growth and resulted in a higher grain yield and wue the r cultivation technique led to higher grain yield than the f cultivation technique for all levels of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation comparison of the means across the two years of the study indicated that the r cultivation technique improved swc and reduced et as a result this technique led to a higher 0 79 t ha 1 grain yield than the f cultivation technique it has been reported that plastic film mulching prolongs the duration of photosynthesis and results in higher grain production and wue qiu et al 2008 the mean grain yields for the r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly increased by 1 19 t ha 1 and 1 15 t ha 1 respectively compared with the f2150 and f275 treatments earlier studies showed that plastic film can enhance production and soil nutrient status zhang et al 2007 shi et al 2014 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system improves soil water status and supplies sufficient water at different growth stages which affects crop dmt and grain yield yang et al 2000 3 6 economic benefit economic benefit is an effective indicator when evaluating crop management practices the r system requires more investment but this investment can be offset by increased crop yields and greater economic returns ren et al 2008 previously study indicated that the r system and deficit irrigation both had positive effects on profit liu et al 2006 here we found that the average total input cost averaged across the two years of the study for the different treatments ranked as follows r1150 r175 r2150 r275 r3150 r375 r30 f1150 f175 f2150 f275 f3150 f375 table 5 the essential outputs from the winter wheat crop are grain and straw yields the market prices for these outputs were stable within the two growing seasons of this study for the r2150 treatment there was a significant increase in mean net income 12 195 cny ha 1 or 23 4 o i ratio 2 65 and nid 2311 cny ha 1 were significantly higher compared with the f2150 treatment the mean net incomes across the two years of the study for the r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly increased by 704 cny ha 1 26 1 and 1236 cny ha 1 13 2 respectively compared with the f1150 and f175 treatments compared with the f2150 and f275 treatments the mean net incomes of the r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly increased by 2311 cny ha 1 23 4 and 2258 cny ha 1 32 7 respectively the net income was significantly increased by 773 cny ha 1 18 0 for the r3150 treatment and 38 cny ha 1 1 7 for the r375 treatment compared with f3150 and f375 treatments respectively the photosynthetic characteristics of winter wheat were positively correlated with dmt swc and grain yield table 4 we found that the r cultivation technique for all levels of deficit irrigation and simulated precipitation had positive effects on economic benefit but excessive precipitation reduced economic benefit thus based on our results we conclude that the r2150 treatment is the best water saving management strategy for increasing the efficiency of moisture consumption and as a result increasing photosynthetic characteristics translocation efficiency wue grain yield and economic return of winter wheat crops grown in rain fed farming systems 4 conclusions we found that cultivation technique had a significant effect on rainwater harvesting and swc growing wheat under the r cultivation pattern with 150 mm deficit irrigation and 200 mm simulated rainfall improved moisture content and thus significantly increased pn gs dry matter distribution pre flowering assimilate translocation grain yield et and wue for all levels of irrigation and simulated precipitation the r cultivation technique significantly increased photosynthetic characteristics and dmt later in growth grain filling stage compared with the f cultivation technique the photosynthetic characteristics of winter wheat were positively correlated with the dmt swc and grain yield comparison of grain yields photosynthetic characteristics dmt wue et and efficient consumption of moisture indicated that the r2150 treatment was the best cultivation method for increasing grain yield wue and economic return of winter wheat grown in rain fed regions acknowledgements this study was

11542,hetao irrigation district a large irrigation district in arid area northwest china is suffering from the decreasing water supply and increasing soil salinization mulched drip irrigation is widely used for agricultural production in arid area and tillage management affects soil environment variously this study aimed to explore combined effects of tillage and mulching modes on soil water and salt transfer under drip irrigation the experiment included 4 treatments ridge tillage with full film mulching rfm ridge tillage with partial film mulching rpm flat tillage with full film mulching ffm and flat tillage with partial film mulching fpm the results showed that rfm increased soil moisture in root zone 0 40 cm soil salt was pushed to the edge of soil wetting front and rfm and ffm reduced salt accumulation in 0 70 layer significantly than rpm and fpm indicating that full film mulching could retard the upward movement of soil salt more effectively furthermore the performance of hydrus 2d was calibrated and evaluated by comparing the simulated values with observed values and further verified model by another year dataset to simulate the spatial distributions of soil water and salt in the two directions under mulched drip irrigation with different irrigation quantity the simulation showed that the wetted region was expanded to the middle position of the film and the uniformity of irrigation increased with the increasing irrigation amount in addition the increasing of assumed irrigation amount induced soil desalination and make soil salinity spatial movement meet a discipline that the direction parallel to the drip line was lower than that perpendicular to the line at the same distance in all rfm could be adopted for optimizing soil water salt regulation under drip irrigation in hetao irrigation district and the model presented here is an efficient approach for investigating the regulation mechanisms of root zone water and salt dynamics under mulching and or tillage keywords soil moisture soil salinity mulched drip irrigation tillage hydrus 2d 1 introduction soil salinity one of the most severe abiotic stresses inhibits growth and yield of non halophyte and even halophyte species and threatens both the food security and the sustainable development of agriculture debez et al 2008 yang et al 2016 it is estimated that 20 of cultivated lands and 33 of irrigated agriculture lands in the world were salt affected and the amount of land now at risk of salinity is four times of current affected areas foolad 2004 fao 2008 hetao irrigation district northwest china is suffered from severe soil salinity qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2017c even worse precipitation deficiency and dry season greatly induce drought occurrence and further aggravate salinity effect wang et al 2015 liu et al 2017 therefore efficient tillage and irrigation methods are essential to mitigate the negative effects of drought and soil salinity on crops mulched drip irrigation is an effective measure to increase soil moisture and promote soil salinity redistribution in arable soil layer resulting in appropriate crop growth conditions zhang et al 2017a this measure could increase water and nutrients use efficiency and thus enhance crop yield zhang et al 2017b moreover previous studies indicate mulched drip irrigation efficiently reduce soil evaporation and improve topsoil temperature and thus maintain suitable soil hydrothermal conditions chakraboyty et al 2008 zhou et al 2009 however during mulched drip irrigation solute salt transport is accompanied by water flow and accumulates at edge of the wetting front and lead to form main salt accumulation area below 30 cm soil layer wang 2013 mirjat et al 2014 ridge tillage could promote water and solute horizontal and vertical infiltration due to its loose soil structure qi et al 2016 therefore the combination measure of mulched drip irrigation and ridge tillage could be a choice to reduce solute salt concentration and move main accumulation area to deep soil layer numerical simulation is an effective way to investigate the law of spatial distribution and movement of soil water and solute salt and then evaluate effects of different tillage and mulching combination methods under drip irrigation which can be used to optimize soil water and salt conditions for effective soil water utilization previous studies indicate the relevant assessment between soil water and salt could be done mathematically using the hydrus 2d the hydrus model has been proved to be an efficient tool for simulating soil water and solute salt transport in many cases kodesova et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 investigated the impact of vapor flow on predictions of soil water content using hydrus model shan et al 2011 also used the hydrus model to simulate soil wetting patterns for overlap zone under double points sources of drip irrigation in a winter wheat planting system wang et al 2013 reported the changes of water flow and heat transport in soil under plastic film mulching with drip irrigation conditions however there is little information regarding the spatial distribution of soil water and salt under plastic film mulching with drip irrigation conditions in this study the main goal is to investigate the spatial distribution of soil water and salt distribution associated with mulched drip irrigation in hetao irrigation district china moreover we calibrate the hydrus 2d model for simulating soil water and salt migration with plastic film mulch finally different irrigation amounts 90 130 180 mm were involved to perform numerical simulations during the growth period of maize to document influence of different irrigation amounts on spatial distribution of salt accumulation in soil profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the field experiments were conducted at the shuguang experimental station 40 46 n 107 24 e 1039 m a s l in 2014 and 2015 the station is in the west of the hetao irrigation district in the inner mongolia china the average annual rainfall is 180 mm but it ranges between a minimum of 139 mm and a maximum of 222 mm year 1 average annual temperature is 6 9 c and mean potential evaporation is 2200 2400 mm during the experimental years 2014 2015 the change in water level was approximately 2 5 m the experimental soils are alluvial silt sediments and begin to freeze by the middle of november and do not thaw completely until late april qi et al 2016 the soil properties and model parameters of the experimental field are shown in tables 1 and 2 four replications were adopted for the test and irrigation water was obtained from groundwater well the average electrical conductivity ec of groundwater is 1 76 ds m 1 the irrigation water and was delivered by a pump with the exact amounts of water supplied monitored by water meters the experimental crop was maize xi meng 6 inner mongolia china during maize growth period urea plus nh4 2hpo4 was supplied as the base fertilizer and urea phosphate fertilizer and kno3 were used as the top dressing four field management treatments were studied fig 1 ridge tillage with full film mulching rfm ridge tillage with partial film mulching rpm flat tillage with full film mulching ffm flat tillage with partial film mulching fpm the experimental field was divided into plots each 12 m long and 3 m wide and four groups of mulched drip irrigation system were arranged on each plot the ridge and furrow for ridge tillage were 40 cm wide 20 cm high and 60 cm wide 20 cm high respectively after the plots were mulched with plastic film according to four treatments requirements two rows of maize were planted on both sides of the drip tape with dibblers the drip tapes spacing and emitter spacing were 100 cm and 30 cm respectively to study the impact of different treatments on soil water and salt transfer the ech2o 5te sensors were installed beneath the emitter at the soil depths of 10 30 55 85 and 110 cm at three locations to record profiled soil moisture of 20 40 70 100 and 120 cm layers fig 2 soil samples were collected by auger before and after each irrigation event part of soil samples were used for measuring gravimetric water contents by oven drying method and the rest were air dried and sieved through 1 mm mesh for preparing dilute soil extract solutions the soil soluble salt was estimated by the extracts with a 1 5 soil water ratio ec1 5 measured with a conductivity meter ds m 1 the mixed solutions of soil and water were oscillated for about 5 min although small amounts of non soluble salts remained in the final mixed solution their proportion was very low the conductivity of saturated paste extract ece was measured using the soil samples with a wide range of ec1 5 values and developed the relationship between ece and ec1 5 r2 0 966 li et al 2015 the ece of all samples was estimated using eq 1 tong 2014 1 e c e 5 88 e c 1 5 1 33 the ece was converted to salt

follows zhao et al 2016 3 s a s t ρ s l where ρ s is the bulk density g cm 1 l is the soil depth cm precipitation data were obtained from the meteorological observation station during each drip irrigation period the amount of irrigation water was recorded once in every 30 min the microlysimeters were installed at no plastic film mulch position to measure soil evaporation they were made of two iron tubes with an internal diameter of 10 cm and a depth of 20 cm for the inner and 15 cm and 20 cm for the outer the outer tube was inserted into the soil and the bottom of inner tube was sealed with a plastic sheet then the inner tube was weighed and installed in the outer tube part of soil in the outer tube should be removed to make the soil surface of the inner tube and surrounding at the

after precipitation and irrigation event all data were analysed using sigma plot 12 0 and surfer 12 0 2 2 precipitation and irrigation fig 3 illustrates precipitation and irrigation amount during maize growing periods in 2014 and 2015 total precipitation during the whole maize growth period was 77 mm and 25 mm in 2014 and in 2015 respectively there were five and one effective rainfall evens that precipitation exceeded 5 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively and the corresponding total amounts were 55 mm and 10 mm in addition there was one heavy rain rainfall intensity 16 mm h 1 in 2014 while there was no heavy precipitation in 2015 in entire monitoring period precipitation was limited and temporal and spatial distribution was uneven thus a certain amount of irrigation was supplied to increase soil moisture and maintain the maize growth the irrigation levels were 135 mm and 345 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively and irrigation events mainly concentrated in july and august 2 3 model

the diameter of the dripper around 10 cm is constant flux condition during irrigation and zero flux boundary condition after irrigation the drip line boundary became a zero flux boundary condition when irrigation was terminated for x 10 cm to x 20 cm a zero flux boundary condition was imposed owing to the plastic mulching also an atmospheric boundary condition was imposed beyond the film

al 2002 parameters from measured transient or steady state flow and or transport data in this case inverse solutions were used to optimize soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters using the observed data initial estimates initial and boundary conditions then the hydrus model was validated with the field data of the 2015 growing period based on the calibrated parameters 2 5 statistical

n o i o 2 where oi and si are the observed and simulated values and n is the number of pair values 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution characteristics of soil moisture and salinity the vertical distribution of soil moisture in all treatments during frequent irrigation period from 1st july to 31st july in 2015 is shown in figs 4 and 5 soil moisture changed significantly and moved as vertical and horizontal direction from the drip line with increasing irrigation there was a wetted bulb formed near ridge slope in 30 40 cm layer and the other wetted zone formed beneath furrow under 50 cm layer in rfm plot while only one moist region formed in 50 60 cm layer in the rest treatments compared with ffm soil moisture in fpm in 0 40 cm layer was lower due to evaporation from bare furrow thus more soil water moved from wetted zone towards to bare furrow figs 6 and 7 show the effect of different mulching and tillage modes on spatial distribution characteristics of soil salinity under drip irrigation interval of 10 days during frequent irrigation in july 2015 soil salinity distribution was significantly influenced by mulching and tillage modes in both topsoil and deep layer the plastic film mulched on both ridge and furrow restrained evaporation of soil moisture from bare area thus the upward movement of soil salt form deep layers was slow down with the movement of soil wetting front salt under the plastic mulch was leached in an ellipse shape to the right and downward direction because the plastic mulch limited evaporation from soil salt in the soil gradually moved to the bare soil surface between the zones of plastic mulches due to higher evaporation compared with the position under the mulch with the upward movement of salt salt accumulation in the bare soil surface between the plastic mulches is a natural consequence the soil salinity tended to move upward from deeper soil to topsoil and from under the mulch toward between the mulches as time passed after irrigation 3 2 salt accumulation during the season the effect of mulching and tillage modes on salt accumulation during the maize growth periods in 2014 and 2015 is shown in table 3 full film mulch treatments had obvious desalination effect while partial film mulch modes led to secondary salinization in 0 40 cm layer compared with ffm treatment rfm significantly decreased soil salinity in 0 40 cm layer by 43 3 and 38 7 in 2014 and 2015 respectively in 40 70 cm layer soil salinity decreased in all treatments additionally rfm has significant desalination effect in this layer and decreased soil salinity up to 30 2 2 3 and 9 3 in 2014 and 47 6 3 5 and 11 4 in 2015 over that in rpm ffm and fpm treatments respectively overall during the whole maize growing season soil salinity decreased gradually at the end compared with the beginning of monitoring period there were significant differences on salt content removed from soil in 0 70 cm layer among four mulching and tillage modes especially in rfm and ffm there were positive effects on reducing salt compared with rpm and fpm in 2014 and 2015 the maximum decreased salt contents were recorded in rfm and almost 4 71 and 5 07 times higher than the minimum value recorded in rpm in 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 3 simulated versus observed results the simulated values for soil water and salt contents with different treatments were compared graphically with the observed results in figs 8 11 although there were some differences between simulated and observed data the overall simulations were in a good agreement for both 2014 and 2015 for four tillage and mulched applications both the observed and simulated data showed simultaneous turbulence at the same layer the statistical evaluation results for model performance in the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 are summarized in table 4 the region of the rmse and r2 values for soil water and salt contents were 0 031 0 043 0 84 0 94 and 0 044 0 057 0 82 0 94 respectively table 4 based on these values we confirm that hydrus 2d model performed reliably in simulation of water flow and salt migration under field experiments 3 4 spatial distribution patterns of soil salinity in order to understand effects of irrigation amount on spatial distribution patterns of soil salinity we simulated soil salinity movement under ffm using three assumed irrigation amounts 90 135 and 180 mm that were selected based on regional average annual variation of irrigation amount and average irrigation amount in 2014 table 5 in addition sources of daily climate data in 2014 were involved in simulation the dripper discharge duration and interval of the drip irrigation were consistent with those of the field experiment 3 4 1 perpendicular to the drip tubing fig 12 illustrates the simulated soil salinity distributions for q1 q2 and q3 perpendicular to the drip tubing the soil salinity for all three irrigation levels was consistently low at the surface layer and below the dripper and increased gradually with soil depth for q1 the soil salt tended to move toward the fringes of the wetted region the desalinated area under the dripper was nearly symmetrical around r 0 because the fringes of the wetted region from two adjacent drippers did not converge there was no significant difference in the middle of the film r 50 and z 0 50 cm accordingly the uniformity of irrigation was low under the q1 irrigation scheme for q2 and q3 the desalinated region under the dripper was asymmetrical and moves towards the middle of the film several previous studies have reported that the wetted region and desalinated area of drip irrigation is symmetrical on each side of the drip tubing patel and rajput 2008 chen et al 2015 therefore our results illustrated that the desalinated area under mulched drip irrigation is affected by the film mulching more soil salt was leached in the middle of the film which provided a mild salt environment for crop growth 3 4 2 parallel to the drip tubing fig 13 illustrates the simulated soil salinity distributions for the soil profiles of q1 q2 and q3 parallel to the drip tubing the desalination zone expanded horizontally and vertically with increased irrigation amount the soil salt contours for q1 were much straighter than those of q2 and q3 the volume of desalination zone for q3 was also larger than that for q1 compared with the placement near the dripper the force that drives the water move downward at the overlap front is much weaker accordingly the salt in the irrigation water could not be leached effectively is retained in the upper part at the overlap front which increased soil salt content of the surface layer at a certain extent the wetting fronts under the drippers overlapped more rapidly with the increase of irrigation amount and conducive to soil salt leaching and downward migration based on the above analysis our results demonstrated that both the uniformity of irrigation and the desalination zone under film mulching were increased when the assumed irrigation amount increased e g q3 the soil salt content parallel to the drip tubing fig 13 was much lower than that perpendicular to the drip tubing fig 12 at the same position indicating that the wetting front of mulched drip irrigation overlapped earlier parallel to the drip tubing the soil evaporation decreased considerably due to mulched drip irrigation which restricted the upward movement trend of soil salt thus forming an obviously desalination zone in the shallow layer for all three irrigation treatments 3 4 3 irrigation system optimization the safety threshold of soil salt content in the root zone 0 40 cm of maize during the tasseling and filling period in the hetao irrigation district was 0 3 ma et al 2014 the soil salt content in the root zone of q1 q2 and q3 was 0 309 0 291 and 0 264 calculated by the empirical formula of chinese saline soil wang et al 2013 respectively for q1 the salt content exceeded the safety threshold and unfavourable for crop growth although the salt content of q3 was lowest the water consumption was greater while a suitable soil moisture and salt condition for crops was created by q2 and significantly increased soil water use efficiency in the present study we illustrated that the mean yield of ffm increased by 20 08 than ck in 2014 and 2015 qi et al 2016 in order to find the optimal irrigation amount between q1 and q2 we set q4 100 mm and q5 120 mm for further adjustment of irrigation scheme compared with q2 water consumption of q4 and q5 was reduced by 10 and 4 1 respectively and soil salt content of root zone was 0 305 and 0 297 respectively simulated results indicate that irrigation level of q5 was the critical value in terms of local cultivation conditions accordingly the irrigation level of q5 is practical and feasible for local irrigation schedule under mulched drip irrigation 4 conclusion in this study based on our field experiment we observed that a wetted bulb formed near ridge slope in 30 40 cm layer and the other wetted zone formed beneath furrow under 50 cm layer in rfm plot the desalinated area under mulched drip irrigation is affected by the film mulching more soil salt was leached in the middle of the film which provided a mild salt environment for crop growth the soil evaporation decreased considerably due to mulched drip irrigation which restricted the upward movement trend of soil salt thus forming an obviously desalination zone in the shallow layer full film mulch treatments had obvious desalination effect while partial film mulch modes led to secondary salinization in 0 40 cm layer during the whole maize growing season soil salinity decreased gradually at the end compared with the beginning of monitoring period hydrus 2d model is reliable to reproduce soil water flow and salt transport under field conditions we used the model to simulate the process of soil salinity distributions perpendicular and parallel to the drip tubing under different irrigation amount the results demonstrated that the uniformity of irrigation and the desalination zone under film mulching were increased when the assumed irrigation amount increased the soil salt content parallel to the drip tubing fig 13 was much lower than that perpendicular to the drip tubing fig 12 at the same position the model presented in this research provided an efficient approach to exploring the characteristics of soil water flow and salt transport for better understanding the mechanisms of soil water and salt migration under mulched drip irrigation in field experiment it has the potential to be applied to design a suitable mulched drip irrigation system for maize in arid

11542,hetao irrigation district a large irrigation district in arid area northwest china is suffering from the decreasing water supply and increasing soil salinization mulched drip irrigation is widely used for agricultural production in arid area and tillage management affects soil environment variously this study aimed to explore combined effects of tillage and mulching modes on soil water and salt transfer under drip irrigation the experiment included 4 treatments ridge tillage with full film mulching rfm ridge tillage with partial film mulching rpm flat tillage with full film mulching ffm and flat tillage with partial film mulching fpm the results showed that rfm increased soil moisture in root zone 0 40 cm soil salt was pushed to the edge of soil wetting front and rfm and ffm reduced salt accumulation in 0 70 layer significantly than rpm and fpm indicating that full film mulching could retard the upward movement of soil salt more effectively furthermore the performance of hydrus 2d was calibrated and evaluated by comparing the simulated values with observed values and further verified model by another year dataset to simulate the spatial distributions of soil water and salt in the two directions under mulched drip irrigation with different irrigation quantity the simulation showed that the wetted region was expanded to the middle position of the film and the uniformity of irrigation increased with the increasing irrigation amount in addition the increasing of assumed irrigation amount induced soil desalination and make soil salinity spatial movement meet a discipline that the direction parallel to the drip line was lower than that perpendicular to the line at the same distance in all rfm could be adopted for optimizing soil water salt regulation under drip irrigation in hetao irrigation district and the model presented here is an efficient approach for investigating the regulation mechanisms of root zone water and salt dynamics under mulching and or tillage keywords soil moisture soil salinity mulched drip irrigation tillage hydrus 2d 1 introduction soil salinity one of the most severe abiotic stresses inhibits growth and yield of non halophyte and even halophyte species and threatens both the food security and the sustainable development of agriculture debez et al 2008 yang et al 2016 it is estimated that 20 of cultivated lands and 33 of irrigated agriculture lands in the world were salt affected and the amount of land now at risk of salinity is four times of current affected areas foolad 2004 fao 2008 hetao irrigation district northwest china is suffered from severe soil salinity qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2017c even worse precipitation deficiency and dry season greatly induce drought occurrence and further aggravate salinity effect wang et al 2015 liu et al 2017 therefore efficient tillage and irrigation methods are essential to mitigate the negative effects of drought and soil salinity on crops mulched drip irrigation is an effective measure to increase soil moisture and promote soil salinity redistribution in arable soil layer resulting in appropriate crop growth conditions zhang et al 2017a this measure could increase water and nutrients use efficiency and thus enhance crop yield zhang et al 2017b moreover previous studies indicate mulched drip irrigation efficiently reduce soil evaporation and improve topsoil temperature and thus maintain suitable soil hydrothermal conditions chakraboyty et al 2008 zhou et al 2009 however during mulched drip irrigation solute salt transport is accompanied by water flow and accumulates at edge of the wetting front and lead to form main salt accumulation area below 30 cm soil layer wang 2013 mirjat et al 2014 ridge tillage could promote water and solute horizontal and vertical infiltration due to its loose soil structure qi et al 2016 therefore the combination measure of mulched drip irrigation and ridge tillage could be a choice to reduce solute salt concentration and move main accumulation area to deep soil layer numerical simulation is an effective way to investigate the law of spatial distribution and movement of soil water and solute salt and then evaluate effects of different tillage and mulching combination methods under drip irrigation which can be used to optimize soil water and salt conditions for effective soil water utilization previous studies indicate the relevant assessment between soil water and salt could be done mathematically using the hydrus 2d the hydrus model has been proved to be an efficient tool for simulating soil water and solute salt transport in many cases kodesova et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 investigated the impact of vapor flow on predictions of soil water content using hydrus model shan et al 2011 also used the hydrus model to simulate soil wetting patterns for overlap zone under double points sources of drip irrigation in a winter wheat planting system wang et al 2013 reported the changes of water flow and heat transport in soil under plastic film mulching with drip irrigation conditions however there is little information regarding the spatial distribution of soil water and salt under plastic film mulching with drip irrigation conditions in this study the main goal is to investigate the spatial distribution of soil water and salt distribution associated with mulched drip irrigation in hetao irrigation district china moreover we calibrate the hydrus 2d model for simulating soil water and salt migration with plastic film mulch finally different irrigation amounts 90 130 180 mm were involved to perform numerical simulations during the growth period of maize to document influence of different irrigation amounts on spatial distribution of salt accumulation in soil profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the field experiments were conducted at the shuguang experimental station 40 46 n 107 24 e 1039 m a s l in 2014 and 2015 the station is in the west of the hetao irrigation district in the inner mongolia china the average annual rainfall is 180 mm but it ranges between a minimum of 139 mm and a maximum of 222 mm year 1 average annual temperature

begin to freeze by the middle of november and do not thaw completely until late april qi et al 2016 the soil properties and model parameters of the experimental field are shown in tables 1 and 2 four replications were adopted for the test and irrigation water was obtained from groundwater well the average electrical conductivity ec of groundwater is 1 76 ds m 1 the irrigation water and was delivered by a pump with the exact amounts of water supplied monitored by water meters the experimental crop was maize xi meng 6 inner mongolia china during maize growth period urea plus nh4 2hpo4 was supplied as the base fertilizer and urea phosphate fertilizer and kno3 were used as the top dressing four field management treatments were studied fig 1 ridge tillage with full film mulching rfm ridge tillage with partial film mulching rpm flat tillage with full film mulching ffm flat tillage with partial film mulching fpm the experimental field was divided into plots each 12 m long and 3 m wide and four groups of mulched drip irrigation system were arranged on each plot the ridge and furrow for ridge tillage were 40 cm wide 20 cm high and 60 cm wide 20 cm high respectively after the plots were mulched with plastic film according to four treatments requirements two rows of maize were planted on both sides of the drip tape with dibblers the drip tapes spacing and emitter spacing were 100 cm and 30 cm respectively to study the impact of different treatments on soil water and salt transfer the ech2o 5te sensors were installed beneath the emitter at the soil depths of 10 30 55 85 and 110 cm at three locations to record profiled soil moisture of 20 40 70 100 and 120 cm layers fig 2 soil samples were collected by auger before and after each irrigation event part of soil samples were used for measuring gravimetric water contents by oven drying method and the rest were air dried and sieved through 1 mm mesh for preparing dilute soil extract solutions the soil soluble salt was estimated by the extracts with a 1 5 soil water ratio ec1 5 measured with a conductivity meter ds m 1 the mixed solutions of soil and water were oscillated for about 5 min although small amounts of non soluble salts remained in the final mixed solution their proportion was very low the conductivity of saturated paste extract ece was measured using the soil samples with a wide range of ec1 5 values and developed the relationship between ece and ec1 5 r2 0 966 li et al 2015 the ece of all samples was estimated using eq 1 tong 2014 1 e c e 5 88 e c 1 5 1 33 the ece was converted to salt

follows zhao et al 2016 3 s a s t ρ s l where ρ s is the bulk density g cm 1 l is the soil depth cm precipitation data were obtained from the meteorological observation station during each drip irrigation period the amount of irrigation water was recorded once in every 30 min the microlysimeters were installed at no plastic film mulch position to measure soil evaporation they were made of two iron tubes with an internal diameter of 10 cm and a depth of 20 cm for the inner and 15 cm and 20 cm for the outer the outer tube was inserted into the soil and the bottom of inner tube was sealed with a plastic sheet then the inner tube was weighed and installed in the outer tube part of soil in the outer tube should be removed to make the soil surface of the inner tube and surrounding at the same elevation each inner tube was weighed daily to evaluate soil evaporation using an electronic balance with a 0 01 g resolution at 8 00 a m the soil of inner tube was changed at 3 days interval or after precipitation and irrigation event all data were analysed using sigma plot 12 0 and surfer 12 0 2 2 precipitation and irrigation fig 3 illustrates precipitation and irrigation amount during maize growing periods in 2014 and 2015 total precipitation during the whole maize growth period was 77 mm and 25 mm in 2014 and in 2015 respectively there were five and one effective rainfall evens that precipitation exceeded 5 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively and the corresponding total amounts were 55 mm and 10 mm in addition there was one heavy rain rainfall intensity 16 mm h 1 in 2014 while there was no heavy precipitation in 2015 in entire monitoring period precipitation was limited and temporal and spatial distribution was uneven thus a certain amount of irrigation was supplied to increase soil moisture and maintain the maize growth the irrigation levels were 135 mm and 345 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively and irrigation events mainly concentrated in july and august 2 3 model

observed data initial estimates initial and boundary conditions then the hydrus model was validated with the field data of the 2015 growing period based on the calibrated parameters 2 5 statistical

n o i o 2 where oi and si are the observed and simulated values and n is the number of pair values 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution characteristics of soil moisture and salinity the vertical distribution of soil moisture in all treatments during frequent irrigation period from 1st july to 31st july in 2015 is shown in figs 4 and 5 soil moisture changed significantly and moved as vertical and horizontal direction from the drip line with increasing irrigation there was a wetted bulb formed near ridge slope in 30 40 cm layer and the other wetted zone formed beneath furrow under 50 cm layer in rfm plot while only one moist region formed in 50 60 cm layer in the rest treatments compared with ffm soil moisture in fpm in 0 40 cm layer was lower due to evaporation from bare furrow thus more soil water moved from wetted zone towards to bare furrow figs 6 and 7 show the effect of different mulching and tillage modes on spatial distribution characteristics of soil salinity under drip irrigation interval of 10 days during frequent irrigation in july 2015 soil salinity distribution was significantly influenced by mulching and tillage modes in both topsoil and deep layer the plastic film mulched on both ridge and furrow restrained evaporation of soil moisture from bare area thus the upward movement of soil salt form deep layers was slow down with the movement of soil wetting front salt under the plastic mulch was leached in an ellipse shape to the right and downward direction because the plastic mulch limited evaporation from soil salt in the soil gradually moved to the bare soil surface between the zones of plastic mulches due to higher evaporation compared with the position under the mulch with the upward movement of salt salt accumulation in the bare soil surface between the plastic mulches is a natural consequence the soil salinity tended to move upward from deeper soil to topsoil and from under the mulch toward between the mulches as time passed after irrigation 3 2 salt accumulation during the season the effect of mulching and tillage modes on salt accumulation during the maize growth periods in 2014 and 2015 is shown in table 3 full film mulch treatments had obvious desalination effect while partial film mulch modes led to secondary salinization in 0 40 cm layer compared with ffm treatment rfm significantly decreased soil salinity in 0 40 cm layer by 43 3 and 38 7 in 2014 and 2015 respectively in 40 70 cm layer soil salinity decreased in all treatments additionally rfm has significant desalination effect in this layer and decreased soil salinity up to 30 2 2 3 and 9 3 in 2014 and 47 6 3 5 and 11 4 in 2015 over that in rpm ffm and fpm treatments respectively overall during the whole maize growing season soil salinity decreased gradually at the end compared with the beginning of monitoring period there were significant differences on salt content removed from soil in 0 70 cm layer among four mulching and tillage modes especially in rfm and ffm there were positive effects on reducing salt compared with rpm and fpm in 2014 and 2015 the maximum decreased salt contents were recorded in rfm and almost 4 71 and 5 07 times higher than the minimum value recorded in rpm in 2014 and 2015 respectively 3 3 simulated versus observed results the simulated values for soil water and salt contents with different treatments were compared graphically with the observed results in figs 8 11 although there were some differences between simulated and observed data the overall simulations were in a good agreement for both 2014 and 2015 for four tillage and mulched applications both the observed and simulated data showed simultaneous turbulence at the same layer the statistical evaluation results for model performance in the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 are summarized in table 4 the region of the rmse and r2 values for soil water and salt contents were 0 031 0 043 0 84 0 94 and 0 044 0 057 0 82 0 94 respectively table 4 based on these values we confirm that hydrus 2d model performed reliably in simulation of water flow and salt migration under field experiments 3 4 spatial distribution patterns of soil salinity in order to understand effects of irrigation amount on spatial distribution patterns of soil salinity we simulated soil salinity movement under ffm using three assumed irrigation amounts 90 135 and 180 mm that were selected based on regional average annual variation of irrigation amount and average irrigation amount in 2014 table 5 in addition sources of daily climate data in 2014 were involved in simulation the dripper discharge duration and interval of the drip irrigation were consistent with those of the field experiment 3 4 1 perpendicular to the drip tubing fig 12 illustrates the simulated soil salinity distributions for q1 q2 and q3 perpendicular to the drip tubing the soil salinity for all three irrigation levels was consistently low at the surface layer and below the dripper and increased gradually with soil depth for q1 the soil salt tended to move toward the fringes of the wetted region the desalinated area under the dripper was nearly symmetrical around r 0 because the fringes of the wetted region from two adjacent drippers did not converge there was no significant difference in the middle of the film r 50 and z 0 50 cm accordingly the uniformity of irrigation was low under the q1 irrigation scheme for q2 and q3 the desalinated region under the dripper was asymmetrical and moves towards the middle of the film several previous studies have reported that the wetted region and desalinated area of drip irrigation is symmetrical on each side of the drip tubing patel and rajput 2008 chen et al 2015 therefore our results illustrated that the desalinated area under mulched drip irrigation is affected by the film mulching more soil salt was leached in the middle of the film which provided a mild salt environment for crop growth 3 4 2 parallel to the drip tubing fig 13 illustrates the simulated soil salinity distributions for the soil profiles of q1 q2 and q3 parallel to the drip tubing the desalination zone expanded horizontally and vertically with increased irrigation amount the soil salt contours for q1 were much straighter than those of q2 and q3 the volume of desalination zone for q3 was also larger than that for q1 compared with the placement near the dripper the force that drives the water move downward at the overlap front is much weaker accordingly the salt in the irrigation water could not be leached effectively is retained in the upper part at the overlap front which increased soil salt content of the surface layer at a certain extent the wetting fronts under the drippers overlapped more rapidly with the increase of irrigation amount and conducive to soil salt leaching and downward migration based on the above analysis our results demonstrated that both the uniformity of irrigation and the desalination zone under film mulching were increased when the assumed irrigation amount increased e g q3 the soil salt content parallel to the drip tubing fig 13 was much lower than that perpendicular to the drip tubing fig 12 at the same position indicating that the wetting front of mulched drip irrigation overlapped earlier parallel to the drip tubing the soil evaporation decreased considerably due to mulched drip irrigation which restricted the upward movement trend of soil salt thus forming an obviously desalination zone in the shallow layer for all three irrigation treatments 3 4 3 irrigation system optimization the safety threshold of soil salt content in the root zone 0 40 cm of maize during the tasseling and filling period in the hetao irrigation district was 0 3 ma et al 2014 the soil salt content in the root zone of q1 q2 and q3 was 0 309 0 291 and 0 264 calculated by the empirical formula of chinese saline soil wang et al 2013 respectively for q1 the salt content exceeded the safety threshold and unfavourable for crop growth although the salt content of q3 was lowest the water consumption was greater while a suitable soil moisture and salt condition for crops was created by q2 and significantly increased soil water use efficiency in the present study we illustrated that the mean yield of ffm increased by 20 08 than ck in 2014 and 2015 qi et al 2016 in order to find the optimal irrigation amount between q1 and q2 we set q4 100 mm and q5 120 mm for further adjustment of irrigation scheme compared with q2 water consumption of q4 and q5 was reduced by 10 and 4 1 respectively and soil salt content of root zone was 0 305 and 0 297 respectively simulated results indicate that irrigation level of q5 was the critical value in terms of local cultivation conditions accordingly the irrigation level of q5 is practical and feasible for local irrigation schedule under mulched drip irrigation 4 conclusion in this study based on our field experiment we observed that a wetted bulb formed near ridge slope in 30 40 cm layer and the other wetted zone formed beneath furrow under 50 cm layer in rfm plot the desalinated area under mulched drip irrigation is affected by the film mulching more soil salt was leached in the middle of the film which provided a mild salt environment for crop growth the soil evaporation decreased considerably due to mulched drip irrigation which restricted the upward movement trend of soil salt thus forming an obviously desalination zone in the shallow layer full film mulch treatments had obvious desalination effect while partial film mulch modes led to secondary salinization in 0 40 cm layer during the whole maize growing season soil salinity decreased gradually at the end compared with the beginning of monitoring period hydrus 2d model is reliable to reproduce soil water flow and salt transport under field conditions we used the model to simulate the process of soil salinity distributions perpendicular and parallel to the drip tubing under different irrigation amount the results demonstrated that the uniformity of irrigation and the desalination zone under film mulching were increased when the assumed irrigation amount increased the soil salt content parallel to the drip tubing fig 13 was much lower than that perpendicular to the drip tubing fig 12 at the same position the model presented in this research provided an efficient approach to exploring the characteristics of soil water flow and salt transport for better understanding the mechanisms of soil water and salt migration under mulched drip irrigation in field experiment it has the potential to be applied to design a suitable mulched drip irrigation system for maize in arid

11543,to investigate the influences of plastic film mulching and deficit irrigation on water use efficiency wue of spring wheat a 2 year field experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2015 in a semi arid region of northwest china the experiments involve ten treatments and each have two replicates including two levels of field mulching i e no mulching m0 and clear plastic film mulching m1 and five irrigation levels including the full irrigation treatment w1 and four deficit irrigation treatments w2 w5 the variation of soil moisture and temperature at different soil depths were monitored during the entire growing season together with crop physiological index and yield the results showed that the average soil temperature at 10 and 20 cm soil depth under film mulching were improved by 5 5 9 3 compared with no mulching during the entire growing season and were improved by 8 2 16 5 during the early stage i e 0 40 dap day after planting film mulching could help decrease soil evaporation and conserve the water in topsoil layers during the early stage of spring wheat growth while in the middle stage the crop tended to consume more soil water in the root zone under film mulching condition compared with the cases with no mulching the stages of emergence tillering jointing heading and milk ripe occurred 3 2 2 3 2 7 3 7 days earlier under mulched cases the highest wue in 2014 was 1 48 kg m 3 achieved under w5m1 treatment and the highest wue in 2015 was 1 43 kg m 3 achieved under w3m1 treatment generally film mulching enhanced the soil temperature especially in the early stage which consequently led to the advancement of growth stage and the improvement of wue for spring wheat in this area the combination of film mulching and some degree of deficit irrigation could reduce water loss and keep crop yield at a desirable level therefore with appropriate disposal techniques field mulching tends to be an effective practice to improve water productivity in arid and semiarid agro ecosystems of china keywords film mulching spring wheat irrigation water use efficiency soil water and heat transfer 1 introduction with the global climate change and the influence of human activity severe water shortage and uneven distribution of water resources have become the greatest social and environmental challenge of the 21 st century in the world karthe et al 2014 water shortage is one of the major constraints to agriculture production in the arid land of northwest china where the annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 200 mm shiyang river basin is one of the three largest continental river basins in china with the largest population the highest level of exploitation and utilization of water resources and the serious contradictions between water and ecological environment in the hexi inland river basin in gansu province in 2014 agricultural irrigation water consumption was 1 488 billion m3 accounting for 62 78 of the total water consumption in the shiyang river basin lei 2015 spring wheat one of the main grain crops in this area has a high seasonal water requirement for yields water turn to be an important input and the most limiting factor for achieving high crop yield therefore efficient use of irrigation water under limited precipitation should be considered for the purpose of saving water as well as improving production film mulching techniques have been widely used for grain crops fruit trees and vegetable crops etc kasperbauer 2000 li et al 2004a b previous research indicated that film mulching can increase the soil temperature reduce soil evaporation promote precipitation infiltration carter and miller 1991 xie et al 2005 anikwe et al 2007 li et al 2013a b and improve crop yield as well as the water use efficiency horton et al 1996 tarara 2000 over 90 of water used in agriculture is lost through evapotranspiration et leuning et al 2008 liu et al 2012 during the wheat growing season evaporation e accounts for 30 60 of et without mulching on the soil gregory et al 1992 and it can be decreased by 55 with film mulching on the soil xie et al 2005 in northwest china film mulching has become an effective technique for the local water saving yi et al 2010 conducted various water management practices for achieving favorable grain yield with high water use efficiency wue of spring maize and found that film mulching increased et improved grain yield and enhanced wue by about 23 25 zhao et al 2014 suggested that ridge furrow irrigation with full film mulching could advance emergence by 8 1 11 7 days improve wue and tuber yields of potato in the semiarid northwest china wang et al 2015 found that film mulching could increase the soil temperature at 10 cm depth by 2 3 c before july and nearly 1 2 c after july and film mulching with basal fertilizer could increase the yield of maize by 10 61 9 48 and 15 36 over three consecutive years in the loess plateau of china liu et al 2016b showed that film mulching led to higher soil water content during the dry season winter and spring for dryland crop production on the loess plateau in china for instance the volumetric soil water content increased by 3 5 at depths of 0 20 cm in winter wheat farmland and by 4 0 6 0 at depths of 0 80 cm in maize potato farmland these studies mainly focus on the impact of film mulching on the soil temperature the soil moisture and or the crop yield for crops like maize potato winter wheat etc until now there has been little quantitative experimental research on the coupled effects of film mulching and various irrigation treatments on water heat transfer the crop growth and wue in farmlands especially for spring wheat one of the main crops in northwest china the main objectives of this research is to 1 compare the effects of field film mulching and non mulching on soil temperature during the growing season 2 investigate the coupled effects of deficit irrigation and field mulching condition on water use spring wheat growth and yield and 3 determine an optimum irrigation strategy with film mulching for achieving high wue of spring wheat in the local region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiments were conducted during 2014 and 2015 at shiyang experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university located in gansu province of northwest china n 37 52 e 102 50 altitude 1581 m the mean annual temperature was 8 c the site has long sunlight hours with the mean annual sunshine duration over 3000 h and frost free period of 150 days the region has limited water resources with the mean annual precipitation of 164 mm and the mean annual pan evaporation of 2000 mm measured by a cylinder class a evaporation pan with a diameter of 120 7 cm and a depth of 25 0 cm the precipitation at the experiment site during the spring wheat growing season for 2014 and 2015 was 106 8 mm and 118 3 mm respectively which was far less than the water requirements of spring wheat the average groundwater depth is about 30 m the soil texture at the experiment site is sandy loam with field water holding capacity of 25 3 in the 0 90 cm soil layer the average organic matter total n p k were 6 48 g kg 1 0 35 g kg 1 0 51 g kg 1 and 15 83 g kg 1 respectively while the available p and k were 9 56 mg kg 1 and 124 84 g kg 1 based on our measurements 2 2 experimental design and field management a winter irrigation of 100 mm was conducted in november of previous year to maintain the soil moisture at field capacity level in tillage layer for seed emergence the spring wheat cultivar yongliang4 was used with a planting density of 375 kg ha 1 spring wheat was sown in the experimental field on march 26 and march 21 and harvested on july 24 and july 17 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with film mulched treatment m1 and a non mulched treatment m0 for m1 it was fully covered with plastic clear film each strip was 120 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick with 2 cm overlap with the adjacent film of course there were holes e g for planting the seeds and cracks on the film which normally is less than 5 in area a total of five irrigation treatments were designed in 2014 and 2015 including w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 as shown in table 1 among them w1 was regarded as full irrigation which is based on the custom of local farmers who concern more on high yield than water applied in recent years however in order to maximize the value of limited water resources deficit irrigation i e incomplete supplemental irrigation was proposed which aimed at obtaining higher crop water productivity with relatively high yield and low irrigation quota to explore the suitable deficit irrigation strategies here we also considered 4 deficit irrigation designs in the experiment i e w2 to w5 compared with w1 w2 cancelled the third irrigation at jointing stage w3 reduced all irrigation quota to 75 w4 cancelled the third irrigation and reduced the other irrigation quota to 75 and w5 reduced all irrigation quota to 50 the main irrigation methods used in the area are surface irrigation and the irrigation water mainly comes from groundwater and rivers each treatment had two replicates and each plot was 7 5 m long and 5 5 m wide there was a 1 m wide gap between the plots also planted with spring wheat each plot had a valve and a water flow meter to control the amount of irrigation three days before planting a base fertilizer containing urea 225 kg ha 1 p2o5 450 kg ha 1 was spread evenly over the field and plowed into the soil then the soil surface was covered with film by hand for the m1 treatments a topdressing fertilizer of urea 150 kg ha 1 was applied to all treatments one day before the first irrigation in both years the fertilizer entered the soil with irrigation water from the film hole spring wheat was sown in holes of 3 cm diameter and 5 cm deep under the films with a row spacing of 15 cm and a plant spacing of 10 cm for the two years using a hole sowing machine spring wheat was sown with 10 15 seeds in each hole during each growing season weeds were removed manually as required 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 weather data precipitation solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were obtained at a height of 2 0 m from a standard automatic weather station installed in the experimental station 2 3 2 soil temperature to compare the influence of full deficit irrigation and the mulching impact on soil temperature soil temperature recorders hz tj1 hezhongbopu were installed in the center area of w1m0 w1m1 w5m0 and w5m1 treatment plots under the plastic film and in the middle of two planting rows the temperature sensors are placed at soil depths of 10 20 40 and 80 cm the soil temperature close to the ground surface i e at the soil depths less than 10 cm was not monitored because the sensors would be easily affected by the soil disturbance the soil temperature was monitored every 60 min and recorded in the memory card during the growing season the mean daily soil temperature was calculated based on the hourly measured data 2 3 3 soil moisture and et soil samples were obtained by drilling randomly in each plot to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm intervals at the beginning of planting one day before and the third day after each irrigation during the whole growing season the mass water content of the soil samples was measured using oven drying method bulk density was measured at three random soil profiles in the experimental field volumetric water content was obtained based on the measured soil bulk density and the mass water content one trime tube was also installed in the middle of each plots soil water content was measured using time domain reflectometry tdr snr 0331 method in the soil depth 0 100 cm at 20 cm intervals every 10 15 days throughout the growing season additional samplings were conducted before and after irrigation events and after precipitation events the tdr measurements were calibrated with the data from oven drying method soil water storage sws in the 0 100 cm soil depth was calculated by summing sws in the different soil layers et in each plot was calculated for the entire growing period based on the soil water balance 1 e t p i δ w d r where p is the precipitation measured by a standard weather station installed at the experiment site i is the amount of irrigation that was measured by the flow meter d is the deep percolation at 100 cm beneath the ground surface r is the surface runoff from each plot and δw is the soil water storage change positive means decrease mm in 0 100 cm soil depth between planting and harvest periods surface runoff was not observed during the research period because irrigation precipitation was relatively low as to the deep drainage previous study li et al 2013a b in the same area demonstrated that the deep drainage was negligible from their detailed monitoring and analysis because the irrigation applied in this research was less and spring wheat consumed more water than maize the crop in their research therefore it is reasonable to neglect drainage here consequently et can be reduced to 2 e t p i δ w the wue kg m 3 was calculated using the following equation 3 w u e y e t where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 et is the total evapotranspiration during the growing season 2 3 4 crop physiological index and yield leaf area index lai was measured at every growing stage beginning from tillering at noon time with adequate light and no cloud using a crop canopy analyzer sunscan in order to ensure the lai of the selected plants was continuously observed at the different growth stages five crop lines 1 m in length were selected for the measurement and marked by red rope in each plot thereby to prevent potential error resulted from spatial variability the aboveground biomass of spring wheat was measured every 30 days during the growing season ten wheat plants were sampled randomly from the plot each time which were dried in an oven at 105 c for 1 h and then at 75 c for a minimum of 72 h until they reached a relatively constant weight for the measurement of final yield two areas 1 m wide 1 m long in the middle of each plot were hand harvested with grain yields and biomass yields measured 2 4 statistical analysis the spss 20 software was used to conduct analysis of variance tests least significant differences lsd were used to detect differences between the means of treatments differences were considered statistically significant when p value was less than 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation and reference evapotranspiration et0 fig 1 shows the daily precipitation and the et0 obtained based on the fao recommended equation during the spring wheat growing season the et0 during the spring wheat growing season totaled 429 96 mm in 2014 and 438 83 mm in 2015 while the precipitation totals 106 8 mm and 118 3 mm for 2014 and 2015 respectively low precipitation and strong potential evaporation through the growing season greatly influenced the soil water storage level and subsequently impacted the yield of spring wheat 3 2 soil temperature low temperatures in the spring often lead to poor development of crops zhou et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 and suppress the differentiation of reproductive organs halse and weir 1974 fig 2 shows the temporal variations of mean daily soil temperature at 10 cm and 20 cm below soil surface for treatments w1m1 w1m0 w5m1 and w5m0 during 2014 and 2015 in 2014 the soil accumulated temperatures of the plastic film mulched treatments w1 and w5 were 1890 1 c and 1886 2 c at 10 cm 1835 4 c and 1813 1 c at 20 cm respectively which are 98 8 c and 118 3 c at 10 cm 102 7 c and 154 3 c at 20 cm higher than the non mulched treatments in 2014 respectively similar results were observed in 2015 the results indicated that plastic film mulching increased the soil temperature at 10 cm and 20 cm over the two growing seasons the soil accumulated temperature of the w1m1 at 10 cm and 20 cm were increased 14 3 and 16 5 during the early growing stage 0 40 day after planting i e dap 4 4 and 4 2 during the middle growing stage 40 8 dap 1 5 and 1 8 during the late growing stage 80 120 dap fig 3 and 5 5 and 5 9 throughout the growing stage compared with w1m0 in 2014 the accumulated soil temperature of the w5m1 at 10 cm and 20 cm were increased 8 2 and 13 7 during the early growing stage 0 40 dap 7 3 and 9 5 during the middle growing stage 40 80 dap 5 4 and 6 9 during the late growing stage 80 120 dap and 6 7 and 9 3 throughout the growing stage compared with w5m0 in 2014 similar results were observed in 2015 it confirmed the previous study that field mulching can help enhance the soil temperature ramakrishna et al 2006 reported that the mean soil temperature at 10 cm ranged from 33 2 c 3 dap to 21 7 c 90 dap in polythene mulch and 30 9 c 3 dap to 18 8 c 90 dap in non mulched treatments polythene mulch increased the soil temperature by 7 4 15 4 at 10 cm depth similar to our findings soil temperature was mainly influenced by the net radiation it received and the conduction of heat to the surrounding area with field mulching the net radiation it received can be negatively or positively influenced by the variation of transmissivity and surface reflection and positively influenced by the decreased latent heat consumption evaporation decreased fan et al 2016 as a result the soil temperature may be influenced by the amount color and characteristic of the covering material previous scholars have done extensive research on effects of ground cover on soil temperature singh and kamal 2012 reported that the highest soil temperature occurred under black polyethylene which was increased 2 2 3 4 c compared with the bare soil liakatas et al 1986 showed that soil temperature under black film was lower than that of transparent film covered while for the conduction of heat to surrounding area the area between ground surface and film mulch forms an air layer with low heat conductivity fan et al 2016 and thus produces a buffering effect on heat conduction which is more apparent at night time li et al 2016a b found that although the reflection of the film reduced the net radiation into the soil in the daytime the soil temperature at night increased because the air layer between the film and the soil surface could reduce heat transfer consumption at night time our findings indicated that plastic film mulching could increase the soil temperature in the whole growth period and the warming effect was more obvious at the early stage of the spring wheat with lower air temperature when looking at the coupled effects of irrigation and field mulching on the soil temperature near the ground surface the accumulated soil temperature at 10 and 20 soil depth in 0 40 dap of w1m1 and w5m1 was generally higher than that of w1m0 and w5m0 showing the positive impact of plastic film on conserving the heat for the accumulated soil temperature in 40 80 and 80 120 dap w1m1 are generally lower than that of w5m1 for example the accumulated soil temperature of w1m1 was 627 9 766 4 c lower than that of w5m1 618 8 799 4 c it demonstrates that under mulched condition higher irrigation can reduce the soil temperature near ground surface it is because the heat preservation of the film mulching make the soil temperature of w1m1 lower than w5m1 after the irrigation moreover the leaf area index fig 6 of w1 was higher than that of w5 during the middle and late growing stage and the larger canopy reduced the solar radiation reaching the ground resulting in lower soil temperature however under non mulched conditions there was no significant difference of soil temperature between w1m0 and w5m0 during the entire growing season it is because without the protection of plastic film the soil surface was exposed to the ambient atmosphere and the temperature near the ground surface was more influenced by the air temperature than by the irrigation difference note that the above results were based on the experiment of clear plastic film mulching from the above study it can be concluded that film mulching can effectively modify the soil water and heat transfer when the soil was covered by film mulch 3 3 soil moisture in general a large amount of water was lost through evapotranspiration deng et al 2006 qin et al 2013 which modified the soil moisture both the field mulching and plant growth can influence soil evaporation and transpiration previous studies have shown that the existence of plants reduced the soil moisture at the root zone through root uptake while on the other hand it helps reduce soil water evaporation in two ways cooper et al 1983 one way is from root water uptake which leads to the reduction of the amount of soil water available for evaporation the other way is large canopy shading on the soil surface which reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the soil surface and thus reduces the capacity of soil evaporation field mulching acts as a barrier can reduce the soil evaporation into the atmosphere and hold the water in soil surface however note that film mulching can increase crop growth and the greater the canopy and leaf area of the crop the more water consumed by transpiration the sws of 0 100 cm depth table 2 under w1m1 ranged from 213 1 mm to 316 6 mm was always higher than that under w1m0 ranged from 207 5 mm to 295 8 mm in 2014 the sws of 0 100 cm under w1m1 was higher at the beginning and end of the growing period and lower in the mid growth period than w1m0 in 2015 while under reduced irrigation treatments the sws in mulched treatments w3m1 w5m1 tended to be lower than those under non mulched treatments w3m0 w5m0 both in 2014 and 2015 during the entire growing stage the results showed that the film mulching was beneficial to increase the sws of 0 100 cm soil layer under the condition of sufficient water supply w1 our results are similar to the findings of chen et al 2015 who also found film mulching improved soil water storage this is because when the water supply is sufficient the crop growth and the transpiration were basically consistent between the mulched and non mulched treatments while the film mulching reduced surface soil evaporation however in the lower irrigation treatments the sws of mulched cases w5m1 decreased compared with that of non mulched cases w5m0 that is because in case of limited irrigation field mulching reduced soil evaporation and conserved valuable soil water to ensure the normal growth of crops in the early growing stage meanwhile increased crop growth consumed more soil water in the root zone and result in an apparent decrease in sws soil water content plays an important role in crop productivity particularly in the semiarid areas the increased tiller density not only led to an increase in water consumption before anthesis but also facilitated the root development in deeper soil layers thus increased the root water uptake in those areas fang et al 2014 in 2014 the soil water content swc in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers were similar between mulching and non mulching under w1 throughout the growing season fig 4 under the conditions of w2 and w3 the swc with film mulching were higher than that without mulching in the early growing period and lower than that without mulching during the middle and late growing period the swc were always lower in w4m1 than that in w4m0 throughout the growing season under the condition of w5 the swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer was higher with film mulching than that without mulching during the entire growing season in 2015 there was no significant difference between mulched and non mulched treatments on swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer for w1 and w2 treatments fig 5 although the swc with mulching was slightly lower than that without mulching in the 20 40 cm soil layer there was no significant difference between mulched and non mulched treatments on swc in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers for w3 the swc with mulching decreased compared with that without mulching in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers for w4 and w5 obviously the effects of field mulching on soil water content were not completely consistent for the two years it should mainly be caused by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil water content distribution however in general we could find that film mulching could help conserve the water in the top soil layers in the early growing stage while in the middle growing stage spring wheat with film mulching tended to consume more soil water especially under limited irrigation conditions in the early crop growing stage the soil water content decreased mainly by soil evaporation while the film mulching blocked soil evaporation and led to a higher soil water content in the treatments with mulching in comparison to the treatments without mulching during the middle and late growing stage the soil water content decreased primarily due to soil evaporation as the soil water in treatments with mulching consumed faster for crop transpiration due to the larger leaf area index fig 6 and biomass accumulation table 4 some treatments showed inconsistent trends e g plastic film mulching slightly improved the topsoil moisture levels but reduced subsoil moisture levels due to higher plant transpiration rates similar with the findings by li et al 1999 on their experiment of effects of clear film mulching on yield of spring wheat in lanzhou 3 4 crop development and biomass accumulation early studies had shown that seedlings subjected to mulched treatments emerged 2 10 days earlier than traditional sowing non mulched in semi arid regions li et al 2004a b zhou et al 2015 li et al 2016a b compared with the non mulched treatments the growth and development progress of spring wheat was facilitated in mulched treatments the film covering provided proper soil moisture and higher soil temperature condition especially in early growing stage the emergence tillering jointing heading and milk ripe stages were advanced by 3 2 2 3 2 7 and 3 7 days table 3 respectively while the total growth stage was reduced by 4 7 days compared with that of the non mulched case we also found that the spring wheat growth period in 2015 was 112 121 days 1 5 days longer than that in 2014 107 120 days this is because the spring wheat was sown on march 21 st in 2015 5 days earlier than march 26th in 2014 obviously early sowing could increase the growth period of spring wheat this was in agreement with the results of zhang et al 2012 who also observed that the days from sowing to heading extended and resulted in an evident increase of the whole growth period with the advance of sowing date in this study we found that the soil temperatures in treatments with mulching were generally higher than those without mulching during the growing seasons fig 1 and higher temperatures in the early spring promoted spring wheat emergence in the mulched treatments fig 2 which was 3 days earlier than the non mulched treatments table 3 this was consistent with results of li et al 2004a b who reported that film mulching improved soil moisture and topsoil temperature hastened seedling emergence by 8 days on average compared with their non mulched treatments 5 days longer than ours this may be due to lower temperature during their sowing period in 1999 film mulching significantly increased soil temperature therefore the emergence date of spring wheat was prominently advanced table 4 shows that the aboveground biomass with mulching was improved about 50 at early stage significantly higher than non mulched treatments while there were no significant differences at maturity stage between m0 and m1 but the aboveground biomass of mulched treatments ranged from 3 21 to 3 71 g per plant in 2014 and 3 37 4 41 g per plant in 2015 higher than non mulched treatments ranged from 3 26 to 4 09 g per plant in 2014 and 3 37 4 41 g per plant in 2015 it demonstrates that spring wheat grew faster during the early and middle stages under field mulching condition niu et al 1998 also showed that film mulching increased dry matter accumulation in the early stage with film mulching it resulted in a higher final biomass than non mulched cases during the entire growing stages bu et al 2013 although the biomass accumulation was not significantly different by the end of the growing period and promoting plant growth and dry matter accumulation prior to anthesis could considerably increase the grain yield of spring wheat gan and stobbe 1996 3 5 leaf area index lai as shown in fig 6 no significant difference in lai between different water treatments w1 w5 under the same mulching condition in the early growing stage because there was no irrigation difference during that period with the development of the growing period and the implementation of various irrigation treatments lai under different water treatments differed at the end of the growing season higher irrigation amount treatments were associated with larger lai for both film mulched and non mulched treatments positive effect of mulching on lai of wheat was previously reported by xie et al 2005 in the early growth period of spring wheat i e emergence tillering and jointing the lai of mulched treatment was significantly higher than that of the non mulched treatment ram et al 2013 also reported a similar increase in lai with mulching in wheat this is because the film mulching advanced spring wheat phenology and increased the accumulation of dry matter in the mature stage with the canopy senescence the lai of both the mulched and non mulched treatments gradually decreased while the difference was not significant at the end of the growing period the maximum lai of mulched treatments was 0 42 1 57 higher than that of the non mulched treatments fig 6 our research showed that the film mulching could not only advance the phenology of spring wheat but also increase the maximum lai this was in agreement with the results of bu et al 2013 who found mulched treatments induced the rapid increase in lai during the seedling stage and reached peak values earlier than those observed in the ck non mulched treatments 3 6 grain yield and et there was no significant difference p 0 05 between mulched and non mulched treatments on grains per spike and 1000 grain weight in 2014 and 2015 table 5 all mulched treatments w1 w5 produced less spikes per square of spring wheat compared with the non mulched treatments in 2014 the number of spikes per square of all mulched treatments was higher than that of non mulched treatments except w1 in 2015 warmer and wetter topsoil also led to faster and higher emergence rates resulting in more tiller numbers per unit area dong et al 2014 li et al 2016a b reported that the increase of soil moisture and temperature not only promoted earlier and more stable seedling establishment but also earlier spikelet and spike differentiation and more grain number per spike and spikes per square this is consistent with our experimental results in 2015 while the contradict results in 2014 may be due to the late sowing date that resulted in significantly shortened growth period and reduced tillers for the film treatments as illustrated in table 3 furthermore some scholars proposed that maximum temperatures higher than 27 8 c mitchell et al 2006 or 31 8 c wheeler et al 1996 have been found responsible for sterile grains in wheat wheat yields in the mulched treatments were generally higher than that of the non mulched treatments under the same irrigation condition table 5 li et al 2004a b reported that the most important factor influencing the yield formation was the number of fertile spikelet in 2014 it is beneficial to increase the grain numbers under mulched treatments compared with non mulched treatments although the spikes per square decreased moreover previous studies have found that the contribution to the final grain yield from vegetative dry matter redistribution was 7 13 austin et al 1980 niu et al 1998 reported that film mulching increased dry matter accumulation in the early stage thus increasing the grain yield by 36 mean grain yields in mulched treatments ranged from 5812 4 to 7259 5 kg ha 1 which were 6 16 higher than that i e 4986 5 6494 9 kg ha 1 in non mulched treatments in 2014 and the mean grain yields in mulched treatments ranged from 4881 9 to 6949 4 kg ha 1 which were 3 5 8 9 higher than that 4835 7 6455 6 kg ha 1 in non mulched treatments except w4 in 2015 results showed a highly significant fig 7 quadratic polynomial relationship between yield kg ha 1 and field water input i e p i mm generally there was a positive correlation between wheat yield and p i when p i was less increasing irrigation could increase yield obviously while when p i exceeded 400 mm the yield increase was very limited therefore during the growing period of spring wheat in this area the field water input of 400 mm should be taken as the reference line and the irrigation quota should be adjusted according to the amount of rainfall in that year in addition film mulching could increase production under the same amount of irrigation therefore whether covered with film or not the recommended input of spring wheat is 400 mm during the entire growth period in this region wheat yields in 2014 were larger than that in 2015 this is due to the decline of soil fertility caused by consecutive planting of spring wheat in the same area results showed a highly significant fig 8 quadratic polynomial relationship between et mm and p i mm in the mulched treatments r2 0 9784 r2 0 8612 and non mulched treatments r2 0 9087 r2 0 8909 respectively in 2014 and 2015 the results showed that et increased with the increase of p i where a large amount of soil moisture consumed in the form of evaporation when the water supply was sufficient w1 there was no significant improvement in grain yield for the mulched treatments compared with the non mulched ones through the combination of film mulching and regulated irrigation it can reduce water loss in the agricultural production system and keep crop yield at a certain level as shown in treatments w3m1 in 2014 and 2015 3 7 effect of film mulching on water use efficiency wue improving wue in semi arid area of northwest china is the main objective for researchers deng et al 2006 and government policy makers under non mulched conditions with the increase of irrigation amount the water use efficiency tended to increase initially and then decrease the maximum values of wue appeared in w4m0 was 1 37 kg m 3 in 2014 and in w3m0 was 1 19 kg m 3 in 2015 it indicated that the maximum wue could be achieved by a certain degree of deficit irrigation w3 and w4 were both in the level of about 75 of the local custom irrigation indicating that current local irrigation quota is excessive for achieving the highest wue in this study we found that film mulching had obvious positive effects on grain yield formation and on wue from the monitoring results in these two experimental years fig 9 wue under mulched condition increased by a range of 7 5 27 3 in 2014 and 3 2 19 8 in 2015 compared with those without mulching xie et al 2005 observed that wue of spring wheat with mulching was 2 61 higher than that without mulching the highest wue of 1 48 kg m 3was achieved under w5m1 in 2014 and the highest wue of 1 43 kg m 3 was achieved under w3m1 in 2015 compared with the non mulched treatments the mulched treatments tended to be able to endure more water shortage and obtain the highest wue and higher yield under more deficit irrigation conditions other studies have similar conclusions on the benefits of mulching on improving crop yields and water use efficiency from their experiments in maize li et al 2012 kang et al 2016 liu et al 2016a fan et al 2016 and wheat wang 2003 fiener and auerswald 2007 hou et al 2012 chen et al 2015 4 conclusion water is one of the major limiting factors for crop yield in the arid region of northwest china to investigate the influences of plastic film mulching and deficit irrigation on soil water heat transfer and water use efficiency wue of spring wheat in this region a 2 year field experiment with 10 treatments was conducted the results indicated that plastic film mulching could increase soil temperature especially in the early growth stage and in the top soil layers film mulching also reduced the crop water consumption especially in the early stage it resulted in fast and stable seedling establishment of spring wheat due to its high moisture and favorable near surface temperature during the early growing period as a result the promoted plant growth and dry matter accumulation prior to anthesis increased grain numbers per spike and finally improved the grain yield of spring wheat deficit irrigation is an effective way to ensure agricultural production in this area the combination of film mulching and regulated deficit irrigation can promote the growth of spring wheat reduce water loss in the agricultural production system and keep crop yield at a desirable level the positive regression relationship between water input irrigation plus precipitation and yield of spring wheat also provide a scientific basis for improving crop production and wue in this area we highly recommend mulching practices with the field water input of 400 mm as both water saving technology and suitable strategy to stabilize wheat yield and increase wue in the current water limited agro ecosystem of northwest china acknowledgements we are grateful to the research grants from national high tech

11543,to investigate the influences of plastic film mulching and deficit irrigation on water use efficiency wue of spring wheat a 2 year field experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2015 in a semi arid region of northwest china the experiments involve ten treatments and each have two replicates including two levels of field mulching i e no mulching m0 and clear plastic film mulching m1 and five irrigation levels including the full irrigation treatment w1 and four deficit irrigation treatments w2 w5 the variation of soil moisture and temperature at different soil depths were monitored during the entire growing season together with crop physiological index and yield the results showed that the average soil temperature at 10 and 20 cm soil depth under film mulching were improved by 5 5 9 3 compared with no mulching during the entire growing season and were improved by 8 2 16 5 during the early stage i e 0 40 dap day after planting film mulching could help decrease soil evaporation and conserve the water in topsoil layers during the early stage of spring wheat growth while in the middle stage the crop tended to consume more soil water in the root zone under film mulching condition compared with the cases with no mulching the stages of emergence tillering jointing heading and milk ripe occurred 3 2 2 3 2 7 3 7 days earlier under mulched cases the highest wue in 2014 was 1 48 kg m 3 achieved under w5m1 treatment and the highest wue in 2015 was 1 43 kg m 3 achieved under w3m1 treatment generally film mulching enhanced the soil temperature especially in the early stage which consequently led to the advancement of growth stage and the improvement of wue for spring wheat in this area the combination of film mulching and some degree of deficit irrigation could reduce water loss and keep crop yield at a desirable level therefore with appropriate disposal techniques field mulching tends to be an effective practice to improve water productivity in arid and semiarid agro ecosystems of china keywords film mulching spring wheat irrigation water use efficiency soil water and heat transfer 1 introduction with the global climate change and the influence of human activity severe water shortage and uneven distribution of water resources have become the greatest social and environmental challenge of the 21 st century in the world karthe et al 2014 water shortage is one of the major constraints to agriculture production in the arid land of northwest china where the annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 200 mm shiyang river basin is one of the three largest continental river basins in china with the largest population the highest level of exploitation and utilization of water resources and the serious contradictions between water and ecological environment in the hexi inland river basin in gansu province in 2014 agricultural irrigation water consumption was 1 488 billion m3 accounting for 62 78 of the total water consumption in the shiyang river basin lei 2015 spring wheat one of the main grain crops in this area has a high seasonal water requirement for yields water turn to be an important input and the most limiting factor for achieving high crop yield therefore efficient use of irrigation water under limited precipitation should be considered for the purpose of saving water as well as improving production film mulching techniques have been widely used for grain crops fruit trees and vegetable crops etc kasperbauer 2000 li et al 2004a b previous research indicated that film mulching can increase the soil temperature reduce soil evaporation promote precipitation infiltration carter and miller 1991 xie et al 2005 anikwe et al 2007 li et al 2013a b and improve crop yield as well as the water use efficiency horton et al 1996 tarara 2000 over 90 of water used in agriculture is lost through evapotranspiration et leuning et al 2008 liu et al 2012 during the wheat growing season evaporation e accounts for 30 60 of et without mulching on the soil gregory et al 1992 and it can be decreased by 55 with film mulching on the soil xie et al 2005 in northwest china film mulching has become an effective technique for the local water saving yi et al 2010 conducted various water management practices for achieving favorable grain yield with high water use efficiency wue of spring maize and found that film mulching increased et improved grain yield and enhanced wue by about 23 25 zhao et al 2014 suggested that ridge furrow irrigation with full film mulching could advance emergence by 8 1 11 7 days improve wue and tuber yields of potato in the semiarid northwest china wang et al 2015 found that film mulching could increase the soil temperature at 10 cm depth by 2 3 c before july and nearly 1 2 c after july and film mulching with basal fertilizer could increase the yield of maize by 10 61 9 48 and 15 36 over three consecutive years in the loess plateau of china liu et al 2016b showed that film mulching led to higher soil water content during the dry season winter and spring for dryland crop production on the loess plateau in china for instance the volumetric soil water content increased by 3 5 at depths of 0 20 cm in winter wheat farmland and by 4 0 6 0 at depths of 0 80 cm in maize potato farmland these studies mainly focus on the impact of film mulching on the soil temperature the soil moisture and or the crop yield for crops like maize potato winter wheat etc until now there has been little quantitative experimental research on the coupled effects of film mulching and various irrigation treatments on water heat transfer the crop growth and wue in farmlands especially for spring wheat one of the main crops in northwest china the main objectives of this research is to 1 compare the effects of field film mulching and non mulching on soil temperature during the growing season 2 investigate the coupled effects of deficit irrigation and field mulching condition on water use spring wheat growth and yield and 3 determine an optimum irrigation strategy with film mulching for achieving high wue of spring wheat in the local region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiments were conducted during 2014 and 2015 at shiyang experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university located in gansu province of northwest china n 37 52 e 102 50 altitude 1581 m the mean annual temperature was 8 c the site has long sunlight hours with the mean annual sunshine duration over 3000 h and frost free period of 150 days the region has limited water resources with the mean annual precipitation of 164 mm and the mean annual pan evaporation of 2000 mm measured by a cylinder class a evaporation pan with a diameter of 120 7 cm and a depth of 25 0 cm the precipitation at the experiment site during the spring wheat growing season for 2014 and 2015 was 106 8 mm and 118 3 mm respectively which was far less than the water requirements of spring wheat the average groundwater depth is about 30 m the soil texture at the experiment site is sandy loam with field water holding capacity of 25 3 in the 0 90 cm soil layer the average organic matter total n p k were 6 48 g kg 1 0 35 g kg 1 0 51 g kg 1 and 15 83 g kg 1 respectively while the available p and k were 9 56 mg kg 1 and 124 84 g kg 1 based on our measurements 2 2 experimental design and field management a winter irrigation of 100 mm was conducted in november of previous year to maintain the soil moisture at field capacity level in tillage layer for seed emergence the spring wheat cultivar yongliang4 was used with a planting density of 375 kg ha 1 spring wheat was sown in the experimental field on march 26 and march 21 and harvested on july 24 and july 17 in 2014 and 2015 respectively the experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with film mulched treatment m1 and a non mulched treatment m0 for m1 it was fully covered with plastic clear film each strip was 120 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick with 2 cm overlap with the adjacent film of course there were holes e g for planting the seeds and cracks on the film which normally is less than 5 in area a total of five irrigation treatments were designed in 2014 and 2015 including w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 as shown in table 1 among them w1 was regarded as full irrigation which is based on the custom of local farmers who concern more on high yield than water applied in recent years however in order to maximize the value of limited water resources deficit irrigation i e incomplete supplemental irrigation was proposed which aimed at obtaining higher crop water productivity with relatively high yield and low irrigation quota to explore the suitable deficit irrigation strategies here we also considered 4 deficit irrigation designs in the experiment i e w2 to w5 compared with w1 w2 cancelled the third irrigation at jointing stage w3 reduced all irrigation quota to 75 w4 cancelled the third irrigation and reduced the other irrigation quota to 75 and w5 reduced all irrigation quota to 50 the main irrigation methods used in the area are surface irrigation and the irrigation water mainly comes from groundwater and rivers each treatment had two replicates and each plot was 7 5 m long and 5 5 m wide there was a 1 m wide gap between the plots also planted with spring wheat each plot had a valve and a water flow meter to control the amount of irrigation three days before planting a base fertilizer containing urea 225 kg ha 1 p2o5 450 kg ha 1 was spread evenly over the field and plowed into the soil then the soil surface was covered with film by hand for the m1 treatments a topdressing fertilizer of urea 150 kg ha 1 was applied to all treatments one day before the first irrigation in both years the fertilizer entered the soil with irrigation water from the film hole spring wheat was sown in holes of 3 cm diameter and 5 cm deep under the films with a row spacing of 15 cm and a plant spacing of 10 cm for the two years using a hole sowing machine spring wheat was sown with 10 15 seeds in each hole during each growing season weeds were removed manually as required 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 weather data precipitation solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were obtained at a height of 2 0 m from a standard automatic weather station installed in the experimental station 2 3 2 soil temperature to compare the influence of full deficit irrigation and the mulching impact on soil temperature soil temperature recorders hz tj1 hezhongbopu were installed in the center area of w1m0 w1m1 w5m0 and w5m1 treatment plots under the plastic film and in the middle of two planting rows the temperature sensors are placed at soil depths of 10 20 40 and 80 cm the soil temperature close to the ground surface i e at the soil depths less than 10 cm was not monitored because the sensors would be easily affected by the soil disturbance the soil temperature was monitored every 60 min and recorded in the memory card during the growing season the mean daily soil temperature was calculated based on the hourly measured data 2 3 3 soil moisture and et soil samples were obtained by drilling randomly in each plot to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm intervals at the beginning of planting one day before and the third day after each irrigation during the whole growing season the mass water content of the soil samples was measured using oven drying method bulk density was measured at three random soil profiles in the experimental field volumetric water content was obtained based on the measured soil bulk density and the mass water content one trime tube was also installed in the middle of each plots soil water content was measured using time domain reflectometry tdr snr 0331 method in the soil depth 0 100 cm at 20 cm intervals every 10 15 days throughout the growing season additional samplings were conducted before and after irrigation events and after precipitation events the tdr measurements were calibrated with the data from oven drying method soil water storage sws in the 0 100 cm soil depth was calculated by summing sws in the different soil layers et in each plot was calculated for the entire growing period based on the soil water balance 1 e t p i δ w d r where p is the precipitation measured by a standard weather station installed at the experiment site i is the amount of irrigation that was measured by the flow meter d is the deep percolation at 100 cm beneath the ground surface r is the surface runoff from each plot and δw is the soil water storage change positive means decrease mm in 0 100 cm soil depth between planting and harvest periods surface runoff was not observed during the research period because irrigation precipitation was relatively low as to the deep drainage previous study li et al 2013a b in the same area demonstrated that the deep drainage was negligible from their detailed monitoring and analysis because the irrigation applied in this research was less and spring wheat consumed more water than maize the crop in their research therefore it is reasonable to neglect drainage here consequently et can be reduced to 2 e t p i δ w the wue kg m 3 was calculated using the following equation 3 w u e y e t where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 et is the total evapotranspiration during the growing season 2 3 4 crop physiological index and yield leaf area index lai was measured at every growing stage beginning from tillering at noon time with adequate light and no cloud using a crop canopy analyzer sunscan in order to ensure the lai of the selected plants was continuously observed at the different growth stages five crop lines 1 m in length were selected for the measurement and marked by red rope in each plot thereby to prevent potential error resulted from spatial variability the aboveground biomass of spring wheat was measured every 30 days during the growing season ten wheat plants were sampled randomly from the plot each time which were dried in an oven at 105 c for 1 h and then at 75 c for a minimum of 72 h until they reached a relatively constant weight for the measurement of final yield two areas 1 m wide 1 m long in the middle of each plot were hand harvested with grain yields and biomass yields measured 2 4 statistical analysis the spss 20 software was used to conduct analysis of variance tests least significant differences lsd were used to detect differences between the means of treatments differences were considered statistically significant when p value was less than 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation and reference evapotranspiration et0 fig 1 shows the daily precipitation and the et0 obtained based on the fao recommended equation during the spring wheat growing season the et0 during the spring wheat growing season totaled 429 96 mm in 2014 and 438 83 mm in 2015 while the precipitation totals 106 8 mm and 118 3 mm for 2014 and 2015 respectively low precipitation and strong potential evaporation through the growing season greatly influenced the soil water storage level and subsequently impacted the yield of spring wheat 3 2 soil temperature low temperatures in the spring often lead to poor development of crops zhou et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 and suppress the differentiation of reproductive organs halse and weir 1974 fig 2 shows the temporal variations of mean daily soil temperature at 10 cm and 20 cm below soil surface for treatments w1m1 w1m0 w5m1 and w5m0 during 2014 and 2015 in 2014 the soil accumulated temperatures of the plastic film mulched treatments w1 and w5 were 1890 1 c and 1886 2 c at 10 cm 1835 4 c and 1813 1 c at 20 cm respectively which are 98 8 c and 118 3 c at 10 cm 102 7 c and 154 3 c at 20 cm higher than the non mulched treatments in 2014 respectively similar results were observed in 2015 the results indicated that plastic film mulching increased the soil temperature at 10 cm and 20 cm over the two growing seasons the soil accumulated temperature of the w1m1 at 10 cm and 20 cm were increased 14 3 and 16 5 during the early growing stage 0 40 day after planting i e dap 4 4 and 4 2 during the middle growing stage 40 8 dap 1 5 and 1 8 during the late growing stage 80 120 dap fig 3 and 5 5 and 5 9 throughout the growing stage compared with w1m0 in 2014 the accumulated soil temperature of the w5m1 at 10 cm and 20 cm were increased 8 2 and 13 7 during the early growing stage 0 40 dap 7 3 and 9 5 during the middle growing stage 40 80 dap 5 4 and 6 9 during the late growing stage 80 120 dap and 6 7 and 9 3 throughout the growing stage compared with w5m0 in 2014 similar results were observed in 2015 it confirmed the previous study that field mulching can help enhance the soil temperature ramakrishna et al 2006 reported that the mean soil temperature at 10 cm ranged from 33 2 c 3 dap to 21 7 c 90 dap in polythene mulch and 30 9 c 3 dap to 18 8 c 90 dap in non mulched treatments polythene mulch increased the soil temperature by 7 4 15 4 at 10 cm depth similar to our findings soil temperature was mainly influenced by the net radiation it received and the conduction of heat to the surrounding area with field mulching the net radiation it received can be negatively or positively influenced by the variation of transmissivity and surface reflection and positively influenced by the decreased latent heat consumption evaporation decreased fan et al 2016 as a result the soil temperature may be influenced by the amount color and characteristic of the covering material previous scholars have done extensive research on effects of ground cover on soil temperature singh and kamal 2012 reported that the highest soil temperature occurred under black polyethylene which was increased 2 2 3 4 c compared with the bare soil liakatas et al 1986 showed that soil temperature under black film was lower than that of transparent film covered while for the conduction of heat to surrounding area the area between ground surface and film mulch forms an air layer with low heat conductivity fan et al 2016 and thus produces a buffering effect on heat conduction which is more apparent at night time li et al 2016a b found that although the reflection of the film reduced the net radiation into the soil in the daytime the soil temperature at night increased because the air layer between the film and the soil surface could reduce heat transfer consumption at night time our findings indicated that plastic film mulching could increase the soil temperature in the whole growth period and the warming effect was more obvious at the early stage of the spring wheat with lower air temperature when looking at the coupled effects of irrigation and field mulching on the soil temperature near the ground surface the accumulated soil temperature at 10 and 20 soil depth in 0 40 dap of w1m1 and w5m1 was generally higher than that of w1m0 and w5m0 showing the positive impact of plastic film on conserving the heat for the accumulated soil temperature in 40 80 and 80 120 dap w1m1 are generally lower than that of w5m1 for example the accumulated soil temperature of w1m1 was 627 9 766 4 c lower than that of w5m1 618 8 799 4 c it demonstrates that under mulched condition higher irrigation can reduce the soil temperature near ground surface it is because the heat preservation of the film mulching make the soil temperature of w1m1 lower than w5m1 after the irrigation moreover the leaf area index fig 6 of w1 was higher than that of w5 during the middle and late growing stage and the larger canopy reduced the solar radiation reaching the ground resulting in lower soil temperature however under non mulched conditions there was no significant difference of soil temperature between w1m0 and w5m0 during the entire growing season it is because without the protection of plastic film the soil surface was exposed to the ambient atmosphere and the temperature near the ground surface was more influenced by the air temperature than by the irrigation difference note that the above results were based on the experiment of clear plastic film mulching from the above study it can be concluded that film mulching can effectively modify the soil water and heat transfer when the soil was covered by film mulch 3 3 soil moisture in general a large amount of water was lost through evapotranspiration deng et al 2006 qin et al 2013 which modified the soil moisture both the field mulching and plant growth can influence soil evaporation and transpiration previous studies have shown that the existence of plants reduced the soil moisture at the root zone through root uptake while on the other hand it helps reduce soil water evaporation in two ways cooper et al 1983 one way is from root water uptake which leads to the reduction of the amount of soil water available for evaporation the other way is large canopy shading on the soil surface which reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the soil surface and thus reduces the capacity of soil evaporation field mulching acts as a barrier can reduce the soil evaporation into the atmosphere and hold the water in soil surface however note that film mulching can increase crop growth and the greater the canopy and leaf area of the crop the more water consumed by transpiration the sws of 0 100 cm depth table 2 under w1m1 ranged from 213 1 mm to 316 6 mm was always higher than that under w1m0 ranged from 207 5 mm to 295 8 mm in 2014 the sws of 0 100 cm under w1m1 was higher at the beginning and end of the growing period and lower in the mid growth period than w1m0 in 2015 while under reduced irrigation treatments the sws in mulched treatments w3m1 w5m1 tended to be lower than those under non mulched treatments w3m0 w5m0 both in 2014 and 2015 during the entire growing stage the results showed that the film mulching was beneficial to increase the sws of 0 100 cm soil layer under the condition of sufficient water supply w1 our results are similar to the findings of chen et al 2015 who also found film mulching improved soil water storage this is because when the water supply is sufficient the crop growth and the transpiration were basically consistent between the mulched and non mulched treatments while the film mulching reduced surface soil evaporation however in the lower irrigation treatments the sws of mulched cases w5m1 decreased compared with that of non mulched cases w5m0 that is because in case of limited irrigation field mulching reduced soil evaporation and conserved valuable soil water to ensure the normal growth of crops in the early growing stage meanwhile increased crop growth consumed more soil water in the root zone and result in an apparent decrease in sws soil water content plays an important role in crop productivity particularly in the semiarid areas the increased tiller density not only led to an increase in water consumption before anthesis but also facilitated the root development in deeper soil layers thus increased the root water uptake in those areas fang et al 2014 in 2014 the soil water content swc in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers were similar between mulching and non mulching under w1 throughout the growing season fig 4 under the conditions of w2 and w3 the swc with film mulching were higher than that without mulching in the early growing period and lower than that without mulching during the middle and late growing period the swc were always lower in w4m1 than that in w4m0 throughout the growing season under the condition of w5 the swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer was higher with film mulching than that without mulching during the entire growing season in 2015 there was no significant difference between mulched and non mulched treatments on swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer for w1 and w2 treatments fig 5 although the swc with mulching was slightly lower than that without mulching in the 20 40 cm soil layer there was no significant difference between mulched and non mulched treatments on swc in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers for w3 the swc with mulching decreased compared with that without mulching in the 0 20 and 20 40 cm soil layers for w4 and w5 obviously the effects of field mulching on soil water content were not completely consistent for the two years it should mainly be caused by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil water content distribution however in general we could find that film mulching could help conserve the water in the top soil layers in the early growing stage while in the middle growing stage spring wheat with film mulching tended to consume more soil water especially under limited irrigation conditions in the early crop growing stage the soil water content decreased mainly by soil evaporation while the film mulching blocked soil evaporation and led to a higher soil water content in the treatments with mulching in comparison to the treatments without mulching during the middle and late growing stage the soil water content decreased primarily due to soil evaporation as the soil water in treatments with mulching consumed faster for crop transpiration due to the larger leaf area index fig 6 and biomass accumulation table 4 some treatments showed inconsistent trends e g plastic film mulching slightly improved the topsoil moisture levels but reduced subsoil moisture levels due to higher plant transpiration rates similar with the findings by li et al 1999 on their experiment of effects of clear film mulching on yield of spring wheat in lanzhou 3 4 crop development and biomass accumulation early studies had shown that seedlings subjected to mulched treatments emerged 2 10 days earlier than traditional sowing non mulched in semi arid regions li et al 2004a b zhou et al 2015 li et al 2016a b compared with the non mulched treatments the growth and development progress of spring wheat was facilitated in mulched treatments the film covering provided proper soil moisture and higher soil temperature condition especially in early growing stage the emergence tillering jointing heading and milk ripe stages were advanced by 3 2 2 3 2 7 and 3 7 days table 3 respectively while the total growth stage was reduced by 4 7 days compared with that of the non mulched case we also found that the spring wheat growth period in 2015 was 112 121 days 1 5 days longer than that in 2014 107 120 days this is because the spring wheat was sown on march 21 st in 2015 5 days earlier than march 26th in 2014 obviously early sowing could increase the growth period of spring wheat this was in agreement with the results of zhang et al 2012 who also observed that the days from sowing to heading extended and resulted in an evident increase of the whole growth period with the advance of sowing date in this study we found that the soil temperatures in treatments with mulching were generally higher than those without mulching during the growing seasons fig 1 and higher temperatures in the early spring promoted spring wheat emergence in the mulched treatments fig 2 which was 3 days earlier than the non mulched treatments table 3 this was consistent with results of li et al 2004a b who reported that film mulching improved soil moisture and topsoil temperature hastened seedling emergence by 8 days on average compared with their non mulched treatments 5 days longer than ours this may be due to lower temperature during their sowing period in 1999 film mulching significantly increased soil temperature therefore the emergence date of spring wheat was prominently advanced table 4 shows that the aboveground biomass with mulching was improved about 50 at early stage significantly higher than non mulched treatments while there were no significant differences at maturity stage between m0 and m1 but the aboveground biomass of mulched treatments ranged from 3 21 to 3 71 g per plant in 2014 and 3 37 4 41 g per plant in 2015 higher than non mulched treatments ranged from 3 26 to 4 09 g per plant in 2014 and 3 37 4 41 g per plant in 2015 it demonstrates that spring wheat grew faster during the early and middle stages under field mulching condition niu et al 1998 also showed that film mulching increased dry matter accumulation in the early stage with film mulching it resulted in a higher final biomass than non mulched cases during the entire growing stages bu et al 2013 although the biomass accumulation was not significantly different by the end of the growing period and promoting plant growth and dry matter accumulation prior to anthesis could considerably increase the grain yield of spring wheat gan and stobbe 1996 3 5 leaf area index lai as shown in fig 6 no significant difference in lai between different water treatments w1 w5 under the same mulching condition in the early growing stage because there was no irrigation difference during that period with the development of the growing period and the implementation of various irrigation treatments lai under different water treatments differed at the end of the growing season higher irrigation amount treatments were associated with larger lai for both film mulched and non mulched treatments positive effect of mulching on lai of wheat was previously reported by xie et al 2005 in the early growth period of spring wheat i e emergence tillering and jointing the lai of mulched treatment was significantly higher than that of the non mulched treatment ram et al 2013 also reported a similar increase in lai with mulching in wheat this is because the film mulching advanced spring wheat phenology and increased the accumulation of dry matter in the mature stage with the canopy senescence the lai of both the mulched and non mulched treatments gradually decreased while the difference was not significant at the end of the growing period the maximum lai of mulched treatments was 0 42 1 57 higher than that of the non mulched treatments fig 6 our research showed that the film mulching could not only advance the phenology of spring wheat but also increase the maximum lai this was in agreement with the results of bu et al 2013 who found mulched treatments induced the rapid increase in lai during the seedling stage and reached peak values earlier than those observed in the ck non mulched treatments 3 6 grain yield and et there was no significant difference p 0 05 between mulched and non mulched treatments on grains per spike and 1000 grain weight in 2014 and 2015 table 5 all mulched treatments w1 w5 produced less spikes per square of spring wheat compared with the non mulched treatments in 2014 the number of spikes per square of all mulched treatments was higher than that of non mulched treatments except w1 in 2015 warmer and wetter topsoil also led to faster and higher emergence rates resulting in more tiller numbers per unit area dong et al 2014 li et al 2016a b reported that the increase of soil moisture and temperature not only promoted earlier and more stable seedling establishment but also earlier spikelet and spike differentiation and more grain number per spike and spikes per square this is consistent with our experimental results in 2015 while the contradict results in 2014 may be due to the late sowing date that resulted in significantly shortened growth period and reduced tillers for the film treatments as illustrated in table 3 furthermore some scholars proposed that maximum temperatures higher than 27 8 c mitchell et al 2006 or 31 8 c wheeler et al 1996 have been found responsible for sterile grains in wheat wheat yields in the mulched treatments were generally higher than that of the non mulched treatments under the same irrigation condition table 5 li et al 2004a b reported that the most important factor influencing the yield formation was the number of fertile spikelet in 2014 it is beneficial to increase the grain numbers under mulched treatments compared with non mulched treatments although the spikes per square decreased moreover previous studies have found that the contribution to the final grain yield from vegetative dry matter redistribution was 7 13 austin et al 1980 niu et al 1998 reported that film mulching increased dry matter accumulation in the early stage thus increasing the grain yield by 36 mean grain yields in mulched treatments ranged from 5812 4 to 7259 5 kg ha 1 which were 6 16 higher than that i e 4986 5 6494 9 kg ha 1 in non mulched treatments in 2014 and the mean grain yields in mulched treatments ranged from 4881 9 to 6949 4 kg ha 1 which were 3 5 8 9 higher than that 4835 7 6455 6 kg ha 1 in non mulched treatments except w4 in 2015 results showed a highly significant fig 7 quadratic polynomial relationship between yield kg ha 1 and field water input i e p i mm generally there was a positive correlation between wheat yield and p i when p i was less increasing irrigation could increase yield obviously while when p i exceeded 400 mm the yield increase was very limited therefore during the growing period of spring wheat in this area the field water input of 400 mm should be taken as the reference line and the irrigation quota should be adjusted according to the amount of rainfall in that year in addition film mulching could increase production under the same amount of irrigation therefore whether covered with film or not the recommended input of spring wheat is 400 mm during the entire growth period in this region wheat yields in 2014 were larger than that in 2015 this is due to the decline of soil fertility caused by consecutive planting of spring wheat in the same area results showed a highly significant fig 8 quadratic polynomial relationship between et mm and p i mm in the mulched treatments r2 0 9784 r2 0 8612 and non mulched treatments r2 0 9087 r2 0 8909 respectively in 2014 and 2015 the results showed that et increased with the increase of p i where a large amount of soil moisture consumed in the form of evaporation when the water supply was sufficient w1 there was no significant improvement in grain yield for the mulched treatments compared with the non mulched ones through the combination of film mulching and regulated irrigation it can reduce water loss in the agricultural production system and keep crop yield at a certain level as shown in treatments w3m1 in 2014 and 2015 3 7 effect of film mulching on water use efficiency wue improving wue in semi arid area of northwest china is the main objective for researchers deng et al 2006 and government policy makers under non mulched conditions with the increase of irrigation amount the water use efficiency tended to increase initially and then decrease the maximum values of wue appeared in w4m0 was 1 37 kg m 3 in 2014 and in w3m0 was 1 19 kg m 3 in 2015 it indicated that the maximum wue could be achieved by a certain degree of deficit irrigation w3 and w4 were both in the level of about 75 of the local custom irrigation indicating that current local irrigation quota is excessive for achieving the highest wue in this study we found that film mulching had obvious positive effects on grain yield formation and on wue from the monitoring results in these two experimental years fig 9 wue under mulched condition increased by a range of 7 5 27 3 in 2014 and 3 2 19 8 in 2015 compared with those without mulching xie et al 2005 observed that wue of spring wheat with mulching was 2 61 higher than that without mulching the highest wue of 1 48 kg m 3was achieved under w5m1 in 2014 and the highest wue of 1 43 kg m 3 was achieved under w3m1 in 2015 compared with the non mulched treatments the mulched treatments tended to be able to endure more water shortage and obtain the highest wue and higher yield under more deficit irrigation conditions other studies have similar conclusions on the benefits of mulching on improving crop yields and water use efficiency from their experiments in maize li et al 2012 kang et al 2016 liu et al 2016a fan et al 2016 and wheat wang 2003 fiener and auerswald 2007 hou et al 2012 chen et al 2015 4 conclusion water is one of the major limiting factors for crop yield in the arid region of northwest china to investigate the influences of plastic film mulching and deficit irrigation on soil water heat transfer and water use efficiency wue of spring wheat in this region a 2 year field experiment with 10 treatments was conducted the results indicated that plastic film mulching could increase soil temperature especially in the early growth stage and in the top soil layers film mulching also reduced the crop water consumption especially in the early stage it resulted in fast and stable seedling establishment of spring wheat due to its high moisture and favorable near surface temperature during the early growing period as a result the promoted plant growth and dry matter accumulation prior to anthesis increased grain numbers per spike and finally improved the grain yield of spring wheat deficit irrigation is an effective way to ensure agricultural production in this area the combination of film mulching and regulated deficit irrigation can promote the growth of spring wheat reduce water loss in the agricultural production system and keep crop yield at a desirable level the positive regression relationship between water input irrigation plus precipitation and yield of spring wheat also provide a scientific basis for improving crop production and wue in this area we highly recommend mulching practices with the field water input of 400 mm as both water saving technology and suitable strategy to stabilize wheat yield and increase wue in the current water limited agro ecosystem of northwest china acknowledgements we are grateful to the research grants from national high tech

11544,the sustainability of soil water is a primary factor for the sustainable development of dryland farming this study was aimed to 1 investigate the characteristics of crop evapotranspiration et and 2 assess the sustainability of soil water utilization under the continuous plastic mulching practices in the winter wheat summer maize crop rotation system on the chinese loess plateau a continuous experiment of rain fed field mulched by transparent tf and black bf plastic film was implemented for three years the results shown that compared with the non mulched treatment the tf and bf treatments annually consumed more soil water with 20 8 and 16 3 mm during wheat growing season respectively but they could annually save 34 5 and 20 9 mm soil water during maize growing season respectively the et during the wheat growing season remained dominant within the 0 100 cm soil depth while the maize plants would exploit the deeper soil water in the subsoil 100 200 cm during its growing season accordingly the mulched treatments during the maize growing season could store more soil water in the 0 100 cm soil depth which can provide effective soil moisture for the next wheat season although the plastic mulching practices insignificantly changed the total crop et with a small quantity compared with the non mulched treatment they tended to reduce non productive soil evaporation and increase productive plant transpiration attributable to expected crop et characteristic difference under plastic mulching treatments the continuous plastic mulching significantly increased the crop grain yields and water use efficiency which could greatly contribute to the sustainability of local dryland farming in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system keywords plastic mulching evapotranspiration sustainability rotation system 1 introduction low precipitation with high spatial and temporal distribution limited groundwater and high water losses combine to make water scarcity the primary limiting factor in the rain fed regions on the loess plateau deng et al 2006 ding et al 2016a the use of alternative field management practices is essential for local sustainable agriculture wang et al 2015 mulching whose advantages have been reported since the middle of the last century andrew et al 1976 hopen 1964 has been proven to be one of the most effective measures to improve water use efficiency wue and grain yield in dryland regions gan et al 2013 plastic mulching has been widely adopted to modify the soil temperature and moisture conditions and thus potentially improve crop production in dryland farming agricultural areas cook et al 2006 fisher 1995 wang et al 2009 most rain fed farming areas on the loess plateau of northwestern china are subject to some of the most serious soil erosion desiccation and desertification pressures deng et al 2006 ding et al 2016b zhang et al 2014 the precipitation in this area ranges from 200 mm to 600 mm with a declining trend in the past 50 years li and xiao 1992 liu et al 2016 this rainfall displays remarkable spatial and temporal variation accompanied by frequent droughts ding et al 2016a wang et al 2012 to adapt to the local weather conditions and environment plastic mulching is an appropriate field management measure and has been extensively used in agricultural production especially for maize and wheat which are the most common grain crops grown on the loess plateau liu et al 2009 chen et al 2015 studies have confirmed that plastic mulching can reduce crop water loss caused by evaporation li et al 2013b improve soil temperature and thereby alter crop development li et al 2013a increase soil infiltration gan et al 2013 directly change soil biological characteristics and fertility gao et al 2009 liu et al 2013a and modulate plant hormonal changes liu et al 2013b accordingly plastic mulching practices significantly promote crop growth and increase water and other resource use efficiencies liu et al 2010 wang et al 2015 with the continuously increasing population modifying rainwater management to mitigate the negative impacts of water deficiency and improve crop productivity in sub humid areas are crucial to ensuring future food security on the loess plateau the winter wheat summer maize cropping system has been shown to maintain a soil hydrological balance in sub humid and semi arid regions jalota et al 2010 lenka et al 2009 and it is expected to play an increasing role in food and nutritional security at the global level zhou et al 2011 however most previous studies have focused on plastic mulching effects on soil water dynamics in the crop fallow system wheat or maize season followed by fallow on the loess plateau the investigation of the effects of continuous plastic mulching on the evapotranspiration et within a crop rotation system such as the winter wheat summer maize rotation system has not been adequately evaluated it was shown that plastic mulching practices can reduce soil evaporation and increase productive plant transpiration resulting in similar or even larger evapotranspiration losses compared with non mulching practice chen et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the soil water deficit caused by large amounts of evapotranspiration may be compensated by the precipitation during the fallow season in a single crop fallow system li et al 2013b but it is unknown when using a crop rotation system whether local precipitation would meet the crop water requirements when continuous plastic mulching was used the characteristics of et for a crop rotation system using continuous plastic mulching needs additional study in this study the et was monitored under the regime of continuous plastic mulching in a typical winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l rotation over a three year period on the loess plateau the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the characteristics of et during crop development in the rotation system 2 evaluate the effects of continuous plastic mulching on crop yields and wue and 3 assess the sustainability of soil water utilization under continuous plastic mulching on the loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the field study was conducted at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china northwest a f university 34 20 n 108 24 e with an elevation of 521 m in yangling china during the period of oct 2013 jun 2016 the study site is located in a typical region with the sub humid continental monsoon climate on the southern part of loess plateau fig 1 where the winter wheat summer maize crop rotation system is dominant its mean annual precipitation is 620 mm with a mean temperature of 13 0 c chen et al 2015 the groundwater in the loess plateau has a depth of approximately 60 m the average bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity were 1 51 g cm 3 and 31 01 cm d 1 respectively and the average saturated water content the field capacity and permanent wilting point in volumetric values were 42 9 32 4 and 18 9 respectively other detailed soil physical properties are shown in table 1 the soil nutrient properties in the top 20 cm are as follows soil organic carbon 9 78 g kg 1 total soil nitrogen 0 95 g kg 1 soil no3 n 5 19 mg kg 1 soil nh4 n 1 31 mg kg 1 available soil phosphorus 19 22 mg kg 1 and available soil potassium 287 50 mg kg 1 sampled on october 2 2013 2 2 field experiment design three treatments were evaluated in this study 1 a control that was non mulched ck 2 transparent plastic film mulching tf and black plastic film mulching bf the ck treatment was basically a flat soil surface that was non mulched while the tf and bf treatments were respectively mulched with transparent and black plastic film 0 01 mm thickness laid over the soil surface within plots the plastic mulching film was removed after harvesting and was replaced immediately as planting the winter wheat was planted in rows in mid october and harvested in early june the summer maize was bunch seeded in mid june and harvested in early october or the end of september table 2 other planting details are shown in table 2 each plot was 5 m length and 2 m width arranged in a randomized block design replicated three times and there were 0 8 m width guard row around each plot nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers were broadcast and incorporated 15 cm deep as the tillage was conducted in each plot table 3 no irrigation was used and all water inputs were rainfall during this study the field management such as pest and weed control were implemented based on the local farming practices 2 3 sampling and measurements the soil water content was determined using a trime tdr device trime pico iph approximately every 10 d during the entire study soil water content measurements were taken from the soil surface to a 200 cm depth at 10 cm intervals within the top 100 cm topsoil and at 20 cm intervals within the bottom 100 cm subsoil stage development was carefully observed and recorded in this study it included emergence started at sowing over wintering regreening jointing heading grain filling and harvesting stages during the wheat growing season and seedling started at sowing jointing tasseling anthesis grain filling and harvesting stages during the maize growing season the soil water content of different depths was additionally measured in the middle of every crop phenological stage the winter wheat phenological growth stages in chronological order are the emergence to over wintering over wintering to regreening regreening to jointing jointing to heading heading to grain filling and grain filling to harvesting stages for the sake of simplicity these growing stages will be discussed using the beginning component of each descriptive pair and therefore be referred to as emergence over wintering regreening jointing heading and grain filling stages respectively a similar notation system will be used for the summer maize where the seedling to jointing jointing to tasseling tasseling to anthesis anthesis to grain filling and grain filling to harvesting stages shall be referred to as the seedling jointing tasseling anthesis and grain filling stages respectively to more clearly show the et characteristics of crops within the rotation system the crop growing season was artificially divided into three periods an earlier vegetative growth period a latter vegetative growth period and a reproductive growth period for winter wheat the period before the regreening stage was the earlier vegetative growth period the period from regreening to heading was the latter vegetative growth period and the period after heading stage was the reproductive growth period for summer maize the period before jointing was the earlier vegetative growth period the period from jointing to tasseling was the latter vegetative growth period and the period after tasseling was the reproductive growing stage additionally the topsoil was referenced as the 0 100 cm soil layer and the subsoil referenced as the 100 200 cm soil layer in this study during the crop growing season aboveground biomass was determined for selected phenological stages where 5 wheat plants or 1 maize plant were randomly sampled from the middle of the plots and oven dried to a constant weight at the same time leaf area index lai was measured using a sunscan meter delta t at crop harvest the final crop yield and aboveground biomass were determined from a 1 by 1 m square area within the center of the wheat plots and by randomly selecting 10 maize plants within each plot 2 4 data calculation and analysis soil water storage sws mm within the 200 cm depth was considered as the total storage in all the sampled soil layers within the plot it was determined as the following 1 s w s s w c i h i where swci was the soil water content of soil layer i vol hi was the height of soil layer i mm the et mm from stage j i e its starting time d to stage j 1 d was calculated as follows 2 e t j j 1 p j j 1 δ s w s where pj j 1 was the precipitation in the duration from stage j to stage j 1 mm δsws was the change in sws from

results 3 1 weather conditions the mean annual maximum temperatures were 19 6 19 7 and 20 0 c for the planting years of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively and the mean annual minimum temperatures were 9 2 9 2 and 9 4 c in the planting year of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively fig 2 the annual precipitation was 682 6 mm 302 3 mm for wheat and 380 3 mm for maize season 523 3 mm 239 4 mm for wheat and 283 9 mm for maize and 478 7 mm 203 5 mm for wheat and 275 3 mm for maize for the planting year of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively compared with the long term average of the last 30 years from 1987 to 2016 198 5 mm precipitation during the wheat growing season of 2013 2014 302 3 mm and 2014 2015 239 4 mm were wet years while the precipitation during the 2015 2016 wheat growing season 203 5 mm was a normal year fig 2 for the maize growing seasons the seasonal precipitation during 2014 380 3 mm was a wet year and precipitation during the maize growing seasons in 2015 283 9 mm and 2016 275 3 mm were normal years compared with the long term average 320 6 mm 3 2 et of wheat during different phenological stages three growing seasons had three different et trend patterns etr and et data between the emergence and over wintering stages for 2013 2014 growing season was inadvertently lost the trapezoid shaped trends of etr were found in 2013 2014 growing season with a terrace after regreening stage in tf and bf treatments and after jointing in ck treatment fig 3 a the triangle shaped trends of et found in 2014 2015 growing season peaked at jointing stage in the three treatments fig 3b the etr trends of three treatments peaked at the regreening stage and then fluctuation changed in 2015 2016 growing stage fig 3c the reasons for these differences in the etr trend patterns observed for the different seasons are not known but are likely due to differences in rainfall distribution during the time intervals during the different seasons moreover the etr values dramatically increased between the over wintering and regreening stages for all treatments fig 3 this phenomenon may be the result of the plant roots beginning to absorb large amounts of soil water to support the fast canopy growth when et values were compared in the same stage of different growing seasons it was found that et in the tf and bf treatments tended to be higher than ck treatment during stages with lower precipitation and et in the ck treatment was higher than the others during stages with higher precipitation except for the jointing stage in 2014 2015 growing season fig 3 in grain filling stages of the three growing seasons this relationship among the treatments et and precipitation was not clearly evident the tf treatment consumed more soil water than the bf treatment before the grain filling stage and the et of the bf became larger in the grain filling stage during the 2013 2014 wheat growing season fig 3a during the 2014 2015 growing season the tf treatment had a larger value of et than the bf treatment during the regreening stage and heading stage and their et values were similar at other stages fig 3b the bf treatment had larger values of et than the tf treatment during the over wintering regreening heading and grain filling stages in the 2015 2016 wheat growing season fig 3c during the over wintering stage of the 2015 2016 growing season the et value of bf treatment was significantly larger than that of the ck treatment p 0 05 fig 3c this may be attributed to the distinct seasonal precipitation pattern fig 2 the bf treatments conserve soil water for later regreening use and promote canopy development with larger transpiration it was found that the aboveground biomass of bf treatment was larger 38 5 140 5 on average than those of the ck treatment from over wintering stage to regreening stage during the 2015 2016 growing season 3 3 et of maize during different phenological stages the etr values of the ck treatment tended to be higher than the etr values of the tf and bf treatments before the jointing stage and always had a peak value at the jointing stage in every growing season fig 4 the etr values of plastic mulching treatments were higher than the etr values of the ck treatment at tasseling and anthesis stages except for the anthesis stage in 2016 growing season the ck treatment had the largest et value before tasseling compared to other treatments except the jointing period during the 2015 growing season fig 4 during the tasseling and anthesis stages the tf and bf treatments tended to consume more soil water than the ck treatment fig 4 the ck treatment had the larger et values when the precipitation was higher during grain filling stage fig 4 those values did not reach the level of significant difference p 0 05 the bf treatment exhibited larger et than the tf treatment before the grain filling stage although the situation was reversed during the grain filling period of the 2014 growing season fig 4a the tf and bf treatments had similar et values during the seedling stage of the 2015 growing season although the tf treatment had larger et values during the jointing stage following this point the bf treatment consumed more soil water than the tf treatment fig 4b during the 2016 growing season the tf treatment displayed larger et values except the anthesis stage fig 4c 3 4 annual et of wheat and maize the film mulching treatments tended to consume more soil water than the ck treatment during the wheat growing season of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 fig 5 a but the situation was reversed during the maize growing season with the ck treatment consuming more soil water fig 5b those values did not reach the level of significant difference p 0 05 it was found that the average annual et values for the tf and bf treatments were 20 8 and 16 3 mm larger than et values for the ck treatment respectively during the latter two wheat growth seasons but the tf and bf treatments could annually save 34 5 and 20 9 mm soil water on the average compared with the ck treatment respectively over the three wheat growth seasons the film mulching treatments tended to consume more soil water than the ck treatment in the latter vegetative growth except the tf in 2013 2014 growing season and while the ck treatment had the larger et values during the reproductive growth period except the bf treatment in 2015 2016 growing season fig 5a the relationship between treatments were not evident during the wheat earlier vegetative growth and one possible reason for this situation was that et values were highly impacted by the seasonal precipitation during this period et values for the tf and bf treatments were roughly equal during the earlier vegetative growth period and reproductive growth period except the 2015 2016 reproductive growth period with larger et under the bf treatment during the latter vegetative growth period the tf treatment always consumed more soil water compared with the bf treatment for three maize growing seasons the ck treatment tended to consume more soil water than film mulching treatments during the whole vegetative growth period except the tf treatment in 2015 latter vegetative growth period when it came to the reproductive growth period et values for mulching treatments tended to be larger than et values for the ck treatment except the tf treatment in 2015 growing season fig 5b it was indicated that the film mulching treatments could conserve more precipitation into soil during maize vegetative growth period and used this additional soil water to support maize reproductive growth during the vegetative growing periods the tf and bf treatments had roughly equal values of the et except the latter vegetative growing season of 2015 while in the reproductive growth period the bf treatment always had the larger et during the three growing seasons the bf treatment consumed more soil water than the tf treatment during the maize growing season of 2014 and 2015 and had the similar value with the tf treatment during the 2016 growing season fig 5b the differences in seasonal et values for the film treatments were not statistically significant from one another during any of the three years 3 5 crop grain yields and wues compared with the ck treatment both the tf and bf treatments resulted in significantly increased wheat yields during the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons p 0 05 table 4 during the 2013 2014 wheat growth season both plastic mulching treatments had larger grain yields than the grain yield for the ck treatment but only the grain yield for the tf treatment displayed a statistically significant difference p 0 05 the yield increases of the tf and bf treatments compared with ck treatment were 17 7 and 9 6 during the 2013 2014 growth season 42 4 and 50 0 during the 2014 2015 growth season and 104 2 and 126 3 during the 2015 2016 growth season respectively the aboveground biomass of mulched treatments displayed similar significance patterns as the grain yields table 4 an exception existed during the 2015 2016 season for the mulched treatments as the bf treatment displayed a statistically increased biomass production when compared to biomass production for the tf treatment p 0 05 both the tf and bf treatments greatly increased the wheat wue compared with the ck treatment compared with the ck treatment the wue for the tf and bf treatments increased 31 9 and 52 0 during the 2014 2015 growth season and 83 8 and 89 3 during the 2015 2016 growth season respectively in addition the tf treatment had an hi value for the 2014 2015 season that was significantly different from the ck treatment but not significantly different from the hi value for the bf treatment table 4 there were no statistically significant differences in the hi values for any of the treatments during the 2013 2014 season and the 2015 2016 season compared to the ck treatment the tf and bf treatments significantly increased the maize grain yields with the increase of 22 5 and 25 9 26 4 and 43 4 23 4 and 32 0 in 2014 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively table 5 an exception was during the 2015 season when the grain yield for the tf treatment was not significantly different than the grain yield for the ck treatment the grain yields for the mulched treatments were not significantly different from one another during any of the three seasons compared with the ck treatment the tf treatment increased the aboveground biomass but did not reach the level of significant difference the bf treatment significantly increased the aboveground biomass during the three growing seasons that were significantly different during 2014 and 2016 growth seasons p 0 05 both the tf and bf treatments greatly increased the maize wue compared with the ck treatment the wue values for the tf and bf treatments in comparison to the values for the ck treatment were increased by 41 7 and 32 7 39 5 and 50 3 and 47 2 and 39 5 during 2014 2015 and 2016 growth seasons respectively table 5 the differences in wue values for the film treatments were not statistically significant from one another during any of the three years the film treatment wue values were significantly different from the ck value during 2015 but were not significantly different from the ck value during 2016 for the 2014 season the wue value for the bf treatment was significantly different from the ck treatment value but the wue value for the tf treatment was not significantly different from the ck treatment value p 0 05 the hi value for the bf treatment was significantly different than the value for the ck treatment and the value for the tf treatment was not significantly different than the value for the ck treatment in the 2014 growing season table 5 the values for any of the treatments within 2015 and 2016 were not significantly different from one another for their respective growing season there were no significant differences between the plastic film treatments in the three growth seasons table 5 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of evapotranspiration to adapt to the extreme weather and environment conditions on the loess plateau many local farmers incorporate plastic mulching practices into their management plans to ensure safety for their field based crop productions contrary to common belief many studies have shown that the mulched treatments resulted in the larger et when compared with the no mulching chen et al 2015 li et al 2013a xie et al 2015 therefore there is a need for documenting the et under continuous plastic mulching to determine the suitability of this practice for the sustainability of local agriculture the et for the growth of winter wheat were highly influenced by the temporal distribution of the local precipitation and the plastic mulching practices the air temperatures during the wheat growing season were relatively low which likely resulted in reduced soil evaporation but if there were a relatively large amount of rainfall during any one period it would be expected that the soil evaporation would correspondingly increase for soils that had not been mulched and while decrease for mulched soils due to the resistance of the plastic mulching this implication was partly confirmed by the phenomenon that the et of the ck treatment was larger during periods with a large amount of rainfall especially in the earlier vegetative growth fig 3 the plastic mulching would be expected to effectively promote the wheat canopy development due to the modification of the soil temperature and moisture yang et al 2006 gan et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 in the instance of our study the aboveground biomass dry matter for the tf and bf treatments in this study was always larger than the aboveground biomass for the ck treatment for example at the beginning of over wintering stage the aboveground biomass of tf and bf treatments had increased 59 152 and 67 104 compared to the aboveground biomass for the ck treatment respectively it is also known that a dense wheat canopy is accordingly accompanied by larger transpiration water losses when these scenarios are considered it provides a fairly clear explanation why the et of mulching treatments was larger during wheat drought periods in fig 3 sinclair and weise 2010 state that to produce 1 g of c4 crop such as maize biomass required 220 g of transpiration under an average climate of 2 kpa implying a directly proportional relationship between crop transpiration and crop biomass while this will range from about 160 g for a humid climate to about 280 g for an arid climate stewart and lal 2012 on the basic of regression results of li et al 2013b which has the similar weather condition with this study the required water amount for 1 g aboveground biomass i e shoot dry matter estimated by the inversely proportional relationship between annual precipitation and the target parameter was about 223 g in the experiment site of this study it was found that the ratio of the transpiration to the et of the ck treatment ranged from 16 7 to 22 9 during the earlier vegetative growth period which means that most of et lost by the evaporation in the ck treatment while this ratio ranged from 59 3 to 89 6 for the tf and from 32 6 to 93 2 for the bf treatments and most of them were larger than 50 this situation implied that plastic mulching treatments effectively restrained soil evaporation and promoted plant transpiration which may also conserve more soil water for latter vegetative growth and reproductive growth the plant canopy was small and most of the soil surface was unshaded in the earlier portions of the maize vegetative growing season as the maize plant developing more and more soil surface would be shaded by the plant canopy over time the soil evaporation would be continuously reduced as well as its proportion in the et the soil transpiration would increase with the fast development of the canopy during this period the entire soil surface was almost shaded by the plant canopy the soil evaporation may become very little and the plant transpiration became dominant route of water loss li et al 2013b the estimation of plant transpiration shown that all the et for tf and bf treatments lost by plant transpiration in the maize reproductive growth season compared with the ck treatment the tf and bf treatments would have larger transpiration water losses caused by the increased canopy as indicated by the larger aboveground biomass which lead to the larger et values during this period 4 2 effect of plastic mulching on crop growth although the plastic mulching practices insignificantly influenced the total crop et values compared with the ck treatment in this experiment they could effectively reduce non productive soil evaporation and increase productive plant transpiration zhu et al 2015 this change in the et pattern i e the ratio of evaporation to transpiration significantly promoted the development of plant canopy leading to the larger aboveground biomass tables 4 and 5 due to the higher soil temperatures and effective ability for soil water conservation the plastic mulching treatments would promote crop root development boatwright et al 1976 cumbus and nye 1985 in addition to the mulched practices resulting in improved soil biological characteristics and fertility gao et al 2009 liu et al 2013a thus a well developed root system played an important part in the improved transpiration rates observed for wheat and maize on the basis of these adaptations more soil nutrients and water were absorbed and transported to other plant organs clark et al 2003 which could contribute to the growth of the plant canopy as a result the plastic mulching improved the plant canopy growth and increased both the crop grain yield and wue tables 4 and 5 the maize yield varied more than the wheat yield during the three growth seasons tables 4 and 5 one probable reason for this variation may be that the rainfall was more variable during the maize growing season than during the wheat growing season zhou et al 2011 there were also serious droughts and higher temperatures during the earlier vegetative growing season that helped account for the lower grain yields during the 2014 maize growing season although the bf treatment had similar soil water consumption characteristics with the tf treatment it produced increased crop yields in comparison to the tf treatment on the one hand this may be attributable to the combined effects of more favorable soil temperatures and increased soil water contents liu et al 2016 and could promote the rate of plant emergence zhang et al 2016 on the other hand the bf treatment could effectively decrease the biological diversity of weeds and suppress weeds growth which is the result of another study in our experiment team feng et al 2017 therefore there are reasons to believe that the yield promotion effect of bf treatment is a comprehensive effect a further study is also needing to more clearly figure out the soil water consumption characteristics and yield promotion effect of bf treatment which are unique compared with those of the tf treatment compared with the ck treatment the tf and bf treatments had lower hi values during the wet years the former two wheat growing seasons and larger hi values during a normal year the final growing season the hi values displayed an inverse relationship to the amount of seasonal rainfall during the wheat growing seasons these results implied that the mulched treatments tended to allocate excessive dry matter accumulations into the vegetative organs during the wet years and ensure adequate amounts of dry matter accumulations for grain yields during the normal years 4 3 sustainability of continuous plastic mulching attributable to expected characteristic difference in crop rooting depths there was a cooperative relationship between the winter wheat and summer maize in their et characteristics the et of the wheat remained dominant in the topsoil while the et of the maize mainly concentrated in the subsoil table 6 to better illustrate this result the change of soil water storage during continuous sunny days more than 7 days was further analyzed it was found that the ratios of the wheat et values in the topsoil layer 0 100 cm to those of the whole soil profile 0 200 cm ranged from 73 to 95 around the time of the regreening stage from 62 to 109 around the time of the jointing stage and from 50 to 139 after the heading stage these results indicated that the et values from topsoil were dominant over the wheat growing season when it came to the maize the continuous sunny days more than 7 days only occurred towards the end of the vegetative growth periods over the three growing seasons the ratios of et values in the topsoil layer 0 100 cm to those of the whole soil profile 0 200 cm ranged from 58 to 315 which indicated the leading role of topsoil during this period this finding together with the fact that et in the subsoil layer occurred during the majority of the entire maize growth season table 6 implied that the et in the subsoil layer became dominant during the maize reproductive growth seasons it has been indicated that the increased maize yield exploits the deeper soil water bu et al 2013 li et al 2013b liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 all the et values of three maize growing seasons were less than the long term average rainfall of 380 3 mm this indicated that the maize production may not be limited by the amount of rainfall in most years zhu et al 2015 the water consumption of winter wheat was much higher than the precipitation during the growing season in the loess plateau huang et al 2003 in this study the seasonal rainfall was short 2 3 18 9 mm and 64 0 80 1 mm during the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 wheat growing season respectively to completely support the et it was surprising that the et for the three wheat growing seasons were larger than the average seasonal precipitation of 198 5 mm fig 5a these findings indicated that wheat production may often be limited by the amount of the seasonal rainfall which was also found by jin et al 2007 however the mulched treatments during the maize growing season stored more soil water in the topsoil that was similar to the results of wang et al 2015 which can provide effective soil moisture for the wheat sowing and seed emergence during the following wheat growing season especially under film mulching practices although the water amounts stored within the soil during the maize growing season may not be sufficient to fully meet the wheat requirement for production it can partially help to ensure a certain yield and can avoid yield failure and thus may help stabilize wheat production this situation was clearly demonstrated by the high yields of the tf and bf treatments which had relatively low rainfall amounts during the 2015 2016 growing season furthermore the et during the maize growth season may be proportional to the amount of rainfall during former wheat seasons for instance the large amounts of rainfall in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 wheat growing season were accompanied by the relatively large amounts of ets during the following maize growing season fig 5 this increased et may be attributable to the increased evaporation during the maize earlier vegetative growth periods no relatively dry years occurred during the entire period of the field study within either the wheat or maize growth seasons effects of plastic mulching on crop yield wue and et during a dry year especially in the continuous dry years need additional study in the future it was found that there were larger et values during the field tilling process after wheat harvesting if there was no rainfall which may result from the higher temperatures during this period thus no tillage and minimal tillage have been previously suggested to help conserve more soil water for maize sowing jin et al 2007 5 conclusions 1 the film mulching treatments tended to consume more soil water during the wheat growth season and retain more soil water during the maize growth season compared with the non mulched treatment during wheat growing seasons et for film mulching treatments tended to be higher than ck treatment during stages with lower precipitation and et for the ck treatment was higher than the others during stages with higher precipitation the plastic mulching treatments effectively restrained soil evaporation and promoted plant transpiration during the maize growing season 2 despite et values were not significantly different between mulching and non mulching treatments the plastic mulching treatment produced substantially more grain yield the continuous plastic mulching practice may effectively promote crop development and growth increase the aboveground biomass grain yields and the wue during the winter wheat summer maize crop rotation system it was demonstrated that the mulching treatments may stabilize the crop yields especially for the wheat under limited rainfall conditions 3 the et of during the wheat growing season remained dominant within the topsoil while the maize plants would exploit the deeper soil water in the subsoil during its growing season accordingly the mulched treatments during the wet season i e maize growing season would store more soil water within the topsoil which may provide additional soil moisture for the following wheat growth therefore the continuous plastic mulching practice was shown to be a management practice that will greatly contribute to the sustainability of soil water for the winter wheat summer maize crop rotation system on the loess plateau of china acknowledgments this work

11544,the sustainability of soil water is a primary factor for the sustainable development of dryland farming this study was aimed to 1 investigate the characteristics of crop evapotranspiration et and 2 assess the sustainability of soil water utilization under the continuous plastic mulching practices in the winter wheat summer maize crop rotation system on the chinese loess plateau a continuous experiment of rain fed field mulched by transparent tf and black bf plastic film was implemented for three years the results shown that compared with the non mulched treatment the tf and bf treatments annually consumed more soil water with 20 8 and 16 3 mm during wheat growing season respectively but they could annually save 34 5 and 20 9 mm soil water during maize growing season respectively the et during the wheat growing season remained dominant within the 0 100 cm soil depth while the maize plants would exploit the deeper soil water in the subsoil 100 200 cm during its growing season accordingly the mulched treatments during the maize growing season could store more soil water in the 0 100 cm soil depth which can provide effective soil moisture for the next wheat season although the plastic mulching practices insignificantly changed the total crop et with a small quantity compared with the non mulched treatment they tended to reduce non productive soil evaporation and increase productive plant transpiration attributable to expected crop et characteristic difference under plastic mulching treatments the continuous plastic mulching significantly increased the crop grain yields and water use efficiency which could greatly contribute to the sustainability of local dryland farming in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system keywords plastic mulching evapotranspiration sustainability rotation system 1 introduction low precipitation with high spatial and temporal distribution limited groundwater and high water losses combine to make water scarcity the primary limiting factor in the rain fed regions on the loess plateau deng et al 2006 ding et al 2016a the use of alternative field management practices is essential for local sustainable agriculture wang et al 2015 mulching whose advantages have been reported since the middle of the last century andrew et al 1976 hopen 1964 has been proven to be one of the most effective measures to improve water use efficiency wue and grain yield in dryland regions gan et al 2013 plastic mulching has been widely adopted to modify the soil temperature and moisture conditions and thus potentially improve crop production in dryland farming agricultural areas cook et al 2006 fisher 1995 wang et al 2009 most rain fed farming areas on the loess plateau of northwestern china are subject to some of the most serious soil erosion desiccation and desertification pressures deng et al 2006 ding et al 2016b zhang et al 2014 the precipitation in this area ranges from 200 mm to 600 mm with a declining trend in the past 50 years li and xiao 1992 liu et al 2016 this rainfall displays remarkable spatial and temporal variation accompanied by frequent droughts ding et al 2016a wang et al 2012 to adapt to the local weather conditions and environment plastic mulching is an appropriate field management measure and has been extensively used in agricultural production especially for maize and wheat which are the most common grain crops grown on the loess plateau liu et al 2009 chen et al 2015 studies have confirmed that plastic mulching can reduce crop water loss caused by evaporation li et al 2013b improve soil temperature and thereby alter crop development li et al 2013a increase soil infiltration gan et al 2013 directly change soil biological characteristics and fertility gao et al 2009 liu et al 2013a and modulate plant hormonal changes liu et al 2013b accordingly plastic mulching practices significantly promote crop growth and increase water and other resource use efficiencies liu et al 2010 wang et al 2015 with the continuously increasing population modifying rainwater management to mitigate the negative impacts of water deficiency and improve crop productivity in sub humid areas are crucial to ensuring future food security on the loess plateau the winter wheat summer maize cropping system has been shown to maintain a soil hydrological balance in sub humid and semi arid regions jalota et al 2010 lenka et al 2009 and it is expected to play an increasing role in food and nutritional security at the global level zhou et al 2011 however most previous studies have focused on plastic mulching effects on soil water dynamics in the crop fallow system wheat or maize season followed by fallow on the loess plateau the investigation of the effects of continuous plastic mulching on the evapotranspiration et within a crop rotation system such as the winter wheat summer maize rotation system has not been adequately evaluated it was shown that plastic mulching practices can reduce soil evaporation and increase productive plant transpiration resulting in similar or even larger evapotranspiration losses compared with non mulching practice chen et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the soil water deficit caused by large amounts of evapotranspiration may be compensated by the precipitation during the fallow season in a single crop fallow system li et al 2013b but it is unknown when using a crop rotation system whether local precipitation would meet the crop water requirements when continuous plastic mulching was used the characteristics of et for a crop rotation system using continuous plastic mulching needs additional study in this study the et was monitored under the regime of continuous plastic mulching in a typical winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l rotation over a three year period on the loess plateau the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the characteristics of et during crop development in the rotation system 2 evaluate the effects of continuous plastic mulching on crop yields and wue and 3 assess the sustainability of soil water utilization under continuous plastic mulching on the loess plateau 2 materials

additionally measured in the middle of every crop phenological stage the winter wheat phenological growth stages in chronological order are the emergence to over wintering over wintering to regreening regreening to jointing jointing to heading heading to grain filling and grain filling to harvesting stages for the sake of simplicity these growing stages will be discussed using the beginning component of each descriptive pair and therefore be referred to as emergence over wintering regreening jointing heading and grain filling stages respectively a similar notation system will be used for the summer maize where the seedling to jointing jointing to tasseling tasseling to anthesis anthesis to grain filling and grain filling to harvesting stages shall be referred to as the seedling jointing tasseling anthesis and grain filling stages respectively to more clearly show the et characteristics of crops within the rotation system the crop growing season was artificially divided into three periods an earlier vegetative growth period a latter vegetative growth period and a reproductive growth period for winter wheat the period before the regreening stage was the earlier vegetative growth period the period from regreening to heading was the latter vegetative growth period and the period after heading stage was the reproductive growth period for summer maize the period before jointing was the earlier vegetative growth period the period from jointing to tasseling was the latter vegetative growth period and the period after tasseling was the reproductive growing stage additionally the topsoil was referenced as the 0 100 cm soil layer and the subsoil referenced as the 100 200 cm soil layer in this study during the crop growing season aboveground biomass was determined for selected phenological stages where 5 wheat plants or 1 maize plant were randomly sampled from the middle of the plots and oven dried to a constant weight at the same time leaf area index lai was measured using a sunscan meter delta t at crop harvest the final crop yield and aboveground biomass were determined from a 1 by 1 m square area within the center of the wheat plots and by randomly selecting 10 maize plants within each plot 2 4 data calculation and analysis soil water storage sws mm within the 200 cm depth was considered as the total storage in all the sampled soil layers within the plot it was determined as the following 1 s w s s w c i h i where swci was the soil water content of soil layer i vol hi was the height of soil layer i mm the et mm from stage j i e its starting time d to stage j 1 d was calculated as follows 2 e t j j 1 p j j 1 δ s w s where pj j 1 was the precipitation in the duration from stage j to stage j 1 mm δsws was the change in sws from stage j to stage j 1 mm water losses to deep percolation and runoff were not considered as these losses were thought to be minimal in the sub humid climate for a relatively topographically flat research site evapotranspiration rate etr mm d 1 from stage i to stage i 1 was calculated as follows 3 e t r i i 1 e t i i 1 t i i 1 where ti i 1 was the duration time from stage i to stage i 1 d thus water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm was calculated as follows 4 w u e i y i e t i where yi was the yield of crop i wheat or maize kg ha 1 eti was the et during crop i season wheat or maize mm the crop harvest index hi was calculated as follows 5 h i y g y b where yg was the crop grain yield kg ha 1 and yb was the crop aboveground biomass kg ha 1 a one way analysis of variation using spss 16 0 software was performed to test the differences between treatments multiple means comparisons were made using the least significant difference lsd with statistical significance denoted at the 5 level 3 results 3 1 weather conditions the mean annual maximum temperatures were 19 6 19 7 and 20 0 c for the planting years of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively and the mean annual minimum temperatures were 9 2 9 2 and 9 4 c in the planting year of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively fig 2 the annual precipitation was 682 6 mm 302 3 mm for wheat and 380 3 mm for maize season 523 3 mm 239 4 mm for wheat and 283 9 mm for maize and 478 7 mm 203 5 mm for wheat and 275 3 mm for maize for the planting year of 2013 2014 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively compared with the long term average of the last 30 years from 1987 to 2016 198 5 mm precipitation during the wheat growing season of 2013 2014 302 3 mm and 2014 2015 239 4 mm were wet years while the precipitation during the 2015 2016 wheat growing season 203 5 mm was a normal year fig 2 for the maize growing seasons the seasonal precipitation during 2014 380 3 mm was a wet year and precipitation during the maize growing seasons in 2015 283 9 mm and 2016 275 3 mm were normal years compared with the long term average 320 6 mm 3 2 et of wheat during different phenological stages three growing seasons had three different et trend patterns etr and et data between the emergence and over wintering stages for 2013 2014 growing season was inadvertently lost the trapezoid shaped trends of etr were found in 2013 2014 growing season with a terrace after regreening stage in tf and bf treatments and after jointing in ck treatment fig 3 a the triangle shaped trends of et found in 2014 2015 growing season peaked at jointing stage in the three treatments fig 3b the etr trends of three treatments peaked at the regreening stage and then fluctuation changed in 2015 2016 growing stage fig 3c the reasons for these differences in the etr trend patterns observed for the different seasons are not known but are likely due to differences in rainfall distribution during the time intervals during the different seasons moreover the etr values dramatically increased between the over wintering and regreening stages for all treatments fig 3 this phenomenon may be the result of the plant roots beginning to absorb large amounts of soil water to support the fast canopy growth when et values were compared in the same stage of different growing seasons it was found that et in the tf and bf treatments tended to be higher than ck treatment during stages with lower precipitation and et in the ck treatment was higher than the others during stages with higher precipitation except for the jointing stage in 2014 2015 growing season fig 3 in grain filling stages of the three growing seasons this relationship among the treatments et and precipitation was not clearly evident the tf treatment consumed more soil water than the bf treatment before the grain filling stage and the et of the bf became larger in the grain filling stage during the 2013 2014 wheat growing season fig 3a during the 2014 2015 growing season the tf treatment had a larger value of et than the bf treatment during the regreening stage and heading stage and their et values were similar at other stages fig 3b the bf treatment had larger values of et than the tf treatment during the over wintering regreening heading and grain filling stages in the 2015 2016 wheat growing season fig 3c during the over wintering stage of the 2015 2016 growing season the et value of bf treatment was significantly larger than that of the ck treatment p 0 05 fig 3c this may be attributed to the distinct seasonal precipitation pattern fig 2 the bf treatments conserve soil water for later regreening use and promote canopy development with larger transpiration it was found that the aboveground biomass of bf treatment was larger 38 5 140 5 on average than those of the ck treatment from over wintering stage to regreening stage during the 2015 2016 growing season 3 3 et of maize during different phenological stages the etr values of the ck treatment tended to be higher than the etr values of the tf and bf treatments before the jointing stage and always had a peak value at the jointing stage in every growing season fig 4 the etr values of plastic mulching treatments were higher than the etr values of the ck treatment at tasseling and anthesis stages except for the anthesis stage in 2016 growing season the ck treatment had the largest et value before tasseling compared to other treatments except the jointing period during the 2015 growing season fig 4 during the tasseling and anthesis stages the tf and bf treatments tended to consume more soil water than the ck treatment fig 4 the ck treatment had the larger et values when the precipitation was higher during grain filling stage fig 4 those values did not reach the level of significant difference p 0 05 the bf treatment exhibited larger et than the tf treatment before the grain filling stage although the situation was reversed during the grain filling period of the 2014 growing season fig 4a the tf and bf treatments had similar et values during the seedling stage of the 2015 growing season although the tf treatment had larger et values during the jointing stage following this point the bf treatment consumed more soil water than the tf treatment fig 4b during the 2016 growing season the tf treatment displayed larger et values except the anthesis stage fig 4c 3 4 annual et of wheat and maize the film mulching treatments tended to consume more soil water than the ck treatment during the wheat growing season of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 fig 5 a but the situation was reversed during the maize growing season with the ck treatment consuming more soil water fig 5b those values did not reach the level of significant difference p 0 05 it was found that the average annual et values for the tf and bf treatments were 20 8 and 16 3 mm larger than et values for the ck treatment respectively during the latter two wheat growth seasons but the tf and bf treatments could annually save 34 5 and 20 9 mm soil water on the average compared with the ck treatment respectively over the three wheat growth seasons the film mulching treatments tended to consume more soil water than the ck treatment in the latter vegetative growth except the tf in 2013 2014 growing season and while the ck treatment had the larger et values during the reproductive growth period except the bf treatment in 2015 2016 growing season fig 5a the relationship between treatments were not evident during the wheat earlier vegetative growth and one possible reason for this situation was that et values were highly impacted by the seasonal precipitation during this period et values for the tf and bf treatments were roughly equal during the earlier vegetative growth period and reproductive growth period except the 2015 2016 reproductive growth period with larger et under the bf treatment during the latter vegetative growth period the tf treatment always consumed more soil water compared with the bf treatment for three maize growing seasons the ck treatment tended to consume more soil water than film mulching treatments during the whole vegetative growth period except the tf treatment in 2015 latter vegetative growth period when it came to the reproductive growth period et values for mulching treatments tended to be larger than et values for the ck treatment except the tf treatment in 2015 growing season fig 5b it was indicated that the film mulching treatments could conserve more precipitation into soil during maize vegetative growth period and used this additional soil water to support maize reproductive growth during the vegetative growing periods the tf and bf treatments had roughly equal values of the et except the latter vegetative growing season of 2015 while in the reproductive growth period the bf treatment always had the larger et during the three growing seasons the bf treatment consumed more soil water than the tf treatment during the maize growing season of 2014 and 2015 and had the similar value with the tf treatment during the 2016 growing season fig 5b the differences in seasonal et values for the film treatments were not statistically significant from one another during any of the three years 3 5 crop grain yields and wues compared with the ck treatment both the tf and bf treatments resulted in significantly increased wheat yields during the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 growing seasons p 0 05 table 4 during the 2013 2014 wheat growth season both plastic mulching treatments had larger grain yields than the grain yield for the ck treatment but only the grain yield for the tf treatment displayed a statistically significant difference p 0 05 the yield increases of the tf and bf treatments compared with ck treatment were 17 7 and 9 6 during the 2013 2014 growth season 42 4 and 50 0 during the 2014 2015 growth season and 104 2 and 126 3 during the 2015 2016 growth season respectively the aboveground biomass of mulched treatments displayed similar significance patterns as the grain yields table 4 an exception existed during the 2015 2016 season for the mulched treatments as the bf treatment displayed a statistically increased biomass production when compared to biomass production for the tf treatment p 0 05 both the tf and bf treatments greatly increased the wheat wue compared with the ck treatment compared with the ck treatment the wue for the tf and bf treatments increased 31 9 and 52 0 during the 2014 2015 growth season and 83 8 and 89 3 during the 2015 2016 growth season respectively in addition the tf treatment had an hi value for the 2014 2015 season that was significantly different from the ck treatment but not significantly different from the hi value for the bf treatment table 4 there were no statistically significant differences in the hi values for any of the treatments during the 2013 2014 season and the 2015 2016 season compared to the ck treatment the tf and bf treatments significantly increased the maize grain yields with the increase of 22 5 and 25 9 26 4 and 43 4 23 4 and 32 0 in 2014 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively table 5 an exception was during the 2015 season when the grain yield for the tf treatment was not significantly different than the grain yield for the ck treatment the grain yields for the mulched treatments were not significantly different from one another during any of the three seasons compared with the ck treatment the tf treatment increased the aboveground biomass but did not reach the level of significant difference the bf treatment significantly increased the aboveground biomass during the three growing seasons that were significantly different during 2014 and 2016 growth seasons p 0 05 both the tf and bf treatments greatly increased the maize wue compared with the ck treatment the wue values for the tf and bf treatments in comparison to the values for the ck treatment were increased by 41 7 and 32 7 39 5 and 50 3 and 47 2 and 39 5 during 2014 2015 and 2016 growth seasons respectively table 5 the differences in wue values for the film treatments were not statistically significant from one another during any of the three years the film treatment wue values were significantly different from the ck value during 2015 but were not significantly different from the ck value during 2016 for the 2014 season the wue value for the bf treatment was significantly different from the ck treatment value but the wue value for the tf treatment was not significantly different from the ck treatment value p 0 05 the hi value for the bf treatment was significantly different than the value for the ck treatment and the value for the tf treatment was not significantly different than the value for the ck treatment in the 2014 growing season table 5 the values for any of the treatments within 2015 and 2016 were not significantly different from one another for their respective growing season there were no significant differences between the plastic film treatments in the three growth seasons table 5 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of evapotranspiration to adapt to the extreme weather and environment conditions on the loess plateau many local farmers incorporate plastic mulching practices into their management plans to ensure safety for their field based crop productions contrary to common belief many studies have shown that the mulched treatments resulted in the larger et when compared with the no mulching chen et al 2015 li et al 2013a xie et al 2015 therefore there is a need for documenting the et under continuous plastic mulching to determine the suitability of this practice for the sustainability of local agriculture the et for the growth of winter wheat were highly influenced by the temporal distribution of the local precipitation and the plastic mulching practices the air temperatures during the wheat growing season were relatively low which likely resulted in reduced soil evaporation but if there were a relatively large amount of rainfall during any one period it would be expected that the soil evaporation would correspondingly increase for soils that had not been mulched and while decrease for mulched soils due to the resistance of the plastic mulching this implication was partly confirmed by the phenomenon that the et of the ck treatment was larger during periods with a large amount of rainfall especially in the earlier vegetative growth fig 3 the plastic mulching would be expected to effectively promote the wheat canopy development due to the modification of the soil temperature and moisture yang et al 2006 gan et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 in the instance of our study the aboveground biomass dry matter for the tf and bf treatments in this study was always larger than the aboveground biomass for the ck treatment for example at the beginning of over wintering stage the aboveground biomass of tf and bf treatments had increased 59 152 and 67 104 compared to the aboveground biomass for the ck treatment respectively it is also known that a dense wheat canopy is accordingly accompanied by larger transpiration water losses when these scenarios are considered it provides a fairly clear explanation why the et of mulching treatments was larger during wheat drought periods in fig 3 sinclair and weise 2010 state that to produce 1 g of c4 crop such as maize biomass required 220 g of transpiration under an average climate of 2 kpa implying a directly proportional relationship between crop transpiration and crop biomass while this will range from about 160 g for a humid climate to about 280 g for an arid climate stewart and lal 2012 on the basic of regression results of li et al 2013b which has the similar weather condition with this study the required water amount for 1 g aboveground biomass i e shoot dry matter estimated by the inversely proportional relationship between annual precipitation and the target parameter was about 223 g in the experiment site of this study it was found that the ratio of the transpiration to the et of the ck treatment ranged from 16 7 to 22 9 during the earlier vegetative growth period which means that most of et lost by the evaporation in the ck treatment while this ratio ranged from 59 3 to 89 6 for the tf and from 32 6 to 93 2 for the bf treatments and most of them were larger than 50 this situation implied that plastic mulching treatments effectively restrained soil evaporation and promoted plant transpiration which may also conserve more soil water for latter vegetative growth and reproductive growth the plant canopy was small and most of the soil surface was unshaded in the earlier portions of the maize vegetative growing season as the maize plant developing more and more soil surface would be shaded by the plant canopy over time the soil evaporation would be continuously reduced as well as its proportion in the et the soil transpiration would increase with the fast development of the canopy during this period the entire soil surface was almost shaded by the plant canopy the soil evaporation may become very little and the plant transpiration became dominant route of water loss li et al 2013b the estimation of plant transpiration shown that all the et for tf and bf treatments lost by plant transpiration in the maize reproductive growth season compared with the ck treatment the tf and bf treatments would have larger transpiration water losses caused by the increased canopy as indicated by the larger aboveground biomass which lead to the larger et values during this period 4 2 effect of plastic mulching on crop growth although the plastic mulching practices insignificantly influenced the total crop et values compared with the ck treatment in this experiment they could effectively reduce non productive soil evaporation and increase productive plant transpiration zhu et al 2015 this change in the et pattern i e the ratio of evaporation to transpiration significantly promoted the development of plant canopy leading to the larger aboveground biomass tables 4 and 5 due to the higher soil temperatures and effective ability for soil water conservation the plastic mulching treatments would promote crop root development boatwright et al 1976 cumbus and nye 1985 in addition to the mulched practices resulting in improved soil biological characteristics and fertility gao et al 2009 liu et al 2013a thus a well developed root system played an important part in the improved transpiration rates observed for wheat and maize on the basis of these adaptations more soil nutrients and water were absorbed and transported to other plant organs clark et al 2003 which could contribute to the growth of the plant canopy as a result the plastic mulching improved the plant canopy growth and increased both the crop grain yield and wue tables 4 and 5 the maize yield varied more than the wheat yield during the three growth seasons tables 4 and 5 one probable reason for this variation may be that the rainfall was more variable during the maize growing season than during the wheat growing season zhou et al 2011 there were also serious droughts and higher temperatures during the earlier vegetative growing season that helped account for the lower grain yields during the 2014 maize growing season although the bf treatment had similar soil water consumption characteristics with the tf treatment it produced increased crop yields in comparison to the tf treatment on the one hand this may be attributable to the combined effects of more favorable soil temperatures and increased soil water contents liu et al 2016 and could promote the rate of plant emergence zhang et al 2016 on the other hand the bf treatment could effectively decrease the biological diversity of weeds and suppress weeds growth which is the result of another study in our experiment team feng et al 2017 therefore there are reasons to believe that the yield promotion effect of bf treatment is a comprehensive effect a further study is also needing to more clearly figure out the soil water consumption characteristics and yield promotion effect of bf treatment which are unique compared with those of the tf treatment compared with the ck treatment the tf and bf treatments had lower hi values during the wet years the former two wheat growing seasons and larger hi values during a normal year the final growing season the hi values displayed an inverse relationship to the amount of seasonal rainfall during the wheat growing seasons these results implied that the mulched treatments tended to allocate excessive dry matter accumulations into the vegetative organs during the wet years and ensure adequate amounts of dry matter accumulations for grain yields during the normal years 4 3 sustainability of continuous plastic mulching attributable to expected characteristic difference in crop rooting depths there was a cooperative relationship between the winter wheat and summer maize in their et characteristics the et of the wheat remained dominant in the topsoil while the et of the maize mainly concentrated in the subsoil table 6 to better illustrate this result the change of soil water storage during continuous sunny days more than 7 days was further analyzed it was found that the ratios of the wheat et values in the topsoil layer 0 100 cm to those of the whole soil profile 0 200 cm ranged from 73 to 95 around the time of the regreening stage from 62 to 109 around the time of the jointing stage and from 50 to 139 after the heading stage these results indicated that the et values from topsoil were dominant over the wheat growing season when it came to the maize the continuous sunny days more than 7 days only occurred towards the end of the vegetative growth periods over the three growing seasons the ratios of et values in the topsoil layer 0 100 cm to those of the whole soil profile 0 200 cm ranged from 58 to 315 which indicated the leading role of topsoil during this period this finding together with the fact that et in the subsoil layer occurred during the majority of the entire maize growth season table 6 implied that the et in the subsoil layer became dominant during the maize reproductive growth seasons it has been indicated that the increased maize yield exploits the deeper soil water bu et al 2013 li et al 2013b liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 all the et values of three maize growing seasons were less than the long term average rainfall of 380 3 mm this indicated that the maize production may not be limited by the amount of rainfall in most years zhu et al 2015 the water consumption of winter wheat was much higher than the precipitation during the growing season in the loess plateau huang et al 2003 in this study the seasonal rainfall was short 2 3 18 9 mm and 64 0 80 1 mm during the 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 wheat growing season respectively to completely support the et it was surprising that the et for the three wheat growing seasons were larger than the average seasonal precipitation of 198 5 mm fig 5a these findings indicated that wheat production may often be limited by the amount of the seasonal rainfall which was also found by jin et al 2007 however the mulched treatments during the maize growing season stored more soil water in the topsoil that was similar to the results of wang et al 2015 which can provide effective soil moisture for the wheat sowing and seed emergence during the following wheat growing season especially under film mulching practices although the water amounts stored within the soil during the maize growing season may not be sufficient to fully meet the wheat requirement for production it can partially help to ensure a certain yield and can avoid yield failure and thus may help stabilize wheat production this situation was clearly demonstrated by the high yields of the tf and bf treatments which had relatively low rainfall amounts during the 2015 2016 growing season furthermore the et during the maize growth season may be proportional to the amount of rainfall during former wheat seasons for instance the large amounts of rainfall in 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 wheat growing season were accompanied by the relatively large amounts of ets during the following maize growing season fig 5 this increased et may be attributable to the increased evaporation during the maize earlier vegetative growth periods no relatively dry years occurred during the entire period of the field study within either the wheat or maize growth seasons effects of plastic mulching on crop yield wue and et during a dry year especially in the continuous dry years need additional study in the future it was found that there were larger et values during the field tilling process after wheat harvesting if there was no rainfall which may result from the higher temperatures during this period thus no tillage and minimal tillage have been previously suggested to help conserve more soil water for maize sowing jin et al 2007 5 conclusions 1 the film mulching treatments tended to consume more soil water during the wheat growth season and retain more soil water during the maize growth season compared with the non mulched treatment during wheat growing seasons et for film mulching treatments tended to be higher than ck treatment during stages with lower precipitation and et for the ck treatment was higher than the others during stages with higher precipitation the plastic mulching treatments effectively restrained soil evaporation and promoted plant transpiration during the maize growing season 2 despite et values were not significantly different between mulching and non mulching treatments the plastic mulching treatment produced substantially more grain yield the continuous plastic mulching practice may effectively promote crop development and growth increase the aboveground biomass grain yields and the wue during the winter wheat summer maize crop rotation system it was demonstrated that the mulching treatments may stabilize the crop yields especially for the wheat under limited rainfall conditions 3 the et of during the wheat growing season remained dominant within the topsoil while the maize plants would exploit the deeper soil water in the subsoil during its growing season accordingly the mulched treatments during the wet season i e maize growing season would store more soil water within the topsoil which may provide additional soil moisture for the following wheat growth therefore the continuous plastic mulching practice was shown to be a management practice that will greatly contribute to the sustainability of soil water for the winter wheat summer maize crop rotation system on the loess plateau of china acknowledgments this work
