1325,drought is one of the main factors negatively affecting crop growth optimizing irrigation time and irrigation amount are two effective ways to improve crop yield and water use efficiency in order to achieve process based optimization in shallow groundwater area a comprehensive model is established by combining epic crop growth module soil and groundwater water salt balance models and multi objectives 0 1 programming multi objectives are set to maximize crop biomass accumulated in drought period and improve water use efficiency for saving water the irrigation amount and irrigation time of maize during drought periods are optimized by the day the results indicate that soil salinization can aggravate the water stress to crops the optimized schemes show the significant difference of total biomass and water use efficiency when irrigating at different time during drought conditions water sensitivity coefficients can be used to roughly guide the irrigation strategies that irrigation should be conducted as early as possible during water sensitive periods so as to guarantee the high crop biomass and water use efficiency the integrated model established in this study provides a reference approach for optimizing irrigation time and irrigation amount based on dynamic changes the established model and obtained results in this study seek to potentially provide effective strategies combating agricultural droughts graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords maize optimal irrigation time optimal irrigation amount shallow groundwater soil water and salt movement 1 introduction drought is one of the main factors negatively affecting crop growth zhou et al 2020 with global warming extreme drought events are frequent in recent years such as the millennium drought in australia the 2011 droughts in texas mexico and east africa and the us summer droughts in 2012 and 2016 which greatly affected crops growth and may threaten national food security lewis et al 2011 schubert et al 2014 williams et al 2015 otkin et al 2018 liu et al 2020 ahmed 2020 how to optimally allocate water resources under drought conditions may be a challenge for managers especially in shallow groundwater area where shallow groundwater table and high soil salt content increase complexities to the system xu et al 2012 ren et al 2017 reca et al 2018 the optimization during the whole crop growth stage based on growth process has been conducted in many researches using water crop water production functions zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 and crop simulation models such as aquacrop and epic model xue et al 2017 bai and gao 2021 linker 2021 roy et al 2019 jalil et al 2020 lopez et al 2017 song and jin 2020 the incorporation of simulation model and optimization model provides an effective way to obtain the optimal irrigation scheme and can offer feasible plans for managers mandal et al 2020 however most researches focused on the whole growth period with known water availability mandal et al 2020 guo et al 2021 garcía vila and fereres 2012 liao et al 2020 laurence et al 2018 it is a problem deserving studying that how to optimally allocate availability in the early or middle growth stage with unknown future water availability with the randomness of droughts how to optimally allocate the available water at present as is well known that when the crop is not mature that is before the yield is formed the growth indicators of the crop such as leaf area index and accumulated biomass can reflect the growth status of the crop du 2020 conducting irrigation at different irrigation time will lead to different growth status of crops for example irrigation in the late drought period is not beneficial to crop recovery after the drought kourgialas et al 2019 tang et al 2018 thus it is of certain research value to optimize irrigation time and amount of crops for maximizing water use efficiency when drought occurs in the middle growth period with better crop growth indicators as the objective shallow groundwater area is featured with relatively shallow groundwater table and high soil salt content where shallow groundwater table will result in the frequent water exchange between soil and groundwater and soil salinization will also greatly affect the crop growth xu et al 2010 xu et al 2012 ren et al 2017 ramos et al 2017 nevertheless there are limited researches revealing the optimal irrigation scheme using process based models in shallow groundwater area additionally for arid and semiarid area improving water use efficiency also should be considered as well as crop growth status so as to save water resource zhao et al 2020 and optimization with multi objectives will give consideration to water resource sustainability on the basis of ensuring food security in order to solve the above problems the comprehensive model integrating the optimization model and simulation models covering crop growth module and soil and groundwater water salt balance model is proposed in this study to obtain the optimal irrigation scheme under drought conditions that happens in the early middle and late crop growth stage irrigation amount and irrigation time are both optimized with multi objectives 0 1 programming to maximizing water use efficiency and total biomass accumulated during the drought period the crop growth indicators such as water use efficiency leaf area index biomass and yield at different irrigation time are examined to explore the potential irrigation strategies in doing this this study seeks to provide an effective and practical approach for managers to optimally allocate limited available water under drought conditions to improve water use efficiency and guarantee food security 2 study system 2 1 study area jiefangzha irrigation area jia is the second largest irrigation area in hetao irrigation district fig 1 it belongs to arid and semi arid area with the average annual rainfall of 140 mm and evaporation of about 2000 mm the annual average temperature is about 7 c the irrigated area and cultivated area in jia is 142 10 ha and 122 00 ha respectively which is mainly planted maize wheat and sunflower the growth of these crops mainly depends on water diversion from yellow river among of them maize has the largest planting area and occupies roughly 30 of total irrigation water due to long term irrigation and poor drainage condition jia has relatively shallow groundwater depth fluctuating between 1 5 and 3 0 m the evaporation of groundwater provides about 20 30 water for crops growth however salt is carried with evaporation into the soil which leads high soil salt content in jia and the intense surface evaporation intensifies the salinization of crop root layer soil therefore shallow groundwater table and high salt content in soil are two specific features of jia which need to be considered in optimizing irrigation schedules in this study monthly average water diversion in jia is set as 100 scenario low drought scenario the 70 of 100 scenario is approximately equal to the minimum monthly water diversion of jia in recent years therefore the 70 of 100 scenario is set as the severe drought scenario another scenario is the 85 of 100 scenario which is considered as the middle drought scenario as fig 2 except for drought period the irrigation scenario in other months are set as 85 scenario because the actual situation of crops in this area may be under middle drought condition in most cases maize is taken as the research crop whose growth stage is as table 1 shown the context in 2011 the year with minimum annual rainfall in recent 20 years is taken as growing environment of maize 2 2 data collection the water diversion data used in this study was collected from local yearbooks and local water resources gazette meteorological data was acquired from the local meteorological station and downloaded from the website of china meteorological data service center the related parameters in crop growth model and water salt movement model are collected from previous researches gao 2017 xue et al 2017 xue et al 2018 yue 2004 the lingo 14 programming software was used to run the established integrated model 3 model development 3 1 study framework in order to optimize the crop growth process in jia the crop growth module in epic model is chosen to simulate the crop growth process and the soil water and salt balance model is used to calculate the exchange capacity of water and salt between soil and groundwater because the combination of crop growth module in epic model and soil water salt balance model has been demonstrated to have relatively high simulation accuracy of maize process in jia chen et al 2020 gao et al 2018 gao 2017 xu et al 2012 additionally this study considers the total biomass accumulated and water use efficiency during drought period and multi objectives programming is needed to balance these two objectives under drought conditions mahmood and mohammad 2020 in this study the multi objectives 0 1 programming is utilized to obtain the optimized irrigation time and irrigation amount of maize under two maximized objectives there are three premises and assumptions before model calculation 1 maize is irrigated only once in may june july and august respectively 2 the infiltration of irrigation water can be completed within one day 3 if soil moisture content is greater than the field water capacity the surplus water will seep down to the groundwater finally the simulation optimization framework is established as fig 3 shown 3 2 epic model growth module the epic model has been demonstrated to be adequately accurate to simulate the crops growth biomass and yield le et al 2018 the epic crop growth module is used to simulate the crops growth under different drought conditions and the related equations are programmed into the integrated model the epic model growth module williams et al 1989 mainly includes phenological development potential biomass leaf area index plant height and root growth the related parameters in the growth module of epic model are equal to the values in the research of gao 2017 as shown in table 2 who conducted the maize field experiments in jia and calibrated the parameters of epic model 1 phenological development 1 hu t t mx t t mn t 2 t b 2 hui t t 1 t hu t phu where hu t represents

shown in table 3 3 5 optimization model in order to guarantee the high total biomass and water use efficiency of crops under drought conditions two objective functions are set as 1 maximize the total

function 1 and objective function 2 respectively the obtained ω 1 and ω 2 are respectively taken as 0 75 and 0 25 it indicates that ensuring total biomass has higher weight than maximizing water use efficiency under drought conditions the constraints of the developed optimization model include soil moisture constraints water availability constraints and 0 1 variables constraints soil moisture constraints 37 θ wpsalt θ t θ fc 38 θ wpsalt θ fc water availability constraints 39 t 1 t q t q sup where q sup is the amount of available water during the drought period mm it is assumed that maize

is taken as an example to analyze the impacts of irrigation time on actual evapotranspiration aet water use efficiency wue and the total biomass tb of maize accumulated during the drought period as shown in figs 4 6 8 10 13 ① droughts occurring in may as droughts occurring in may the tb and wue increase slowly first and then decrease rapidly with irrigation time fig 4 the big reduction in tb and wue in the late may may be because the delay of irrigation time aggravates the water deficit to maize the severe water deficit caused by long term non irrigation results in the large decline of crop tb and wue if irrigation is carried out between may 8 and may 26 the tb of maize accumulated in may will achieve an above average value and reaches the maximum at 8 10 10 4 t hm2 on may 22 together the wue will be higher than the average value if irrigation is carried out between may 11 and may 27 and reaches a peak at 7 54 10 4 g m3 on may 23 due to relatively small value of tb and wue even little fluctuations in these two indicators will cause a large change range whose differences between maximum and minimum values are smaller than aet though the similar changing trend between the aet tb and wue can be observed the aet reaches the maximum at 119 04 mm on may 8 with the optimal irrigation scheme optimal irrigation time and irrigation amount fig 5 irrigation water is respectively saved by 21 39 9 54 and 0 at h m and l scenarios and no significant differences of lai and tb among different scenarios indicate the possibility of adopting water saving strategies during this period ② droughts occurring in june in june the aet of maize decreases steadily with irrigation time and the maximum value is 103 75 mm on june 2 fig 6 the tb and wue of maize achieve maximum values on june 17 and june 19 at 4 83 t hm2 and 5 22 g m3 respectively if the maize is irrigated between june 9 and 23 its tb will maintain an above average value while the wue can achieve the above average value when irrigation is conducted between june 12 and 25 after optimization the optimal irrigation time at h m and l scenario is all june 17 and the optimal irrigation water is the maximum available water as shown in fig 7 table 4 during this period in june main growth period of maize different drought scenarios cause significant difference in lai and tb the lai is improved by 11 16 h and 6 18 m than l scenario and the tb is increased by 26 97 h and 14 33 m respectively than l scenario these large changes of lai and tb indicate the importance of full irrigation in this period ③ droughts occurring in july the aet and tb of maize both decrease with irrigation time fig 8 while the wue shows an increasing trend with irrigation time with the maximum value of 26 94 g m3 on july 31 and maximum value of 19 23 g m3 on july 2 additionally the tb of maize is higher than the average level of 15 29 t hm2 if the maize is irrigated before july 18 the smaller decreased proportion of tb than aet can be observed because of the relatively high background values the high decrease in aet and relatively low decline of tb lead to an increasing trend of wue after the balance of improving tb and wue it is obtained that the best irrigation time under three scenarios is all july 2 as fig 9 shown the irrigation water can barely influence the lai that at h scenario is only 0 06 higher than l scenario as the lai has almost reached to the maximum value before drought occurs by contrast the decrease of irrigation water can significantly decrease the tb that at h and m scenario is significantly 12 96 and 6 63 higher than that at l scenario ④ droughts occurring in august early irrigation time may be an effective strategy in maintaining high tb as the aet tb and yield of maize all decrease with irrigation time fig 10 the maximum of these indicators are all reached on august 2 at 48 79 mm 25 51 t hm2 and 9 24 t hm2 respectively the wue of maize shows an increasing trend and reaches the maximum value 75 35 g m3 on august 31 the best irrigation time for h m and l scenarios during august is august 2 august 2 and august 11 days respectively figs 11 12 it can be seen that the lai almost cannot be influenced by these three droughts scenarios because of the small difference between the value of lai at h scenario and that at l scenario the tb at h and m scenarios are 5 83 and 3 19 higher than that at l scenario the final yield at h and m scenarios is 5 34 and 2 48 higher than that at l scenario respectively ⑤ droughts occurring in july and august irrigation time has greater influence on the aet of maize in july than in june fig 13 that can decrease aet by 16 54 17 58 in june and 6 47 7 44 in august and the aet decreases continuously with the delay of irrigation time reaching the peak value at 129 78 mm when maize is irrigated on july 2 and august 1 fig 13 b shows that the irrigation time in august has more influence on maize yield than in july when drought is occurring in july and august the tb and yield can be improved by 12 49 and 8 73 when maize is irrigated at the beginning of august compared with being irrigated at the late of august in july the tb and yield of maize can reach two peaks on july 1 and july 22 23 but fluctuate within a range of less than 3 and 2 respectively the wue has large fluctuation with several peaks with the largest value at 20 39 g m3 on july 31 and august 31 and the minimum value at 18 47 g m3 july 9 and august 1 it is worth mentioning that the delay of irrigation time in july and august is not conducive to the increase of crop yield carrying out irrigation in the first half of august can keep crop yield at a high level while irrigating in the second half of august will lead to the aggravate of maize yield reduction rate after the optimization of water allocation scheme although the optimal irrigation amount is all the maximum available water the optimal irrigation time is different among three drought scenarios that is july 2 and august 11 at h scenario and july 22 and august 1 at m and l scenarios figs 14 15 owing to the late growth stage the lai of maize during this period is less affected by droughts and very little difference in lai can be observed among these three scenarios the tb at h and m scenarios is 16 30 and 8 33 higher than that at l scenario respectively and the maize yield at h and m scenarios is 17 78 and 8 79 higher than that of l scenario respectively 5 discussion 1 the effects of different irrigation time in this study it is assumed that the groundwater is not extracted the groundwater table continuously declines with groundwater evaporation during drought period however in actual situation it is quite possible that the groundwater may be extracted when droughts threaten the crops growth which will lead to the larger decline of groundwater table and may destroy the local ecological environment although sufficient irrigation is key to guarantee crop production the water use efficiency should be considered when combating droughts this study has demonstrated the necessity of optimizing irrigation time the drought condition in june is selected to show the comparison among three drought scenarios at different irrigation time in the following fig 16 the total biomass accumulated during this period not only fluctuates largely with irrigation time but also differs among three scenarios when irrigation is conducted in the early to mid june the gap among these three scenarios is around 0 52 0 71 t hm2 while the difference is narrowed when maize is irrigated in the mid to late june it indicates that irrigation time and irrigation amount are both factors influencing crops biomass accumulation only considering one of them is still possible to cause water waste the different trend of total biomass and actual evapotranspiration in fig 4 and fig 6 indicates that the total biomass accumulated during one period is not always increased with the increase of actual evapotranspiration for example the total biomass in fig 6 increases firstly and then decreases which may be because that irrigating early may increase the water loss in the early period and may lead to the water deficit of maize in the later period however irrigating too late may fail to satisfy the water need of crops which may also lead to the low total biomass therefore modifying the irrigation time can help to improve water use efficiency although the available water is at the same level the optimized irrigation time in this study is obtained based on two objectives set in section 3 5 the corresponding soil water content at optimized irrigation time is not the value at withering point but the value higher than soil wilting moisture content 2 optimal irrigation scheme the optimal irrigation scheme in this study covers optimal irrigation time and irrigation amount during different drought periods as for optimal irrigation time the key problem is which time can help to achieve maximum yield or water use efficiency crops growth period is the process of constant irrigation and soil water consumption when soil water content is lower than the threshold that will restrict crop growth the actual evapotranspiration will be lower than the maximum evapotranspiration and the accumulated biomass will be lower than the maximum biomass that can be accumulated in this period therefore the problems affecting biomass accumulation are how long the crop is under water stress and how much does water stress affect biomass to some extent the optimal irrigation scheme is to find the minimum product of water deficit duration and biomass reduction in addition salt stress is another factor that affects crop growth due to soil salinization in this area salt accumulation in shallow soil does not only raise the withering point but also aggravates water stress to crops in this case salt stress increases the complexity of exploring optimal irrigation scheme the optimal scheme becomes to seek the minimum product of environment stress and stress degrees which is also the reason why accumulated biomass will sharply decline if maize is irrigated in the later drought period fig 4 fig 6 fig 8 fig 10 when environment stress is increased to a certain degree the actual water consumption may be approach to 0 if the crop is not irrigated at this time the crop may be near death due to severe drought with accumulated biomass close to zero 3 irrigation guidance under drought conditions the obtained results can be analyzed combining with the growth stage to explain its validity table 1 in early researches heading stage and filling stage of maize have higher water sensitivity indexes than other growth stages and seedling stage has the least water sensitivity index in this study the irrigation amount in may in seedling stage is lower than the maximum available water and has a potential to save water the optimal irrigation time in july in a few jointing stage and most heading stage and august in filling stage are all at the beginning of month these consistent results demonstrate that to some extent water sensitivity index can also be used to guide irrigation when droughts occur the crops may be suggested to be irrigated early at those stages with high water sensitivity index under drought conditions the optimization model considers the water use efficiency and the total biomass accumulated during drought period it provides a new perspective for optimizing irrigation amount and irrigation time of crops when droughts happening in the early and middle growth period during this period the maize has not been matured and it is difficult to estimate the future final production yield since there may be many other uncertain factors influencing the later crop growth other growth indices which can reflect crops growth status such as lai and total biomass have to be considered as guidance for early irrigation introducing the crop growth module of epic model into optimization is also for this purpose because crop models can simulate crop growth process the established model in this paper is also useful in the case of unknown future water diversion because optimization module can ensure the total biomass maintain a high level at the end of drought period which is more likely to be much good for crop growth in the next growth period 4 salt stress and no salt stress this study set five soil salt content levels to reveal the impacts of salt stress on water use efficiency and biomass accumulated during drought conditions fig 17 the biomass accumulated under different soil salt contents all shows increasing first and declining trends when biomass reaches to peak values lower initial soil salt content can lead to higher biomass and high initial soil salt content may make the peak slightly earlier however if irrigation is conducted early higher initial soil salt content increases biomass accumulation this is because more water is absorbed from soil when initial soil salt content is relatively low crop is not under salt stress but mainly affected by water stress in the later growth stage the water use efficiency wue is the ratio of yield accumulated to the actual evapotranspiration fig 17 shows that the wue is increased with soil salt content increasing because the actual water consumption is decreased with the increase of initial soil salt content additionally early irrigation widens the difference of wue with the maximum difference at 28 59 2 79 g m3 when initial soil salt content is 2 ds m and 3 59 g m3 when initial soil salt content is 5 ds m the difference of wue is small when initial soil salt content is 1 and 2 ds m 5 limitation however this study also has some limitations for example this study only considers the drought happening in may june july august and july august respectively the maize before droughts is irrigated the middle irrigation level the obtained optimized results can provide the reference value in set scenarios although the established integrated model can also be used to simulate and optimize other given scenarios additionally this study only considers the certain case and does not concern the uncertain factors that may exist in agricultural system such as meteorological condition water diversion and other uncontrollable factors these uncertain factors may make decision makers change their analytical patterns and have to adjust their decision making scheme to defeat against the drought 6 conclusion in order to obtain the optimal irrigation time and optimal irrigation amount of crops under different drought scenarios in shallow groundwater area an integrated model combining epic crop growth module soil water and salt balance model and multi objectives 0 1 programming was established in this study the established model has the following advantages 1 integrating crops growth model into optimization model provides an idea for addressing optimizing irrigation water and time in early and middle growth periods because crop growth module can simulate crops growth such as potential biomass and leaf area index 2 the multiple objectives set in this model maximizing the total biomass of crops and the water use efficiency wue can effectively guarantee the normal crop growth and avoid the water waste 3 the soil water and salt movement model fully reflect the actual situation in jiefangzha irrigation area and also provide a reference for the optimal water allocation model in areas with shallow groundwater table and high soil salt content 4 the application of 0 1 programming provides decision makers with the choice of setting irrigation times under drought conditions this study optimizes the irrigation amount and irrigation time of maize during drought periods by the day soil salinization can aggravate the water stress to crops the obtained results indicate the significant difference of biomass and water use efficiency when irrigating at different time during drought conditions water sensitivity can be used to roughly guide the irrigation strategies that irrigation should be conducted as early as possible during water sensitive period so as to guarantee the high biomass and water use efficiency the detailed consideration of the model established in this study provides a reference for optimizing crop water allocation in arid and semi arid regions under drought conditions maize is the crop studied as an example in this paper the established model is also applicable for other crops and can also be used to optimize the water allocation among multiple crops author statement xiaoxing zhang conceptualization data collection and analysis formal analysis writing original draft ping guo

should be conducted as early as possible during water sensitive periods so as to guarantee the high crop biomass and water use efficiency the integrated model established in this study provides a reference approach for optimizing irrigation time and irrigation amount based on dynamic changes the established model and obtained results in this study seek to potentially provide effective strategies combating agricultural droughts graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords maize optimal irrigation time optimal irrigation amount shallow groundwater soil water and salt movement 1 introduction drought is one of the main factors negatively affecting crop growth zhou et al 2020 with global warming extreme drought events are frequent in recent years such as the millennium drought in australia the 2011 droughts in texas mexico and east africa and the us summer droughts in 2012 and 2016 which greatly affected crops growth and may threaten national food security lewis et al 2011 schubert et al 2014 williams et al 2015 otkin et al 2018 liu et al 2020 ahmed 2020 how to optimally allocate water resources under drought conditions may be a challenge for managers especially in shallow groundwater area where shallow groundwater table and high soil salt content increase complexities to the system xu et al 2012 ren et al 2017 reca et al 2018 the optimization during the whole crop growth stage based on growth process has been conducted in many researches using water crop water production functions zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 and crop simulation models such as aquacrop and epic model xue et al 2017 bai and gao 2021 linker 2021 roy et al 2019 jalil et al 2020 lopez et al 2017 song and jin 2020 the incorporation of simulation model and optimization model provides an effective way to obtain the optimal irrigation scheme and can offer feasible plans for managers mandal et al 2020 however most researches focused on the whole growth period with known water availability mandal et al 2020 guo et al 2021 garcía vila and fereres 2012 liao et al 2020 laurence et al 2018 it is a problem deserving studying that how to optimally allocate availability in the early or middle growth stage with unknown future water availability with the randomness of droughts how to optimally allocate the available water at present as is well known that when the crop is not mature that is before the yield is formed the growth indicators of the crop such as leaf area index and accumulated biomass can reflect the growth status of the crop du 2020 conducting irrigation at different irrigation time will lead to different growth status of crops for example irrigation in the late drought period is not beneficial to crop recovery after the drought kourgialas et al 2019 tang et al 2018 thus it is of certain research value to optimize irrigation time and amount of crops for maximizing water use efficiency when drought occurs in the middle growth period with better crop growth indicators as the objective shallow groundwater area is featured with relatively shallow groundwater table and high soil salt content where shallow groundwater table will result in the frequent water exchange between soil and groundwater and soil salinization will also greatly affect the crop growth xu et al 2010 xu et al 2012 ren et al 2017 ramos et al 2017 nevertheless there are limited researches revealing the optimal irrigation scheme using process based models in shallow groundwater area additionally for arid and semiarid area improving water use efficiency also should be considered as well as crop growth status so as to save water resource zhao et al 2020 and optimization with multi objectives will give consideration to water resource sustainability on the basis of ensuring food security in order to solve the above problems the comprehensive model integrating the optimization model and simulation models covering crop growth module and soil and groundwater water salt balance model is proposed in this study to obtain the optimal irrigation scheme under drought conditions that happens in the early middle and late crop growth stage irrigation amount and irrigation time are both optimized with multi objectives 0 1 programming to maximizing water use efficiency and total biomass accumulated during the drought period the crop growth indicators such as water use efficiency leaf area index biomass and yield at different irrigation time are examined to explore the potential irrigation strategies in doing this this study seeks to provide an effective and practical approach for managers to optimally allocate limited available water under drought conditions to improve water use efficiency and guarantee food security 2 study system 2 1 study area jiefangzha irrigation area jia is the second largest irrigation area in hetao irrigation district fig 1 it belongs to arid and semi arid area with the average annual rainfall of 140 mm and evaporation of about 2000 mm the annual average temperature is about 7 c the irrigated area and cultivated area in jia is 142 10 ha and 122 00 ha respectively which is mainly planted maize wheat and sunflower the growth of these crops mainly depends on water diversion from yellow river among of them maize has the largest planting area and occupies roughly 30 of total irrigation water due to long term irrigation and poor drainage condition jia has relatively shallow groundwater depth fluctuating between 1 5 and 3 0 m the evaporation of groundwater provides about 20 30 water for crops growth however salt is carried with evaporation into the soil which leads high soil salt content in jia and the intense surface evaporation intensifies the salinization of crop root layer soil therefore shallow groundwater table and high salt content in soil are two specific features of jia which need to be considered in optimizing irrigation schedules in this study monthly average water diversion in jia is set as 100 scenario low drought scenario the 70 of 100 scenario is approximately equal to the minimum monthly water diversion of jia in recent years therefore the 70 of 100 scenario is set as the severe drought scenario another scenario is the 85 of 100 scenario which is considered as the middle drought scenario as fig 2 except for drought period the irrigation scenario in other months are set as 85 scenario because the actual situation of crops in this area may be under middle drought condition in most cases maize is taken as the research crop whose growth stage is as table 1 shown the context in 2011 the year with minimum annual rainfall in recent 20 years is taken as growing environment of maize 2 2 data collection the water diversion data used in this study was collected from local yearbooks and local water resources gazette meteorological data was acquired from the local meteorological station and downloaded from the website of china meteorological data service center the related parameters in crop growth model and water salt movement model are collected from previous researches gao 2017 xue et al 2017 xue et al 2018 yue 2004 the lingo 14 programming software was used to run the established integrated model 3 model development 3 1 study framework in order to optimize the crop growth process in jia the crop growth module in epic model is chosen to simulate the crop growth process and the soil water and salt balance model is used to calculate the exchange capacity of water and salt between soil and groundwater because the combination of crop growth module in epic model and soil water salt balance model has been demonstrated to have relatively high simulation accuracy of maize process in jia chen et al 2020 gao et al 2018 gao 2017 xu et al 2012 additionally this study considers the total biomass accumulated and water use efficiency during drought period and multi objectives programming is needed to balance these two objectives under drought conditions mahmood and mohammad 2020 in this study the multi objectives 0 1 programming is utilized to obtain the optimized irrigation time and irrigation amount of maize under two maximized objectives there are three premises and assumptions before model calculation 1 maize is irrigated only once in may june july and august respectively 2 the infiltration of irrigation water can be completed within one day 3 if soil moisture content is greater than the field water capacity the surplus water will seep down to the groundwater finally the simulation optimization framework is established as fig 3 shown 3 2 epic model growth module the epic model has been demonstrated to be adequately accurate to simulate the crops growth biomass and yield le et al 2018 the epic crop growth module is used to simulate the crops growth under different drought conditions and the related equations are programmed into the integrated model the epic model growth module williams et al 1989 mainly includes phenological development potential biomass leaf area index plant height and root growth the related parameters in the growth module of epic model are equal to the values in the research of gao 2017 as shown in table 2 who conducted the maize field experiments in jia and calibrated the parameters of epic model 1 phenological development 1 hu t t mx t t mn t 2 t b 2 hui t t 1 t hu t phu where hu t represents

shown in table 3 3 5 optimization model in order to guarantee the high total biomass and water use efficiency of crops under drought conditions two objective functions are set as 1 maximize the total

objectives are addressed by weighting method the weights of objectives can be obtained by ahp method zhang et al 2019 finally two objective functions can be converted into one objective function as

function 1 and objective function 2 respectively the obtained ω 1 and ω 2 are respectively taken as 0 75 and 0 25 it indicates that ensuring total biomass has higher weight than maximizing water use efficiency under drought conditions the constraints of the developed optimization model include soil moisture constraints water availability constraints and 0 1 variables constraints soil moisture constraints 37 θ wpsalt θ t θ fc 38 θ wpsalt θ fc water availability constraints 39 t 1 t q t q sup where q sup is the amount of available water during the drought period mm it is assumed that maize

is taken as an example to analyze the impacts of irrigation time on actual evapotranspiration aet water use efficiency wue and the total biomass tb of maize accumulated during the drought period as shown in figs 4 6 8 10 13 ① droughts occurring in may as droughts occurring in may the tb and wue increase slowly first and then decrease rapidly with irrigation time fig 4 the big reduction in tb and wue in the late may may be because the delay of irrigation time aggravates the water deficit to maize the severe water deficit caused by long term non irrigation results in the large decline of crop tb and wue if irrigation is carried out between may 8 and may 26 the tb of maize accumulated in may will achieve an above average value and reaches the maximum at 8 10 10 4 t hm2 on may 22 together the wue will be higher than the average value if irrigation is carried out between may 11 and may 27 and reaches a peak at 7 54 10 4 g m3 on may 23 due to relatively small value of tb and wue even little fluctuations in these two indicators will cause a large change range whose differences between maximum and minimum values are smaller than aet though the similar changing trend between the aet tb and wue can be observed the aet reaches the maximum at 119 04 mm on may 8 with the optimal irrigation scheme optimal irrigation time and irrigation amount fig 5 irrigation water is respectively saved by 21 39 9 54 and 0 at h m and l scenarios and no significant differences of lai and tb among different scenarios indicate the possibility of adopting water saving strategies during this period ② droughts occurring in june in june the aet of maize decreases steadily with irrigation time and the maximum value is 103 75 mm on june 2 fig 6 the tb and wue of maize achieve maximum values on june 17 and june 19 at 4 83 t hm2 and 5 22 g m3 respectively if the maize is irrigated between june 9 and 23 its tb will maintain an above average value while the wue can achieve the above average value when irrigation is conducted between june 12 and 25 after optimization the optimal irrigation time at h m and l scenario is all june 17 and the optimal irrigation water is the maximum available water as shown in fig 7 table 4 during this period in june main growth period of maize different drought scenarios cause significant difference in lai and tb the lai is improved by 11 16 h and 6 18 m than l scenario and the tb is increased by 26 97 h and 14 33 m respectively than l scenario these large changes of lai and tb indicate the importance of full irrigation in this period ③ droughts occurring in july the aet and tb of maize both decrease with irrigation time fig 8 while the wue shows an increasing trend with irrigation time with the maximum value of 26 94 g m3 on july 31 and maximum value of 19 23 g m3 on july 2 additionally the tb of maize is higher than the average level of 15 29 t hm2 if the maize is irrigated before july 18 the smaller decreased proportion of tb than aet can be observed because of the relatively high background values the high decrease in aet and relatively low decline of tb lead to an increasing trend of wue after the balance of improving tb and wue it is obtained that the best irrigation time under three scenarios is all july 2 as fig 9 shown the irrigation water can barely influence the lai that at h scenario is only 0 06 higher than l scenario as the lai has almost reached to the maximum value before drought occurs by contrast the decrease of irrigation water can significantly decrease the tb that at h and m scenario is significantly 12 96 and 6 63 higher than that at l scenario ④ droughts occurring in august early irrigation time may be an effective strategy in maintaining high tb as the aet tb and yield of maize all decrease with irrigation time fig 10 the maximum of these indicators are all reached on august 2 at 48 79 mm 25 51 t hm2 and 9 24 t hm2 respectively the wue of maize shows an increasing trend and reaches the maximum value 75 35 g m3 on august 31 the best irrigation time for h m and l scenarios during august is august 2 august 2 and august 11 days respectively figs 11 12 it can be seen that the lai almost cannot be influenced by these three droughts scenarios because of the small difference between the value of lai at h scenario and that at l scenario the tb at h and m scenarios are 5 83 and 3 19 higher than that at l scenario the final yield at h and m scenarios is 5 34 and 2 48 higher than that at l scenario respectively ⑤ droughts occurring in july and august irrigation time has greater influence on the aet of maize in july than in june fig 13 that can decrease aet by 16 54 17 58 in june and 6 47 7 44 in august and the aet decreases continuously with the delay of irrigation time reaching the peak value at 129 78 mm when maize is irrigated on july 2 and august 1 fig 13 b shows that the irrigation time in august has more influence on maize yield than in july when drought is occurring in july and august the tb and yield can be improved by 12 49 and 8 73 when maize is irrigated at the beginning of august compared with being irrigated at the late of august in july the tb and yield of maize can reach two peaks on july 1 and july 22 23 but fluctuate within a range of less than 3 and 2 respectively the wue has large fluctuation with several peaks with the largest value at 20 39 g m3 on july 31 and august 31 and the minimum value at 18 47 g m3 july 9 and august 1 it is worth mentioning that the delay of irrigation time in july and august is not conducive to the increase of crop yield carrying out irrigation in the first half of august can keep crop yield at a high level while irrigating in the second half of august will lead to the aggravate of maize yield reduction rate after the optimization of water allocation scheme although the optimal irrigation amount is all the maximum available water the optimal irrigation time is different among three drought scenarios that is july 2 and august 11 at h scenario and july 22 and august 1 at m and l scenarios figs 14 15 owing to the late growth stage the lai of maize during this period is less affected by droughts and very little difference in lai can be observed among these three scenarios the tb at h and m scenarios is 16 30 and 8 33 higher than that at l scenario respectively and the maize yield at h and m scenarios is 17 78 and 8 79 higher than that of l scenario respectively 5 discussion 1 the effects of different irrigation time in this study it is assumed that the groundwater is not extracted the groundwater table continuously declines with groundwater evaporation during drought period however in actual situation it is quite possible that the groundwater may be extracted when droughts threaten the crops growth which will lead to the larger decline of groundwater table and may destroy the local ecological environment although sufficient irrigation is key to guarantee crop production the water use efficiency should be considered when combating droughts this study has demonstrated the necessity of optimizing irrigation time the drought condition in june is selected to show the comparison among three drought scenarios at different irrigation time in the following fig 16 the total biomass accumulated during this period not only fluctuates largely with irrigation time but also differs among three scenarios when irrigation is conducted in the early to mid june the gap among these three scenarios is around 0 52 0 71 t hm2 while the difference is narrowed when maize is irrigated in the mid to late june it indicates that irrigation time and irrigation amount are both factors influencing crops biomass accumulation only considering one of them is still possible to cause water waste the different trend of total biomass and actual evapotranspiration in fig 4 and fig 6 indicates that the total biomass accumulated during one period is not always increased with the increase of actual evapotranspiration for example the total biomass in fig 6 increases firstly and then decreases which may be because that irrigating early may increase the water loss in the early period and may lead to the water deficit of maize in the later period however irrigating too late may fail to satisfy the water need of crops which may also lead to the low total biomass therefore modifying the irrigation time can help to improve water use efficiency although the available water is at the same level the optimized irrigation time in this study is obtained based on two objectives set in section 3 5 the corresponding soil water content at optimized irrigation time is not the value at withering point but the value higher than soil wilting moisture content 2 optimal irrigation scheme the optimal irrigation scheme in this study covers optimal irrigation time and irrigation amount during different drought periods as for optimal irrigation time the key problem is which time can help to achieve maximum yield or water use efficiency crops growth period is the process of constant irrigation and soil water consumption when soil water content is lower than the threshold that will restrict crop growth the actual evapotranspiration will be lower than the maximum evapotranspiration and the accumulated biomass will be lower than the maximum biomass that can be accumulated in this period therefore the problems affecting biomass accumulation are how long the crop is under water stress and how much does water stress affect biomass to some extent the optimal irrigation scheme is to find the minimum product of water deficit duration and biomass reduction in addition salt stress is another factor that affects crop growth due to soil salinization in this area salt accumulation in shallow soil does not only raise the withering point but also aggravates water stress to crops in this case salt stress increases the complexity of exploring optimal irrigation scheme the optimal scheme becomes to seek the minimum product of environment stress and stress degrees which is also the reason why accumulated biomass will sharply decline if maize is irrigated in the later drought period fig 4 fig 6 fig 8 fig 10 when environment stress is increased to a certain degree the actual water consumption may be approach to 0 if the crop is not irrigated at this time the crop may be near death due to severe drought with accumulated biomass close to zero 3 irrigation guidance under drought conditions the obtained results can be analyzed combining with the growth stage to explain its validity table 1 in early researches heading stage and filling stage of maize have higher water sensitivity indexes than other growth stages and seedling stage has the least water sensitivity index in this study the irrigation amount in may in seedling stage is lower than the maximum available water and has a potential to save water the optimal irrigation time in july in a few jointing stage and most heading stage and august in filling stage are all at the beginning of month these consistent results demonstrate that to some extent water sensitivity index can also be used to guide irrigation when droughts occur the crops may be suggested to be irrigated early at those stages with high water sensitivity index under drought conditions the optimization model considers the water use efficiency and the total biomass accumulated during drought period it provides a new perspective for optimizing irrigation amount and irrigation time of crops when droughts happening in the early and middle growth period during this period the maize has not been matured and it is difficult to estimate the future final production yield since there may be many other uncertain factors influencing the later crop growth other growth indices which can reflect crops growth status such as lai and total biomass have to be considered as guidance for early irrigation introducing the crop growth module of epic model into optimization is also for this purpose because crop models can simulate crop growth process the established model in this paper is also useful in the case of unknown future water diversion because optimization module can ensure the total biomass maintain a high level at the end of drought period which is more likely to be much good for crop growth in the next growth period 4 salt stress and no salt stress this study set five soil salt content levels to reveal the impacts of salt stress on water use efficiency and biomass accumulated during drought conditions fig 17 the biomass accumulated under different soil salt contents all shows increasing first and declining trends when biomass reaches to peak values lower initial soil salt content can lead to higher biomass and high initial soil salt content may make the peak slightly earlier however if irrigation is conducted early higher initial soil salt content increases biomass accumulation this is because more water is absorbed from soil when initial soil salt content is relatively low crop is not under salt stress but mainly affected by water stress in the later growth stage the water use efficiency wue is the ratio of yield accumulated to the actual evapotranspiration fig 17 shows that the wue is increased with soil salt content increasing because the actual water consumption is decreased with the increase of initial soil salt content additionally early irrigation widens the difference of wue with the maximum difference at 28 59 2 79 g m3 when initial soil salt content is 2 ds m and 3 59 g m3 when initial soil salt content is 5 ds m the difference of wue is small when initial soil salt content is 1 and 2 ds m 5 limitation however this study also has some limitations for example this study only considers the drought happening in may june july august and july august respectively the maize before droughts is irrigated the middle irrigation level the obtained optimized results can provide the reference value in set scenarios although the established integrated model can also be used to simulate and optimize other given scenarios additionally this study only considers the certain case and does not concern the uncertain factors that may exist in agricultural system such as meteorological condition water diversion and other uncontrollable factors these uncertain factors may make decision makers change their analytical patterns and have to adjust their decision making scheme to defeat against the drought 6 conclusion in order to obtain the optimal irrigation time and optimal irrigation amount of crops under different drought scenarios in shallow groundwater area an integrated model combining epic crop growth module soil water and salt balance model and multi objectives 0 1 programming was established in this study the established model has the following advantages 1 integrating crops growth model into optimization model provides an idea for addressing optimizing irrigation water and time in early and middle growth periods because crop growth module can simulate crops growth such as potential biomass and leaf area index 2 the multiple objectives set in this model maximizing the total biomass of crops and the water use efficiency wue can effectively guarantee the normal crop growth and avoid the water waste 3 the soil water and salt movement model fully reflect the actual situation in jiefangzha irrigation area and also provide a reference for the optimal water allocation model in areas with shallow groundwater table and high soil salt content 4 the application of 0 1 programming provides decision makers with the choice of setting irrigation times under drought conditions this study optimizes the irrigation amount and irrigation time of maize during drought periods by the day soil salinization can aggravate the water stress to crops the obtained results indicate the significant difference of biomass and water use efficiency when irrigating at different time during drought conditions water sensitivity can be used to roughly guide the irrigation strategies that irrigation should be conducted as early as possible during water sensitive period so as to guarantee the high biomass and water use efficiency the detailed consideration of the model established in this study provides a reference for optimizing crop water allocation in arid and semi arid regions under drought conditions maize is the crop studied as an example in this paper the established model is also applicable for other crops and can also be used to optimize the water allocation among multiple crops author statement xiaoxing zhang conceptualization data collection and analysis formal analysis writing original draft ping guo

outputs revealed that sn 56 5 and af 29 5 were the primary contributor to riverine no3 pollution followed by nf 7 1 ms 3 6 and ap 3 4 sources moreover an uncertainty index ui 90 of the isotope mixing showed that sn 0 73 and af 0 67 had the highest values followed by nf 0 22 m s 0 22 and ap 0 10 chemical fertilizer and sn collectively contributed 50 of nitrate during the two sampling campaigns these results indicated that reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizers and rational irrigation are the keys to alleviate of no3 pollution the study is helpful in understanding the source and transformation of riverine no3 and effectively reducing no3 pollution in karst agricultural rivers or watersheds keywords nitrate isotope nitrate source identification simmr model uncertainty analysis karst watershed yufu river 1 introduction nitrate no3 in the karst water environment impacted by intensive agricultureare highly vulnerable to pollution because of heavy fertilizer application and irrational irrigation practices which is one of the most common environmental issue in karstic regions ford and williams 2007 perrin et al 2008 yue et al 2018 yang et al 2020 elevated nitrate levels in the contaminated waters may induce deterioration of water quality resulting in acidification and eutrophication of water and threaten drinking water safety camargo and alonso 2006 górski et al 2019 excessive nitrate concentrations in drinking water may increase the risk of some diseases such as methemoglobinemia in infants diabetes and stomach cancer xu et al 2016 ji et al 2017 li et al 2017 furthermore due to the heterogeneity and high permeability of karst conduits and fissures the migration mechanism of nitrate from different sources in surface water and groundwater systems is extremely complex and its pollution prevention and control becomes a prominent problem in karstic regions ford and williams 2007 yue et al 2018 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 thus understanding the sources and transformations of nitrate in the karst environment is crucially important for alleviating nitrogen pollution reducing nutrient loss and protecting water quality the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 are commonly used to distinguish potential sources of nitrate nestler et al 2011 since different sources of nitrate exhibit different isotope signatures in the water environment nestler et al 2011 the typical δ15n of nitrate derives from atmospheric precipitation nitrate fertilizer ammonium fertilizer soil nitrogen and manure sewage at 5 15 5 5 10 5 2 8 and 8 25 respectively mayer et al 2002 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 jin et al 2015 kohl et al 1971 first used δ15n to reveal that nitrate in surface water mainly derived from chemical fertilizers however certain nitrate sources cannot be distinguished by δ15n alone because the distribution ranges from different sources may overlap or isotope fractionations caused by biogeochemical processes may alter the initial isotopic signatures xue et al 2009 kendall et al 2007 these sources may be identified when δ18o of nitrate is incorporated amberger and schmidt 1987 the δ18ono3 of precipitation is influenced by complex atmospheric processes and varies widely from 25 to 75 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 the δ18ono3 in nitrate fertilizer ranges from 17 to 25 amberger and schmidt 1987 the δ18ono3 values from nitrification of ammonium fertilizer soil nitrogen and manure sewage generally are within 5 to 15 which is significantly lower than the δ18ono3 from atmospheric precipitation and nitrate fertilizer kendall and mcdonnell 1998 mayer et al 2001 xue et al 2009 therefore the δ18ono3 isotopes combined with δ15nno3 can be used to further distinguish different nitrate sources and are widely used in nitrate source identification of surface water zhang et al 2018a hu et al 2019a li et al 2019a jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b fadhullah et al 2020 the isotope mixing models for the quantitative assessment of nitrate sources mainly include the mass equilibrium mixing model and the siar mixsiar and simmr models quantitative assessment of nitrate sources by using the mass equilibrium mixing model has great limitations because it does not consider isotope fractionation during biogeochemical processes and identifies no more than three sources xue et al 2012 subsequently parnell et al 2010 and stock et al 2018 developed stable isotope mixing models such as siar simmr and mixsiar based on a bayesian framework for the above problems these models overcome the limitations of the mass equilibrium mixing model and are widely used in surface water ecosystems xue et al 2012 yue et al 2015 li et al 2019a hu et al 2019b ogrinc et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a ren et al 2021 nevertheless these models can potentially count uncertain sources that introduce uncertainties into the proportional contribution of no3 sources jin et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b the karst waters have been an important water source for industry agriculture and domestic water in north china due to the diversity of recharge sources and the openness of karst water system groundwater and surface water in kart areas are closely interactive each other gao et al 2020 cao et al 2021 this makes water in karst areas more vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination than those in non karst areas yue et al 2018 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020d ren et al 2021 with the intensification of agriculture and the continuous expansion of industry and urbanization in northern china the discharge of industrial agricultural and domestic pollutants has been increasing leading to the serious deterioration of surface water quality in karst areas in northern china yuan 1994 in addition the superposition of human activities and climate change further aggravates the severity of karst water pollution in north china gao et al 2020 meanwhile most of karst in north china are developed in semi arid areas where water resources are scarce which makes the problem of pollution induced water shortage more prominent at present the research on identifying the source and behavior of nitrate in karst areas is more focused on karst areas in south china yue et al 2015 li and ji 2016 yue et al 2018 jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c cao et al 2021 however the source identification of nitrate in typical karst basins in north china has not been reported the yufu river yfr watershed is a representative agricultural karst area in north china in recent years its prevalence on karst groundwater and surface water quality impairment with the rapid development of intensive agriculture and urbanization in jinan city furthermore the watershed is not only an important recharge water source of jinan karst spring groups but also a national key protection of drinking water source and the main production and living water source in jinan city therefore to better protect and scientifically manage karst water resources it is necessary to adopt dual isotope approach and bayesian isotope mixing model to quantitatively identify no3 n pollution sources in the watershed the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the temporal and spatial variations of nitrogen species in different streams and evaluate their pollution level 2 identify no3 n sources and transformations by utilizing a combination of hydrochemistry and multi isotope δ2hh2o δ18oh2o δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 and land use information and 3 quantify the contributions of no3 n sources by using the simmr model and to propose management measures to reduce nitrogen pollution the results provide important implications for nitrogen pollution control water quality protection and sustainable utilization of karst water resources in karst agricultural rivers with multiple pollution sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yufu river watershed 36 20 n 36 40 n 116 45 e 117 15 e is located in southern jinan city shandong province north china fig 1 the watershed is mainly composed of a main stream and three tributaries the main river is the yufu river yfr the tributaries are the jinxiu river jxr and jinyang river jyr in the upper reaches and the erxian river exr in the middle reaches the sources of the jxr and jyr originate from the northern slope of tai mountain at 1500 m above mean sea level and the rivers convergently flow into the wohushan reservoir site 16 discharge to the yfr and eventually flow into the yellow river the total length of the yufu river is 95 7 km and its drainage area is 764 2 km2 the watershed is located in the semi humid warm temperate zone and has a typical east asian monsoon climate from 1958 to 2019 the annual mean precipitation and air temperature are 658 8 mm and 14 3 c respectively http data cma cn the minimum mean daily and maximum mean temperatures are 0 4 c in january and 27 5 c in july respectively the seasonal distribution of precipitation is uneven and the precipitation is concentrated from july to september accounting for approximately 75 of the annual precipitation the mean annual evaporation is 1430 mm the mean runoff depth is 141 3 mm and the mean annual runoff is 1 26 108 m3 in 2019 http jnwater jinan gov cn col col27547 index html the soil profile is thinnest and discontinuous in the upstream of the watershed and relatively thick in karst river valley and alluvial and diluvial plain areas which are mostly distributed in the mid lower stream the soil types in the watershed are mainly brown soil and cinnamon soil the dominant land use types of the watershed are forest and shrub 52 7 followed by cultivated land 26 1 and residential land 12 4 the remaining land use types are water bodies 3 6 unused land 1 9 grassland 1 4 transportation land 1 1 and public land 0 8 typical crops in the watershed include winter wheat rice corn beans tubers cotton apple pear melons and vegetables etc the watershed is a typical karst agricultural watershed which is dominated by agriculture and widely distributed arable land according to the field investigation the agricultural fertilizers application in the watershed mainly include ammonium fertilizer e g ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate etc urea nitrogen and phosphorus compound fertilizer controlled release fertilizer and livestock and poultry excrement in karst soils the nh4 in ammonium fertilizer urea and manure are nitrated or nitrate fertilizers are remineralized into nh4 and nitrated to form nitrates that are easier to migrate li et al 2020 nitrate contaminants are carried into rivers through surface runoff generated by precipitation or nitrate in surface runoff or irrigation water is lost into karst aquifers which recharge rivers in the form of base flow at lower terrain resulting in deterioration of river water quality and a threat to drinking water safety due to the steep karst terrain and the relatively developed karst conduits and fissures the nitrate isotope of river water inherited more signatures from non point sources such as nitrifying soil organic nitrogen and ammonium fertilizer therefore agricultural non point source pollution may be an important factor leading to large amounts of nitrogen pollutants in the rivers of the watershed especially near rivers and reservoirs large scale facility agriculture is distributed which mainly grows vegetables and fruits for the consumption of jinan residents meanwhile the study area is also a national key protection area are of drinking water source and the main production and living water source in jinan city from the upstream to downstream of the watershed the main outcropped strata and lithology are taishan group metamorphic rocks cambrian and ordovician carbonate rocks and quaternary unconsolidated sediments rivers in the watershed are mainly recharged by atmospheric precipitation and groundwater discharge the river waters in the upper reaches of the metamorphic rock region is also recharged by bedrock fissure water while in the mid lower reaches of the intermountain valley and piedmont alluvial plain it is mainly recharged by karst groundwater and quaternary pore water in the middle and upper reaches of the watershed the cambrian and ordovician outcrops are large in area and thick and karst groundwater is an important recharge source for surface water in addition most of the surface water in the reach between sites 5 and 6 of yfr is recharged into karst aquifers through the seepage zone and becomes an important recharge water source for the four largest spring groups in jinan xing et al 2018 the thickness of quaternary sediments is about 7 30 m and gradually thickens from the strong seepage zone to the downstream in the yfr 2 2 sampling and pre treatment considering the different types of existing potential sources of pollution land use patterns and watershed characteristics 32 sampling sites in september wet season and december 2019 dry season covering the entire watershed fig 1 were identified and their locations were recorded by a hand held global positioning system the water temperature tw ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were directly measured in situ using a portable multiparameter water quality meter wtw multi 3630 germany which has accuracies of 0 1 c 0 01 ph units 1 μs cm and 0 01 mg l respectively river water samples at 15 cm under the water surface were collected the collected water samples were filtered immediately through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane saved in prewashed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and then stored at 4 c before experimental analysis 2 3 water quality and stable isotope analysis the concentrations of tn no3 n nh4 n and no2 n in river water samples were measured by using the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method uv spectrophotometric method indophenol blue spectrophotometric method and diazo coupled spectrophotometric method respectively yue et al 2014 chloride cl ion concentrations were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 usa with a precision of 5 the δd and δ18o of water samples were measured using high precision laser spectroscopy xiong et al 2021 lgr iwa 45 ep usa at the institute of geological survey china university of geosciences wuhan the international standards are vienna standard mean ocean water v smow for δ18o and δd in water the analytical precisions were 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δd respectively the cadmium cd reduction and azide reduction method was used to analyze δ15nno3 and δ18o no3 of water samples by reducing nitrate to n2o tu et al 2016 sui et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the isotopic signature of the produced n2o was determined using a stable isotopic ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo fisher scientific usa at the third institute of oceanography ministry of natural resources china the measurement results were referenced to international standards atmospheric n2 for δ15n and v smow for δ18o and were calibrated based on international standards usgs32 and usgs34 casciotti et al 2002 yang and toor 2016 the precision for δ15n and δ18o was 0 3 the stable isotope ratios are expressed as δ values and calculated by eq 1 1 δ sample r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the 15n 14n 18o 16o and 2h 1h ratios of the sample and standard respectively 2 4 statistical analysis before comparative analysis of temporal and spatial differences of variables we first analyzed the normality of all variables in different rivers for dry and wet seasons september and december by using shapiro welk test the differences of variables were statistically compared by using a one way anova test p 0 05 if the assumption of normality was rejected the non parametric kruskal wallis test was applied spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze the relationship among hydrochemical parameters and isotope values with a 0 05 significance level chemical components in river water were determined by the kriging interpolation method in arcgis 10 5 the ibm spss version 22 0 originpro2018 and arcgis10 5 were used for statistical analyses and scientific mapping respectively the proportional contribution of different contamination sources to no3 in different seasons was evaluated by applying stable isotope mixing models in r parnell 2013 simmr is an upgraded version of the siar package and contains many of the same features https cran r project org web packages simmr vignettes simmr html compared with siar this new version has a more sophisticated mixing model simpler user interfaces and more advanced drawing functions the contributions of no3 sources to a mixture were quantified using the mcmc model parnell et al 2010 as follows 2 x ij k 1 k p k q jk s jk c jk k 1 k p k q jk ε ij 3 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 4 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 5 ε ij 0 σ j 2 where x ij is the isotope value j of water sample i p k is the contribution of source k q jk is the concentration of isotope j in source k s jk is the source value k of isotope j which has mean μ jk and standard deviation sd ω jk c jk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k which has mean λ jk and sd τ jk 2 and ε ij is the residual error where σ j 2 is the residual variance 2 5 uncertainty index the uncertainty index ui 90 is based on the posterior distribution to characterize the uncertainty strength of nitrate source apportionment ji et al 2017 xu et al 2021 in the process of nitrate pollutant source identification uncertainty is defined as the variation strength of each nitrate source contribution within a given likelihood range to eliminate the effect of extreme values and to describe the degree of uncertainty related to the distribution results ui 90 is calculated by using the difference proportional contribution between the minimum and maximum values of the rapidly increasing segment 90 cumulative probability divided by 90 the calculation formula of ui 90 is as follows 6 ui 90 p max p min 0 9 where p max and p min are the maximum and minimum proportional contributions of different sources in the rapid growth segment of 90 cumulative probability respectively the smaller the value of ui 90 is the more stable the source contribution of nitrate while the larger the value is the stronger the variability of the source contribution 3 results 3 1 field parameters the field parameters of river water in yfr watershed in september and december are summarized in table 1 the ph was 7 64 8 96 mean 8 25 with moderately alkaline conditions in the yfr watershed the dissolved oxygen do concentration ranged from 1 76 to 17 99 mg l in the watershed all of which were higher than 2 mg l except for one sample indicating that the surface river water was generally aerobic the ec values ranged from 297 μs cm upstream to 1195 μs cm downstream showing significant spatial variation p 0 05 furthermore the ec value also showed significant temporal variation p 0 05 with higher mean values in december 767 μs cm than in september 668 μs cm 3 2 the variation of water quality indicators the concentrations of nitrogen species and cl ions in the water samples are shown in table 1 and fig 2s the tn concentrations of surface water samples had a wide range between different watersheds p 0 05 with values ranging from 0 26 to 23 mg l regardless of the wet season or dry season the average tn concentrations in the four watersheds from high to low were the exr 12 83 mg l jxr 9 61 mg l jyr 5 99 mg l and yfr 5 62 mg l in addition among the 64 water samples except for those from two sites sites 1 and 6 in december the tn concentration exceeded the limit of surface water national environmental protection agency of china 2002 1 0 mg l accounting for approximately 96 9 of the total water samples the no3 n concentrations of all samples ranged from 0 1 to 8 15 mg l mean 4 41 mg l presenting a first increasing and then decreasing trend from upstream to downstream in both seasons with a higher value in the tributaries 2 15 6 4 mg l than in the mainstream 0 32 4 91 mg l for different watersheds the no3 n concentrations from high to low were the exr 6 27 mg l jxr 5 41 mg l jyr 4 09 mg l and yfr 2 67 mg l which also showed significant spatial variation p 0 05 moreover no3 n was the main nitrogen form accounting for 68 4 and 47 7 of the tn in the water samples in september and december respectively the no3 n concentrations of all the water samples were below the guideline value of 10 mg l for drinking water national environmental protection agency of china 2002 the mean tn and no3 n concentrations in september 9 56 and 5 78 mg l respectively were significantly higher than those in december 6 56 and 3 04 mg l respectively showing significant seasonal variation p 0 05 this result is not consistent with the results for surface water in other study areas zhang et al 2018a jin et al 2018 li et al 2019b fadhullah et al 2020 the nh4 n concentrations of all samples ranged from 0 01 to 10 47 mg l mean 0 95 mg l most of which were low and accounted for only 11 and 12 of the tn in september and december respectively the mean concentrations of nh4 n in the yfr 1 73 mg l and exr 1 56 mg l were higher than those in the upstream watersheds jyr 0 29 mg l and the jxr 0 16 mg l indicating significant differences in the spatial variation in the watershed p 0 05 although the mean concentration of nh4 n in september 1 12 mg l was higher than that in december 0 78 mg l there was no significant difference in the seasonal variation in nh4 n p 0 05 the concentration of no2 n was extremely low ranging from 0 01 to 0 86 mg l mean 0 1 mg l accounting for approximately 2 of the tn no significant differences in seasonal and spatial variations in no2 n were observed p 0 05 as shown in fig 2s the cl concentration had a significant spatial difference ranging between 10 95 and 131 78 mg l mean 31 34 mg l showing a trend of gradual increase from upstream 18 74 mg l to mid lower stream 48 3 mg l although the concentration of cl in december was higher than that in september there was no significant difference in seasonal variation p 0 05 3 3 isotopic composition of water the δdh2o and δ18oh2o distributions for all sampled water in the yfr watershed are shown in fig 2 the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values ranged from 66 0 to 36 6 mean 56 0 and 9 2 to 4 2 7 7 in the watershed respectively according to the statistical analysis the seasonal variation of δdh2o and δ18oh2o in river water showed no significant difference p 0 05 but the spatial variation of δdh2o and δ18oh2o had significant difference p 0 05 the mean δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of the water samples in the four watersheds were the yfr 6 4 and 48 8 respectively jyr 8 0 and 57 4 exr 8 2 and 57 9 jxr 8 7 and 62 1 the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of river water samples were generally enriched from upstream to mid lower stream and were distributed along the lower part of the lmwl with offset to the right the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of water in september ranged from 6 4 to 45 9 average of 54 5 and 9 2 to 5 9 7 6 respectively the values varied between 64 3 and 36 6 for δdh2o 54 5 and between 8 9 and 4 2 7 6 for δ18oh2o in december there were no statistically significant differences in the seasonal variation in water p 0 05 in addition due to the impact of atmospheric precipitation recharge the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of water samples were significantly positively correlated in september r 0 93 p 0 05 and december r 0 96 p 0 05 and were located near the local meteoric water line lmwl nevertheless due to the evaporation effect of river water the slope of the evaporation line in september slope 5 6 and december slope 5 3 was significantly lower than that of lmwl slope 7 46 3 4 the isotopic composition of nitrate the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values of river water in the yfr watershed are shown in table 1 and fig 4 there was a range of δ15nno3 values from 6 7 to 8 1 mean 2 1 with 76 6 of water samples having δ15nno3 values between 0 and 5 the δ18ono3 values ranged from 11 9 to 22 0 with an average value of 3 9 spatially the mean δ15nno3 values of the water samples in the four watersheds from high to low were the yfr 3 1 jyr 2 2 exr 1 5 and jxr 1 1 however the δ18ono3 values of water samples in the watershed were the yfr 5 9 jxr 4 7 exr 3 5 jxr 1 1 overall the mean values of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 in the mid lower reaches of the watershed were higher than those in the upper reaches but only δ18ono3 has a significant difference p 0 05 the δ15nno3 values ranged from 6 9 to 8 1 mean 2 5 and the δ18ono3 values ranged from 11 9 to 8 6 3 0 in september the δ15nno3 values in december were lower ranging from 3 6 to 5 9 while the δ18ono3 value in december was more enriched than that in september varying in a range of 8 7 to 22 0 in the watershed there was no statistically significant difference in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values between seasons and location p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal variations of nitrate concentrations as shown in table 1 the no3 n concentrations of the middle and upper reaches exr jxr and jyr were significantly higher than those of the lower reaches yfr p 0 05 indicating that they might be different sources of no3 n or have undergone different biogeochemical processes furthermore the no3 n levels in the jxr and jyr showed a gradually increasing trend from upstream to downstream during the sampling campaigns which might be attributed to the different land use because the proportion of forestland in the upstream of the sub basin is relatively high while the proportion of arable land in the downstream increases slightly fig 1 the no3 n concentrations were high in the exr except site 9 in the estuary since agricultural land was dominant however the no3 n concentrations in the yfr gradually attenuated from upstream to the estuary while the cl concentration showed a trend of gradual increase this suggested that nitrate might be influenced by both biogeochemical processes assimilation or denitrification and human activities hu et al 2020 the no3 n concentration in september in the study area was higher than that in december which was contrary to the results in other study areas jin et al 2019 li et al 2019a this might be because the increased precipitation in september causes more agricultural non point source pollutants from steep karst terrains are directly discharged into rivers through increased surface runoff or infiltrate underground aquifers through karst conduits and fissures and then discharged into low altitude surface rivers as base flow yue et al 2018 by comparing the surface water in yfr watershed with other basins in china the mean riverine no3 concentration in yfr watershed is similar to that in the yellow river zhang et al 2018b and dagu river li et al 2019b but it is significantly higher than those in rivers of southern china li et al 2010 jin et al 2019 li et al 2019a jin et al 2020 yi et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 tibetan plateau xia et al 2009 and beijing city li et al 2014 peters et al 2019 in addition the concentration of no3 in the fenhe river of the loess plateau yang et al 2018 is significantly higher than that in the study area therefore geographical location climatic conditions geological background human activities and other factors will result in great differences in nitrate in surface water in different regions chen et al 2020 4 2 identification of the sources of no3 by water chemistry composition the relationship between cl versus no3 cl is commonly used to identify the sources and biogeochemical processes of nitrate in surface rivers liu et al 2006 yue et al 2017 jin et al 2018 in the absence of halite deposits non point sources e g chemical fertilizer and soil nitrogen erosion generally has low cl concentrations and a high no3 cl ratio while sewage or manure may generate high cl and a low no3 cl ratio liu et al 2006 li et al 2016 jiang et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 the ratios of no3 cl in water samples varied greatly from 0 01 to 2 03 indicated that no3 might derive from multiple sources the upstream of the watershed jxr and jyr had lower cl and higher no3 cl ratios which may be attributed to non point source pollution caused by extensive application of agricultural n fertilizer and soil erosion compared with the upstream of the watershed the no3 cl ratios in the midstream and downstream exr and yfr is lower and cl concentration is higher the results showed that nitrate may derived from a mixture of sewage and manure soil nitrogen erosion and agricultural inputs in the midstream and downstream the lower reaches of the watershed are piedmont alluvial plains with extensive arable land and dense population and the contribution of sewage and manure may be increased compared with that of the upper reaches moreover the no3 cl ratios decreased rapidly from upstream to estuary in yfr while cl concentration increased slightly indicating that biological processes may be partially responsible for the reduction of nitrate concentrations such as denitrification or assimilation liu et al 2006 li et al 2016 4 3 identification of nitrate sources by δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 a classic dual isotope bi plot approach δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 was used to qualitatively identify predominant no3 sources in yfr watershed as shown in fig 4 none of the river water nitrate isotopic fingerprints fell into the ap source area indicating that the contribution of ap to river nitrate was limited it is worth noting that only one water sample was within the range of nf although it is affected by high intensity agricultural activities the possible explanation is that the contribution of nitrate fertilizer in karst soil or epikarst zone has been masked by multiple biogeochemical cycles xu et al 2021 most residential areas in the watershed are located around rivers and reservoirs however only one sample in september fell within the overlapping range of sn and m s which may be related to the measures taken by the watershed to limit point source pollution most of the samples fell within the overlapping range of sn and af indicating that nitrate mainly derived from nitrification of sn and af this result is basically consistent with that of hydrochemistry this may be attributed to the steep karst terrain and intensive agricultural activities in the watershed li et al 2020 furthermore the mean δ15nno3 values in december was slightly lower than that in september and was closer to the af range this is because december is the dry season in the watershed and the surface water is basically in the base flow state due to less precipitation which is more laterally recharged by karst groundwater meanwhile the intensive agriculture applied excessive ammonium fertilizer and flood irrigation to achieve higher vegetable and fruit yields these unreasonable practices might result in the nitrification of large amounts of af into nitrates which was then lost to karst aquifers through karst conduits and fissures and recharged the surface water in the form of basal flow in early september although it is in the middle and late period of the wet season due to the high precipitation in august fig 1s more soil organic nitrogen in the epikarst zones was eroded into the surface rivers through the increased surface runoff or directly into karst aquifers through the epikarst zone or karst conduits and fractures and finally discharged into the surface rivers however there may be a certain lag due to the recharge of karst groundwater by precipitation and then drainage to surface rivers by groundwater flow therefore the contribution of soil organic nitrogen was still high despite the low precipitation in september the higher no3 cl and lower δ15nno3 values suggested soil sources e g soil organic nitrogen or chemical fertilizer dominated the no3 in contrast the lower no3 cl and higher δ15nno3 values suggested manure and sewage sources or biological processes e g denitrification and assimilation dominated the no3 jiang et al 2021 in september forest and arable land dominated in exr jxr and jyr most water samples have higher no3 cl ratios and more depleted δ15nno3 fig 4c however the no3 cl ratios of yfr in september gradually decreased from the upstream to the estuary while the δ15nno3 values were gradually increased meanwhile there was a significant negative linear correlation between no3 cl and δ15nno3 slope 1 2 r 0 88 p 0 05 all these confirmed that the nitrate in yfr may be affected either by manure and sewage or biological processes however the nitrate isotope fingerprints of most samples did not fall within sewage and manure source area indicating that nitrate in yfr may derive from the mixture of soil organic nitrogen ammonium fertilizer with more depletion of δ15nno3 in the upstream and sewage discharge along the downstream in december the no3 cl ratios and δ15nno3 values of exr jxr and jyr were similar to those in september which also confirmed that nitrate in the upstream rivers mainly derived from soil organic nitrogen and ammonium fertilizer fig 4d the no3 cl ratios in yfr were lower than that of other rivers but the δ15nno3 values were more depleted however there is no better explanation for this result and further research is still needed 4 4 biogeochemical processes of nitrate the isotope compositions of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 are not only related to their initial sources but also influenced by isotopic fractionation during biogeochemical processes such as nitrification denitrification and assimilation kendall et al 2007 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 yue et al 2017 puig et al 2017 nitrification is the process of ammonia oxidation to nitrate mediated by microorganisms kendall et al 2007 xu et al 2016 the δ18o of nitrate produced by nitrification consists of one oxygen atom from atmospheric o2 and two oxygen atoms from the ambient water δ18ono3 1 3δ18oo2 2 3δ18oh2o andersson and hooper 1983 kendall et al 2007 the δ18oh2o value of river water samples ranged from 9 2 to 4 2 and the δ18oo2 value in the atmosphere is 23 5 amberger and schmidt 1987 the theoretical values of δ18ono3 from nitrification would be 1 7 to 5 0 from calculation fig 5 revealed that most of the water samples in the upstream of the watershed fell within the theoretical nitrification range confirming that nitrification dominates the oxygen isotope composition of nitrate nevertheless the δ18ono3 values of some samples were higher than the upper limit of nitrification 5 0 which might be related to precipitation contribution evaporation and the respiration and denitrification of microorganisms kendall et al 2007 yue et al 2014 due to the low precipitation during the sampling period fig 1s it can be excluded the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of sample sites 1 and 4 7 in september and sites 1 4 8 31 and 32 in september were relatively enriched indicating that they were affected by evaporation fig 2 however the water isotope values of sites 19 22 were more depleted and the partial pressure of co2 10 3 6 10 3 3 in the water at these points were close to that in the atmosphere 10 3 5 indicating that oxygen in nitrate may be exchanged with oxygen in the atmosphere moreover samples 2 3 9 12 15 in september and 2 13 14 and 15 in december had δ18ono3 values below the lower limit 1 7 which might be caused by the exchange of oxygen atoms from nitrite in the epikarst zones with more depleted oxygen atoms in the soil water mayer et al 2001 kool et al 2011 li et al 2019a qin et al 2019 it is noteworthy that these water samples all have higher concentrations of ammonium 0 69 10 47 mg l the results indicated that the transformation process of nitrate in the upper reaches of the watershed was mainly controlled by microbial nitrification while it was dominated by the mixture of multiple no3 sources in the mid lower reaches denitrification is an important microbially facilitated process in anaerobic conditions where no3 is reduced to n2 as the terminal product by microorganisms kendall et al 2007 xu et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 in addition heterotrophic microorganisms preferentially utilize light isotopes and consume nitrates in aquatic ecosystems during denitrification kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 luu et al 2020 when denitrification occurs the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values in the substrate increase with the decrease of the no3 n concentrations and the δ15n δ18o ratio generally ranged from 1 3 1 to 2 1 1 liu et al 2006 yang and toor 2016 li et al 2019a only the exr in september and jyr in september and december had significant positive linear correlation with δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 p 0 05 fig 3s but the slopes were not between 0 5 and 1 the rest showed no significant linear positive correlation p 0 05 the results suggest that denitrification might be minor in the watershed additionally the do values ranged from 1 76 to 17 99 mg l and only one sample was 2 mg l which limits denitrification pastén zapata et al 2014 yang and toor 2016 the relationship between lnno3 n versus δ15nno3 δ18ono3 is commonly used to distinguish mixing and biological n removal processes mariotti et al 1988 weng et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the significant negative linear correlation between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 versus lnno3 n can identify biological no3 removal processes such as denitrification or assimilation kendall et al 2007 jiang et al 2021 as shown in the fig 6 there were significant negative linear correlation between δ15nno3 and lnno3 n in september in the yfr slope 1 4 r 0 76 p 0 05 and δ15nno3 values were enriched from upstream to downstream with the attenuation of no3 n concentrations meanwhile δ15nno3 and 1 no3 n have a positive curved correlation fig 7 indicating that the attenuation of nitrate might be caused by biological no3 removal processes paredes et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 it is difficult to distinguish between assimilation absorption and denitrification using δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 since phytoplankton may preferentially metabolize light isotopes yue et al 2018 however the δ15nno3 and lnno3 n were weakly correlated with δ18ono3 p 0 05 which was inconsistent with the above conclusions thus there is not enough evidence to confirm that denitrification occurs significantly and that the biogeochemical processes of nitrates are conservative in the watershed the no3 n gradually increased from upstream to downstream in the jxr during the two sampling activities while δ15nno3 or δ18ono3 were gradually depleted and showing a linear negative correlation fig 6 meanwhile there were positive linear correlation between 1 no3 n versus δ15nno3 or δ18ono3 fig 7 these results suggested that nitrate may be related to the mixing of soil organic nitrogen from upstream and af application in intensive agriculture along the jxr furthermore the no3 n levels of jyr in december gradually increased from upstream to downstream while the values of δ15nno3 or δ18ono3 increased slightly along the river flow direction there were positive correlation between 1 no3 n versus δ15nno3 r 0 4 p 0 05 or δ18ono3 r 0 75 p 0 05 in jyr in december fig 7 kendall et al 2007 this is the result of erosion of soil organic nitrogen or loss of af in the upstream mixed with small amounts of sewage and manure along the way however for the rest there is no linear negative correlation between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 versus lnno3 n fig 6 meanwhile there was no correlation between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 versus 1 no3 n fig 7 these results further confirm that no3 removal processes and mixing of two sources of nitrate with different concentrations in these rivers may be minor 4 5 source apportionment of nitrate based on the simmr model a bayesian mixing model in simmr was used to quantitatively estimate the proportional contributions of nitrate from five potential sources in the watershed fig 8 the site specific isotope information of the no3 sources was determined from the relevant literature table 1s meanwhile we assumed that the fractionation factor c jk was 0 eq 4 because river water was not conducive to denitrification the output results from the simmr model table 2s and fig 8 shows that the mean contribution proportions of the five potential no3 sources in the watershed could be ranked as follows sn 68 7 af 17 2 nf 7 2 ap 3 6 m s 3 3 in september and sn 44 3 af 41 8 nf 6 9 m s 3 9 ap 3 1 in december the contribution of sn to nitrate was the highest since the watershed is dominated by steep karst terrain and land use is dominated by natural vegetation and farmland furthermore the sn in september was 24 4 higher than that in december which might be attributed to more flushing of nitrogen containing soil organic matter from karst steep slopes e g slope farming to rivers under intense rainfall conditions in the rainy season liu et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the contribution of af to nitrate is second only to that of sn which might be related to the high intensity of agricultural activities in the watershed the contribution of af increased 23 6 in december compared with september this could be attributed to the heavy application of ammonium fertilizer and improper irrigation in december in intensive agricultural areas around rivers or reservoirs although the watershed has a high proportion of agricultural cropland 26 1 and intensive agricultural activities the contribution proportion of nitrate fertilizer was lower in september and december 6 9 and 7 2 respectively a possible explanation is that the contribution of nitrate fertilizers in karst soils or epikarst zones has been masked by multiple biogeochemical cycles xu et al 2021 the manure and sewage contribution ranged between 3 3 in september and 3 9 in december indicating that the contribution of manure and sewage to nitrate was small in the study area this might be related to the strict management measures in the watershed as the yfr watershed is a key protection area for drinking water in jinan city the local government has taken strict administrative measures to protect the water quality therefore the contribution of point source pollution such as domestic sewage and municipal sewage to nitrate was significantly reduced the contribution of atmospheric precipitation to no3 was low in both sampling campaigns in the watershed and similar values have been observed in other study areas xue et al 2012 matiatos 2016 li et al 2019a spatially the contribution proportion of sn in september was the highest 56 61 in the four rivers and increased slightly from the upstream to downstream ammonium fertilizer decreased by 15 from upstream to downstream while the proportions of atmospheric precipitation nitrate fertilizer and manure and sewage increased by approximately 2 1 and 8 respectively this suggested that the decrease of ammonium fertilizer from upstream to downstream may be related to the increase of the remaining four sources in addition the contribution of the four rivers in september showed similar patterns of nitrate sources fig 8a this reflects that increased precipitation during the wet season facilitated the mixing of different sources of river nitrate in contrast fig 8b showed different source apportionment patterns in december the contribution of nitrate sources from upstream rivers jyr and jxr was sn af nf m s ap in december which was consistent with the pattern of nitrate sources in september nevertheless the reason for this pattern was different from that in september this might be attributed to the steep terrain and high natural vegetation cover in the upstream of the watershed in addition slope farming also resulted in erosion of soil organic matter and loss of n fertilizers li et al 2019a however the contribution of sn to nitrate downstream decreased by 32 compared with that upstream in december while the contribution proportions of ap m s nf and af in the downstream increased by 4 5 9 and 22 respectively the results showed that the high intensity agricultural activities in december had a significant impact on the nitrate source in the mid lower reaches 4 6 uncertainty analysis uncertainty determines whether the quantitative identification of no3 pollution sources in waters is reliable and stable shang et al 2020 the ui 90 value for ap was the smallest 0 1 and its source was the most stable fig 9 however the highest ui 90 value of sn 0 73 and af 0 67 indicated that the proportional contribution of these sources exhibited the strongest uncertainty the nf 0 22 and m s 0 22 had moderate uncertainties the uncertainty of nitrate input might be attributed to the variation in nitrate source export from the watershed and isotope fractionation e g denitrification and assimilation during multiple nitrogen cycling processes ji et al 2017 for instance the variations in fertilization and soil fertility status caused by crop rotation e g maize wheat and vegetable fruits and cropping patterns in the watershed resulted in high uncertainty in the contribution of sn and af sources climate and landform are also important factors affecting the uncertainty of nitrate sources contribution the magnitude and intensity of precipitation are different in different seasons leading to dramatical changes in the runoff process in time and space and increasing the uncertainty of the sources of nitrate ji et al 2017 in karst areas the sources of nitrate are extremely complicated and uncertain due to the steep karst terrain heterogeneity and high permeability of karst conduits and fissures li et al 2020 moreover biological n removal process may occur in the downstream of the watershed in september which may alter the initial isotopic compositions of no3 and resulted in some estimation errors 4 7 implications for nitrate control in karst agricultural watersheds this study revealed the important clues for the high no3 in typical agricultural rivers in karstic regions the contribution proportions of anthropogenic activities mainly af nf and m s in the watershed were between 35 and 42 in september and 34 62 in december this indicates that nitrate pollutants contributed by anthropogenic inputs are the main sources of nitrate in rivers and have an important impact on river water quality first nitrogen fertilizers are the main source of human activities excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer should be limited the utilization efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer should be improved adopting deep fertilization instead of surface fertilization using nitrification inhibitors or slow released n fertilizer ji et al 2017 and soil testing fertilization in agricultural fields guo et al 2016 huang et al 2021 jin et al 2019 furthermore irrational irrigation is another important factor in nitrate contribution to rivers for example flood irrigation is common in northern china and will leach the nitrate in farmland into karst aquifer and finally discharge to rivers zhang et al 2018b to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and fertilizer and to reduce nitrogen loss advanced water saving irrigation techniques such as sprinkler and drip irrigation are proposed instead of flood irrigation second sn contributes the most to river nitrates 30 61 and the most effective management practices should be tailored to local conditions to reduce soil erosion and nutrient loss from karst slopes directly into rivers we can intercept and remove nitrogen from surface runoff by reduced tillage with crop residue mulching restoring riparian vegetation and establishing buffer strips ji et al 2017 zak et al 2018 jin et al 2019 5 conclusion in the present study hydrochemical compositions and environmental isotopes are combined to identify the sources of riverine no3 pollution in the typical karst watershed north china the results showed that no3 n was the predominant form of inorganic nitrogen in the water quality impairment of the yfr watershed accounting for approximately 58 of tn the cl concentrations and no3 cl ratios indicated that nitrate in the yfr watershed was mainly derived from a mixture of agricultural inputs soil organic nitrogen sewage and manure the isotopic compositions of no3 revealed that mixing of diffuse sources and biogeochemical attenuation controlled the fate of no3 in the watershed furthermore the results calculated by simmr model using δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 isotopes showed that the contributions of different nitrate sources to riverine nitrates varied seasonally and spatially in september sn 68 7 appeared to be the primary source of no3 in the rivers whereas af was lower 17 2 nevertheless although sn 44 3 and af 41 8 still contributed the most in december the contribution ratio of sn decreased by 22 4 while that of af increased by 24 6 therefore reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizer and improving the efficiency of agricultural irrigation provide the key to controlling nitrogen pollution in rivers and reservoirs in the yfr watershed in addition uncertainty analysis ui 90 quantitatively characterized the uncertainty trends associated with contributions of different nitrate sources and showed that sn 0 73 and af 0 67 had the highest uncertainty followed by nf 0 22 m s 0 22 and ad 0 10 the results showed that the uncertainty of the dual isotopic approach in nitrate source apportionment can be reduced this study provides a scientific basis for water

1326,nitrate no3 contamination of surface water is a globally concern especially in karstic regions affected by intensive agricultural activities this study combines hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes δ2hh2o δ18oh2o δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 with a bayesian isotope mixing model simmr to reduce the uncertainty in estimating the contributions of different pollution sources samples were collected from 32 surface water sites in the yufu river yfr watershed north china in september and december 2019 the results revealed that no3 n was the predominant form of inorganic nitrogen that caused the deterioration of water quality in the watershed accounting for approximately 58 of the total nitrogen tn the hydrochemical compositions and nitrate isotopes indicated that no3 mainly originated from soil nitrogen sn ammonium fertilizer af but nitrate fertilizer nf manure and sewage m s and atmospheric precipitation ap were limited the isotopic composition of nitrate in the upper reaches of the watershed was mainly affected by microbial nitrification while the mixture of multiple sources was the dominant nitrogen transformation process in the mid lower reaches of the watershed simmr model outputs revealed that sn 56 5 and af 29 5 were the primary contributor to riverine no3 pollution followed by nf 7 1 ms 3 6 and ap 3 4 sources moreover an uncertainty index ui 90 of the isotope mixing showed that sn 0 73 and af 0 67 had the highest values followed by nf 0 22 m s 0 22 and ap 0 10 chemical fertilizer and sn collectively contributed 50 of nitrate during the two sampling campaigns these results indicated that reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizers and rational irrigation are the keys to alleviate of no3 pollution the study is helpful in understanding the source and transformation of riverine no3 and effectively reducing no3 pollution in karst agricultural rivers or watersheds keywords nitrate isotope nitrate source identification simmr model uncertainty analysis karst watershed yufu river 1 introduction nitrate no3 in the karst water environment impacted by intensive agricultureare highly vulnerable to pollution because of heavy fertilizer application and irrational irrigation practices which is one of the most common environmental issue in karstic regions ford and williams 2007 perrin et al 2008 yue et al 2018 yang et al 2020 elevated nitrate levels in the contaminated waters may induce deterioration of water quality resulting in acidification and eutrophication of water and threaten drinking water safety camargo and alonso 2006 górski et al 2019 excessive nitrate concentrations in drinking water may increase the risk of some diseases such as methemoglobinemia in infants diabetes and stomach cancer xu et al 2016 ji et al 2017 li et al 2017 furthermore due to the heterogeneity and high permeability of karst conduits and fissures the migration mechanism of nitrate from different sources in surface water and groundwater systems is extremely complex and its pollution prevention and control becomes a prominent problem in karstic regions ford and williams 2007 yue et al 2018 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 thus understanding the sources and transformations of nitrate in the karst environment is crucially important for alleviating nitrogen pollution reducing nutrient loss and protecting water quality the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 are commonly used to distinguish potential sources of nitrate nestler et al 2011 since different sources of nitrate exhibit different isotope signatures in the water environment nestler et al 2011 the typical δ15n of nitrate derives from atmospheric precipitation nitrate fertilizer ammonium fertilizer soil nitrogen and manure sewage at 5 15 5 5 10 5 2 8 and 8 25 respectively mayer et al 2002 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 jin et al 2015 kohl et al 1971 first used δ15n to reveal that nitrate in surface water mainly derived from chemical fertilizers however certain nitrate sources cannot be distinguished by δ15n alone because the distribution ranges from different sources may overlap or isotope fractionations caused by biogeochemical processes may alter the initial isotopic signatures xue et al 2009 kendall et al 2007 these sources may be identified when δ18o of nitrate is incorporated amberger and schmidt 1987 the δ18ono3 of precipitation is influenced by complex atmospheric processes and varies widely from 25 to 75 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 the δ18ono3 in nitrate fertilizer ranges from 17 to 25 amberger and schmidt 1987 the δ18ono3 values from nitrification of ammonium fertilizer soil nitrogen and manure sewage generally are within 5 to 15 which is significantly lower than the δ18ono3 from atmospheric precipitation and nitrate fertilizer kendall and mcdonnell 1998 mayer et al 2001 xue et al 2009 therefore the δ18ono3 isotopes combined with δ15nno3 can be used to further distinguish different nitrate sources and are widely used in nitrate source identification of surface water zhang et al 2018a hu et al 2019a li et al 2019a jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b fadhullah et al 2020 the isotope mixing models for the quantitative assessment of nitrate sources mainly include the mass equilibrium mixing model and the siar mixsiar and simmr models quantitative assessment of nitrate sources by using the mass equilibrium mixing model has great limitations because it does not consider isotope fractionation during biogeochemical processes and identifies no more than three sources xue et al 2012 subsequently parnell et al 2010 and stock et al 2018 developed stable isotope mixing models such as siar simmr and mixsiar based on a bayesian framework for the above problems these models overcome the limitations of the mass equilibrium mixing model and are widely used in surface water ecosystems xue et al 2012 yue et al 2015 li et al 2019a hu et al 2019b ogrinc et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a ren et al 2021 nevertheless these models can potentially count uncertain sources that introduce uncertainties into the proportional contribution of no3 sources jin et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b the karst waters have been an important water source for industry agriculture and domestic water in north china due to the diversity of recharge sources and the openness of karst water system groundwater and surface water in kart areas are closely interactive each other gao et al 2020 cao et al 2021 this makes water in karst areas more vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination than those in non karst areas yue et al 2018 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020d ren et al 2021 with the intensification of agriculture and the continuous expansion of industry and urbanization in northern china the discharge of industrial agricultural and domestic pollutants has been increasing leading to the serious deterioration of surface water quality in karst areas in northern china yuan 1994 in addition the superposition of human activities and climate change further aggravates the severity of karst water pollution in north china gao et al 2020 meanwhile most of karst in north china are developed in semi arid areas where water resources are scarce which makes the problem of pollution induced water shortage more prominent at present the research on identifying the source and behavior of nitrate in karst areas is more focused on karst areas in south china yue et al 2015 li and ji 2016 yue et al 2018 jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c cao et al 2021 however the source identification of nitrate in typical karst basins in north china has not been reported the yufu river yfr watershed is a representative agricultural karst area in north china in recent years its prevalence on karst groundwater and surface water quality impairment with the rapid development of intensive agriculture and urbanization in jinan city furthermore the watershed is not only an important recharge water source of jinan karst spring groups but also a national key protection of drinking water source and the main production and living water source in jinan city therefore to better protect and scientifically manage karst water resources it is necessary to adopt dual isotope approach and bayesian isotope mixing model to quantitatively identify no3 n pollution sources in the watershed the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the temporal and spatial variations of nitrogen species in different streams and evaluate their pollution level 2 identify no3 n sources and transformations by utilizing a combination of hydrochemistry and multi isotope δ2hh2o δ18oh2o δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 and land use information and 3 quantify the contributions of no3 n sources by using the simmr model and to propose management measures to reduce nitrogen pollution the results provide important implications for nitrogen pollution control water quality protection and sustainable utilization of karst water resources in karst agricultural rivers with multiple pollution sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yufu river watershed 36 20 n 36 40 n 116 45 e 117 15 e is located in southern jinan city shandong province north china fig 1 the watershed is mainly composed of a main stream and three tributaries the main river is the yufu river yfr the tributaries are the jinxiu river jxr and jinyang river jyr in the upper reaches and the erxian river exr in the middle reaches the sources of the jxr and jyr originate from the northern slope of tai mountain at 1500 m above mean sea level and the rivers convergently flow into the wohushan reservoir site 16 discharge to the yfr and eventually flow into the yellow river the total length of the yufu river is 95 7 km and its drainage area is 764 2 km2 the watershed is located in the semi humid warm temperate zone and has a typical east asian monsoon climate from 1958 to 2019 the annual mean precipitation and air temperature are 658 8 mm and 14 3 c respectively http data cma cn the minimum mean daily and maximum mean temperatures are 0 4 c in january and 27 5 c in july respectively the seasonal distribution of precipitation is uneven and the precipitation is concentrated from july to september accounting for approximately 75 of the annual precipitation the mean annual evaporation is 1430 mm the mean runoff depth is 141 3 mm and the mean annual runoff is 1 26 108 m3 in 2019 http jnwater jinan gov cn col col27547 index html the soil profile is thinnest and discontinuous in the upstream of the watershed and relatively thick in karst river valley and alluvial and diluvial plain areas which are mostly distributed in the mid lower stream the soil types in the watershed are mainly brown soil and cinnamon soil the dominant land use types of the watershed are forest and shrub 52 7 followed by cultivated land 26 1 and residential land 12 4 the remaining land use types are water bodies 3 6 unused land 1 9 grassland 1 4 transportation land 1 1 and public land 0 8 typical crops in the watershed include winter wheat rice corn beans tubers cotton apple pear melons and vegetables etc the watershed is a typical karst agricultural watershed which is dominated by agriculture and widely distributed arable land according to the field investigation the agricultural fertilizers application in the watershed mainly include ammonium fertilizer e g ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate etc urea nitrogen and phosphorus compound fertilizer controlled release fertilizer and livestock and poultry excrement in karst soils the nh4 in ammonium fertilizer urea and manure are nitrated or nitrate fertilizers are remineralized into nh4 and nitrated to form nitrates that are easier to migrate li et al 2020 nitrate contaminants are carried into rivers through surface runoff generated by precipitation or nitrate in surface runoff or irrigation water is lost into karst aquifers which recharge rivers in the form of base flow at lower terrain resulting in deterioration of river water quality and a threat to drinking water safety due to the steep karst terrain and the relatively developed karst conduits and fissures the nitrate isotope of river water inherited more signatures from non point sources such as nitrifying soil organic nitrogen and ammonium fertilizer therefore agricultural non point source pollution may be an important factor leading to large amounts of nitrogen pollutants in the rivers of the watershed especially near rivers and reservoirs large scale facility agriculture is distributed which mainly grows vegetables and fruits for the consumption of jinan residents meanwhile the study area is also a national key protection area are of drinking water source and the main production and living water source in jinan city from the upstream to downstream of the watershed the main outcropped strata and lithology are taishan group metamorphic rocks cambrian and ordovician carbonate rocks and quaternary unconsolidated sediments rivers in the watershed are mainly recharged by atmospheric precipitation and groundwater discharge the river waters in the upper reaches of the metamorphic rock region is also recharged by bedrock fissure water while in the mid lower reaches of the intermountain valley and piedmont alluvial plain it is mainly recharged by karst groundwater and quaternary pore water in the middle and upper reaches of the watershed the cambrian and ordovician outcrops are large in area and thick and karst groundwater is an important recharge source for surface water in addition most of the surface water in the reach between sites 5 and 6 of yfr is recharged into karst aquifers through the seepage zone and becomes an important recharge water source for the four largest spring groups in jinan xing et al 2018 the thickness of quaternary sediments is about 7 30 m and gradually thickens from the strong seepage zone to the downstream in the yfr 2 2 sampling and pre treatment considering the different types of existing potential sources of pollution land use patterns and watershed characteristics 32 sampling sites in september wet season and december 2019 dry season covering the entire watershed fig 1 were identified and their locations were recorded by a hand held global positioning system the water temperature tw ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were directly measured in situ using a portable multiparameter water quality meter wtw multi 3630 germany which has accuracies of 0 1 c 0 01 ph units 1 μs cm and 0 01 mg l respectively river water samples at 15 cm under the water surface were collected the collected water samples were filtered immediately through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester membrane saved in prewashed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and then stored at 4 c before experimental analysis 2 3 water quality and stable isotope analysis the concentrations of tn no3 n nh4 n and no2 n in river water samples were measured by using the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method uv spectrophotometric method indophenol blue spectrophotometric method and diazo coupled spectrophotometric method respectively yue et al 2014 chloride cl ion concentrations were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 usa with a precision of 5 the δd and δ18o of water samples were measured using high precision laser spectroscopy xiong et al 2021 lgr iwa 45 ep usa at the institute of geological survey china university of geosciences wuhan the international standards are vienna standard mean ocean water v smow for δ18o and δd in water the analytical precisions were 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δd respectively the cadmium cd reduction and azide reduction method was used to analyze δ15nno3 and δ18o no3 of water samples by reducing nitrate to n2o tu et al 2016 sui et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the isotopic signature of the produced n2o was determined using a stable isotopic ratio mass spectrometer mat 253 thermo fisher scientific usa at the third institute of oceanography ministry of natural resources china the measurement results were referenced to international standards atmospheric n2 for δ15n and v smow for δ18o and were calibrated based on international standards usgs32 and usgs34 casciotti et al 2002 yang and toor 2016 the precision for δ15n and δ18o was 0 3 the stable isotope ratios are expressed as δ values and calculated by eq 1 1 δ sample r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the 15n 14n 18o 16o and 2h 1h ratios of the sample and standard respectively 2 4 statistical analysis before comparative analysis of temporal and spatial differences of variables we first analyzed the normality of all variables in different rivers for dry and wet seasons september and december by using shapiro welk test the differences of variables were statistically compared by using a one way anova test p 0 05 if the assumption of normality was rejected the non parametric kruskal wallis test was applied spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze the relationship among hydrochemical parameters and isotope values with a 0 05 significance level chemical components in river water were determined by the kriging interpolation method in arcgis 10 5 the ibm spss version 22 0 originpro2018 and arcgis10 5 were used for statistical analyses and scientific mapping respectively the proportional contribution of different contamination sources to no3 in different seasons was evaluated by applying stable isotope mixing models in r parnell 2013 simmr is an upgraded version of the siar package and contains many of the same features https cran r project org web packages simmr vignettes simmr html compared with siar this new version has a more sophisticated mixing model simpler user interfaces and more advanced drawing functions the contributions of no3 sources to a mixture were quantified using the mcmc model parnell et al 2010 as follows 2 x ij k 1 k p k q jk s jk c jk k 1 k p k q jk ε ij 3 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 4 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 5 ε ij 0 σ j 2 where x ij is the isotope value j of water sample i p k is the contribution of source k q

which has mean λ jk and sd τ jk 2 and ε ij is the residual error where σ j 2 is the residual variance 2 5 uncertainty index the uncertainty index ui 90 is based on the posterior distribution to characterize the uncertainty strength of nitrate source apportionment ji et al 2017 xu et al 2021 in the process of nitrate pollutant source identification uncertainty is defined as the variation strength of each nitrate source contribution within a given likelihood range to eliminate the effect of extreme values and to describe the degree of uncertainty related to the distribution results ui 90 is calculated by using the difference proportional contribution between the minimum and maximum values of the rapidly increasing segment 90 cumulative probability divided by 90 the calculation formula of ui 90 is as follows 6 ui 90 p max p min 0 9 where p max and p min are the maximum and minimum proportional contributions of different sources in the rapid growth segment of 90 cumulative probability respectively the smaller the value of ui 90 is the more stable the source contribution of nitrate while the larger the value is the stronger the variability of the source contribution 3 results 3 1 field parameters the field parameters of river water in yfr watershed in september and december are summarized in table 1 the ph was 7 64 8 96 mean 8 25 with moderately alkaline conditions

water was generally aerobic the ec values ranged from 297 μs cm upstream to 1195 μs cm downstream showing significant spatial variation p 0 05 furthermore the ec value also showed significant temporal

samples are shown in table 1 and fig 2s the tn concentrations of surface water samples had a wide range between different watersheds p 0 05 with values ranging from 0 26 to 23 mg l regardless of the wet season or dry season the average tn concentrations in the four watersheds from high to low were the exr 12 83 mg l jxr 9 61 mg l jyr 5 99 mg l and yfr 5 62 mg l in addition among the 64 water samples except for those from two sites sites 1 and 6 in december the tn concentration exceeded the limit of surface water national environmental protection agency of china 2002 1 0 mg l accounting for approximately 96 9 of the total water samples the no3 n concentrations of all samples ranged from 0 1 to 8 15 mg l mean 4 41 mg l presenting a first increasing and then decreasing trend from upstream to downstream in both seasons with a higher value in the tributaries 2 15 6 4 mg l than in the mainstream 0 32 4 91 mg l for different watersheds the no3 n concentrations from high to low were the exr 6 27 mg l jxr 5 41 mg l jyr 4 09 mg l and yfr 2 67 mg l which also showed significant spatial variation p 0 05 moreover no3 n was the main nitrogen form accounting for 68 4 and 47 7 of the tn in the water samples in september and december respectively the no3 n concentrations of all the water samples were below the guideline value of 10 mg l for drinking water national environmental protection agency of china 2002 the mean tn and no3 n concentrations in september 9 56 and 5 78 mg l respectively were significantly higher than those in december 6 56 and 3 04 mg l respectively showing significant seasonal variation p 0 05 this result is not consistent with the results for surface water in other study areas zhang et al 2018a jin et al 2018 li et al 2019b fadhullah et al 2020 the nh4 n concentrations of all samples ranged from 0 01 to 10 47 mg l mean 0 95 mg l most of which were low and accounted for only 11 and 12 of the tn in september and december respectively the mean concentrations of nh4 n in the yfr 1 73 mg l and exr 1 56 mg l were higher than those in the upstream watersheds jyr 0 29 mg l and the jxr 0 16 mg l indicating significant differences in the spatial variation in the watershed p 0 05 although the mean concentration of nh4 n in september 1 12 mg l was higher than that in december 0 78 mg l there was no significant difference in the seasonal variation in nh4 n p 0 05 the concentration of no2 n was extremely low ranging from 0 01 to 0 86 mg l mean 0 1 mg l accounting for approximately 2 of the tn no significant differences in seasonal and spatial variations in no2 n were observed p 0 05 as shown in fig 2s the cl concentration had a significant spatial difference ranging between 10 95 and 131 78 mg l mean 31 34 mg l showing a trend of gradual increase from upstream 18 74 mg l to mid lower stream 48 3 mg l although the concentration of cl in december was higher than that in september there was no significant difference in seasonal variation p 0 05 3 3 isotopic composition of water the δdh2o and δ18oh2o distributions for all sampled water in the yfr watershed are shown in fig 2 the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values ranged from 66 0 to 36 6 mean 56 0 and 9 2 to 4 2 7 7 in the watershed respectively according to the statistical analysis the seasonal variation of δdh2o and δ18oh2o in river water showed no significant difference p 0 05 but the spatial variation of δdh2o and δ18oh2o had significant difference p 0 05 the mean δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of the water samples in the four watersheds were the yfr 6 4 and 48 8 respectively jyr 8 0 and 57 4 exr 8 2 and 57 9 jxr 8 7 and 62 1 the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of river water samples were generally enriched from upstream to mid lower stream and were distributed along the lower part of the lmwl with offset to the right the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of water in september ranged from 6 4 to 45 9 average of 54 5 and 9 2 to 5 9 7 6 respectively the values varied between 64 3 and 36 6 for δdh2o 54 5 and between 8 9 and 4 2 7 6 for δ18oh2o in december there were no statistically significant differences in the seasonal variation in water p 0 05 in addition due to the impact of atmospheric precipitation recharge the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of water samples were significantly positively correlated in september r 0 93 p 0 05 and december r 0 96 p 0 05 and were located near the local meteoric water line lmwl nevertheless due to the evaporation effect of river water the slope of the evaporation line in september slope 5 6 and december slope 5 3 was significantly lower than that of lmwl slope 7 46 3 4 the isotopic composition of nitrate the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values of river water in the yfr watershed are shown in table 1 and fig 4 there was a range of δ15nno3 values from 6 7 to 8 1 mean 2 1 with 76 6 of water samples having δ15nno3 values between 0 and 5 the δ18ono3 values ranged from 11 9 to 22 0 with an average value of 3 9 spatially the mean δ15nno3 values of the water samples in the four watersheds from high to low were the yfr 3 1 jyr 2 2 exr 1 5 and jxr 1 1 however the δ18ono3 values of water samples in the watershed were the yfr 5 9 jxr 4 7 exr 3 5 jxr 1 1 overall the mean values of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 in the mid lower reaches of the watershed were higher than those in the upper reaches but only δ18ono3 has a significant difference p 0 05 the δ15nno3 values ranged from 6 9 to 8 1 mean 2 5 and the δ18ono3 values ranged from 11 9 to 8 6 3 0 in september the δ15nno3 values in december were lower ranging from 3 6 to 5 9 while the δ18ono3 value in december was more enriched than that in september varying in a range of 8 7 to 22 0 in the watershed there was no statistically significant difference in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values between seasons and location p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal variations of nitrate concentrations as shown in table 1 the no3 n concentrations of the middle and upper reaches exr jxr and jyr were significantly higher than those of the lower reaches yfr p 0 05 indicating that they might be different sources of no3 n or have undergone different biogeochemical processes furthermore the no3 n levels in the jxr and jyr showed a gradually increasing trend from upstream to downstream during the sampling campaigns which might be attributed to the different land use because the proportion of forestland in the upstream of the sub basin is relatively high while the proportion of arable land in the downstream increases slightly fig 1 the no3 n concentrations were high in the exr except site 9 in the estuary since agricultural land was dominant however the no3 n concentrations in the yfr gradually attenuated from upstream to the estuary while the cl concentration showed a trend of gradual increase this suggested that nitrate might be influenced by both biogeochemical processes assimilation or denitrification and human activities hu et al 2020 the no3 n concentration in september in the study area was higher than that in december which was contrary to the results in other study areas jin et al 2019 li et al 2019a this might be because the increased precipitation in september causes more agricultural non point source pollutants from steep karst terrains are directly discharged into rivers through increased surface runoff or infiltrate underground aquifers through karst conduits and fissures and then discharged into low altitude surface rivers as base flow yue et al 2018 by comparing the surface water in yfr watershed with other basins in china the mean riverine no3 concentration in yfr watershed is similar to that in the yellow river zhang et al 2018b and dagu river li et al 2019b but it is significantly higher than those in rivers of southern china li et al 2010 jin et al 2019 li et al 2019a jin et al 2020 yi et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 tibetan plateau xia et al 2009 and beijing city li et al 2014 peters et al 2019 in addition the concentration of no3 in the fenhe river of the loess plateau yang et al 2018 is significantly higher than that in the study area therefore geographical location climatic conditions geological background human activities and other factors will result in great differences in nitrate in surface water in different regions chen et al 2020 4 2 identification of the sources of no3 by water chemistry composition the relationship between cl versus no3 cl is commonly used to identify the sources and biogeochemical processes of nitrate in surface rivers liu et al 2006 yue et al 2017 jin et al 2018 in the absence of halite deposits non point sources e g chemical fertilizer and soil nitrogen erosion generally has low cl concentrations and a high no3 cl ratio while sewage or manure may generate high cl and a low no3 cl ratio liu et al 2006 li et al 2016 jiang et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 the ratios of no3 cl in water samples varied greatly from 0 01 to 2 03 indicated that no3 might derive from multiple sources the upstream of the watershed jxr and jyr had lower cl and higher no3 cl ratios which may be attributed to non point source pollution caused by extensive application of agricultural n fertilizer and soil erosion compared with the upstream of the watershed the no3 cl ratios in the midstream and downstream exr and yfr is lower and cl concentration is higher the results showed that nitrate may derived from a mixture of sewage and manure soil nitrogen erosion and agricultural inputs in the midstream and downstream the lower reaches of the watershed are piedmont alluvial plains with extensive arable land and dense population and the contribution of sewage and manure may be increased compared with that of the upper reaches moreover the no3 cl ratios decreased rapidly from upstream to estuary in yfr while cl concentration increased slightly indicating that biological processes may be partially responsible for the reduction of nitrate concentrations such as denitrification or assimilation liu et al 2006 li et al 2016 4 3 identification of nitrate sources by δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 a classic dual isotope bi plot approach δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 was used to qualitatively identify predominant no3 sources in yfr watershed as shown in fig 4 none of the river water nitrate isotopic fingerprints fell into the ap source area indicating that the contribution of ap to river nitrate was limited it is worth noting that only one water sample was within the range of nf although it is affected by high intensity agricultural activities the possible explanation is that the contribution of nitrate fertilizer in karst soil or epikarst zone has been masked by multiple biogeochemical cycles xu et al 2021 most residential areas in the watershed are located around rivers and reservoirs however only one sample in september fell within the overlapping range of sn and m s which may be related to the measures taken by the watershed to limit point source pollution most of the samples fell within the overlapping range of sn and af indicating that nitrate mainly derived from nitrification of sn and af this result is basically consistent with that of hydrochemistry this may be attributed to the steep karst terrain and intensive agricultural activities in the watershed li et al 2020 furthermore the mean δ15nno3 values in december was slightly lower than that in september and was closer to the af range this is because december is the dry season in the watershed and the surface water is basically in the base flow state due to less precipitation which is more laterally recharged by karst groundwater meanwhile the intensive agriculture applied excessive ammonium fertilizer and flood irrigation to achieve higher vegetable and fruit yields these unreasonable practices might result in the nitrification of large amounts of af into nitrates which was then lost to karst aquifers through karst conduits and fissures and recharged the surface water in the form of basal flow in early september although it is in the middle and late period of the wet season due to the high precipitation in august fig 1s more soil organic nitrogen in the epikarst zones was eroded into the surface rivers through the increased surface runoff or directly into karst aquifers through the epikarst zone or karst conduits and fractures and finally discharged into the surface rivers however there may be a certain lag due to the recharge of karst groundwater by precipitation and then drainage to surface rivers by groundwater flow therefore the contribution of soil organic nitrogen was still high despite the low precipitation in september the higher no3 cl and lower δ15nno3 values suggested soil sources e g soil organic nitrogen or chemical fertilizer dominated the no3 in contrast the lower no3 cl and higher δ15nno3 values suggested manure and sewage sources or biological processes e g denitrification and assimilation dominated the no3 jiang et al 2021 in september forest and arable land dominated in exr jxr and jyr most water samples have higher no3 cl ratios and more depleted δ15nno3 fig 4c however the no3 cl ratios of yfr in september gradually decreased from the upstream to the estuary while the δ15nno3 values were gradually increased meanwhile there was a significant negative linear correlation between no3 cl and δ15nno3 slope 1 2 r 0 88 p 0 05 all these confirmed that the nitrate in yfr may be affected either by manure and sewage or biological processes however the nitrate isotope fingerprints of most samples did not fall within sewage and manure source area indicating that nitrate in yfr may derive from the mixture of soil organic nitrogen ammonium fertilizer with more depletion of δ15nno3 in the upstream and sewage discharge along the downstream in december the no3 cl ratios and δ15nno3 values of exr jxr and jyr were similar to those in september which also confirmed that nitrate in the upstream rivers mainly derived from soil organic nitrogen and ammonium fertilizer fig 4d the no3 cl ratios in yfr were lower than that of other rivers but the δ15nno3 values were more depleted however there is no better explanation for this result and further research is still needed 4 4 biogeochemical processes of nitrate the isotope compositions of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 are not only related to their initial sources but also influenced by isotopic fractionation during biogeochemical processes such as nitrification denitrification and assimilation kendall et al 2007 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 yue et al 2017 puig et al 2017 nitrification is the process of ammonia oxidation to nitrate mediated by microorganisms kendall et al 2007 xu et al 2016 the δ18o of nitrate produced by nitrification consists of one oxygen atom from atmospheric o2 and two oxygen atoms from the ambient water δ18ono3 1 3δ18oo2 2 3δ18oh2o andersson and hooper 1983 kendall et al 2007 the δ18oh2o value of river water samples ranged from 9 2 to 4 2 and the δ18oo2 value in the atmosphere is 23 5 amberger and schmidt 1987 the theoretical values of δ18ono3 from nitrification would be 1 7 to 5 0 from calculation fig 5 revealed that most of the water samples in the upstream of the watershed fell within the theoretical nitrification range confirming that nitrification dominates the oxygen isotope composition of nitrate nevertheless the δ18ono3 values of some samples were higher than the upper limit of nitrification 5 0 which might be related to precipitation contribution evaporation and the respiration and denitrification of microorganisms kendall et al 2007 yue et al 2014 due to the low precipitation during the sampling period fig 1s it can be excluded the δdh2o and δ18oh2o values of sample sites 1 and 4 7 in september and sites 1 4 8 31 and 32 in september were relatively enriched indicating that they were affected by evaporation fig 2 however the water isotope values of sites 19 22 were more depleted and the partial pressure of co2 10 3 6 10 3 3 in the water at these points were close to that in the atmosphere 10 3 5 indicating that oxygen in nitrate may be exchanged with oxygen in the atmosphere moreover samples 2 3 9 12 15 in september and 2 13 14 and 15 in december had δ18ono3 values below the lower limit 1 7 which might be caused by the exchange of oxygen atoms from nitrite in the epikarst zones with more depleted oxygen atoms in the soil water mayer et al 2001 kool et al 2011 li et al 2019a qin et al 2019 it is noteworthy that these water samples all have higher concentrations of ammonium 0 69 10 47 mg l the results indicated that the transformation process of nitrate in the upper reaches of the watershed was mainly controlled by microbial nitrification while it was dominated by the mixture of multiple no3 sources in the mid lower reaches denitrification is an important microbially facilitated process in anaerobic conditions where no3 is reduced to n2 as the terminal product by microorganisms kendall et al 2007 xu et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 in addition heterotrophic microorganisms preferentially utilize light isotopes and consume nitrates in aquatic ecosystems during denitrification kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 luu et al 2020 when denitrification occurs the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 values in the substrate increase with the decrease of the no3 n concentrations and the δ15n δ18o ratio generally ranged from 1 3 1 to 2 1 1 liu et al 2006 yang and toor 2016 li et al 2019a only the exr in september and jyr in september and december had significant positive linear correlation with δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 p 0 05 fig 3s but the slopes were not between 0 5 and 1 the rest showed no significant linear positive correlation p 0 05 the results suggest that denitrification might be minor in the watershed additionally the do values ranged from 1 76 to 17 99 mg l and only one sample was 2 mg l which limits denitrification pastén zapata et al 2014 yang and toor 2016 the relationship between lnno3 n versus δ15nno3 δ18ono3 is commonly used to distinguish mixing and biological n removal processes mariotti et al 1988 weng et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the significant negative linear correlation between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 versus lnno3 n can identify biological no3 removal processes such as denitrification or assimilation kendall et al 2007 jiang et al 2021 as shown in the fig 6 there were significant negative linear correlation between δ15nno3 and lnno3 n in september in the yfr slope 1 4 r 0 76 p 0 05 and δ15nno3 values were enriched from upstream to downstream with the attenuation of no3 n concentrations meanwhile δ15nno3 and 1 no3 n have a positive curved correlation fig 7 indicating that the attenuation of nitrate might be caused by biological no3 removal processes paredes et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 it is difficult to distinguish between assimilation absorption and denitrification using δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 since phytoplankton may preferentially metabolize light isotopes yue et al 2018 however the δ15nno3 and lnno3 n were weakly correlated with δ18ono3 p 0 05 which was inconsistent with the above conclusions thus there is not enough evidence to confirm that denitrification occurs significantly and that the biogeochemical processes of nitrates are conservative in the watershed the no3 n gradually increased from upstream to downstream in the jxr during the two sampling activities while δ15nno3 or δ18ono3 were gradually depleted and showing a linear negative correlation fig 6 meanwhile there were positive linear correlation between 1 no3 n versus δ15nno3 or δ18ono3 fig 7 these results suggested that nitrate may be related to the mixing of soil organic nitrogen from upstream and af application in intensive agriculture along the jxr furthermore the no3 n levels of jyr in december gradually increased from upstream to downstream while the values of δ15nno3 or δ18ono3 increased slightly along the river flow direction there were positive correlation between 1 no3 n versus δ15nno3 r 0 4 p 0 05 or δ18ono3 r 0 75 p 0 05 in jyr in december fig 7 kendall et al 2007 this is the result of erosion of soil organic nitrogen or loss of af in the upstream mixed with small amounts of sewage and manure along the way however for the rest there is no linear negative correlation between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 versus lnno3 n fig 6 meanwhile there was no correlation between δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 versus 1 no3 n fig 7 these results further confirm that no3 removal processes and mixing of two sources of nitrate with different concentrations in these rivers may be minor 4 5 source apportionment of nitrate based on the simmr model a bayesian mixing model in simmr was used to quantitatively estimate the proportional contributions of nitrate from five potential sources in the watershed fig 8 the site specific isotope information of the no3 sources was determined from the relevant literature table 1s meanwhile we assumed that the fractionation factor c jk was 0 eq 4 because river water was not conducive to denitrification the output results from the simmr model table 2s and fig 8 shows that the mean contribution proportions of the five potential no3 sources in the watershed could be ranked as follows sn 68 7 af 17 2 nf 7 2 ap 3 6 m s 3 3 in september and sn 44 3 af 41 8 nf 6 9 m s 3 9 ap 3 1 in december the contribution of sn to nitrate was the highest since the watershed is dominated by steep karst terrain and land use is dominated by natural vegetation and farmland furthermore the sn in september was 24 4 higher than that in december which might be attributed to more flushing of nitrogen containing soil organic matter from karst steep slopes e g slope farming to rivers under intense rainfall conditions in the rainy season liu et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the contribution of af to nitrate is second only to that of sn which might be related to the high intensity of agricultural activities in the watershed the contribution of af increased 23 6 in december compared with september this could be attributed to the heavy application of ammonium fertilizer and improper irrigation in december in intensive agricultural areas around rivers or reservoirs although the watershed has a high proportion of agricultural cropland 26 1 and intensive agricultural activities the contribution proportion of nitrate fertilizer was lower in september and december 6 9 and 7 2 respectively a possible explanation is that the contribution of nitrate fertilizers in karst soils or epikarst zones has been masked by multiple biogeochemical cycles xu et al 2021 the manure and sewage contribution ranged between 3 3 in september and 3 9 in december indicating that the contribution of manure and sewage to nitrate was small in the study area this might be related to the strict management measures in the watershed as the yfr watershed is a key protection area for drinking water in jinan city the local government has taken strict administrative measures to protect the water quality therefore the contribution of point source pollution such as domestic sewage and municipal sewage to nitrate was significantly reduced the contribution of atmospheric precipitation to no3 was low in both sampling campaigns in the watershed and similar values have been observed in other study areas xue et al 2012 matiatos 2016 li et al 2019a spatially the contribution proportion of sn in september was the highest 56 61 in the four rivers and increased slightly from the upstream to downstream ammonium fertilizer decreased by 15 from upstream to downstream while the proportions of atmospheric precipitation nitrate fertilizer and manure and sewage increased by approximately 2 1 and 8 respectively this suggested that the decrease of ammonium fertilizer from upstream to downstream may be related to the increase of the remaining four sources in addition the contribution of the four rivers in september showed similar patterns of nitrate sources fig 8a this reflects that increased precipitation during the wet season facilitated the mixing of different sources of river nitrate in contrast fig 8b showed different source apportionment patterns in december the contribution of nitrate sources from upstream rivers jyr and jxr was sn af nf m s ap in december which was consistent with the pattern of nitrate sources in september nevertheless the reason for this pattern was different from that in september this might be attributed to the steep terrain and high natural vegetation cover in the upstream of the watershed in addition slope farming also resulted in erosion of soil organic matter and loss of n fertilizers li et al 2019a however the contribution of sn to nitrate downstream decreased by 32 compared with that upstream in december while the contribution proportions of ap m s nf and af in the downstream increased by 4 5 9 and 22 respectively the results showed that the high intensity agricultural activities in december had a significant impact on the nitrate source in the mid lower reaches 4 6 uncertainty analysis uncertainty determines whether the quantitative identification of no3 pollution sources in waters is reliable and stable shang et al 2020 the ui 90 value for ap was the smallest 0 1 and its source was the most stable fig 9 however the highest ui 90 value of sn 0 73 and af 0 67 indicated that the proportional contribution of these sources exhibited the strongest uncertainty the nf 0 22 and m s 0 22 had moderate uncertainties the uncertainty of nitrate input might be attributed to the variation in nitrate source export from the watershed and isotope fractionation e g denitrification and assimilation during multiple nitrogen cycling processes ji et al 2017 for instance the variations in fertilization and soil fertility status caused by crop rotation e g maize wheat and vegetable fruits and cropping patterns in the watershed resulted in high uncertainty in the contribution of sn and af sources climate and landform are also important factors affecting the uncertainty of nitrate sources contribution the magnitude and intensity of precipitation are different in different seasons leading to dramatical changes in the runoff process in time and space and increasing the uncertainty of the sources of nitrate ji et al 2017 in karst areas the sources of nitrate are extremely complicated and uncertain due to the steep karst terrain heterogeneity and high permeability of karst conduits and fissures li et al 2020 moreover biological n removal process may occur in the downstream of the watershed in september which may alter the initial isotopic compositions of no3 and resulted in some estimation errors 4 7 implications for nitrate control in karst agricultural watersheds this study revealed the important clues for the high no3 in typical agricultural rivers in karstic regions the contribution proportions of anthropogenic activities mainly af nf and m s in the watershed were between 35 and 42 in september and 34 62 in december this indicates that nitrate pollutants contributed by anthropogenic inputs are the main sources of nitrate in rivers and have an important impact on river water quality first nitrogen fertilizers are the main source of human activities excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer should be limited the utilization efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer should be improved adopting deep fertilization instead of surface fertilization using nitrification inhibitors or slow released n fertilizer ji et al 2017 and soil testing fertilization in agricultural fields guo et al 2016 huang et al 2021 jin et al 2019 furthermore irrational irrigation is another important factor in nitrate contribution to rivers for example flood irrigation is common in northern china and will leach the nitrate in farmland into karst aquifer and finally discharge to rivers zhang et al 2018b to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and fertilizer and to reduce nitrogen loss advanced water saving irrigation techniques such as sprinkler and drip irrigation are proposed instead of flood irrigation second sn contributes the most to river nitrates 30 61 and the most effective management practices should be tailored to local conditions to reduce soil erosion and nutrient loss from karst slopes directly into rivers we can intercept and remove nitrogen from surface runoff by reduced tillage with crop residue mulching restoring riparian vegetation and establishing buffer strips ji et al 2017 zak et al 2018 jin et al 2019 5 conclusion in the present study hydrochemical compositions and environmental isotopes are combined to identify the sources of riverine no3 pollution in the typical karst watershed north china the results showed that no3 n was the predominant form of inorganic nitrogen in the water quality impairment of the yfr watershed accounting for approximately 58 of tn the cl concentrations and no3 cl ratios indicated that nitrate in the yfr watershed was mainly derived from a mixture of agricultural inputs soil organic nitrogen sewage and manure the isotopic compositions of no3 revealed that mixing of diffuse sources and biogeochemical attenuation controlled the fate of no3 in the watershed furthermore the results calculated by simmr model using δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 isotopes showed that the contributions of different nitrate sources to riverine nitrates varied seasonally and spatially in september sn 68 7 appeared to be the primary source of no3 in the rivers whereas af was lower 17 2 nevertheless although sn 44 3 and af 41 8 still contributed the most in december the contribution ratio of sn decreased by 22 4 while that of af increased by 24 6 therefore reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizer and improving the efficiency of agricultural irrigation provide the key to controlling nitrogen pollution in rivers and reservoirs in the yfr watershed in addition uncertainty analysis ui 90 quantitatively characterized the uncertainty trends associated with contributions of different nitrate sources and showed that sn 0 73 and af 0 67 had the highest uncertainty followed by nf 0 22 m s 0 22 and ad 0 10 the results showed that the uncertainty of the dual isotopic approach in nitrate source apportionment can be reduced this study provides a scientific basis for water

research in this study we used red mud as a stable supporting medium to develop red mud modified nzvi to form rm nzvi composite we assessed its sorptive reductive removal of mercury hg2 from aqueous solutions the rm nzvi was synthesized through the reduction of ferric iron by sodium borohydride nabh4 in the presence of red mud morphological characterization of rm nzvi confirmed its diffusion state with lesser aggregation the rm nzvi has the bet surface area pore diameter and pore volume as 111 59 m2g 1 3 82 nm and 0 49 cm3g 1 respectively adsorption of mercury hg2 by rm nzvi exhibits ph dependent behavior with increased removal of hg2 with the increase in ph up to 5 and the removal rate decreased gradually as the ph increased from 5 to 10 extensive characterization of rm nzvi corroborated the evidence that the removal of hg2 was initially by rapid physical adsorption followed by a reduction of hg2 to hg0 the adsorption data were best fitted with langmuir isotherm with r2 correlation coefficient 0 99 with high uptake capacity of 94 58 mg g 1 the novel rm nzvi composite with enhanced sorptive and reductive capacity is an ideal alternative for removing hg2 from

processes or due to anthropogenic activities natural events through which mercury enters the aqueous environment include volcanic explosions weathering of rock erosion of natural deposits geothermal processes wild forest fires and vaporization from soil and water feng et al 2003 schroeder and munthe 1998 there are myriad anthropogenic sources through which hg ii and its compounds enter the aquatic environment including the uncontrolled and unregulated discharge of effluents from industries such as gold refineries petroleum refineries electroplating leather tanning metal finishing pharmaceuticals industries and runoff from landfills and croplands ma et al 2019 mercury is a non biodegradable heavy metal once released to the environment it can persist for more than a year li and tse 2015 in an aqueous environment mercury tends to bioaccumulate and bioconcentrate in the tissues muscles lipids and livers of aquatic organisms ingestion of mercury contaminated fish could result in severe human health repercussions even at low concentrations including metabolic disruption damage to the nervous system breakdown of the chromosome and paralysis syversen and kaur 2012 given its toxicity the united states environmental protection agency stipulates the maximum contaminant levels mcl concentration for mercury in drinking water as 2 μgl 1 different international regulatory agencies have proposed the permissible limits for mercury as 10 μgl 1 and 1 μgl 1 for surface water and drinking water respectively namasivayam and periasamy 1993 not surprisingly regulatory agencies have implemented stringent regulations that govern the treatment and discharge of effluent containing heavy metals mercury is a pollutant of primary concern and is currently ranked third in the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr just after arsenic and lead kong et al 2019 given its long term persistence and adverse consequences to human health and other living organisms mercury polluted water bodies must be remediated to protect human health and the environment kong et al 2019 currently many technologies exist for the removal of mercury from industrial wastewater with varying efficiencies sowlat et al 2017 techniques such as ion exchange chemical precipitation reduction extraction and chelating resins showed promising results for treating industrial wastewater containing hg2 ions tauanov et al 2018 however these technologies were not economically feasible and often result in a substantial amount of secondary waste streams that need further treatment and disposal power et al 2011 these limitations were the prime motivation to explore the possibility of financially viable remediation technology nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi gained widespread acceptance as a preferred nanomaterial for remediation of soil and groundwater ahmadi et al 2017 azari et al 2015 pang et al 2019 given its broader reactivity toward various contaminants including halogenated compounds and heavy metals the use of nanomaterials for environmental remediation gained acceptance in europe and the united states chen et al 2017 many studies showed the use of nzvi for remediation of heavy metals like pb ii kim et al 2013 liu et al 2015 ponder et al 2000 zhang et al 2011b hg ii amiri et al 2017 liu et al 2014 as iii liu et al 2016 cr vi dong et al 2017 ponder et al

2010 and a variety of other groundwater pollutants such as tetracycline chen et al 2011b metronidazole fang et al 2011 nitrate zhang et al 2011a and de coloration of dyes shu et al 2010 shu et al 2007 from the water body due to its controllable atomic size rich open surface sites a faster rate of adsorption high reduction capacity high efficiency better injectability into aquifers and low economic and environmental costs nzvi makes for an ideal alternative material for the removal of heavy metal ions and other pollutants from contaminated water boparai et al 2011 yan et al 2010 despite the numerous advantages of nzvi it has some limitations unfortunately the immediate utilization of nzvi is limited due to its small particle size which reacts with surrounding media and agglomerates the coalescing property of nzvi reduces the reactivity and restricts its resulting in poor nanoparticle dispersion in the polluted media grieger et al 2010 o carroll et al 2013 often the stable support material is used to minimize this issue vilardi et al 2019 for example nzvi can be stabilized by incorporating a supporting material that prevents the particle agglomeration and retains the nanoparticle s sorption potential pang et al 2020 such an approach helps overcome disadvantages such as faster loss of nzvi during water and wastewater li et al 2007 üzüm et al 2009 zhang et al 2011a in the past various researchers investigated adsorbents supported by stable media shouman et al 2019 vilardi et al 2021 vilardi and verdone 2020 various supporting materials such as a resin shi et al 2011 silica zhan et al 2008 kaolinite üzüm et al 2009 zeolite kim et al 2013 pillared clay zhang et al 2011a montmorillonite bhowmick et al 2014 zhan et al 2008 rectorite yuan et al 2016 and bentonite chen et al 2011a sheng et al 2014 have been effectively incorporated in the nzvi material for better dispersibility of nzvi particles in this research we synthesized an efficient composite adsorbent using red mud as a supporting media for nzvi to study the removal of hg2 from aqueous solution red mud is a waste product produced by alumina industries genç fuhrman et al 2004 saini 2004 management of red mud in alumina industries is challenging as it involves environmental and economic issues sahu et al 2015 unique properties of red mud such as high mechanical and chemical stability and structural properties can be efficiently and sustainably used as a stable supporting medium for creating a novel composite material sahu et al 2010 a perusal of existing literature suggests that to date the red mud adsorbent and its application for removal of hg2 from aqueous solutions have not yet been investigated a few studies successfully used red mud alone to remove arsenic or chlorophenols but not in combination with the nzvi in this research we present for the first time the application of nzvi incorporated red mud to remove hg2 from aqueous solutions toward that end the primary objectives of this study are to 1 synthesize characterize and apply the novel and stable rm nzvi composite to remove hg2 from aqueous solutions 2 determine hg2 removal efficiency of laboratory synthesized rm nzvi composite from aqueous solutions and 3 illustrate the fundamental understanding of the adsorption reduction mechanism of hg2 by rm nzvi 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and

small amount of ca2 and mg2 analytical grade chemicals were used in performing all the experiments chemicals such as ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o cas 10025 77 1 and sodium borohydride nabh4

of hg2 1000 ppm was prepared by adding 1 71 g of hg no3 2 h2o in 1 l ultrapure water the experimental solution at various concentrations was prepared from the stock solution by serial dilutions 2 2 preparation of rm nzvi composite material the rm nzvi and nzvi were prepared by the reducing ferric iron fe3 by nabh4 in liquid phase with and without red mud the reduction of fe3 can be expressed as

ethanol mix v v red mud 4 g was added to the solution and stirred vigorously for one hour in the presence of atmospheric nitrogen rapid stirring facilitates excellent mixing of the red mud babaei et al 2015 freshly prepared 100 ml of 1 61 m nabh4 solution was added at 20 30 drops per minute the solution was continuously stirred for a complete reduction of fe3 in the solution until black solids were observed the solid material thus obtained was separated by centrifugation and washed three times with the water alcohol solution the solid material was vacuum oven dried for 12 h at 70 c the materials nzvi and rm nzvi were kept in an airtight brown bottle until they were used 2 3 adsorption experiments series of batch experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 2 c using a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml hg2 solution and 10 g of rm nzvi composite material dilute hcl and naoh 0 10 mol dm 3 solution was used to adjust the ph the solution was continuously stirred using a rotary shaker at specific reaction time intervals suspension s solid and liquid phase were isolated by centrifugation 4000 rpm 10 min and the concentration of residual hg2 solution was determined by

nzvi as illustrated in fig 1a b and c it is clear from fig 1a that the nzvi particles were aggregated and had a roughly globular size aggregation of nzvi particles could be attributed to the magnetic dipole interactions once the red mud is introduced a significant reduction in rm nzvi particle aggregation is evidenced as shown in fig 1b other studies reported similar results of reduced agglomeration when nzvi was incorporated with kaolin as a supporting media for the removal of cu ii and co ii from aqueous solutions üzüm et al 2009 adsorption of aqueous phase hg2 led to significantly larger rm nzvi nanoparticles fig 1c this behavior could be attributed to the redox reaction between hg ii and fe0 resulting in co precipitation of hg2 and fe3 on the material s exterior manning et al 2007 the corresponding eds spectrum of fesem showed the composition of fe 65 25 o 34 75 in nzvi and no prominent peaks of other elements were detected fig 1a whereas in rm nzvi 64 49 of fe and 35 51 of o were detected fig 1b there was also a change in the intensity of peaks equivalent to fe 0 this observation showed that the incorporation of red mud prevents the accumulation of nzvi fig 1c showed the eds spectrum of the hg2 loaded rm nzvi which consisted of 52 26 of fe 40 88 of o and 6 86 of hg2 the presence of cu peaks was due to the presence of the copper grid table 1 presents the bet brunauer emmett teller surface area pore diameters and pore volume of red mud nzvi and rm nzvi red mud and nzvi adsorbent have the bet surface area of 12 33 m2 g 1 and 62 75 m2 g 1 with the pore size diameter 3 40 and 3 11 nm and pore volume of 0 12 cm3 g 1 and 0 44 cm3 g 1 respectively the incorporation of red mud as a supporting material onto nzvi has significantly increased the surface area pore size diameter and pore volume to 111 59 m2 g 1 3 82 nm and 0 49 cm3 g 1 respectively compare to the values obtained for pure nzvi nanoparticles these values are much higher after modification numerous mesopores and macropores exist in the rm nzvi surface due to the more dispersed iron phases covered the surface of the red mud materials the increase in the rm nzvi composite s surface area resulted in the enhanced removal efficiency of hg2 table 2 shows the summaries of the specific surface areas of nzvi modified with different materials fig 2 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of red mud nzvi and rm nzvi the morphology and arrangement of rm nzvi was characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem jeol 3010 japan as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3a that the nzvi and the red mud were firmly attached forming a composite rm nzvi the nanoparticles of iron were spread uniformly in the matrix of the red mud fig 3b shows a dense core containing a single particle surrounded by a thin shell the depths of the shell and core were measured as 3 15 and 32 215 nm respectively the particle size distribution histogram of rm nzvi revealed the mean particle size of 45 nm as shown in fig 3c fig 3d shows ultrafine fe0 crystals with lattice fringes of 0 17 nm and 0 13 nm that corresponds to lattice planes of 110 and 200 respectively representing nano fe0 the absence of periodic lattice fringes could be due to the shell s speckle contrast indicating the amorphous shell layer the saed pattern of the core area fig 3d represents a diffused ring pattern showing 110 and 200 rings which indicates the presence of a body centered cubic bcc structure metal s chemical state on the surface of rm nzvi was analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps esca 2000 vg micromesh spectrometer shown in fig 4 fig 4a represents the rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi surface profiles it was observed that the peaks are due to the presence of iron fe 2p and oxygen o 1 s on the surface of rm nzvi but there is an additional peak corresponding to hg 4f in hg loaded rm nzvi composite fig 4b represents the enlarged view of the fe 2p core level the peak at 713 6 ev matches the fe 2p3 2 and the peak at 726 9 ev corresponds to the fe 2p1 2 these matching peaks are due to iron oxide or oxyhydroxide phases in both rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi samples wang et al 2015 there is a difference of 13 3 ev in the binding energy between fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 spin orbit levels these results indicate that the iron oxide layer in feo feooh and fe3o4 envelops the surface of rm nzvi when tem and xps results were further corroborated they indicated a thin layer of oxidized iron surrounding the metallic iron core also the fresh rm nzvi yield a small peak at 706 7 ev binding energy indicating the presence of zero valent iron fe 0 2p3 2 sun et al 2006 the presence of two peaks with binding energies of 99 9 ev and 103 14 ev in hg loaded rm nzvi were allocated to 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 respectively corresponding to hg 0 component fig 4c sasmaz et al 2012 the presence of none of the other valence states of hg was observed fig 4d shows the de convoluted xps spectrum of the o 1 s in the rm nzvi which gives three peaks at 530 66 531 66 and 533 20 ev equivalent to oxide oxygen o2 adsorbed water h2o and hydroxyl groups oh respectively x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffractometer philip s x pert shows the xrd patterns of the nzvi rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi in the 2θ range of 20 85 fig 5 for nzvi the three characteristic peaks that appear at 2θ value 45 86 65 09 and 82 85 correspond to the lattice planes of 110 200 and 211 respectively jcpds no 36 0696 clearly demonstrating the presence of fe0 shi et al 2011 in the rm nzvi the diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ value 29 15 38 17 40 69 54 45 67 47 69 10 and 77 09 correspond to the lattice planes of 104 110 113 116 214 300 and 1010 respectively showing the presence of fe2o3 wang et al 2020 similarly the peaks at 40 69 and 59 18 correspond to the lattice plane 113 and 122 individually suggesting fe3o4 furthermore the diffraction peak at 2θ value 45 86 in rm nzvi shows the existence of fe0 thus the diffraction peaks of fe2o3 fe3o4 and fe0 observed in rm nzvi suggest that iron oxides from the red mud had coated over the fe0 surface resulting in the formation of a core shell like structure comparison of diffraction peaks of hg loaded rm nzvi with rm nzvi suggest that the fe0 peak reduced or disappeared entirely because of the redox reaction of rm nzvi and hg2 where rm nzvi particles acted as a reductant and oxidized the fe0 to fe2o3 fe3o4 additionally the peak intensity increased significantly for fe2o3 fe3o4 in hg loaded rm nzvi moreover a new peak appears in the 2θ value of 62 73 in hg loaded rm nzvi corresponding to the lattice plane 220 for the metallic hg0 which confirmed the reduction of hg2 on the rm nzvi surface ojea jiménez et al 2012 it is clear from the x ray diffraction analysis that the iron oxides gradually formed when rm nzvi is reduced other researchers report similar results with starch and surfactant modified zeolite or resin as a supporting media for nzvi he and zhao 2005 li et al 2007 ftir data for nzvi rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi were obtained from the ftir spectrophotometer rx i perkin elmer corporation usa and observed the range of 4000 400 cm 1 as shown in fig 6 the ftir data of nzvi showed the peaks at 3320 1558 1272 850 660 and 452 cm 1 the band at 3320 cm 1 was observed because of the weak stretching vibration of surface hydroxyl groups salama et al 2015 the bands at 1558 and 1272 cm 1 were due to oh stretching of ethanol used in preparing the sample furthermore the weak peaks at 850 660 and 452 cm 1 in the nzvi were caused by iron oxides on the surface which corroborated with the nzvi ftir spectra zhang et al 2011b the ftir data of rm nzvi showed two strong peaks at 1334 cm 1 and 976 cm 1 equivalent to the oh stretching of lepidocrocite γ feooh formation on some fe0 surfaces andrade et al 2009 and feo stretching of fe2o3 or fe3o4 respectively the information obtained from the ftir provided further evidence that the iron oxides covered the fe0 and formed a core shell like structure the blue curve from fig 6 shows the ftir spectrum of the hg loaded rm nzvi the shifting of characteristic bands with reduced intensity was observed compared to the rm nzvi indicating the binding of mercury on the surface of rm nzvi 3 2 parametric study of the adsorption process 3 2 1 effect of ph ph dependent adsorption behavior of hg2 onto rm nzvi was investigated in the ph range of 2 to 10 fig 7a experiments were conducted at room temperature using 2 g of rm nzvi and 100 ml of 10 mg l 1 hg2 solution the hg2 solution s ph was adjusted using hcl and naoh 0 10 mol dm 3 and measured with a ph meter phan lab india results indicate that ph affected the hg2 percent removal efficiency removal efficiency gradually increased to 96 with the increase in ph up to 5 beyond this ph ph 5 10 the removal efficiency significantly decreased the zero point charge phzpc of rm nzvi was found to be 4 6 when the ph phzpc the surface of rm nzvi become positively charged and when the ph phzpc the surface became negatively charged theoretically the hg ii solution s ph affected the speciation of hg2 ions in solution based on the solution ph the hg ii ions take various forms including hg2 hg oh hg oh 2 and hg oh 3 puanngam and unob 2008 at ph 4 hg2 cations were the dominant species whereas at ph 4 the dominant species were hg oh hg oh 2 and hg oh 3 fig 7a indicates that the removal percentage increased with a decrease in ph ph phpzc notionally when the ph increased ph phpzc the adsorbent s surface became negatively charged due to deprotonation thus more functional groups would be available resulting in high adsorption however at higher ph the dominant species of hg ii are hg oh hg oh 2 and hg oh 3 which have higher mobility due to smaller effective size sánchez polo and rivera utrilla 2002 again when the ph increased from ph 5 to ph 10 the removal percentage decreased with the increase in ph iron oxide precipitated to form the ferrous hydroxide which was deposited on the surface of rm nzvi and thus covered the active sites to reduce the adsorption rate 3 2 2 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics the effect of contact time on overall removal of hg2 was evaluated by conducting the adsorption experiment at room temperature using 10 mg l 1 of mercury solution 2 g of rm nzvi adjusted to ph of 5 the effect of contact time on adsorptive removal of hg2 by rm nzvi and rm nzvi demonstrated that the adsorption of hg2 on rm nzvi and rm nzvi increases with the increase of contact time fig 7b the rapid adsorption of hg2 at the initial stage 0 60 min occurred due to a considerable number of empty binding sites at the exterior surface of the rm nzvi adsorbent subsequently hg ii uptake slowed down when the adsorption started at the adsorbent s interior surface after initial adsorption there may be a repulsive force between the solute molecules present on the solid and bulk phases resulting in slower adsorption massoudinejad et al 2015 however after 60 min the binding sites were exhausted and reduced the adsorption capacity thus 60 min appears to be the optimum equilibrium time for adsorption the adsorption kinetics parameters for removing hg2 on rm nzvi and rm nzvi individually are shown in table 3 an excellent correlation between contact time and removal of hg2 exists with correlation coefficient r2 values being 0 98 0 98 and 0 99 for the adsorbents rm nzvi and rm nzvi respectively adsorption kinetics follows a pseudo first order model signifying that the adsorption occurs at the interface and depends on the relative abundance of active sites present on the adsorbents surface babaei et al 2016 kakavandi et al 2016 among the three adsorbents studied individually to remove hg2 rm nzvi has the maximum removal capacity of 43 41 mg g 1 at 60 min the elovich equation has been widely used in adsorption kinetics which describes the chemical adsorption mechanism and gives a good correlation for adsorption of adsorbate on highly heterogeneous adsorbent surface in this study the correlation coefficients for elovich equation is lower than the pseudo first order equation and thus elovich equation does not predict any definite mechanism between the adsorbent and adsorbate but it is useful in describing adsorption on highly heterogeneous adsorbents 3 2 3 effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherms the effect of initial metal ion concentration hg ii ions adsorption by rm nzvi nanoparticles was studied in batch experiments using different initial hg ii concentrations of 1 3 5 7 10 15 20 35 40 50 60 and 70 mg l 1 the equilibrium uptake of the adsorbent was observed increasing gradually with an increasing initial concentration of hg ii ions probably due to higher interaction between the hg ii ions and sequestering sites present on the surface of the adsorbent the equilibrium adsorption isotherm study was shown in fig 8 on fitting with the experimental data the values of the parameters obtained were shortened in table 4 it is clear from the adsorption data that hg2 could be best fitted with the langmuir isotherm model with r2 value 0 99 as compared to the r2 value of redlich peterson and freundlich isotherms the basic assumption of the langmuir adsorption isotherm is based on the monolayer coverage of the adsorbate on the surface of adsorbent which is an indication of the fact that the adsorption of hg2 on to rm nzvi generates a monolayer formation sahu et al 2015 on comparing the adsorption capacity of rm nzvi nzvi and rm adsorbent nanoparticles rm nzvi nanocomposite show maximum adsorption capacity of 94 58 mg g 1 the results indirected that the hg2 adsorption affinity was remarkably improved by using rm as supportive material for nzvi a comparison of removal efficiency and ph of nzvi adsorbents modified with different material were summarized in the table 5 3 2 4 regeneration and reusability of rm nzvi for the commercial applications regeneration and reusability of the adsorbent are crucial factors for evaluating the adsorbent potential in this study regeneration of rm nzvi was evaluated by taking 1 g of hg2 loaded rm nzvi nanocomposite in 50 ml of several desorbing agents such as water edta 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m and hno3 0 1 m and stirred for 2 h as shown in fig 9 a edta shows the best results for the regeneration of the nanocomposite materials as compared to water hcl and hno3 the reusability of the desorbed adsorbent was evaluated through five successive cycles and after each cycle of adsorption at optimum condition desorption was carried and the results is shown in fig 9 b the reusability result shows that the re adsorption percentage of rm nzvi decreases with increase the number of cycle and the maximum re adsorption percentage of hg2 takes place in cycle 1 that is 94 2 which might be due to the surface corrosion and iron ions dissolution which reduced the active sites on rm nzvi overall these results confirmed that the prepared nanocomposite material can be used efficiently for the remediation of hg2 from water 3 3 ion selectivity generally all industrial waste water contains various cationic species which may be affect the adsorption capacity by covering the surface binding sites of the adsorbent thus the ion selectivity of rm nzvi was studied by taking 10 mg l 1 aqueous solution containing various commonly coexisting metal ions i e k hg2 zn2 mg2 ca2 pb2 cr3 cd2 and cu2 as shown in fig 10 rm nzvi showed very specific selectivity to adsorb hg2 96 24 in the presence of all other competitive ions this distinctive selectivity is attributed to the well matched binding energy of the rm nzvi and hg2 3 4 mechanism of hg ii removal by rm nzvi the xps characterization shows that the rm nzvi composite has a core shell structure further characterization using ftir and xrd analysis indicated iron oxide and iron hydroxide on the rm nzvi surface the disappearance of the diffraction peak of zero valent iron and the increase in the peak intensity of fe2o3 fe3o4 in the xrd spectra of hg loaded rm nzvi indicated that fe0 was oxidized by hg2 to form iron oxide the specific diffraction peak of hg0 situated at 2θ value 62 73 in hg loaded rm nzvi further confirmed the reduction of hg2 to hg0 by rm nzvi the standard reduction potential of hg2 hg0 e0 h 0 86 v is higher more positive than that of fe2 fe0 e0 h 0 44 v suggesting electrochemical reduction of hg2 to hg0 the oxidation of fe0 into fe2 and fe3 increased the iron oxide content leading to more hg2 being adsorbed on the surface of the rm nzvi which was subsequently converted into mercury oxides other researchers reported similar results in their study of adsorption of hg2 and pb2 by using ostrich bone ash oba as an adsorbent supported by nzvi amiri et al 2017 the authors attributed the reddish brown color of composite oba nzvi to the fast reduction of pb2 and hg2 to pb0 and hg0 on the surface of oba nzvi respectively with the simultaneous oxidation of fe0 to fe2 observation of the xps spectra shows a direct contrast between the fresh rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi a virgin rm nzvi has a small peak at 706 7 ev signifying the presence of zero valent iron fe0 2p3 2 which is absent in the hg loaded rm nzvi li et al 2007 the missing metallic iron peaks in the hg loaded rm nzvi suggest that surface corrosion might have occurred again the xps spectra of hg loaded rm nzvi shown in fig 4c showed two peaks for hg0 with binding energies of 99 9 ev 4f7 2 and 103 14 ev 4f5 2 confirming the impregnation of hg2 that was reduced to hg0 via a hg2 fe0 replacement reaction 10 hg 2 aq fe 0 s hg 0 s fe 2 aq the proposed mechanism of adsorption of hg2 by rm nzvi with its twin strategies is depicted in fig 11 below rm nzvi s reactivity and overall performance is contingent upon the way it is processed and actual particle size particle size influences the proportion of atoms on rm nzvi s surface potentially resulting in its ability to adsorb and react with other atoms and molecules until charge stabilization occurs the proposed mechanism illustrated above is specific to the nzvi particles investigated for the removal of hg2 given the variation in the rm nzvi there is a slight change in the removal mechanism expected for example unlike the proposed mechanism of sorptive reductive removal of hg2 by rm nzvi discussed above other researchers have postulated that hg2 reduced by rm nzvi to hg0 refer to reaction 10 quickly partitions between the aqueous phase and gaseous phase owing to its low solubility with henry s law constant values in the range of 376 391 l atm mol 1 vernon and bonzongo 2014 additionally dissolved oxygen in the aqueous solution could also oxidize the rm nzvi particles leading to the formation of fe2 which will eventually produce hg0 upon further oxidation the reactions below illustrate this mechanism 11 hg 2 fe 2 hg fe 3 12 hg fe 2 hg 0 g fe 3 adsorption and volatilization are the primary mechanisms for removing hg2 by rm nzvi with volatilization accounting for nearly 10 of the total removal irrespective of the size of rm nzvi vernon and bonzongo 2014 as such the volatilization of hg is not a predominant mechanism for the removal of hg2 again not all nzvi is made equal depending on how nzvi is processed the particles can differ in their structure and reactivity which subsequently affects their removal efficiency for example a study showed that removal efficiencies vary across different nzvis procured from different vendors clearly indicating that the processing of nzvi affects their removal efficiency gil díaz et al 2017 in this study the authors investigated the removal of as and hg in brownfield soil using commercially available nzvis such as nanofer 25s rnip and rnip d showing that both rnip and rnip d exhibited 10 13 better removal efficiency for hg compared to removal by nanofer 25s additionally supporting media the effect on thermal stability and mechanical strength also need to be accounted for in discussions of hg2 removal by the mechanism of rm nzvi 4 environmental implications the environmental implications of this research work are utilization of the industrial by product red mud for the treatment of groundwater and industrial waste water containing heavy metals red mud is a serious problem to the environment because of its chemical composition and the amount generated every year red mud is disposed as slurry or dry or semidry material in red mud ponds red mud is highly alkaline in nature and the process of storage is not free of problems which seepage into underground water and pollutes the water also the industrial waste water containing heavy metals pose major environmental problems worldwide because of their toxicity and the wastewater discharged to ponds and rivers from industries without treatment which pollute the surface water and groundwater therefore in this research we used red mud modified with nzvi as an adsorbent rm nzvi for the removal of hg2 heavy metals and found that the novel adsorbent materials significantly adsorbed the heavy metal which has two environmental benefits firstly utilization of red mud can reduce the underground water contamination and secondly the adsorbent materials rm nzvi treat the surface water and ground water from heavy metals contamination the rm nzvi composite materials provide an environmentally harmless technology that poses no risk to the environment hence the rm nzvi composite provides a new and competitive option for groundwater remediation 5 conclusions in this study the rm nzvi composite was successfully synthesized by the sodium borohydride reduction method the rm nzvi demonstrated maximum removal capacity for hg2 from aqueous solutions red mud was used as a supporting material that enhanced rm nzvi s reactivity and reduced the aggregation of the nzvi the surface area and pore volume of the resulting rm nzvi was found to 111 59 m2 g 1 and 0 156 cm3 g 1 respectively the percent removal of hg2 increased with a subsequent increase in ph from 1 to 5 further an increase in ph from 5 to 10 leads to a decrease in percent removal of hg2 the results of xps and microscopic analysis provided evidence of a core shell structure in rm nzvi where a thin layer of amorphous iron oxide encapsulates the fe0 core the mechanism for removing hg2 from aqueous solution using rm nzvi involves two primary processes adsorption and reduction the adsorption primarily occurs on the surface of rm nzvi which subsequently reduced to fe0 from the characterization techniques it was observed that the removal of hg2 initially by rapid physical adsorption followed by a reduction of hg2 to hg0 the rm nzvi nanocomposite showed maximum adsorption capacity of 94 58 mg g 1 and followed langmuir isotherm model with r2 value 0 99 additionally future studies are planned to investigate the sorptive reductive removal of mercury from industrial wastewater and surface water using rm nzvi composite novelty statement nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been extensively investigated in numerous studies for the remediation of groundwater and other environmental applications but due to its lack of durability mechanical strength and agglomeration the application of nzvi is limited to overcome this issue in this present study red mud was loaded on to nzvi as a supporting material and used for the removal of hg2 ions from aqueous solution this study shows that the rm nzvi has not only a great potential to be a good adsorbent for removal of hg ii ions but also provide an outstanding method to minimize the issues of polluted water declaration of competing interest the authors declare

1327,recently nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi particles have been efficiently used in the remediation of many heavy metals yet potential agglomeration and loss of nzvi remain a critical area of research in this study we used red mud as a stable supporting medium to develop red mud modified nzvi to form rm nzvi composite we assessed its sorptive reductive removal of mercury hg2 from aqueous solutions the rm nzvi was synthesized through the reduction of ferric iron by sodium borohydride nabh4 in the presence of red mud morphological characterization of rm nzvi confirmed its diffusion state with lesser aggregation the rm nzvi has the bet surface area pore diameter and pore volume as 111 59 m2g 1 3 82 nm and 0 49 cm3g 1 respectively adsorption of mercury hg2 by rm nzvi exhibits ph dependent behavior with increased removal of hg2 with the increase in ph up to 5 and the removal rate decreased gradually as the ph increased from 5 to 10 extensive characterization of rm nzvi corroborated the evidence that the removal of hg2 was initially by rapid physical adsorption followed by a reduction of hg2 to hg0 the adsorption data were best fitted with langmuir isotherm with r2 correlation coefficient 0 99 with high uptake capacity of 94 58 mg g 1 the novel rm nzvi composite with enhanced sorptive and reductive capacity is an ideal alternative for removing hg2 from

occurring element in the earth s crust and one of the most harmful heavy metals frequently detected in the aqueous environment shetty et al 2019 mercury enters the environment either through natural processes or due to anthropogenic activities natural events through which mercury enters the aqueous environment include volcanic explosions weathering of rock erosion of natural deposits geothermal processes wild forest fires and vaporization from soil and water feng et al 2003 schroeder and munthe 1998 there are myriad anthropogenic sources through which hg ii and its compounds enter the aquatic environment including the uncontrolled and unregulated discharge of effluents from industries such as gold refineries petroleum refineries electroplating leather tanning metal finishing pharmaceuticals industries and runoff from landfills and croplands ma et al 2019 mercury is a non biodegradable heavy metal once released to the environment it can persist for more than a year li and tse 2015 in an aqueous environment mercury tends to bioaccumulate and bioconcentrate in the tissues muscles lipids and livers of aquatic organisms ingestion of mercury contaminated fish could result in severe human health repercussions even at low concentrations including metabolic disruption damage to the nervous system breakdown of the chromosome and paralysis syversen and kaur 2012 given its toxicity the united states environmental protection agency stipulates the maximum contaminant levels mcl concentration for mercury in drinking water as 2 μgl 1 different international regulatory agencies have proposed the permissible limits for mercury as 10 μgl 1 and 1 μgl 1 for surface water and drinking water respectively namasivayam and periasamy 1993 not surprisingly regulatory agencies have implemented stringent regulations that govern the treatment and discharge of effluent containing heavy metals mercury is a pollutant of primary concern and is currently ranked third in the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr just after arsenic and lead kong et al 2019 given its long term persistence and adverse consequences to human health and other living organisms mercury polluted water bodies must be remediated to protect human health and the environment kong et al 2019 currently many technologies exist for the removal of mercury from industrial wastewater with varying efficiencies sowlat et al 2017 techniques such as ion exchange chemical precipitation reduction extraction and chelating resins showed promising results for treating industrial wastewater containing hg2 ions tauanov et al 2018 however these technologies were not economically feasible and often result in a substantial amount of secondary waste streams that need further treatment and disposal power et al 2011 these limitations were the prime motivation to explore the possibility of financially viable remediation technology nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi gained widespread acceptance as a preferred nanomaterial for remediation of soil and groundwater ahmadi et al 2017 azari et al 2015 pang et al 2019 given its broader reactivity toward various contaminants including halogenated compounds and heavy metals the use of nanomaterials for environmental remediation gained acceptance in europe and the united states chen et al 2017 many studies showed the use of nzvi for remediation of heavy metals like pb ii kim et al 2013 liu et al 2015 ponder et al 2000 zhang et al 2011b hg ii amiri et al 2017 liu et al 2014 as iii liu et al 2016 cr vi dong et al 2017 ponder et al

from the water body due to its controllable atomic size rich open surface sites a faster rate of adsorption high reduction capacity high efficiency better injectability into aquifers and low economic and environmental costs nzvi makes for an ideal alternative material for the removal of heavy metal ions and other pollutants from contaminated water boparai et al 2011 yan et al 2010 despite the numerous advantages of nzvi it has some limitations unfortunately the immediate utilization of nzvi is limited due to its small particle size which reacts with surrounding media and agglomerates the coalescing property of nzvi reduces the reactivity and restricts its resulting in poor nanoparticle dispersion in the polluted media grieger et al 2010 o carroll et al 2013 often the stable support material is used to minimize this issue vilardi et al 2019 for example nzvi can be stabilized by incorporating a supporting material that prevents the particle agglomeration and retains the nanoparticle s sorption potential pang et al 2020 such an approach helps overcome disadvantages such as faster loss of nzvi during water and wastewater li et al 2007 üzüm et al 2009 zhang et al 2011a in the past various researchers investigated adsorbents supported by stable media shouman et al 2019 vilardi et al 2021 vilardi and verdone 2020 various supporting materials such as a resin shi et al

chen et al 2011a sheng et al 2014 have been effectively incorporated in the nzvi material for better dispersibility of nzvi particles in this research we synthesized an efficient composite adsorbent using red mud as a supporting media for nzvi to study the removal of hg2 from aqueous solution red mud is a waste product produced by alumina industries genç fuhrman et al 2004 saini 2004 management of red mud in alumina industries is challenging as it involves environmental and economic issues sahu et al 2015 unique properties of red mud such as high mechanical and chemical stability and structural properties can be efficiently and sustainably used as a stable supporting medium for creating a novel composite material sahu et al 2010 a perusal of existing literature suggests that to date the red mud adsorbent and its application for removal of hg2 from aqueous solutions have not yet been investigated a few studies successfully used red mud alone to remove arsenic or chlorophenols but not in combination with the nzvi in this research we present for the first time the application of nzvi incorporated red mud to remove hg2 from aqueous solutions toward that end the primary objectives of this study are to 1 synthesize characterize and apply the novel and stable rm nzvi composite to remove hg2 from aqueous solutions 2 determine hg2 removal efficiency of laboratory synthesized rm nzvi composite from aqueous solutions and 3 illustrate the fundamental understanding of the adsorption reduction mechanism of hg2 by rm nzvi 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals red mud was procured from vedanta alumina ltd located in lanjigarh southern odisha india this alumina refinery is designed using the concept of zero discharge it processes all its waste

small amount of ca2 and mg2 analytical grade chemicals were used in performing all the experiments chemicals such as ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o cas 10025 77 1 and sodium borohydride nabh4

of hg2 1000 ppm was prepared by adding 1 71 g of hg no3 2 h2o in 1 l ultrapure water the experimental solution at various concentrations was prepared from the stock solution by serial dilutions 2 2 preparation of rm nzvi composite material the rm nzvi and nzvi were prepared by the reducing ferric iron fe3 by nabh4 in liquid phase with and without red mud the reduction of fe3 can be expressed as

ethanol mix v v red mud 4 g was added to the solution and stirred vigorously for one hour in the presence of atmospheric nitrogen rapid stirring facilitates excellent mixing of the red mud babaei et al 2015 freshly prepared 100 ml of 1 61 m nabh4 solution was added at 20 30 drops per minute the solution was continuously stirred for a complete reduction of fe3 in the solution until black solids were observed the solid material thus obtained was separated by centrifugation and washed three times with the water alcohol solution the solid material was vacuum oven dried for 12 h at 70 c the materials nzvi and rm nzvi were kept in an airtight brown bottle until they were used 2 3 adsorption experiments series of batch experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 2 c using a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml hg2 solution and 10 g of rm nzvi composite material dilute hcl and naoh 0 10 mol dm 3 solution was used to adjust the ph the solution was continuously stirred using a rotary shaker at specific reaction time intervals suspension s solid and liquid phase were isolated by centrifugation 4000 rpm 10 min and the concentration of residual hg2 solution was determined by

nzvi as illustrated in fig 1a b and c it is clear from fig 1a that the nzvi particles were aggregated and had a roughly globular size aggregation of nzvi particles could be attributed to the magnetic dipole interactions once the red mud is introduced a significant reduction in rm nzvi particle aggregation is evidenced as shown in fig 1b other studies reported similar results of reduced agglomeration when nzvi was incorporated with kaolin as a supporting media for the removal of cu ii and co ii from aqueous solutions üzüm et al 2009 adsorption of aqueous phase hg2 led to significantly larger rm nzvi nanoparticles fig 1c this behavior could be attributed to the redox reaction between hg ii and fe0 resulting in co precipitation of hg2 and fe3 on the material s exterior manning et al 2007 the corresponding eds spectrum of fesem showed the composition of fe 65 25 o 34 75 in nzvi and no prominent peaks of other elements were detected fig 1a whereas in rm nzvi 64 49 of fe and 35 51 of o were detected fig 1b there was also a change in the intensity of peaks equivalent to fe 0 this observation showed that the incorporation of red mud prevents the accumulation of nzvi fig 1c showed the eds spectrum of the hg2 loaded rm nzvi which consisted of 52 26 of fe 40 88 of o and 6 86 of hg2 the presence of cu peaks was due to the presence of the copper grid table 1 presents the bet brunauer emmett teller surface area pore diameters and pore volume of red mud nzvi and rm nzvi red mud and nzvi adsorbent have the bet surface area of 12 33 m2 g 1 and 62 75 m2 g 1 with the pore size diameter 3 40 and 3 11 nm and pore volume of 0 12 cm3 g 1 and 0 44 cm3 g 1 respectively the incorporation of red mud as a supporting material onto nzvi has significantly increased the surface area pore size diameter and pore volume to 111 59 m2 g 1 3 82 nm and 0 49 cm3 g 1 respectively compare to the values obtained for pure nzvi nanoparticles these values are much higher after modification numerous mesopores and macropores exist in the rm nzvi surface due to the more dispersed iron phases covered the surface of the red mud materials the increase in the rm nzvi composite s surface area resulted in the enhanced removal efficiency of hg2 table 2 shows the summaries of the specific surface areas of nzvi modified with different materials fig 2 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of red mud nzvi and rm nzvi the morphology and arrangement of rm nzvi was characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem jeol 3010 japan as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3a that the nzvi and the red mud were firmly attached forming a composite rm nzvi the nanoparticles of iron were spread uniformly in the matrix of the red mud fig 3b shows a dense core containing a single particle surrounded by a thin shell the depths of the shell and core were measured as 3 15 and 32 215 nm respectively the particle size distribution histogram of rm nzvi revealed the mean particle size of 45 nm as shown in fig 3c fig 3d shows ultrafine fe0 crystals with lattice fringes of 0 17 nm and 0 13 nm that corresponds to lattice planes of 110 and 200 respectively representing nano fe0 the absence of periodic lattice fringes could be due to the shell s speckle contrast indicating the amorphous shell layer the saed pattern of the core area fig 3d represents a diffused ring pattern showing 110 and 200 rings which indicates the presence of a body centered cubic bcc structure metal s chemical state on the surface of rm nzvi was analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps esca 2000 vg micromesh spectrometer shown in fig 4 fig 4a represents the rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi surface profiles it was observed that the peaks are due to the presence of iron fe 2p and oxygen o 1 s on the surface of rm nzvi but there is an additional peak corresponding to hg 4f in hg loaded rm nzvi composite fig 4b represents the enlarged view of the fe 2p core level the peak at 713 6 ev matches the fe 2p3 2 and the peak at 726 9 ev corresponds to the fe 2p1 2 these matching peaks are due to iron oxide or oxyhydroxide phases in both rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi samples wang et al 2015 there is a difference of 13 3 ev in the binding energy between fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 spin orbit levels these results indicate that the iron oxide layer in feo feooh and fe3o4 envelops the surface of rm nzvi when tem and xps results were further corroborated they indicated a thin layer of oxidized iron surrounding the metallic iron core also the fresh rm nzvi yield a small peak at 706 7 ev binding energy indicating the presence of zero valent iron fe 0 2p3 2 sun et al 2006 the presence of two peaks with binding energies of 99 9 ev and 103 14 ev in hg loaded rm nzvi were allocated to 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 respectively corresponding to hg 0 component fig 4c sasmaz et al 2012 the presence of none of the other valence states of hg was observed fig 4d shows the de convoluted xps spectrum of the o 1 s in the rm nzvi which gives three peaks at 530 66 531 66 and 533 20 ev equivalent to oxide oxygen o2 adsorbed water h2o and hydroxyl groups oh respectively x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffractometer philip s x pert shows the xrd patterns of the nzvi rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi in the 2θ range of 20 85 fig 5 for nzvi the three characteristic peaks that appear at 2θ value 45 86 65 09 and 82 85 correspond to the lattice planes of 110 200 and 211 respectively jcpds no 36 0696 clearly demonstrating the presence of fe0 shi et al 2011 in the rm nzvi the diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ value 29 15 38 17 40 69 54 45 67 47 69 10 and 77 09 correspond to the lattice planes of 104 110 113 116 214 300 and 1010 respectively showing the presence of fe2o3 wang et al 2020 similarly the peaks at 40 69 and 59 18 correspond to the lattice plane 113 and 122 individually suggesting fe3o4 furthermore the diffraction peak at 2θ value 45 86 in rm nzvi shows the existence of fe0 thus the diffraction peaks of fe2o3 fe3o4 and fe0 observed in rm nzvi suggest that iron oxides from the red mud had coated over the fe0 surface resulting in the formation of a core shell like structure comparison of diffraction peaks of hg loaded rm nzvi with rm nzvi suggest that the fe0 peak reduced or disappeared entirely because of the redox reaction of rm nzvi and hg2 where rm nzvi particles acted as a reductant and oxidized the fe0 to fe2o3 fe3o4 additionally the peak intensity increased significantly for fe2o3 fe3o4 in hg loaded rm nzvi moreover a new peak appears in the 2θ value of 62 73 in hg loaded rm nzvi corresponding to the lattice plane 220 for the metallic hg0 which confirmed the reduction of hg2 on the rm nzvi surface ojea jiménez et al 2012 it is clear from the x ray diffraction analysis that the iron oxides gradually formed when rm nzvi is reduced other researchers report similar results with starch and surfactant modified zeolite or resin as a supporting media for nzvi he and zhao 2005 li et al 2007 ftir data for nzvi rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi were obtained from the ftir spectrophotometer rx i perkin elmer corporation usa and observed the range of 4000 400 cm 1 as shown in fig 6 the ftir data of nzvi showed the peaks at 3320 1558 1272 850 660 and 452 cm 1 the band at 3320 cm 1 was observed because of the weak stretching vibration of surface hydroxyl groups salama et al 2015 the bands at 1558 and 1272 cm 1 were due to oh stretching of ethanol used in preparing the sample furthermore the weak peaks at 850 660 and 452 cm 1 in the nzvi were caused by iron oxides on the surface which corroborated with the nzvi ftir spectra zhang et al 2011b the ftir data of rm nzvi showed two strong peaks at 1334 cm 1 and 976 cm 1 equivalent to the oh stretching of lepidocrocite γ feooh formation on some fe0 surfaces andrade et al 2009 and feo stretching of fe2o3 or fe3o4 respectively the information obtained from the ftir provided further evidence that the iron oxides covered the fe0 and formed a core shell like structure the blue curve from fig 6 shows the ftir spectrum of the hg loaded rm nzvi the shifting of characteristic bands with reduced intensity was observed compared to the rm nzvi indicating the binding of mercury on the surface of rm nzvi 3 2 parametric study of the adsorption process 3 2 1 effect of ph ph dependent adsorption behavior of hg2 onto rm nzvi was investigated in the ph range of 2 to 10 fig 7a experiments were conducted at room temperature using 2 g of rm nzvi and 100 ml of 10 mg l 1 hg2 solution the hg2 solution s ph was adjusted using hcl and naoh 0 10 mol dm 3 and measured with a ph meter phan lab india results indicate that ph affected the hg2 percent removal efficiency removal efficiency gradually increased to 96 with the increase in ph up to 5 beyond this ph ph 5 10 the removal efficiency significantly decreased the zero point charge phzpc of rm nzvi was found to be 4 6 when the ph phzpc the surface of rm nzvi become positively charged and when the ph phzpc the surface became negatively charged theoretically the hg ii solution s ph affected the speciation of hg2 ions in solution based on the solution ph the hg ii ions take various forms including hg2 hg oh hg oh 2 and hg oh 3 puanngam and unob 2008 at ph 4 hg2 cations were the dominant species whereas at ph 4 the dominant species were hg oh hg oh 2 and hg oh 3 fig 7a indicates that the removal percentage increased with a decrease in ph ph phpzc notionally when the ph increased ph phpzc the adsorbent s surface became negatively charged due to deprotonation thus more functional groups would be available resulting in high adsorption however at higher ph the dominant species of hg ii are hg oh hg oh 2 and hg oh 3 which have higher mobility due to smaller effective size sánchez polo and rivera utrilla 2002 again when the ph increased from ph 5 to ph 10 the removal percentage decreased with the increase in ph iron oxide precipitated to form the ferrous hydroxide which was deposited on the surface of rm nzvi and thus covered the active sites to reduce the adsorption rate 3 2 2 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics the effect of contact time on overall removal of hg2 was evaluated by conducting the adsorption experiment at room temperature using 10 mg l 1 of mercury solution 2 g of rm nzvi adjusted to ph of 5 the effect of contact time on adsorptive removal of hg2 by rm nzvi and rm nzvi demonstrated that the adsorption of hg2 on rm nzvi and rm nzvi increases with the increase of contact time fig 7b the rapid adsorption of hg2 at the initial stage 0 60 min occurred due to a considerable number of empty binding sites at the exterior surface of the rm nzvi adsorbent subsequently hg ii uptake slowed down when the adsorption started at the adsorbent s interior surface after initial adsorption there may be a repulsive force between the solute molecules present on the solid and bulk phases resulting in slower adsorption massoudinejad et al 2015 however after 60 min the binding sites were exhausted and reduced the adsorption capacity thus 60 min appears to be the optimum equilibrium time for adsorption the adsorption kinetics parameters for removing hg2 on rm nzvi and rm nzvi individually are shown in table 3 an excellent correlation between contact time and removal of hg2 exists with correlation coefficient r2 values being 0 98 0 98 and 0 99 for the adsorbents rm nzvi and rm nzvi respectively adsorption kinetics follows a pseudo first order model signifying that the adsorption occurs at the interface and depends on the relative abundance of active sites present on the adsorbents surface babaei et al 2016 kakavandi et al 2016 among the three adsorbents studied individually to remove hg2 rm nzvi has the maximum removal capacity of 43 41 mg g 1 at 60 min the elovich equation has been widely used in adsorption kinetics which describes the chemical adsorption mechanism and gives a good correlation for adsorption of adsorbate on highly heterogeneous adsorbent surface in this study the correlation coefficients for elovich equation is lower than the pseudo first order equation and thus elovich equation does not predict any definite mechanism between the adsorbent and adsorbate but it is useful in describing adsorption on highly heterogeneous adsorbents 3 2 3 effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherms the effect of initial metal ion concentration hg ii ions adsorption by rm nzvi nanoparticles was studied in batch experiments using different initial hg ii concentrations of 1 3 5 7 10 15 20 35 40 50 60 and 70 mg l 1 the equilibrium uptake of the adsorbent was observed increasing gradually with an increasing initial concentration of hg ii ions probably due to higher interaction between the hg ii ions and sequestering sites present on the surface of the adsorbent the equilibrium adsorption isotherm study was shown in fig 8 on fitting with the experimental data the values of the parameters obtained were shortened in table 4 it is clear from the adsorption data that hg2 could be best fitted with the langmuir isotherm model with r2 value 0 99 as compared to the r2 value of redlich peterson and freundlich isotherms the basic assumption of the langmuir adsorption isotherm is based on the monolayer coverage of the adsorbate on the surface of adsorbent which is an indication of the fact that the adsorption of hg2 on to rm nzvi generates a monolayer formation sahu et al 2015 on comparing the adsorption capacity of rm nzvi nzvi and rm adsorbent nanoparticles rm nzvi nanocomposite show maximum adsorption capacity of 94 58 mg g 1 the results indirected that the hg2 adsorption affinity was remarkably improved by using rm as supportive material for nzvi a comparison of removal efficiency and ph of nzvi adsorbents modified with different material were summarized in the table 5 3 2 4 regeneration and reusability of rm nzvi for the commercial applications regeneration and reusability of the adsorbent are crucial factors for evaluating the adsorbent potential in this study regeneration of rm nzvi was evaluated by taking 1 g of hg2 loaded rm nzvi nanocomposite in 50 ml of several desorbing agents such as water edta 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m and hno3 0 1 m and stirred for 2 h as shown in fig 9 a edta shows the best results for the regeneration of the nanocomposite materials as compared to water hcl and hno3 the reusability of the desorbed adsorbent was evaluated through five successive cycles and after each cycle of adsorption at optimum condition desorption was carried and the results is shown in fig 9 b the reusability result shows that the re adsorption percentage of rm nzvi decreases with increase the number of cycle and the maximum re adsorption percentage of hg2 takes place in cycle 1 that is 94 2 which might be due to the surface corrosion and iron ions dissolution which reduced the active sites on rm nzvi overall these results confirmed that the prepared nanocomposite material can be used efficiently for the remediation of hg2 from water 3 3 ion selectivity generally all industrial waste water contains various cationic species which may be affect the adsorption capacity by covering the surface binding sites of the adsorbent thus the ion selectivity of rm nzvi was studied by taking 10 mg l 1 aqueous solution containing various commonly coexisting metal ions i e k hg2 zn2 mg2 ca2 pb2 cr3 cd2 and cu2 as shown in fig 10 rm nzvi showed very specific selectivity to adsorb hg2 96 24 in the presence of all other competitive ions this distinctive selectivity is attributed to the well matched binding energy of the rm nzvi and hg2 3 4 mechanism of hg ii removal by rm nzvi the xps characterization shows that the rm nzvi composite has a core shell structure further characterization using ftir and xrd analysis indicated iron oxide and iron hydroxide on the rm nzvi surface the disappearance of the diffraction peak of zero valent iron and the increase in the peak intensity of fe2o3 fe3o4 in the xrd spectra of hg loaded rm nzvi indicated that fe0 was oxidized by hg2 to form iron oxide the specific diffraction peak of hg0 situated at 2θ value 62 73 in hg loaded rm nzvi further confirmed the reduction of hg2 to hg0 by rm nzvi the standard reduction potential of hg2 hg0 e0 h 0 86 v is higher more positive than that of fe2 fe0 e0 h 0 44 v suggesting electrochemical reduction of hg2 to hg0 the oxidation of fe0 into fe2 and fe3 increased the iron oxide content leading to more hg2 being adsorbed on the surface of the rm nzvi which was subsequently converted into mercury oxides other researchers reported similar results in their study of adsorption of hg2 and pb2 by using ostrich bone ash oba as an adsorbent supported by nzvi amiri et al 2017 the authors attributed the reddish brown color of composite oba nzvi to the fast reduction of pb2 and hg2 to pb0 and hg0 on the surface of oba nzvi respectively with the simultaneous oxidation of fe0 to fe2 observation of the xps spectra shows a direct contrast between the fresh rm nzvi and hg loaded rm nzvi a virgin rm nzvi has a small peak at 706 7 ev signifying the presence of zero valent iron fe0 2p3 2 which is absent in the hg loaded rm nzvi li et al 2007 the missing metallic iron peaks in the hg loaded rm nzvi suggest that surface corrosion might have occurred again the xps spectra of hg loaded rm nzvi shown in fig 4c showed two peaks for hg0 with binding energies of 99 9 ev 4f7 2 and 103 14 ev 4f5 2 confirming the impregnation of hg2 that was reduced to hg0 via a hg2 fe0 replacement reaction 10 hg 2 aq fe 0 s hg 0 s fe 2 aq the proposed mechanism of adsorption of hg2 by rm nzvi with its twin strategies is depicted in fig 11 below rm nzvi s reactivity and overall performance is contingent upon the way it is processed and actual particle size particle size influences the proportion of atoms on rm nzvi s surface potentially resulting in its ability to adsorb and react with other atoms and molecules until charge stabilization occurs the proposed mechanism illustrated above is specific to the nzvi particles investigated for the removal of hg2 given the variation in the rm nzvi there is a slight change in the removal mechanism expected for example unlike the proposed mechanism of sorptive reductive removal of hg2 by rm nzvi discussed above other researchers have postulated that hg2 reduced by rm nzvi to hg0 refer to reaction 10 quickly partitions between the aqueous phase and gaseous phase owing to its low solubility with henry s law constant values in the range of 376 391 l atm mol 1 vernon and bonzongo 2014 additionally dissolved oxygen in the aqueous solution could also oxidize the rm nzvi particles leading to the formation of fe2 which will eventually produce hg0 upon further oxidation the reactions below illustrate this mechanism 11 hg 2 fe 2 hg fe 3 12 hg fe 2 hg 0 g fe 3 adsorption and volatilization are the primary mechanisms for removing hg2 by rm nzvi with volatilization accounting for nearly 10 of the total removal irrespective of the size of rm nzvi vernon and bonzongo 2014 as such the volatilization of hg is not a predominant mechanism for the removal of hg2 again not all nzvi is made equal depending on how nzvi is processed the particles can differ in their structure and reactivity which subsequently affects their removal efficiency for example a study showed that removal efficiencies vary across different nzvis procured from different vendors clearly indicating that the processing of nzvi affects their removal efficiency gil díaz et al 2017 in this study the authors investigated the removal of as and hg in brownfield soil using commercially available nzvis such as nanofer 25s rnip and rnip d showing that both rnip and rnip d exhibited 10 13 better removal efficiency for hg compared to removal by nanofer 25s additionally supporting media the effect on thermal stability and mechanical strength also need to be accounted for in discussions of hg2 removal by the mechanism of rm nzvi 4 environmental implications the environmental implications of this research work are utilization of the industrial by product red mud for the treatment of groundwater and industrial waste water containing heavy metals red mud is a serious problem to the environment because of its chemical composition and the amount generated every year red mud is disposed as slurry or dry or semidry material in red mud ponds red mud is highly alkaline in nature and the process of storage is not free of problems which seepage into underground water and pollutes the water also the industrial waste water containing heavy metals pose major environmental problems worldwide because of their toxicity and the wastewater discharged to ponds and rivers from industries without treatment which pollute the surface water and groundwater therefore in this research we used red mud modified with nzvi as an adsorbent rm nzvi for the removal of hg2 heavy metals and found that the novel adsorbent materials significantly adsorbed the heavy metal which has two environmental benefits firstly utilization of red mud can reduce the underground water contamination and secondly the adsorbent materials rm nzvi treat the surface water and ground water from heavy metals contamination the rm nzvi composite materials provide an environmentally harmless technology that poses no risk to the environment hence the rm nzvi composite provides a new and competitive option for groundwater remediation 5 conclusions in this study the rm nzvi composite was successfully synthesized by the sodium borohydride reduction method the rm nzvi demonstrated maximum removal capacity for hg2 from aqueous solutions red mud was used as a supporting material that enhanced rm nzvi s reactivity and reduced the aggregation of the nzvi the surface area and pore volume of the resulting rm nzvi was found to 111 59 m2 g 1 and 0 156 cm3 g 1 respectively the percent removal of hg2 increased with a subsequent increase in ph from 1 to 5 further an increase in ph from 5 to 10 leads to a decrease in percent removal of hg2 the results of xps and microscopic analysis provided evidence of a core shell structure in rm nzvi where a thin layer of amorphous iron oxide encapsulates the fe0 core the mechanism for removing hg2 from aqueous solution using rm nzvi involves two primary processes adsorption and reduction the adsorption primarily occurs on the surface of rm nzvi which subsequently reduced to fe0 from the characterization techniques it was observed that the removal of hg2 initially by rapid physical adsorption followed by a reduction of hg2 to hg0 the rm nzvi nanocomposite showed maximum adsorption capacity of 94 58 mg g 1 and followed langmuir isotherm model with r2 value 0 99 additionally future studies are planned to investigate the sorptive reductive removal of mercury from industrial wastewater and surface water using rm nzvi composite novelty statement nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been extensively investigated in numerous studies for the remediation of groundwater and other environmental applications but due to its lack of durability mechanical strength and agglomeration the application of nzvi is limited to overcome this issue in this present study red mud was loaded on to nzvi as a supporting material and used for the removal of hg2 ions from aqueous solution this study shows that the rm nzvi has not only a great potential to be a good adsorbent for removal of hg ii ions but also provide an outstanding method to minimize the issues of polluted water declaration of competing interest the authors declare

1328,viruses including human pathogenic viruses can persist in water for producing drinking water from surface water via bank filtration natural attenuation capacities and the fate of viruses during the passage of aquatic sediments are of particular interest moreover the increasing frequency of extreme hydrological events necessitate re evaluation of the sustainability and efficacy of processes removing viruses for this purpose we performed bank sediment filtration experiments using a mesocosm in a technical scale experimental facility that simulates a field situation under more tightly controlled conditions we used the bacteriophage ms2 as a surrogate for enteric viruses to study the transport of different viral loads through the bank sediment additionally we simulated a heavy rain event to investigate the re mobilization of initially attached virus particles we quantified the abundance of infectious ms2 phages by plaque assay and the total number of ms2 particles by qpcr also we differentiated pore water concentrations by depths of the sediment column and investigated attachment to the sediment matrix at the end of the individual experimental phases bank filtration over a vertical distance of 80 cm through sandy sediment revealed a virus removal efficiency of 0 8 log10 for total ms2 particles and 1 7 log10 for infectious ms2 particles with an initial phage concentration of 1 84 108 gene copies ml 1 a low load of infectious ms2 1 9 106 plaque forming units ml 1 resulted in a greater removal efficiency 3 0 log10 the proportion of infectious ms2 phages of the total ms2 particle mass steadily decreased over time i e in the course of individual breakthrough curves and with sediment depth the simulated pulse of rainwater caused a front of low ionic strength water which resulted in pronounced phage remobilization the high proportion of infectious ms2 among the detached phages indicated that attachment to the sediment matrix may substantially conserve virus infectivity therefore the re mobilization of previously attached viruses owing to hydrological extremes should be considered in water quality assessment and monitoring schemes keywords virus transport ms2 bank filtration inactivation hydrological extremes climate change 1 introduction bank filtration of river and lake water has proven to be of great value for drinking water production by combining treatment and abstraction at low costs ahmed and marhaba 2017 massmann et al 2004 krauss and griebler 2011 kuehn and mueller 2000 the infiltrating surface water is physically chemically and microbiologically altered during sediment passage and this generally improves water quality jaramillo 2011 at some sites bank filtration plants have been operating for more than 150 years kuehn and mueller 2000 nagy kovács et al 2019 for example in germany the country in europe with most sites of induced bank filtration 9 16 of drinking water is produced in this way gillefalk et al 2018 however if the efficiency of the natural subsurface attenuation processes is insufficient or highly variable bank filtrate may be contaminated with pathogens including viruses schijven et al 2002 tufenkji et al 2002 the contamination of raw and drinking water with pathogens is a widespread source of waterborne disease outbreaks yang et al 2012 previous studies found a range of human enteric viruses at densities of 102 to 103 gc gene copies l 1 in surface waters lodder et al 2010 prevost et al 2015 these were introduced either by wastewater or via surface run off from agricultural land where wastewater and manure were applied fong and lipp 2005 the reduction of pathogenic viruses during bank filtration is of particular interest because compared to most pathogenic bacteria many viruses are more persistent in the aquatic environment it is not rare for viruses to remain infective for more than 100 days in sediment freshwater and sewage fong and lipp 2005 moreover owing to their smaller size viruses may travel longer distances through the porous subsurface as underground physical attenuation processes may be less effective than for bacteria betancourt et al 2014 bition and harvey 1992 viruses have been reported to be transported through subsurface media over distances as far as 1600 m and to a depth of 64 m below the land surface bales et al 1989 for these reasons a comprehensive understanding of the attenuation efficiency of bank filtration particularly for viruses is important for planning sustainable and safe drinking water production this requires addressing the impact of dynamic changes in the hydrological cycle on virus transport and retention including the impact of extended periods of droughts followed by heavy rain events and floods eckert et al 2008 climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in extreme hydrological events including more frequent and extended droughts and heavy rainfall understanding the impact of changes in hydrological conditions on the distribution of pathogens during bank filtration is therefore important for public health sprenger et al 2011 previous studies have already concluded that bank filtrate quality may be compromised by viral contamination induced by extreme precipitation owing both to shorter travel time in the subsurface and to elevated viral contamination in surface water rose et al 2000 sprenger et al 2011 additionally drayna et al 2010 proposed that the re mobilization desorption of formerly attached viruses in sediments can be a relevant process in the contamination of groundwater from infiltrating precipitation variation in the ionic strength of the sediment pore water may exert an important influence on virus attachment detachment and re mobilization landry et al 1979 it is therefore important to understand how heavy rain events causing water with a low ionic strength to percolate through bank sediments affect virus transport although bank filtration has been studied for many years the focus was chiefly on the fate of a variety of chemical pollutants and pathogenic bacteria the transport of pathogenic viruses through aquatic sediment has been less well studied mainly owing to the challenges of virus detection and quantification dash et al 2010 doussan et al 1997 wyn jones and sellwood 2001 moreover studies have so far almost exclusively addressed the infectious viruses i e detection by plaque assay or cell lines suspended and transported in sediment pore water while the transport of those which are no longer infectious has scarcely been addressed however including them provides information on virus inactivation virus removal by irreversible attachment to sediment or decay and virus retardation by attachment and re mobilization loveland et al 1996 limiting research to the study of infectious virus particles may further underestimate the number of viruses involved in aggregation in contrast exclusively addressing total viruses as is currently common with molecular tools misses viral infectivity and inactivation hassard et al 2016 combining and comparing the fate of both the total virus load and the fraction which remains infectious is therefore the most comprehensive approach for elucidating the mechanisms of virus transport during sediment passage the primary objective of the current study was to elucidate the efficacy and contribution of individual natural attenuation processes as viruses travel through aquatic sediment including irreversible attachment retardation attachment and re mobilization inactivation and decay this included in particular quantification of the re mobilization of formerly attached viruses caused by rainwater infiltration to achieve the aims of this study bacteriophage ms2 was used as a surrogate because of its similar size 26 nm and shape icosahedral to enteric viruses especially enteroviruses as well as its similar behavioral characteristics persistence resistance no replication in aquatic environments decay rate in surface water that determine its fate in the subsurface boehm et al 2019 harvey and ryan 2004 jofre et al 2016 pitol et al 2018 two scenarios in the main experiment focused on mimicking the infiltration of heavy viral contamination and a subsequent rainstorm event both scenarios are likely to occur frequently in fairly densely settled areas where bank filtrate is obtained from rivers and lakes that carry treated wastewater e g by upstream discharge from sewage treatment plants or by stormwater overflow from mixed sewers unlike other studies we not only looked at the fate of either total or infectious virus particles suspended in sediment pore water but also evaluated their combined dynamics over space and time and included total and infectious ms2 phages attached to the sediment matrix after each treatment phase i e after the contamination event and after the heavy rain event moreover key physical and chemical parameters i e electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen concentration do ph redox potential and temperature and basic microbial parameters i e adenosine triphosphate concentration atp and total prokaryotic cell counts tcc were monitored in

riverbank and slow sand filtration fig s1 at the german environment agency s field station in berlin marienfelde this is fed by water from a storage pond in which groundwater from which fe and mn were removed through microbial precipitation was exposed to the atmosphere including natural rainfall and sunlight so that natural flora and fauna could develop after a residence time of 2 3 weeks this water entered the slow sand filtration basin mimicking surface water with a ph of 8 0 2 29 replicate measurements and a calculated ionic strength of 13 3 mm selected inorganic hydrochemical parameters

water saturated sand column similar to a lysimeter with a diameter of 113 cm i e corresponding to a surface area of 1 m2 and a height of 130 cm fig 1 was embedded in the slow sand infiltration basin dimensions 10 10 m and fed with surrounding pond water the supernatant i e a water column of 10 cm corresponding to 100 l of water could be connected and disconnected to the surrounding pond water the

supporting layer of 30 cm of gravel as the ratio of the column diameter dcol to the effective particle diameter d10 of the media was far greater than 50 a potential wall effect can be neglected knappett et al 2008 sampling ports for sampling along the flowpath were installed at depths of 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm the system had been in operation for over 10 years sufficient for the establishment of a natural bacterial community degenkolb et al 2018 2 2 pre experiments pre experiments included i batch tests on the inactivation decay of ms2 phages in sterile surface water and water saturated sediment and ii a virus transport experiment in the sediment column with a moderate virus load for the batch tests ms2 was added to filter sterilized 0 22 μm danube river water ph 8 19 ec 401 μs cm 1

47 108 particles ml 1 duplicate sediment samples each water saturated consisted of 17 g dry weight sediment with approximately 3 6 ml of pore water and received an initial total ms2 concentration of 1 52 108 particles ml 1 these samples were incubated at 7 c in the dark for 19 23 days the impact of a moderate virus load on ms2 transport was assessed 2 years before the main experiment also in november and with the same column system a pulse of pond water 200l with a moderate virus load i e a final concentration of 1 9 106 plaque forming units pfu ml 1 of infectious ms2 total amount of infectious ms2 of 3 8 1011 pfu was supplied with flow rate adjusted to a filter velocity of 1 1 m d 1 corresponding to a pore water velocity of 2 2 m d 1 after the pulse the column was re connected to the surrounding pond water just before the pulse solution was completely infiltrated water samples were collected before and after the respective treatments at a high temporal and spatial resolution i e the supernatant 40 cm 80 cm and the column outlet at 130 cm depth fig 1 since this pre experiment was conducted two years before the main experiment there was sufficient time for the sediment system to be flushed by ms2 free water 2 3 main experimental design in the first of the two experimental phases a 100 l pulse of pond water containing a high load of 1 84 108 gc ml 1 ms2 particles as determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr and 1 5 108 pfu ml 1 of infectious phage as determined by the plaque assay was supplied to the column with a pore water velocity of 2 1 m d 1 nineteen days after the high virus load pulse experimental phase 2 was initiated to simulate a heavy rainfall event corresponding to 37 mm h via infiltration of a pulse of 100 l of deionized water deionized water was used because its low ionic strength is similar to that of natural rainwater after each of the pulses the column was reconnected to the surrounding pond water just before the pulse solution was completely infiltrated sampling depths for pore water included the surface i e the supernatant 20 cm withdrawal rate 1 3 l h 40 cm withdrawal rate 1 4 l h 80 cm withdrawal rate 1 4

cell counts and microbial activity were collected every hour in the first 7 h and 12 h after the dose of ms2 pulse and the pulse of deionized water respectively subsequently the sampling intervals increased sequentially with time see tables s2 and s3 for details at the mesocosm outlet in experimental phase 1 water samples for biological monitoring were first collected 23 h after the supply of ms2 particles samples for the analyis of water chemistry were taken once a day during the first 10 days after ms2 dosing and for the entire experimental phase 2 after simulated rainfall additional water chemistry samples were taken at 15 and 16 days after ms2 donation sediment samples were collected after the high virus load pulse experimental phase 1 and the simulated rain event experimental phase 2 using a double wall sediment corer high density polyethylene 10 cm outer diameter 4 cm inner diameter and 100 cm height which was pushed into the sediment to a depth of 70 cm at the end of each experimental phase day 15 and day 23 after the ms2 pulse the inner core was withdrawn carrying the sediment whereas the outer tube remained in place for the remainder of the experiment to maintain undisturbed hydrological conditions the cored sediment samples were divided into portions of 5 cm depth and transferred into falcon tubes 50 ml for the subsequent quantification of total and infectious ms2 particles all experiments were conducted at the end of the calendar year november december 2 4 cultivation and quantification of ms2 bacteriophage ms2 dsmz 13767 and ms2 host strain escherichia coli dsmz 5695 were obtained from the dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures gmbh isolation and purification of ms2 phages after propagation with a co incubation of e coli 5695 were performed following the protocol described in feichtmayer 2019 to produce a high density phage suspension in buffer solution for the pre experiment with the moderate virus load infectious phages were quantified with the plaque assay in accordance with din en iso 10705 1 2001 for the pre experiment batches and the main experiments this was adapted to follow the double agar overlay method of kropinski et al 2009 in brief a solid agar base 10 ml of 1 5 agar w v was overlaid with a mixture of soft agar 4 ml of 0 75 agar w v and 1 ml of a well mixed solution consisting of the diluted sample and host bacteria in the logarithmic growth phase 1 1 v v serial dilutions of the mixture were incubated at 37 c overnight and pfus were counted in duplicate the titer of infectious phages in the sediment samples was estimated after the elution of 0 5 ml of sediment with 1 ml of deionized water and vigorous shaking on a vortex mixer 3 times each for 1 min with 30 s between each mixing step the limit of detection lod for the plaque assays was 0 5 pfu ml 1 triplicate quantification of the total number of phages was performed using qpcr analysis of phage rna transcribed into cdna before phage rna extraction all water samples were concentrated to a volume of 1 ml using amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter units merck phage rna was then extracted using the allprep powerviral dna rna kit qiagen and cdna synthesis was performed using the maxima first strand cdna synthesis kit thermofisher the isolation of phage rna and the reverse transcription was conducted following the manufacturer s instruction the qpcr targeted a 315 bp fragment using the ms2 specific primer sequences ms2 2717fw 5 ctg ggc aat agt caa a 3 and ms2 3031rv 5 cgt gga tct gac ata c 3 and using the brilliant iii ultrafast sybr green qpcr master mix agilent then 2 μl of cdna were quantified in triplicate each 25 μl reaction contained 12 5 μl of qpcr master mix 0 375 μl of reference dye 1 500 v v dilution in rnase free water and 0 5 μl of each primer 10 μm eurofins the qpcr analyses were performed in a stratagene mx3000p qpcr cycler agilent r2 0 99 and a light cycler 480 sw 1 5 roche r2 0 98 following a protocol modified from dreier et al 2005 initial denaturation 95 c 10 min was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation 95 c 15 s annealing 50 c 30 s and elongation 72 c 30 s afterwards the melting curve was recorded between 55 c and 95 c to verify the specificity of the amplification products owing to the different sample volumes available for concentration there was no single lod instead the lod range was determined as 5 8 102 5 6 103 gc ml 1 2 5 atp and tcc analyses to study the relationship between virus reduction and the amount and activity of autochthonous microorganisms microbial activity and prokaryotic cell counts were monitored in both water and sediment samples throughout the experiment the microbial activity in water and sediment samples was estimated using atp concentration measurements using the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay kit promega following the protocol described in hammes et al 2010 but with minor modifications water samples and the bactiter glo reagent prepared in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions were pre warmed separately at 38 c for at least 2 min before 1 ml of sample was mixed with 50 μl of reagent the mixture was incubated at 38 c for 1 min and luminescence measured on a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega concentrations were determined by comparison with external atp standards dissolved in atp free water fisher scientific using atp free water as blank to correct for the contribution of extracellular atp in the samples the measurements were performed on an untreated sample fraction representing the total atp concentration as well as a fraction of the same sample that was filtered 0 1 μm syringe filter merck millipore to remove microbial cells the concentration of intracellular atp was then calculated by subtracting the extracellular concentration from the total all measurements were conducted in triplicate the total atp in sediment samples was determined as follows 50 μl of 0 1 μm filtered milli q water was added to 200 μl of homogenized sediment next 100 μl preheated 38 c bactiter glo reagent was added and the sample was mixed using a thermomixer 1400 rpm at 38 c for 2 5 min subsequently 900 μl of 0 1 μm filtered milli q water was added and the sample was briefly mixed using a vortex mixer and centrifuged finally triplicate measurements of the supernatant were performed using a similar protocol to that for the water samples see above the extracellular atp in sediment samples was quantified using a similar setup but without the addition of 100 μl preheated 38 c bactiter glo reagent to lyse the cells tcc was quantified using flow cytometry fc 500 cytomics beckman coulter as described in fillinger et al 2019 for pore water samples and as detailed in bayer et al 2016 for sediment samples 2 6 physicochemical conditions pore water temperature and ph were measured on site using a temperature data logger voltcraft and microprocessor ph meter respectively ec redox potential and do were measured on site using field sensors wtw 2 7 data analysis the recovery of total and infectious ms2 during experimental phase 1 and phase 2 was calculated to a depth of 80 cm the deeper zone of the mesocosm including the gravel layer was not included thus avoiding inconsistency due to its large sediment heterogeneity and the risk of having missed the ms2 peak concentration at the mesocosm s outlet for samples with a total ms2 concentrations below the detection limit the infectious ms2 concentration was used instead for calculation the number of total and infectious sediment attached ms2 was calculated as the product of the total or infectious ms2 concentration detected at various depths of the sediment cores and the volume of the corresponding column layer the phage particle concentrations collected at depths between 65 cm and 70 cm were assumed to be representative of the depth interval of 65 80 cm to test the relationships between different biological and physico chemical variables a spearman rank correlation analysis was performed with the hmisc package in r harrll et al 2018 and applied to all available variables collected for pore water and sediments encompassing data from both experimental phases tables s4 and s5 student s t test t test in r and the wilcoxon test wilcox test in r were used to analyze the significance of difference between samples using t with a significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre experiments 3 1 1 inactivation and decay of ms2 in batch incubations following the ms2 inoculum of 6 5 108 gc ml 1 in sterilized surface water for 23 days in batch experiments fig 2 showed the concentration of total ms2 particles as measured by qpcr to remain constant i e without any significant reduction wilcoxon test n 12 p 0 5 fig 2 this indicates that no ms2 decay occurred during incubation however the fraction of infectious ms2 showed some decline at 19 days after inoculation i e from 5 6 108 to 9 8 107 pfu ml 1 accounting for 15 of the total ms2 and corresponding to a 0 8 log reduction of the initial infectious ms2 concentration this decrease in infectious ms2 during incubation is assumed to be due to inactivation and implies an inactivation rate of ms2 in the sterilized surface water at 7 c was 0 045 log10 day 1 fig 2 similar to the inactivation rate of ms2 0 043 log10 d 1 determined at 4 c in raw groundwater by ogorzaly et al 2010 similar to the experiments only in sterilized water no reduction in total ms2 was observed after inoculation into water saturated sediments wilcoxon test n 12 p 1 the initial concentration of attached total ms2 in the sterile water saturated sediment mixture was 1 5 108 gc ml 1 infectious ms2 attached to the sediment with an initial concentration of 8 9 107 pfu ml 1 declined at an inactivation rate of 0 035 log10 d 1 fig 2 the assumed inactivation rate of attached ms2 phages was lower than that of the suspended ms2 indicating that although attachment is an important process for attenuating ms2 during the subsurface passage phage activity is preserved prolonged survival of the virus by attachment to sediment was also observed by melnick et al 1980 and schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 3 1 2 transport of a moderate ms2 pulse through the sediment column in the pre experiment that lasted for 50 h we observed a significant decrease in the peak concentrations of the infectious virus breakthrough curves with depth from 1 9 106 pfu ml 1 at the surface to 2 1 103 pfu ml 1 at a depth of 80 cm fig 3 after 80 cm of sediment passage the attenuation or removal of infectious ms2 amounted to approximately 3 0 log10 no significant difference in the concentration of infectious ms2 was detected at the depth of 80 cm and the outlet at the depth of 130 cm t test t 0 97 df 9 7 p 0 35 3 2 main experiments 3 2 1 dynamics of physico chemical water quality during the entire course of the main experiment the pond water

collected at the outlet after 130 cm of sediment passage compared to the surface water temperature meansurface 5 9 c 2 4 c water temperature at the column outflow was higher and more constant meanoutlet 7 8 c 2 0 c fig 4 this difference was partially due to the transition from autumn to winter and the delayed response of the sediment temperature to the decrease in air temperature during the course of the experiment the mean do concentration decreased from 13 9 1 8 mg l 1 meansurface to 11 5 2 2 mg l 1 meanoutlet during the passage of pore water through the column which was likely due to higher oxygen solubility at lower temperature and microbial processes e g aerobic respiration diem et al 2013 a peak value of 17 2 mg l 1 do in the infiltrating surface water on day 9 corresponded to a sudden drop in temperature fig 4 the ph decreased from a mean value at the surface of 8 1 0 1 to a mean value at the outlet of 7 8 0 3 fig 4 heterotrophic biological processes result in do consumption and oxidation of organic matter with the production of co2 and or organic acids which generally reduces ph kuehn and mueller 2000 during sampling the mean redox potential at the surface 350 71 mv was not significantly different from that at the column outlet 347 67 mv wilcoxon test n 32 p 0 5 as redox conditions remained oxic throughout the entire experiment effects on the survival of the virus by a redox shift are likely to have been negligible feichtmayer et al 2017 ec remained constant during the experiment meansurface 878 223 μs cm 1 meanoutlet 879 192 μs cm 1 and was independent of sediment depth with one exception namely the supply of deionized water at the beginning of phase 2 which caused a temporary shift throughout the sediment column the lowest ec caused by deionized water was 15 1 μs cm 1 at the surface a higher value of 135 8 μs cm 1 was detected at the outlet the simulated heavy rainfall as intended led to a reduction in the ionic strength of the sediment pore water overall the differences in do and ph indicated the activity of biological processes during bank filtration kuehn and mueller 2000 diem et al 2013 3 2 2 experimental phase 1 virus contamination 3 2 2 1 fate of ms2 during transport through the bank sediment the peak concentrations of total ms2 in the breakthrough curves decreased with increasing depth and distance to the surface fig 5 i e from 1 84 108 gc ml 1 in the surface water to 3 2 107 gc ml 1 at 80 cm thus the peak of total virus concentration was reduced by 0 8 log units through 80 cm of sediment passage a total amount of 1 75 1013 ms2 particles was estimated to be transported through the 80 cm sediment column table 2 i e at the end of experimental phase 1 only 5 of the total ms2 particles remained in the column at 219 h after the inoculation with ms2 103 total ms2 particles ml 1 were detected in the surface water corresponding to a log decrease rate of 0 0185 h 1 we attribute these remaining ms2 particles to kinetic phage attachment to and detachment from the top sediment taking into account the mixing and non uniform infiltration of the pond water frohnert et al 2014 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 as with the concentration of total ms2 phage particles the peak concentration of infectious ms2 in pore water decreased with increasing distance from the surface i e from 1 5 108 pfu ml 1 in the surface water to 2 9 106 pfu ml 1 measured at depth of 80 cm fig 5 corresponding to a removal of approximately 1 7 log units with a reduction in peak concentration of 0 8 log units for total ms2 particles and 1 7 log units for infectious ms2 particles the overall reduction of virus in our main experiment was in the range of that reported in other studies using ms2 as a model agent i e a 0 1 1 9 log unit reduction over a filtration distance of 0 4 1 5 m as reviewed by bauer et al 2011 with the moderate virus load applied in the pre experiment which was run under the same conditions as the main experiment a 3 0 log unit removal of infectious ms2 in pore water was found exceeding the removal in the main experiment the lower removal efficiency in the main experiment can be explained by a conceptual model for colloid transport derived from column studies and micromodel observations as suggested by bradford et al 2009 at high initial input concentrations a lower relative mass transfer to the solid phase occurs because weakly associated colloids are knocked off the solids surface owing to more frequent collisions moreover bradford et al 2009 found that only a small fraction of the porous media play an active role in colloid retention the reason being that colloid retention is highest near grain grain contact where low velocity areas form furthermore another possible explanation is the enhanced aggregation caused by the higher virus concentration leading to less interaction of the individual viruses with the grain surfaces indeed all virus particles within one aggregate must be inactivated before this aggregate group will not appear as active in the plaque assay schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the high virus load we applied reflects a worst case scenario with a high share of sewage in river flow as raw sewage is reported to contain between 109 and 1012 infectious coliphages per l lodder and de roda husman 2005 applying a high virus load also enabled the reliable detection of total and infectious ms2 particles over time and space 19 days after the major ms2 pulse 0 1 of ms2 particles that were transported through the 80 cm sediment column were still infective compared to the infectious ms2 fraction of the sterilized water in batch experiments a much higher proportion of infectious ms2 particles lost their infectivity during the sediment passage in the main experiment we assumed that the higher fraction of inactivated ms2 phages in the column pore water relative to the sterile batch tests was mainly attributable to the interplay of pore water flow and attachment as well as to autochthonous microorganisms and their activity for example hurst et al 1980 and schijven et al 2002 found that the presence of aerobic microorganisms especially sediment attached microorganisms could affect virus activity and may promote virus decay yates et al 1990 provided an early review of the mechanisms through which microorganisms may cause the inactivation of viruses for example certain bacteria release proteolytic enzymes that destroy the protein coating of virus particles cliver and herrmann 1972 deng et al 2014 indicated that the number of infectious ms2 phages may be reduced by grazing protozoa more recently feichtmayer et al 2017 provided a comprehensive review of the antagonistic microbial processes inactivating and or eliminating viruses in aquatic ecosystems importantly the average percentage of infectious ms2 in pore water decreased with increasing distance from the point of infiltration fig 5 moreover the proportion of infectious ms2 0 4 79 also changed over time in the breakthrough water the highest proportion of infectious ms2 particles was found near or at the peak of the individual breakthrough curves independently of sediment depth i e 79 at 0 cm 59 at 20 cm 47 at 40 cm and 30 at 80 cm 3 2 2 2 fate of ms2 attached to the sediment in phase 1 core samples the concentration of sediment attached total ms2 particles was distributed rather evenly with depth in the sediment column at the end of phase 1 i e 15 days after the inoculation with ms2 fig 6 starting with a total concentration of attached ms2 phages of 1 5 105 gc ml 1 in the uppermost sediment layer the concentration increased to 4 8 105 gc ml 1 to a depth of 15 cm and then remained constant independently of further sediment depth this pattern indicated that the top sediment layer experienced significant detachment owing to the ongoing infiltration of ms2 free surface water whereas sediments below 15 cm experienced a ms2 saturation with a balance between the attachment and detachment of ms2 particles the distribution of infectious ms2 particles followed a slightly different trend with a stable concentration in the top 45 cm and a moderate decrease in concentration and proportion between 50 cm and 70 cm the percentage of infectious ms2 phages was thus high at the top 15 at 5 cm decreased with depth and became lowest at the bottom of the column 0 8 at 70 cm both the attached and suspended infectious ms2 decreased with depth suggesting ms2 experienced more inactivation than decay during the sediment passage this result also suggests that the retention of infectious phage particles is higher than that for the total ms2 particles because inactivation reduces particle size and alters the physico chemical characteristics of the phage surface facilitating transport ghanem et al 2018 3 2 2 3 microbial biomass and activity in phase 1 the abundance of prokaryotic cells and microbial activity in the pore water at individual sediment depths remained stable during phase 1 fig 7 this indicates that the inoculation of surface water with ms2 did not significantly alter other microbial patterns in sediment pore water as expected the concentration of prokaryotic cells in the pore water decreased with sediment depth from 8 12 105 cells ml 1 in the surface water to 5 39 104 cells ml 1 at 100 cm a similar pattern was observed for pore water microbial activity fig 7 prokaryotic cell counts and microbial activity of the attached microbial communities from core sampling were also highest in the top most sediments fig 8 decreasing prokaryotic cell numbers with increasing sediment depth were consistent with previous studies as reviewed by hassard et al 2016 while the stable microbial activity throughout the column below 10 cm the presence of a well established depth independent active bacterial community degenkolb et al 2018 the activity of indigenous microbes is assumed to have a negative impact on the survival of allochthonous viruses and bacteria particularly those that do not have a host in the environment such as human pathogenic viruses sobsey et al 1980 feichtmayer et al 2017 3 2 3 experimental phase 2 phage re mobilization through a simulated heavy rainfall event as described in section 2 2 the simulated heavy rainfall event was initiated 19 days after the supply of a high load of ms2 the infiltration of 100 l of deionized water was equivalent to a recharge of precipitation of 37 mm h which represents an extreme rainfall for the berlin area the pulse of deionized water caused a significant decrease in ec i e a reactive front of low ionic strength water migrating down through the sediment column fig 4 after 1 day the ec values were fully recovered not only in the surface water but also at the outlet of the column 3 2 3 1 re mobilization of attached ms2 phages although the number of total ms2 particles had dropped below or close to the detection limit in sediment pore water immediately before the simulated rainfall event the pulse of deionized water caused a new moving front of ms2 phages re mobilized from the sediment migrating through the sediment column in contrast to experimental phase 1 the peak concentrations of total ms2 particles in pore water increased with depth reaching concentrations as high as 105 gc ml 1 fig 5 the fraction of infectious ms2 phages followed a distribution pattern similar to that of the total ms2 phages fig 5 the average percentage of infectious ms2 in pore water samples at different depths was in the range of 13 40 and hence significantly higher than in the first experimental phase where the range was 7 6 21 notably in experimental phase 2 3 3 1010 ms2 particles in total were transported through the 80 cm sediment column after the application of deionized water and a significant portion on average 69 were still infectious table 2 this suggested that attachment somehow conserves infectivity of phage particles better than transport in suspension similar findings were obtained in the batch experiments fig 2 and in earlier studies yates et al 1987 melnick et al 1980 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 gerba 1984 proposed that the mechanisms protecting viruses attached to sediment might include shielding from proteolytic enzymes or other substances that inactivate and degrade viruses the attachment of virus particles to the soil and sediment surface is mediated by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions gerba 1984 a decrease in pore water salt concentration is known to increase the surface potential of the attached viruses owing to the expansion of the electrostatic double layer surrounding the virus particles and soil particle surfaces causing virus detachment quanrud et al 2003 a rapid shift to low ionic strength conditions has a strong desorption effect on phages and other particles from sediment surfaces yates et al 1987 gerba 1999 deionized water as shown in this experiment can cause a quantitative re mobilization of previously immobilized virus and thus a second pulse of contamination guber et al 2006 landry et al 1979 although the reactive front of the low ionic strength water pulse initiated the desorption of part of the attached phages the phage peak in the column outflow was broader we assumed that some virus particles underwent re attachment further down the sediment column as observed by wellings et al 1975 3 2 3 2 phages remaining attached to sediment after simulated heavy rain a significant number of total ms2 particles around 1011 gc remained attached to the sediment after both phases of the experiment table 2 after the artificial rain event the abundance of sediment attached total ms2 particles was moderately lower at the top of the sediment column than in experimental phase 1 down to a depth of 20 cm but below that it remained constant and similar to the numbers found at the end of experimental phase 1 figs 6 and 8 indeed the number of sediment bound infectious ms2 phages after the simulated rainfall event was not significantly different from that in experimental phase 1 t test t 0 80 df 26 p 0 43 infectious ms2 particles attached to the sediment matrix were distributed more evenly with depth than total phage particles ranging from 7 6 103 to 2 5 104 pfu ml 1 modelling the proportion of infectious ms2 collected from the sediment core against the sediment depth showed that the decrease in the proportion of infectious ms2 phages with depth was less steep after the artificial rainfall than in experimental phase 1 fig 6 indicating that infectious ms2 particles were preferentially re mobilized 3 2 3 3 effects of rain on the distribution of bacteria and microbial activity the artificial heavy rainfall not only mobilized sediment attached ms2 particles but also caused prokaryotic cells to detach fig 7 this result supported the findings of earlier studies which reported that the contamination of groundwater wells was promoted by the detachment of bacteria from surrounding sediments in periods of heavy rainfall bition and harvey 1992 zyman and sorber 1988 interestingly in our study no apparent changes were observed in microbial activity down to a depth of 40 cm indicating that cells with no or low activity were predominantly dislodged from the sediment following rainfall however at deeper zones of the sediment column the microbial activity appeared to follow the dynamics of the bacterial numbers fig 7 the peak concentration of prokaryotic cells in the sediment pore water following the simulated rainfall was more than 10 times higher than the pore water concentrations detected in experimental phase 1 however at 91 h after the simulated rainfall lower concentrations of prokaryotic cells were detected in pore water compared with phase 1 but the overall pattern was similar fewer prokaryotic cells were present further down the column as in experimental phase 1 the sediment attached prokaryotic cell concentration was highest at the top of the column 5 cm sediment depth and 10 times lower at a depth of 70 cm after the rainfall although the numbers of sediment attached microorganisms were lower mainly in the top sediments the overall abundance of bacteria that remained attached to the sediment was lower in experimental phase 2 than in experimental phase 1 although a breakthrough of prokaryotic cells migrating through the sediment column was observed following the simulated rain event the total number of sediment attached cells did not change significantly wilcoxon test n 28 p 0 38 as shown by the cell count which was two orders of magnitude lower in pore water than attached to the sediment matrix similar patterns were found for microbial activity fig 8 the simulated rainfall significantly increased the activity of the sediment attached microbial consortia in the top sediment apart from this exception most of the sediment bound microbial activity was lower in phase 2 with a significant difference between phase 1 and phase 2 revealed wilcoxon test n 28 p 0 003 3 3 a comprehensive perspective on the main experiment although it may be assumed that the virus concentrations applied in the experiment rarely occur in natural environments in face of the rather small sample volumes available and the lod of the methods applied for the quantification of total and infectious ms2 the seeding of high phage numbers allowed the spatio temporal resolution of several processes involved in the retardation and attenuation of virus in bank sediment infiltration including attachment detachment and inactivation our study revealed that high peak concentration of viruses in recharge water can lead to exceedance of the retention capacity of bank sediments presumably caused by the displacing interactions between attached ms2 and suspended ms2 in the water phase in our main experiment only a minor fraction of the supplied virus particles was retarded by attachment and for the peak concentrations of total ms2 and infectious ms2 phage particles the reductions achieved amounted only to of 0 8 and 1 7 log units respectively for a sediment passage of 80 cm in contrast for the lower initial ms2 concentration in the supply water the sediment removal efficiency was much higher amounting to 3 0 log10 if we only consider infectious virus particles to be a health hazard our results are more promising we showed that with travel distance through the sediment and water residence time the proportion of non infectious virus particles steadily increased after a sediment passage of 80 cm 1 2 log10 of the total ms2 particles were inactivated and could no longer be detected by the plaque assay indeed compared with ms2 other viruses particularly many human pathogenic viruses tend to be attached more efficiently especially within the first centimeters of sediment passage schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 thus the breakthrough of viruses of health concern is likely to be lower than for the bacteriophage ms2 the attachment of a virus particle does not imply that it will be inactivated and decay our data showed that re mobilized virus particles were characterized by a higher proportion of infectious particles 0 3 89 4 than that found in the suspended virus fraction during the initial contamination i e experimental phase 1 fig 5 the inactivation of viruses during attachment is reported to be virus specific frohnert et al 2014 yates et al 1987 reviewed further factors that could affect the transport and inactivation of viruses during soil and sediment passage including temperature pore water ph sediment organic matter content autochthonous microbial activity and ionic strength while earlier studies commonly agree that viruses remain infective and intact for longer at low temperatures yates et al 1987 feng et al 2003 and inactivation rates increase with an increase in temperature john and rose 2005 krauss and griebler 2011 during our experiment temperature showed a positive correlation to both infectious ms2 and total ms2 phage concentrations in pore water table s4 however this correlation is caused by a decrease of virus particles over time and a simultaneous seasonal decrease of ambient temperature in the sediment mesocosm moreover water temperatures detected during our experiment remained 10 c a temperature range characterized by a very low inactivation rate of ms2 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 ec was negatively correlated with infectious ms2 phage concentrations this supports the view that compared with total ms2 the desorption of infectious ms2 is more sensitive to ionic strength for the sediment samples tested prokaryotic cell abundance and microbial activity were significantly negatively correlated with the concentration of total ms2 particles rather than the concentration of infectious ms2 particles table s5 this indicates an antagonistic relationship between the autochthonous microbial communities and the allochthonous phages microbial mediated antagonistic processes that lead to a reduction of allochthonous viruses and microbes have been reported feichtmayer et al 2017 a further possibility is competition between total viruses and autochthonous bacteria for attachment sites in the aquifer medium the simulated recharge of rainwater clearly showed that a significant proportion of the initially attached viruses was re mobilized resulting in a second pulse of virus contaminated pore water moving through the bank sediment and thus demonstrating that extreme hydrological events indeed have the potential to cause a temporary impact on water quality as the low ec of the simulated rainwater exceeded 130 cm of sediment passage fig 4 the re mobilization of attached viruses can be expected to have an impact over a distance of several meters depending on the time and intensity of the rain event water flow velocity and pore water ionic strength quanrud et al 2003 4 conclusions attachment inactivation and decay are important processes in the attenuation of viruses as exemplified with the bacteriophage ms2 during bank sediment passage even when challenged with an extreme virus concentration of 108 particles ml 1 at the upper end of loads to be expected in rivers bank filtration can be efficient in reducing a viral contamination by 1 2 log units after only a short transport distance of less than one meter at lower concentrations of viruses infiltrating bank sediments and a lower water flow velocity i e high water residence time and or higher temperatures the natural attenuation efficiency is likely to be much higher in the range of 3 4 log units equally important only a small fraction of virus particles remained infectious after the sediment passage indicating that virus inactivation was a quantitatively important process in bank filtration extreme hydrological events such as heavy rainfall will cause the re mobilization of previously attached virus particles and autochthonous microorganisms from the sediment matrix as such rain and flood events may pose a hazard for drinking

1328,viruses including human pathogenic viruses can persist in water for producing drinking water from surface water via bank filtration natural attenuation capacities and the fate of viruses during the passage of aquatic sediments are of particular interest moreover the increasing frequency of extreme hydrological events necessitate re evaluation of the sustainability and efficacy of processes removing viruses for this purpose we performed bank sediment filtration experiments using a mesocosm in a technical scale experimental facility that simulates a field situation under more tightly controlled conditions we used the bacteriophage ms2 as a surrogate for enteric viruses to study the transport of different viral loads through the bank sediment additionally we simulated a heavy rain event to investigate the re mobilization of initially attached virus particles we quantified the abundance of infectious ms2 phages by plaque assay and the total number of ms2 particles by qpcr also we differentiated pore water concentrations by depths of the sediment column and investigated attachment to the sediment matrix at the end of the individual experimental phases bank filtration over a vertical distance of 80 cm through sandy sediment revealed a virus removal efficiency of 0 8 log10 for total ms2 particles and 1 7 log10 for infectious ms2 particles with an initial phage concentration of 1 84 108 gene copies ml 1 a low load of infectious ms2 1 9 106 plaque forming units ml 1 resulted in a greater removal efficiency 3 0 log10 the proportion of infectious ms2 phages of the total ms2 particle mass steadily decreased over time i e in the course of individual breakthrough curves and with sediment depth the simulated pulse of rainwater caused a front of low ionic strength water which resulted in pronounced phage remobilization the high proportion of infectious ms2 among the detached phages indicated that attachment to the sediment matrix may substantially conserve virus infectivity therefore the re mobilization of previously attached viruses owing to hydrological extremes should be considered in water quality assessment and monitoring schemes keywords virus transport ms2 bank filtration inactivation hydrological extremes climate change 1 introduction bank filtration of river and lake water has proven to be of great value for drinking water production by combining treatment and abstraction at low costs ahmed and marhaba 2017 massmann et al 2004 krauss and griebler 2011 kuehn and mueller 2000 the infiltrating surface water is physically chemically and microbiologically altered during sediment passage and this generally improves water quality jaramillo 2011 at some sites bank filtration plants have been operating for more than 150 years kuehn and mueller 2000 nagy kovács et al 2019 for example in germany the country in europe with most sites of induced bank filtration 9 16 of drinking water is produced in this way gillefalk et al 2018 however if the efficiency of the natural subsurface attenuation processes is insufficient or highly variable bank filtrate may be contaminated with pathogens including viruses schijven et al 2002 tufenkji et al 2002 the contamination of raw and drinking water with pathogens is a widespread source of waterborne disease outbreaks yang et al 2012 previous studies found a range of human enteric viruses at densities of 102 to 103 gc gene copies l 1 in surface waters lodder et al 2010 prevost et al 2015 these were introduced either by wastewater or via surface run off from agricultural land where wastewater and manure were applied fong and lipp 2005 the reduction of pathogenic viruses during bank filtration is of particular interest because compared to most pathogenic bacteria many viruses are more persistent in the aquatic environment it is not rare for viruses to remain infective for more than 100 days in sediment freshwater and sewage fong and lipp 2005 moreover owing to their smaller size viruses may travel longer distances through the porous subsurface as underground physical attenuation processes may be less effective than for bacteria betancourt et al 2014 bition and harvey 1992 viruses have been reported to be transported through subsurface media over distances as far as 1600 m and to a depth of 64 m below the land surface bales et al 1989 for these reasons a comprehensive understanding of the attenuation efficiency of bank filtration particularly for viruses is important for planning sustainable and safe drinking water production this requires addressing the impact of dynamic changes in the hydrological cycle on virus transport and retention including the impact of extended periods of droughts followed by heavy rain events and floods eckert et al 2008 climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in extreme hydrological events including more frequent and extended droughts and heavy rainfall understanding the impact of changes in hydrological conditions on the distribution of pathogens during bank filtration is therefore important for public health sprenger et al 2011 previous studies have already concluded that bank filtrate quality may be compromised by viral contamination induced by extreme precipitation owing both to shorter travel time in the subsurface and to elevated viral contamination in surface water rose et al 2000 sprenger et al 2011 additionally drayna et al 2010 proposed that the re mobilization desorption of formerly attached viruses in sediments can be a relevant process in the contamination of groundwater from infiltrating precipitation variation in the ionic strength of the sediment pore water may exert an important influence on virus attachment detachment and re mobilization landry et al 1979 it is therefore important to understand how heavy rain events causing water with a low ionic strength to percolate through bank sediments affect virus transport although bank filtration has been studied for many years the focus was chiefly on the fate of a variety of chemical pollutants and pathogenic bacteria the transport of pathogenic viruses through aquatic sediment has been less well studied mainly owing to the challenges of virus detection and quantification dash et al 2010 doussan et al 1997 wyn jones and sellwood 2001 moreover studies have so far almost exclusively addressed the infectious viruses i e detection by plaque assay or cell lines suspended and transported in sediment pore water while the transport of those which are no longer infectious has scarcely been addressed however including them provides information on virus inactivation virus removal by irreversible attachment to sediment or decay and virus retardation by attachment and re mobilization loveland et al 1996 limiting research to the study of infectious virus particles may further underestimate the number of viruses involved in aggregation in contrast exclusively addressing total viruses as is currently common with molecular tools misses viral infectivity and inactivation hassard et al 2016 combining and comparing the fate of both the total virus load and the fraction which remains infectious is therefore the most comprehensive approach for elucidating the mechanisms of virus transport during sediment passage the primary objective of the current study was to elucidate the efficacy and contribution of individual natural attenuation processes as viruses travel through aquatic sediment including irreversible attachment retardation attachment and re mobilization inactivation and decay this included in particular quantification of the re mobilization of formerly attached viruses caused by rainwater infiltration to achieve the aims of this study bacteriophage ms2 was used as a surrogate because of its similar size 26 nm and shape icosahedral to enteric viruses especially enteroviruses as well as its similar behavioral characteristics persistence resistance no replication in aquatic environments decay rate in surface water that determine its fate in the subsurface boehm et al 2019 harvey and ryan 2004 jofre et al 2016 pitol et al 2018 two scenarios in the main experiment focused on mimicking the infiltration of heavy viral contamination and a subsequent rainstorm event both scenarios are likely to occur frequently in fairly densely settled areas where bank filtrate is obtained from rivers and lakes that carry treated wastewater e g by upstream discharge from sewage treatment plants or by stormwater overflow from mixed sewers unlike other studies we not only looked at the fate of either total or infectious virus particles suspended in sediment pore water but also evaluated their combined dynamics over space and time and included total and infectious ms2 phages attached to the sediment matrix after each treatment phase i e after the contamination event and after the heavy rain event moreover key physical and chemical parameters i e electrical conductivity ec

riverbank and slow sand filtration fig s1 at the german environment agency s field station in berlin marienfelde this is fed by water from a storage pond in which groundwater from which fe and mn were removed through microbial precipitation was exposed to the atmosphere including natural rainfall and sunlight so that natural flora and fauna could develop after a residence time of 2 3 weeks this water entered the slow sand filtration basin mimicking surface water with a ph of 8 0 2 29 replicate measurements and a calculated ionic strength of 13 3 mm selected inorganic hydrochemical parameters

knappett et al 2008 sampling ports for sampling along the flowpath were installed at depths of 20 cm 40 cm and 80 cm the system had been in operation for over 10 years sufficient for the establishment of a natural bacterial community degenkolb et al 2018 2 2 pre experiments pre experiments included i batch tests on the inactivation decay of ms2 phages in sterile surface water and water saturated

52 108 particles ml 1 these samples were incubated at 7 c in the dark for 19 23 days the impact of a moderate virus load on ms2 transport was assessed 2 years before the main experiment also in november and with the same column system a pulse of pond water 200l with a moderate virus load i e a final concentration of 1 9 106 plaque forming units pfu ml 1 of infectious ms2 total amount of infectious ms2 of 3 8 1011 pfu was supplied with flow rate adjusted to a filter velocity of 1 1 m d 1 corresponding to a pore water velocity of 2 2 m d 1 after the pulse the column was re connected to the surrounding pond water just before the pulse solution was completely infiltrated water samples were collected before and after the respective treatments at a high temporal and spatial resolution i

to be flushed by ms2 free water 2 3 main experimental design in the first of the two experimental phases a 100 l pulse of pond water containing a high load of 1 84 108 gc ml 1 ms2 particles as determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr and 1 5 108 pfu ml 1 of infectious phage as determined by the plaque assay was supplied to the column with a pore water velocity of 2 1 m d 1 nineteen days after the high virus load pulse experimental phase 2 was initiated to simulate a heavy rainfall event corresponding to 37 mm h via infiltration of a pulse of 100 l of deionized water deionized water was used because its low ionic strength is similar to that of natural rainwater after each of the pulses the column was reconnected to the surrounding pond water just before the pulse solution was completely infiltrated sampling depths for pore water included the surface i e the supernatant 20 cm withdrawal rate 1 3 l h 40 cm withdrawal rate 1 4 l h 80 cm withdrawal rate 1 4

cell counts and microbial activity were collected every hour in the first 7 h and 12 h after the dose of ms2 pulse and the pulse of deionized water respectively subsequently the sampling intervals increased sequentially with time see tables s2 and s3 for details at the mesocosm outlet in experimental phase 1 water samples for biological monitoring were first collected 23 h after the supply of ms2 particles samples for the analyis of water chemistry were taken once a day during the first 10 days after ms2 dosing and for the entire experimental phase 2 after simulated rainfall additional water chemistry samples were taken at 15 and 16 days after ms2 donation sediment samples were collected after the high virus load pulse experimental phase 1 and the simulated rain event experimental phase 2 using a double wall sediment corer high density polyethylene 10 cm outer diameter 4 cm inner diameter and 100 cm height which was pushed into the sediment to a depth of 70 cm at the end of each experimental phase day 15 and day 23 after the ms2 pulse the inner core was withdrawn carrying the sediment whereas the outer tube remained in place for the remainder of the experiment to maintain undisturbed hydrological conditions the cored sediment samples were divided into portions of 5 cm depth and transferred into falcon tubes 50 ml for the subsequent quantification of total and infectious ms2 particles all experiments were conducted at the end of the calendar year november december 2 4 cultivation and quantification of ms2 bacteriophage ms2 dsmz 13767 and ms2 host strain escherichia coli dsmz 5695 were obtained from the dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures gmbh isolation and purification of ms2 phages after propagation with a co incubation of e coli 5695 were performed following the protocol described in feichtmayer 2019 to produce a high density phage suspension in buffer solution for the pre experiment with the moderate virus load infectious phages were quantified with the plaque assay in accordance with din en iso 10705 1 2001 for the pre experiment batches and the main experiments this was adapted to follow the double agar overlay method of kropinski et al 2009 in brief a solid agar base 10 ml of 1 5 agar w v was overlaid with a mixture of soft agar 4 ml of 0 75 agar w v and 1 ml of a well mixed solution consisting of the diluted sample and host bacteria in the logarithmic growth phase 1 1 v v serial dilutions of the mixture were incubated at 37 c overnight and pfus were counted in duplicate the titer of infectious phages in the sediment samples was estimated after the elution of 0 5 ml of sediment with 1 ml of deionized water and vigorous shaking on a vortex mixer 3 times each for 1 min with 30 s between each mixing step the limit of detection lod for the plaque assays was 0 5 pfu ml 1 triplicate quantification of the total number of phages was performed using qpcr analysis of phage rna transcribed into

following a protocol modified from dreier et al 2005 initial denaturation 95 c 10 min was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation 95 c 15 s annealing 50 c 30 s and elongation 72 c 30 s afterwards the melting curve was recorded between 55 c and 95 c to verify the specificity of the amplification products owing to the different sample volumes available for concentration there was no single lod instead the lod range was determined as 5 8 102 5 6 103 gc ml 1 2 5 atp and tcc analyses to study the relationship between virus reduction and the amount and activity of autochthonous microorganisms microbial activity and prokaryotic cell counts were monitored in both water and sediment samples throughout the experiment the microbial activity in water and sediment samples was estimated using atp concentration measurements using the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay kit promega following the protocol described in hammes et al 2010 but with minor modifications water samples and the bactiter glo reagent prepared in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions were pre warmed separately at 38 c for at least 2 min before 1 ml of sample was mixed with 50 μl of reagent the mixture was incubated at 38 c for 1 min and luminescence measured on a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega concentrations were determined by comparison with external atp standards dissolved in atp free water fisher scientific using atp free water as blank to correct for the contribution of extracellular atp in the samples the measurements were performed on an untreated sample fraction representing the total atp concentration as well as a fraction of the same sample that was filtered 0 1 μm syringe filter merck millipore to remove microbial cells the concentration of intracellular atp was then calculated by subtracting the extracellular concentration from the total all measurements were conducted in triplicate the total atp in sediment samples was determined as follows 50 μl of 0 1 μm filtered milli q water was added to 200 μl of homogenized sediment next 100 μl preheated 38 c bactiter glo reagent was added and the sample was mixed using a thermomixer 1400 rpm at 38 c for 2 5 min subsequently 900 μl of 0 1 μm filtered milli q water was added and the sample was briefly mixed using a vortex mixer and centrifuged finally triplicate measurements of the supernatant were performed using a similar protocol to that for the water samples see above the extracellular atp in sediment samples was quantified using a similar setup but without the addition of 100 μl preheated 38 c bactiter glo reagent to lyse the cells tcc was quantified using flow cytometry fc 500 cytomics beckman coulter as described in fillinger et al 2019 for pore water samples and as detailed in bayer et al 2016 for sediment samples 2 6 physicochemical conditions pore water temperature and ph were measured on site using a temperature data logger voltcraft and microprocessor ph meter respectively ec redox potential and do were measured on site using field sensors wtw 2 7 data analysis the recovery of total and infectious ms2 during experimental phase 1 and phase 2 was calculated to a depth of 80 cm the deeper zone of the mesocosm including the gravel layer was not included thus avoiding inconsistency due to its large sediment heterogeneity and the risk of having missed the ms2 peak concentration at the mesocosm s outlet for samples with a total ms2 concentrations below the detection limit the infectious ms2 concentration was used instead for calculation the number of total and infectious sediment attached ms2 was calculated as the product of the total or infectious ms2 concentration detected at various depths of the sediment cores and the volume of the corresponding column layer the phage particle concentrations collected at depths between 65 cm and 70 cm were assumed to be representative of the depth interval of 65 80 cm to test the relationships between different biological and physico chemical variables a spearman rank correlation analysis was performed with the hmisc package in r harrll et al 2018 and applied to all available variables collected for pore water and sediments encompassing data from both experimental phases tables s4 and s5 student s t test t test in r and the wilcoxon test wilcox test in r were used to analyze the significance of difference between samples using t with a significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre experiments 3 1 1 inactivation and decay of ms2 in batch incubations following the ms2 inoculum of 6 5 108 gc ml 1 in sterilized surface water for 23 days in batch experiments fig 2 showed the concentration of total ms2 particles as measured by qpcr to remain constant i e without any significant reduction wilcoxon test n 12 p 0 5 fig 2 this indicates that no ms2 decay occurred during incubation however the fraction of infectious ms2 showed some decline at 19 days after inoculation i e from 5 6 108 to 9 8 107 pfu ml 1 accounting for 15 of the total ms2 and corresponding to a 0 8 log reduction of the initial infectious ms2 concentration this decrease in infectious ms2 during incubation is assumed to be due to inactivation and implies an inactivation rate of ms2 in the sterilized surface water at 7 c was 0 045 log10 day 1 fig 2 similar to the inactivation rate of ms2 0 043 log10 d 1 determined at 4 c in raw groundwater by ogorzaly et al 2010 similar to the experiments only in sterilized water no reduction in total ms2 was observed after inoculation into water saturated sediments wilcoxon test n 12 p 1 the initial concentration of attached total ms2 in the sterile water saturated sediment mixture was 1 5 108 gc ml 1 infectious ms2 attached to the sediment with an initial concentration of 8 9 107 pfu ml 1 declined at an inactivation rate of 0 035 log10 d 1 fig 2 the assumed inactivation rate of attached ms2 phages was lower than that of the suspended ms2 indicating that although attachment is an important process for attenuating ms2 during the subsurface passage phage activity is preserved prolonged survival of the virus by attachment to sediment was also observed by melnick et al 1980 and schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 3 1 2 transport of a moderate ms2 pulse through the sediment column in the pre experiment that lasted for 50 h we observed a significant decrease in the peak concentrations of the infectious virus breakthrough curves with depth from 1 9 106 pfu ml 1 at the surface to 2 1 103 pfu ml 1 at a depth of 80 cm fig 3 after 80 cm of sediment passage the attenuation or removal of infectious ms2 amounted to approximately 3 0 log10 no significant difference in the concentration of infectious ms2 was detected at the depth of 80 cm and the outlet at the depth of 130 cm t test t 0 97 df 9 7 p 0 35 3 2 main experiments 3 2 1 dynamics of physico chemical water quality during the entire course of the main experiment the pond water

collected at the outlet after 130 cm of sediment passage compared to the surface water temperature meansurface 5 9 c 2 4 c water temperature at the column outflow was higher and more constant meanoutlet 7 8 c 2 0 c fig 4 this difference was partially due to the transition from autumn to winter and the delayed response of the sediment temperature to the decrease in air temperature during the course of the experiment the mean do concentration decreased from 13 9 1 8 mg l 1 meansurface to 11 5 2 2 mg l 1 meanoutlet during the passage of pore water through the column which was likely due to higher oxygen solubility at lower temperature and microbial processes e g aerobic respiration diem et al 2013 a peak value of 17 2 mg l 1 do in the infiltrating surface water on day 9 corresponded to a sudden drop in temperature fig 4 the ph decreased from a mean value at the surface of 8 1 0 1 to a mean value at the outlet of 7 8 0 3 fig 4 heterotrophic biological processes result in do consumption and oxidation of organic matter with the production of co2 and or organic acids which generally reduces ph kuehn and mueller 2000 during sampling the mean redox potential at the surface 350 71 mv was not significantly different from that at the column outlet 347 67 mv wilcoxon test n 32 p 0 5 as redox conditions remained oxic throughout the entire experiment effects on the survival of the virus by a redox shift are likely to have been negligible feichtmayer et al 2017 ec remained constant during the experiment meansurface 878 223 μs cm 1 meanoutlet 879 192 μs cm 1 and was independent of sediment depth with one exception namely the supply of deionized water at the beginning of phase 2 which caused a temporary shift throughout the sediment column the lowest ec caused by deionized water was 15 1 μs cm 1 at the surface a higher value of 135 8 μs cm 1 was detected at the outlet the simulated heavy rainfall as intended led to a reduction in the ionic strength of the sediment pore water overall the differences in do and ph indicated the activity of biological processes during bank filtration kuehn and mueller 2000 diem et al 2013 3 2 2 experimental phase 1 virus contamination 3 2 2 1 fate of ms2 during transport through the bank sediment the peak concentrations of total ms2 in the breakthrough curves decreased with increasing depth and distance to the surface fig 5 i e from 1 84 108 gc ml 1 in the surface water to 3 2 107 gc ml 1 at 80 cm thus the peak of total virus concentration was reduced by 0 8 log units through 80 cm of sediment passage a total amount of 1 75 1013 ms2 particles was estimated to be transported through the 80 cm sediment column table 2 i e at the end of experimental phase 1 only 5 of the total ms2 particles remained in the column at 219 h after the inoculation with ms2 103 total ms2 particles ml 1 were detected in the surface water corresponding to a log decrease rate of 0 0185 h 1 we attribute these remaining ms2 particles to kinetic phage attachment to and detachment from the top sediment taking into account the mixing and non uniform infiltration of the pond water frohnert et al 2014 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 as with the concentration of total ms2 phage particles the peak concentration of infectious ms2 in pore water decreased with increasing distance from the surface i e from 1 5 108 pfu ml 1 in the surface water to 2 9 106 pfu ml 1 measured at depth of 80 cm fig 5 corresponding to a removal of approximately 1 7 log units with a reduction in peak concentration of 0 8 log units for total ms2 particles and 1 7 log units for infectious ms2 particles the overall reduction of virus in our main experiment was in the range of that reported in other studies using ms2 as a model agent i e a 0 1 1 9 log unit reduction over a filtration distance of 0 4 1 5 m as reviewed by bauer et al 2011 with the moderate virus load applied in the pre experiment which was run under the same conditions as the main experiment a 3 0 log unit removal of infectious ms2 in pore water was found exceeding the removal in the main experiment the lower removal efficiency in the main experiment can be explained by a conceptual model for colloid transport derived from column studies and micromodel observations as suggested by bradford et al 2009 at high initial input concentrations a lower relative mass transfer to the solid phase occurs because weakly associated colloids are knocked off the solids surface owing to more frequent collisions moreover bradford et al 2009 found that only a small fraction of the porous media play an active role in colloid retention the reason being that colloid retention is highest near grain grain contact where low velocity areas form furthermore another possible explanation is the enhanced aggregation caused by the higher virus concentration leading to less interaction of the individual viruses with the grain surfaces indeed all virus particles within one aggregate must be inactivated before this aggregate group will not appear as active in the plaque assay schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the high virus load we applied reflects a worst case scenario with a high share of sewage in river flow as raw sewage is reported to contain between 109 and 1012 infectious coliphages per l lodder and de roda husman 2005 applying a high virus load also enabled the reliable detection of total and infectious ms2 particles over time and space 19 days after the major ms2 pulse 0 1 of ms2 particles that were transported through the 80 cm sediment column were still infective compared to the infectious ms2 fraction of the sterilized water in batch experiments a much higher proportion of infectious ms2 particles lost their infectivity during the sediment passage in the main experiment we assumed that the higher fraction of inactivated ms2 phages in the column pore water relative to the sterile batch tests was mainly attributable to the interplay of pore water flow and attachment as well as to autochthonous microorganisms and their activity for example hurst et al 1980 and schijven et al 2002 found that the presence of aerobic microorganisms especially sediment attached microorganisms could affect virus activity and may promote virus decay yates et al 1990 provided an early review of the mechanisms through which microorganisms may cause the inactivation of viruses for example certain bacteria release proteolytic enzymes that destroy the protein coating of virus particles cliver and herrmann 1972 deng et al 2014 indicated that the number of infectious ms2 phages may be reduced by grazing protozoa more recently feichtmayer et al 2017 provided a comprehensive review of the antagonistic microbial processes inactivating and or eliminating viruses in aquatic ecosystems importantly the average percentage of infectious ms2 in pore water decreased with increasing distance from the point of infiltration fig 5 moreover the proportion of infectious ms2 0 4 79 also changed over time in the breakthrough water the highest proportion of infectious ms2 particles was found near or at the peak of the individual breakthrough curves independently of sediment depth i e 79 at 0 cm 59 at 20 cm 47 at 40 cm and 30 at 80 cm 3 2 2 2 fate of ms2 attached to the sediment in phase 1 core samples the concentration of sediment attached total ms2 particles was distributed rather evenly with depth in the sediment column at the end of phase 1 i e 15 days after the inoculation with ms2 fig 6 starting with a total concentration of attached ms2 phages of 1 5 105 gc ml 1 in the uppermost sediment layer the concentration increased to 4 8 105 gc ml 1 to a depth of 15 cm and then remained constant independently of further sediment depth this pattern indicated that the top sediment layer experienced significant detachment owing to the ongoing infiltration of ms2 free surface water whereas sediments below 15 cm experienced a ms2 saturation with a balance between the attachment and detachment of ms2 particles the distribution of infectious ms2 particles followed a slightly different trend with a stable concentration in the top 45 cm and a moderate decrease in concentration and proportion between 50 cm and 70 cm the percentage of infectious ms2 phages was thus high at the top 15 at 5 cm decreased with depth and became lowest at the bottom of the column 0 8 at 70 cm both the attached and suspended infectious ms2 decreased with depth suggesting ms2 experienced more inactivation than decay during the sediment passage this result also suggests that the retention of infectious phage particles is higher than that for the total ms2 particles because inactivation reduces particle size and alters the physico chemical characteristics of the phage surface facilitating transport ghanem et al 2018 3 2 2 3 microbial biomass and activity in phase 1 the abundance of prokaryotic cells and microbial activity in the pore water at individual sediment depths remained stable during phase 1 fig 7 this indicates that the inoculation of surface water with ms2 did not significantly alter other microbial patterns in sediment pore water as expected the concentration of prokaryotic cells in the pore water decreased with sediment depth from 8 12 105 cells ml 1 in the surface water to 5 39 104 cells ml 1 at 100 cm a similar pattern was observed for pore water microbial activity fig 7 prokaryotic cell counts and microbial activity of the attached microbial communities from core sampling were also highest in the top most sediments fig 8 decreasing prokaryotic cell numbers with increasing sediment depth were consistent with previous studies as reviewed by hassard et al 2016 while the stable microbial activity throughout the column below 10 cm the presence of a well established depth independent active bacterial community degenkolb et al 2018 the activity of indigenous microbes is assumed to have a negative impact on the survival of allochthonous viruses and bacteria particularly those that do not have a host in the environment such as human pathogenic viruses sobsey et al 1980 feichtmayer et al 2017 3 2 3 experimental phase 2 phage re mobilization through a simulated heavy rainfall event as described in section 2 2 the simulated heavy rainfall event was initiated 19 days after the supply of a high load of ms2 the infiltration of 100 l of deionized water was equivalent to a recharge of precipitation of 37 mm h which represents an extreme rainfall for the berlin area the pulse of deionized water caused a significant decrease in ec i e a reactive front of low ionic strength water migrating down through the sediment column fig 4 after 1 day the ec values were fully recovered not only in the surface water but also at the outlet of the column 3 2 3 1 re mobilization of attached ms2 phages although the number of total ms2 particles had dropped below or close to the detection limit in sediment pore water immediately before the simulated rainfall event the pulse of deionized water caused a new moving front of ms2 phages re mobilized from the sediment migrating through the sediment column in contrast to experimental phase 1 the peak concentrations of total ms2 particles in pore water increased with depth reaching concentrations as high as 105 gc ml 1 fig 5 the fraction of infectious ms2 phages followed a distribution pattern similar to that of the total ms2 phages fig 5 the average percentage of infectious ms2 in pore water samples at different depths was in the range of 13 40 and hence significantly higher than in the first experimental phase where the range was 7 6 21 notably in experimental phase 2 3 3 1010 ms2 particles in total were transported through the 80 cm sediment column after the application of deionized water and a significant portion on average 69 were still infectious table 2 this suggested that attachment somehow conserves infectivity of phage particles better than transport in suspension similar findings were obtained in the batch experiments fig 2 and in earlier studies yates et al 1987 melnick et al 1980 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 gerba 1984 proposed that the mechanisms protecting viruses attached to sediment might include shielding from proteolytic enzymes or other substances that inactivate and degrade viruses the attachment of virus particles to the soil and sediment surface is mediated by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions gerba 1984 a decrease in pore water salt concentration is known to increase the surface potential of the attached viruses owing to the expansion of the electrostatic double layer surrounding the virus particles and soil particle surfaces causing virus detachment quanrud et al 2003 a rapid shift to low ionic strength conditions has a strong desorption effect on phages and other particles from sediment surfaces yates et al 1987 gerba 1999 deionized water as shown in this experiment can cause a quantitative re mobilization of previously immobilized virus and thus a second pulse of contamination guber et al 2006 landry et al 1979 although the reactive front of the low ionic strength water pulse initiated the desorption of part of the attached phages the phage peak in the column outflow was broader we assumed that some virus particles underwent re attachment further down the sediment column as observed by wellings et al 1975 3 2 3 2 phages remaining attached to sediment after simulated heavy rain a significant number of total ms2 particles around 1011 gc remained attached to the sediment after both phases of the experiment table 2 after the artificial rain event the abundance of sediment attached total ms2 particles was moderately lower at the top of the sediment column than in experimental phase 1 down to a depth of 20 cm but below that it remained constant and similar to the numbers found at the end of experimental phase 1 figs 6 and 8 indeed the number of sediment bound infectious ms2 phages after the simulated rainfall event was not significantly different from that in experimental phase 1 t test t 0 80 df 26 p 0 43 infectious ms2 particles attached to the sediment matrix were distributed more evenly with depth than total phage particles ranging from 7 6 103 to 2 5 104 pfu ml 1 modelling the proportion of infectious ms2 collected from the sediment core against the sediment depth showed that the decrease in the proportion of infectious ms2 phages with depth was less steep after the artificial rainfall than in experimental phase 1 fig 6 indicating that infectious ms2 particles were preferentially re mobilized 3 2 3 3 effects of rain on the distribution of bacteria and microbial activity the artificial heavy rainfall not only mobilized sediment attached ms2 particles but also caused prokaryotic cells to detach fig 7 this result supported the findings of earlier studies which reported that the contamination of groundwater wells was promoted by the detachment of bacteria from surrounding sediments in periods of heavy rainfall bition and harvey 1992 zyman and sorber 1988 interestingly in our study no apparent changes were observed in microbial activity down to a depth of 40 cm indicating that cells with no or low activity were predominantly dislodged from the sediment following rainfall however at deeper zones of the sediment column the microbial activity appeared to follow the dynamics of the bacterial numbers fig 7 the peak concentration of prokaryotic cells in the sediment pore water following the simulated rainfall was more than 10 times higher than the pore water concentrations detected in experimental phase 1 however at 91 h after the simulated rainfall lower concentrations of prokaryotic cells were detected in pore water compared with phase 1 but the overall pattern was similar fewer prokaryotic cells were present further down the column as in experimental phase 1 the sediment attached prokaryotic cell concentration was highest at the top of the column 5 cm sediment depth and 10 times lower at a depth of 70 cm after the rainfall although the numbers of sediment attached microorganisms were lower mainly in the top sediments the overall abundance of bacteria that remained attached to the sediment was lower in experimental phase 2 than in experimental phase 1 although a breakthrough of prokaryotic cells migrating through the sediment column was observed following the simulated rain event the total number of sediment attached cells did not change significantly wilcoxon test n 28 p 0 38 as shown by the cell count which was two orders of magnitude lower in pore water than attached to the sediment matrix similar patterns were found for microbial activity fig 8 the simulated rainfall significantly increased the activity of the sediment attached microbial consortia in the top sediment apart from this exception most of the sediment bound microbial activity was lower in phase 2 with a significant difference between phase 1 and phase 2 revealed wilcoxon test n 28 p 0 003 3 3 a comprehensive perspective on the main experiment although it may be assumed that the virus concentrations applied in the experiment rarely occur in natural environments in face of the rather small sample volumes available and the lod of the methods applied for the quantification of total and infectious ms2 the seeding of high phage numbers allowed the spatio temporal resolution of several processes involved in the retardation and attenuation of virus in bank sediment infiltration including attachment detachment and inactivation our study revealed that high peak concentration of viruses in recharge water can lead to exceedance of the retention capacity of bank sediments presumably caused by the displacing interactions between attached ms2 and suspended ms2 in the water phase in our main experiment only a minor fraction of the supplied virus particles was retarded by attachment and for the peak concentrations of total ms2 and infectious ms2 phage particles the reductions achieved amounted only to of 0 8 and 1 7 log units respectively for a sediment passage of 80 cm in contrast for the lower initial ms2 concentration in the supply water the sediment removal efficiency was much higher amounting to 3 0 log10 if we only consider infectious virus particles to be a health hazard our results are more promising we showed that with travel distance through the sediment and water residence time the proportion of non infectious virus particles steadily increased after a sediment passage of 80 cm 1 2 log10 of the total ms2 particles were inactivated and could no longer be detected by the plaque assay indeed compared with ms2 other viruses particularly many human pathogenic viruses tend to be attached more efficiently especially within the first centimeters of sediment passage schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 thus the breakthrough of viruses of health concern is likely to be lower than for the bacteriophage ms2 the attachment of a virus particle does not imply that it will be inactivated and decay our data showed that re mobilized virus particles were characterized by a higher proportion of infectious particles 0 3 89 4 than that found in the suspended virus fraction during the initial contamination i e experimental phase 1 fig 5 the inactivation of viruses during attachment is reported to be virus specific frohnert et al 2014 yates et al 1987 reviewed further factors that could affect the transport and inactivation of viruses during soil and sediment passage including temperature pore water ph sediment organic matter content autochthonous microbial activity and ionic strength while earlier studies commonly agree that viruses remain infective and intact for longer at low temperatures yates et al 1987 feng et al 2003 and inactivation rates increase with an increase in temperature john and rose 2005 krauss and griebler 2011 during our experiment temperature showed a positive correlation to both infectious ms2 and total ms2 phage concentrations in pore water table s4 however this correlation is caused by a decrease of virus particles over time and a simultaneous seasonal decrease of ambient temperature in the sediment mesocosm moreover water temperatures detected during our experiment remained 10 c a temperature range characterized by a very low inactivation rate of ms2 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 ec was negatively correlated with infectious ms2 phage concentrations this supports the view that compared with total ms2 the desorption of infectious ms2 is more sensitive to ionic strength for the sediment samples tested prokaryotic cell abundance and microbial activity were significantly negatively correlated with the concentration of total ms2 particles rather than the concentration of infectious ms2 particles table s5 this indicates an antagonistic relationship between the autochthonous microbial communities and the allochthonous phages microbial mediated antagonistic processes that lead to a reduction of allochthonous viruses and microbes have been reported feichtmayer et al 2017 a further possibility is competition between total viruses and autochthonous bacteria for attachment sites in the aquifer medium the simulated recharge of rainwater clearly showed that a significant proportion of the initially attached viruses was re mobilized resulting in a second pulse of virus contaminated pore water moving through the bank sediment and thus demonstrating that extreme hydrological events indeed have the potential to cause a temporary impact on water quality as the low ec of the simulated rainwater exceeded 130 cm of sediment passage fig 4 the re mobilization of attached viruses can be expected to have an impact over a distance of several meters depending on the time and intensity of the rain event water flow velocity and pore water ionic strength quanrud et al 2003 4 conclusions attachment inactivation and decay are important processes in the attenuation of viruses as exemplified with the bacteriophage ms2 during bank sediment passage even when challenged with an extreme virus concentration of 108 particles ml 1 at the upper end of loads to be expected in rivers bank filtration can be efficient in reducing a viral contamination by 1 2 log units after only a short transport distance of less than one meter at lower concentrations of viruses infiltrating bank sediments and a lower water flow velocity i e high water residence time and or higher temperatures the natural attenuation efficiency is likely to be much higher in the range of 3 4 log units equally important only a small fraction of virus particles remained infectious after the sediment passage indicating that virus inactivation was a quantitatively important process in bank filtration extreme hydrological events such as heavy rainfall will cause the re mobilization of previously attached virus particles and autochthonous microorganisms from the sediment matrix as such rain and flood events may pose a hazard for drinking

1329,in recent years dna tagged silica colloids have been used as an environmental tracer a major advantage of this technique is that the dna coding provides an unlimited number of unique tracers without a background concentration however little is known about the effects of physio chemical subsurface properties on the transport behavior of dna tagged silica tracers we are the first to explore the deposition kinetics of this new dna tagged silica tracer for different pore water chemistries flow rates and sand grain size distributions in a series of saturated sand column experiments in order to predict environmental conditions for which the dna tagged silica tracer can best be employed our results indicated that the transport of dna tagged silica tracer can be well described by first order kinetic attachment and detachment because of massive re entrainment under transient chemistry conditions we inferred that attachment was primarily in the secondary energy minimum based on calculated sticking efficiencies of the dna tagged silica tracer to the sand grains we concluded that a large fraction of the dna tagged silica tracer colliding with the sand grain surface did also stick to that surface when the ionic strength of the system was higher the experimental results revealed the sensitivity of dna tagged silica tracer to both physical and chemical factors this reduces its applicability as a conservative hydrological tracer for studying subsurface flow paths based on our experiments the dna tagged silica tracer is best applicable for studying flow routes and travel times in coarse grained aquifers with a relatively high flow rate dna tagged silica tracers may also be applied for simulating the transport of engineered or biological colloidal pollution such as microplastics and pathogens keywords dna tagged silica colloids tracer solution chemistry 1 introduction tracers are widely used in hydrological studies such as tracking contamination in the

tagged with dna is not limited to water and oil applications examples include pesticide spraying mora et al 2015 and waste water sludge grass et al 2014 more recently dnacol were also used as a surrogate model to study the microbial transmission in healthcare scotoni et al 2020 and in the setting up of a dna of things as the storage material koch et al 2020 the main advantages of tagging silica colloids with dna are that it gives the colloids a unique dna sequence and enables analysis at low concentrations using standard microbial techniques e g quantitative polymerase chain reaction

silica colloids can enhance contaminant transport dai et al 2020 hou et al 2021 mendes de oliveira et al 2017 qin et al 2020 in the subsurface therefore all of the aforementioned physicochemical factors can influence aggregation deposition and remobilization of colloidal matter to better predict the behavior of dnacol as a tracer or surrogate we conducted a series of saturated sand column experiments the objective of this study was two fold first to systematically explore the use of dnacol in columns of quartz sand in order to compare deposition kinetics with existing literature second we wanted to identify removal of dnacol under various saturated porous media conditions in order to start predicting their value in environmental applications thereto we carried out column experiments with dnacol in which we varied solution chemistry flow rate and grain size in addition we used hydrus 1d to quantify transport parameters and assist in analyzing colloid grain surface interaction processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 the dna tagged silica particle the dnacol was composed of a silica outer shell sio2 a layer of dna molecules and a silica core paunescu et al 2013 a 1 ml 10 mg ml 1 dnacol suspension equal to 4 1011 particles ml 1 paunescu et al 2013 was kindly fabricated and provided by the functional materials laboratory group at eth zurich average diameter of dna tagged silica particles was 270 nm and density of 2 2 g cm 1 mora et al 2015 the double stranded dna sequence which was sandwiched between silica core and protective cover layer was 80 nucleotides long details in the supporting information prior to use dnacol was washed in a diluted commercial bleach solution 10 μl bleach to 10 ml water to ensure no free dna in suspension then 1000 diluted dnacol batches 5 μl to 5 ml dnacol concentration 0 001 mg ml 1 or 4 107 particles ml 1 were prepared in milli q water nacl 33 mm ph 5 5 and cacl2 41 mm ph 5 8 the effect of solution chemistries on the stability of dnacol was measured via the zeta potential ζ using a nanosizer nano series malvern instrument ltd uk the ζ was determined from electrophoretic mobility using smoluchowski s formula at 25 c temperature and the dielectric constant of water medium 78 54 thereto three dnacol batches were prepared in milli q water resistivity 18 mω cm nacl is 33 mm ph 5 5 and cacl2 is 41 mm ph 5 8 in a 10 ppm concentration 0 01 mg ml 1 after vortexing ζ was 42 5 5 3 mv in milli q water 33 9 6 1 mv in nacl and 20 7 3 3 mv in cacl2 solution respectively we used these values for dlvo calculations see supporting information 2 2 porous medium we used two different sand types one was quartz sand j t baker inc phillipsburg new jersey sieved to a fraction of 1000 1400 μm grain size range coarse sand and the other was so called silver sand m31 sibelco belgium sieved to a fraction of 500 630 μm grain size range fine sand to remove impurities the sands were soaked in 65 concentrated 4 n hno3 solution for 2 h at 100 c after cooling the acid was decanted and the sand was rinsed repeatedly with deionized water until the ph stabilized around 7 and the electrical conductivity of the rinse water became less than 1 2 μs cm 1 then the acid washed sand was oven dried for 24 h at 105 c the clean and dry sand was stored in a capped container for further use the zeta potential of both fine and coarse sand was determined with a crushed fraction thereto both fine and coarse sand were ground manually using a mortar and pestle then 0 5 g of crushed sand was added to 10 ml of each milli q water nacl and cacl2 solution each suspension was vortexed three times and allowed to settle for 2 min the supernatant was used for measuring the zeta potential the ξ for fine sand was 34 4 5 4 mv in milli q water 39 4 5 4 mv in nacl and 15 3 4 3 mv in cacl2 while for coarse sand it was 33 1 4 7 mv in milli q water 41 2 7 1 mv in nacl and 11 3 4 5 mv in cacl2 the mean and standard deviation values are calculated from the average of mean and standard deviation of triplicate measurements 2 3 column experiments soil column experiments were conducted with adjustable height chromatography columns made of borosilicate glass omnifit cambridge uk the column with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm was wet packed with one of the two sands to a height of 6 5 cm before packing the column co2 gas was flushed into the dry sand to increase wettability of the sand upon wet packing during wet packing the column was vibrated with a plastic bar to facilitate uniform packing after connecting the pump demineralized water was injected in an upward direction at a constant flow rate typically two columns were prepared one with fine sand and one with coarse sand these columns were run in parallel at similar pump speed see table 1 for an overview first 2 2 5 pore volumes of nacl solution was injected in order to determine dispersivity and porosity of the sand thereto at specific time intervals as a proxy for nacl concentration the electrical conductivity ec of the effluent was measured then the influent solution was switched back to demineralized water dm water to flush out remaining nacl solution next a 2 2 5 pore volumes pv of a 10 3 mg ml 1 4 107 particles ml 1 dnacol suspension in dm water under continuous mixing was injected in the column followed by at least 3 pv flushing with dnacol free solution the column was flushed overnight with nacl and then a 2 2 5 pv of a 10 3 mg ml 1 4 107 particles ml 1 dnacol suspension in nacl under continuous mixing was injected in the column followed by at least 3 pv flushing with dnacol free solution the column was flushed overnight with cacl2 and then a 2 2 5 pv of a 10 3 mg ml 1 4 107 particles ml 1 dnacol suspension in cacl2 under continuous mixing was injected in the column followed by at least 3 pv flushing with dnacol free solution so per column a total of 4 experiments were carried out the tubing pore volume was negligible for a number of experiments extra milli q water flush in see table 1 at the end of the experiment we applied a 3 pv flush of demineralized water in order to mimic transient chemistry conditions and to possibly re entrain previously attached dnacol most experiments were carried out in duplicate for each experiment 0 8 ml column effluent was collected in a 20 ml centrifuge tube using a fraction collector omnicoll lambda laboratory systems switzerland of this 100 μl was pipetted into a 1 5 ml eppendorf vial and stored at 4 c in the fridge for dna release and qpcr analysis later 2 4 dna

later qpcr sample preparation was carried out using a pipetting robot qiagility instrument qiagen hilden germany dna concentrations were determined using a mini opticon bio rad hercules ca usa programmed to run 400 s at 95 c and then 42 cycles of 14 s at 95 c 27 s at 58 c 25 s at 72 c results in terms of threshold cycles ct were analyzed using the bio rad cfx manager 3 1 software and applying the regression function in the cq determination mode as opposed to the manually adjustable baseline subtraction dnacol concentrations were then read from a calibration curve from duplicated samples which was prepared for each solution chemistry supporting information 2 5 modeling transport of dnacol transport of silica colloids in saturated porous media can be described by the advection

large number of advection dispersion models have been developed to describe solute and colloid transport in porous media analytically and or numerically either with one or two site kinetic attachment or adsorption selim et al 1987 van genuchten and wagenet 1989 van genuchten et al 2012 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2017 schijven and šimůnek 2002 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 in this work we used hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 to determine values of dispersivity porosity and attachment and detachment rate coefficients the first two parameters i e dispersivity λ l porosity ε were determined by fitting the nacl tracer data while for the latter two parameters first order attachment k att and detachment rate coefficients k det the dnacol breakthrough data were used by invoking porosity and dispersivity values obtained from the nacl tracer experiment whereby the code was set to log resident concentrations in doing so we excluded colloid size dependent dispersivity and mechanical equilibrium see introduction section the former assumption underestimated colloid dispersivity also gravity effects were excluded since the dnacol was small resulting in negligible restricted settling velocity as a function of column orientation and flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 the model presented here eqs 1 and 2 is implemented in the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 briefly a galerkin type linear finite element method was used for spatial discretization while finite difference methods were used to approximate temporal derivatives and a crank nicholson finite difference scheme was used for solution of the advection dispersion equation parameter optimization was carried out by first defining an objective function šimůnek et al 1998 which was then minimized using the levenberg marquardt non linear minimization method which is a weighted least squares approach based on marquardt s maximum neighborhood method marquardt 1963 we used hydrus 1d because it is open source widely used and well documented and it includes various colloid transport models including the one we used the dimensionless sticking efficiency α was then

defined as the fraction of dnacol sticking to the sand grain surface over the total dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface when α 0 then no dnacol would stick to the surface and when α 1 then all dnacol colliding would also stick the collision efficiency was determined using the tufenkji and elimelech te correlation equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 thereto 2 2 g cm 3 was assumed for the dnacol mora et al 2015 while the hamaker constant was assumed to be 0 7 10 20 j for the combination of silica water silica rhodes 2008 2 6 evaluating hypothetical dnacol removal upon traveled

we used eqs 6 and 7 to predict dnacol removal as a function of transport distance and to evaluate the usefulness of dnacol in aquifer experiments at three different distances 3 results 3 1 column breakthrough curves btcs in case of nacl from 0 to 0 5 pv the relative concentration c c0 nacl whereby c is the effluent ec value as a proxy for nacl concentration and c0 the influent ec value was around 1 10 3 see fig 1a d the values were not lower since the ec of the sand column effluent prior to nacl injection was around 1 2 μs cm 1 and the ec of the nacl tracer injected through the column was around 4 103 μs cm 1 at pv 1 c c0 nacl in all cases reached 0 5 and then continued to rise to 1 at pv 2 2 5 when c c0 nacl was 1 we stopped injection of nacl tracer we considered this to be of sufficient contrast to determine dispersivity and porosity with hydrus 1d the shape of the nacl tracer breakthrough curve also confirmed the setup of the column in all cases was adequate without leakage and the front displacement inside the column was perpendicular to flow in our experimental conditions since peclet numbers were high 1 an indication of advection dominant transport the dispersivity value of dnacol was taken from the nacl tracer experiments upon injection of dnacol in dm water c c0 dnacol started to rise slightly difference than the initial rise of the nacl tracer fig 1e h at 1 5 2 0 pv c c0 dnacol reached 1 fig 1e h during elution c c0 dnacol rapidly decreased at pv 3 4 and at pv 4 6 the tail of the breakthrough curve in most cases flattened fig 1e h in case of dnacol in nacl more specifically the coarse sand high flow case fig 1i the moment of rise rising limb plateau phase and declining limb of c c0 dnacol were comparable to c c0 dnacol in dm water in other words attachment was negligible in this case however for the fine sand and or low flow rates conditions maximum c c0 dnacol during the plateau phase decreased from 0 06 in fig 1j to 0 02 in case of fig 1k and l during elution after pv 3 5 c c0 dnacol in nacl declined sharply and after pv 4 became constant at 1 10 3 fig 1k l in case of fig 1k and l an extra milli q water flush was passed through the columns giving rise to a peak c c0 dnacol at pv 7 of 200 times the maximum c c0 dnacol during the plateau phase in fig 1l in case of dnacol in cacl2 fig 1m p maximum c c0 dnacol during the plateau phase was 0 5 fig 1m and this value decreased to 0 015 for fig 1n and o and to 0 004 for fig 1p respectively after pv 4 during elution c c0 dnacol of fig 1m remained rather high at 1 103 while for the other btcs fig 1n p c c0 dnacol during tailing was lower at 1 10 4 to 1 10 3 like in the nacl case an extra milli q water flush which was passed through the columns fig 1o and p gave rise to a peak c c0 dnacol at pv 7 of 200 times the maximum c c0 dnacol during the plateau phase fig 1p finally in some btcs e g fig 1i and j from 0 to 0 5 pv the c c0 dnacol varied between 1 10 4 and 1 10 3 this was because we used sybr green to detect dna sybr green is a non specific dye which also shows amplification of non target dna in fact when c c0 dnacol was 1 10 4 the detection limit of the qpcr analysis was reached see supporting information for details regarding the standard curves negative control or no template control ntc the lowest limit of detection level the cutoff value was assigned to ct 30 3 2 modeling with hydrus and determining sticking efficiencies all dnacol btcs could be well fitted with an attachment rate k att and a detachment rate coefficient k det except for the experiment in cacl2 fine sand low flow yielding very low breakthrough the r2 values of the models ranged between 25 and 92 table 2 fitted curves overestimated c c0 dnacol between pv 2 and 3 which gave rise to somewhat lowered r2 values attachment of dnacol in dm water was lowest with k att ranging from 2 68 10 4 to 9 37 10 3 while in cacl2 k att of dnacol was highest and ranged from 5 78 10 3 to 1 97 10 1 for detachment we observed the opposite in dm water k det ranged from 2 32 10 3 to 1 07 10 1 and was relatively high while in cacl2 k det ranged from 8 56 10 6 to 5 25 10 2 which was relatively speaking the lowest set of detachment rate coefficients we identified three reasons for the 25 92 efficiency variations firstly the high sensitivity of the qpcr technique which is essentially an enzyme based technique to determine concentrations we used in detecting target dna in each sample a variation error of cq values was inevitable because errors may propagate from pipetting or intrinsic variances of enzymatic efficiency due to minor temperature differences in the qpcr apparatus foppen et al 2013 secondly the use of the one site kinetic model eqs 1 and 2 may have oversimplified the true dnacol transport processes in the columns thirdly we observed that the model could not capture the earlier breakthrough curve of dnacol data in several cases this limitation was associated with assigning the dispersivity value of nacl tracer to the dnacol as mentioned in the methods section such assumption can lead to underestimation of the colloid dispersivity from k att values determined with hydrus we calculated the sticking efficiency values of the dnacol per experiment by making use of eq 3 table 2 in dm water sticking efficiencies ranged from 0 008 0 27 and in both nacl and cacl2 sticking efficiencies ranged from 0 02 to 1 56 based on these values we concluded that sticking efficiencies in dm water were relatively lowest while in nacl and cacl2 they were highest also there was no significant difference between the use of either nacl or cacl2 solution chemistry when applying dnacol sticking efficiencies higher than 1 are physically impossible since the fraction sticking to the sand grain surface cannot exceed the total fraction dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface we attributed this to the irregular shapes of the collector silica grains the correlation equation we used in order to determine single collector efficiency was essentially developed for spherical collectors and not irregularly shaped collector grains which likely gave rise to inaccuracies in determining sticking efficiencies the calculated sticking efficiencies demonstrated that in our experiments a large fraction and in some experiments all dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface did also stick to the surface 4 discussion in this work we aimed at investigating the sensitivity of dna tagged silica particles to solution chemistry and studied mechanisms controlling transport and retention based on the hydrus 1d modeling of the observed breakthrough curves we concluded that the transport of dnacol in columns of saturated quartz sand could be well described by a first order kinetic attachment and detachment rate coefficient however for several cases we observed discrepancies between experimental data and the fitted model likely more elaborate models including two kinetic sites gravity effects colloid size dependent dispersivity and or nanoscale heterogeneity need to be invoked in order to further reduce these discrepancies which we however considered to be outside the scope of this work in their 14 5 cm sand columns saiers et al 1994 arrived at a similar description of the silica colloid removal process although their silica concentrations were much higher the silica particles smaller 91 nm and the zeta potential more negative 65 mv furthermore the ionic strength of the solutions they used was much lower 10 3 m nacl and ph 8 5 while darcian velocities 5 7 cm hr 1 were comparable to ours 2 and 10 cm hr 1 the removal of silica in their case however was less than 10 fig 1 saiers et al 1994 while in our case removal could be as high as 2 2 5 log units or more than 90 johnson et al 1996 their fig 2 used 10 cm columns of quartz sand prolate spheroidal shaped 0 32 nominal grain diameter 300 nm silica colloids in dilute 10 3 m kcl and at comparable darcian velocity or approach velocity as ours arrived at similar first order kinetic removal of silica colloids whereby their silica colloid removal rates less than 5 were in the same range as saiers et al 1994 we think this difference is due to a combination of higher ionic strength used 3 3 10 2 m nacl and 4 1 10 2 m cacl2 in our work larger dnacol diameter and a less negative zeta potential of the dnacol ionic strength matters as is clear from the work of zeng et al 2017 liu et al 2017 and wang et al 2012 these authors used a first order kinetic removal mechanism and observed a decrease in maximum relative concentration as a function of ionic strength of the solution on the other hand under high salinity conditions 8 10 w v nacl cacl2 brines kim et al 2015 observed aggregation of silica colloids which could be transported through a 30 cm column of 0 35 mm ottawa sand the high darcian flow 71 m day 1 kim et al 2015 used could well have contributed to the lack of first order kinetic attachment in addition to first order kinetic attachment we used a first order kinetic rate constant to describe detachment of previously attached particles while maintaining identical ionic strength conditions in all cases detachment during the tail of the breakthrough curve from pv 4 6 did not lead to high c c0 dnacol values and was a few orders of magnitude lower than maximum c c0 dnacol from pv 2 3 detachment rate constants were generally higher for the dm water cases plus the fast flow coarse sand experiments while in most experiments using nacl and cacl2 solutions detachment rate constants were low in the order of 10 4 10 5 despite the use of a first order kinetic detachment rate constant in literature without exception silica colloid breakthrough curves are shown using a linear vertical axis liu et al 2017 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 saiers et al 1994 johnson et al 1996 vitorge et al 2014 2014a emphasizing the effect of flow velocity on the normalized peak value concentration and the type of plateau e g steady state increasing or decreasing over time but which does not make clear how un important the detachment process is for the low flow nacl and cacl2 cases fig 1k l o and p at the end of the experiment when we applied a flush of milli q water we observed massive reentrainment of previously attached particles zeng et al 2017 also observed massive reentrainment of silica colloids due to dm water flushing at the end of their experiments which was up to 800 times maximum c c0 they attributed this to strong electrostatic repulsion between sand collector and silica colloids as the surfaces of both materials possessed a high concentration of negative charge under the experimental conditions used zeng et al 2017 also liu et al 2017 at the end of the column experiment after a flush of demineralised water observed reentrainment of silica colloids up to 0 9 times maximum c c0 their two site dynamic model fitting results showed that reversible retention was related to first order straining since the average diameter of the dnacol in our case was 270 nm and the median of the finest grain size we used was 565 μm the ratio of the two was 4 8 10 4 which was well below 0 003 defined by bradford et al 2007 to be the lowest ratio for spherical grains at which straining would occur in other words in our case we think straining was relatively unimportant and the observed reentrainment was due to electrostatic interaction variations as a result of the transient chemistry conditions we applied in order to make our case we calculated the dlvo profiles and added them to the supporting information since all zeta potential values were more negative than 20 mv we assumed aggregation did not take place in our column experiments from the dlvo profiles a primary energy minimum and secondary energy minimum appeared for both nacl and cacl2 however in case of nacl the energy barrier was higher 600 kbt than for cacl2 100 kbt possibly giving rise to more attachment in the primary energy minimum for the latter case furthermore the massive reentrainment of the attached dnacol when we applied the flushing step of milli q water to the soil columns after nacl and cacl2 experiments was well explained by the dlvo profile in milli q water from calculating the sticking efficiencies we concluded that a large fraction if not all dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface did also stick to that sand grain surface from the reentrainment of dnacol under transient chemistry conditions we also conclude that in terms of dlvo theory a large fraction of retained dnacol resided in the secondary energy minimum hereby we assumed a negative charge for both silica sand and dnacol giving rise to a primary energy minimum due to attractive van der waals forces at close distance of the sand grain nm range an energy barrier further away followed by a secondary energy minimum as a result of the net electrostatic forces between dnacol and sand grain in literature we have not come across sticking efficiency values for silica colloid silica collector grains under conditions of similarly charged surfaces from transport of bacteria and viruses in aquifers we know that sticking efficiencies must be in the order of 10 4 for viruses and 10 3 for bacteria in order to be able to travel through an aquifer e g foppen and schijven 2006 as sticking efficiencies in the order of 0 1 1 lead to the immediate removal of the biocolloid at short distance from where it enters the aquifer assuming a sticking efficiency of 0 59 which is the average of all our experiments and a darcy flow velocity of 300 m y 1 and a porosity of 0 35 we determined the relative dnacol concentration as a function of transport distance fig 2 upon traveling through aquifers composed of 1 5 mm size silica grains if the vial of 1 ml 10 mg ml 1 dnacol suspension we used in this study equal to 4 1011 particles ml 1 would have been completely diluted in 1 l aquifer water which would have been injected into the aquifer without further dilution and if we assume a lowest limit of detection of 5 individual dnacol in a 4 μl sample in a qpcr well or 1 25 105 dnacol per l then a removal of 4 1011 1 25 105 3 2 106 can be allowed for detection this assumes no further dilution will take place due to diverging or converging flow lines in the aquifer e g due to injection or abstraction also this assumes the aquifer is fully composed of negative surface charge which is due to the presence of minerals like calcite or iron iii oxyhydroxide coatings around aquifer grains not very realistic in such cases removal of dnacol will likely be higher li and cathles 2014 johnson et al 1996 ryan et al 1999 finally this assumes no detachment is taking place which is not true in reality detachment takes place but with such slow detachment rate that it has negligible effect for an aquifer composed of 1 mm silica grains the maximum traveled distance would be 5 m and for a 5 mm silica grain aquifer maximum travel distance would be 20 m larger transport distances are of course possible by increasing dnacol injection mass or by up concentrating sample volumes this example serves to illustrate the potential of dnacol for fine grained aquifers e g silts clays or mixtures dnacol will have limited applicability under natural groundwater chemistry since the particle will not travel very far straining of dnacol in such conditions will of course further limit dnacol transport also due to this dnacol mass loss attachment straining etc it will be impossible to determine the entire dnacol mass and to prepare a mass balance also since chemical conditions in the aquifer will be transient in nature by default previously attached dnacol can likely be reentrained for aquifers predominantly composed of silica dnacol can be used in high concentrations in case of short distance high flow coarse aquifer grain conditions to map contaminant sources understand flowpaths and determine travel times there is a fair chance the aquifer grains will be covered by a layer of humic substances and or a biofilm in those cases reaching the secondary minimum might be sterically hindered which reduces dnacol attachment and increases transport distance on the other hand zhang et al 2020 observed clustering of si nanoparticles and humic acid due to calcium bridging which increased retention due to the presence of ca2 so those same humic substances can also increase attachment and reduce transport distance finally the dnacol can be pre conditioned whereby the formation of an eco corona at the outer surface of each individual dna silica colloid is allowed to take place e g xu et al 2020 galloway et al 2017 lynch et al 2014 in order to reduce removal and to enhance dnacol transport for those conditions the fate of each unique dnacol should be studied and more research work is required 5 conclusions we are the first to explore the deposition kinetics of this new dna tagged silica tracer for different pore water chemistries flow rates and sand grain size distributions in a series of saturated sand column experiments in order to predict environmental conditions for which the dna tagged silica tracer can best be employed based on the hydrus modeling of the observed breakthrough curves we concluded that the transport of the dnacol in columns of saturated quartz sand could be well described by a first order kinetic attachment and detachment rate coefficient attachment was primarily in the secondary energy minimum so the dnacol could be reentrained under transient flow conditions based on calculated average sticking efficiencies we concluded that a large fraction if not all the dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface did also stick to that sand grain surface therefore the potential of current dnacol as a tracer for fine grained aquifers e g fine sand silts and natural groundwater will be limited since the particle will not travel very far for such cases dnacol with different physio chemical characteristics need to be developed for sandy aquifers the dnacol can be used potentially in high concentrations in case of short distance i e meter scale high flow velocities coarse aquifer grain conditions and distinct preferential flow paths to map contaminant sources understand flowpaths and determine travel times overall the dnacol exhibited some limitations for the application as a generic hydrological tracer in subsurface flow especially in the presence of fine grains or low flow velocity despite such limitations dnacol showed potential to be used as colloidal tracer to study fate and transport of biological

1329,in recent years dna tagged silica colloids have been used as an environmental tracer a major advantage of this technique is that the dna coding provides an unlimited number of unique tracers without a background concentration however little is known about the effects of physio chemical subsurface properties on the transport behavior of dna tagged silica tracers we are the first to explore the deposition kinetics of this new dna tagged silica tracer for different pore water chemistries flow rates and sand grain size distributions in a series of saturated sand column experiments in order to predict environmental conditions for which the dna tagged silica tracer can best be employed our results indicated that the transport of dna tagged silica tracer can be well described by first order kinetic attachment and detachment because of massive re entrainment under transient chemistry conditions we inferred that attachment was primarily in the secondary energy minimum based on calculated sticking efficiencies of the dna tagged silica tracer to the sand grains we concluded that a large fraction of the dna tagged silica tracer colliding with the sand grain surface did also stick to that surface when the ionic strength of the system was higher the experimental results revealed the sensitivity of dna tagged silica tracer to both physical and chemical factors this reduces its applicability as a conservative hydrological tracer for studying subsurface flow paths based on our experiments the dna tagged silica tracer is best applicable for studying flow routes and travel times in coarse grained aquifers with a relatively high flow rate dna tagged silica tracers may also be applied for simulating the transport of engineered or biological colloidal pollution such as microplastics and pathogens keywords dna tagged silica colloids tracer solution chemistry 1 introduction tracers are widely used in hydrological studies such as tracking contamination in the subsurface in recent years dna tagged silica colloids abbreviated to dnacol have been used as an environmental tracer in various applications e g in fractured reservoir characterization zhang et al 2015 in a coarse grained aquifer mikutis et al 2018 in fractured crystalline rock kittilä et al 2019 and at smaller scale for tomographic reservoir imaging kong et al 2018 the use of silica colloids tagged with dna is not limited to water and oil applications examples include pesticide spraying mora et al 2015 and waste water sludge grass et al 2014 more recently dnacol were also used as a surrogate model to study the microbial transmission in healthcare scotoni et al 2020 and in the setting up of a dna of things as the storage material koch et al 2020 the main advantages of tagging silica colloids with dna are that it gives the colloids a unique dna sequence and enables analysis at low concentrations using standard microbial techniques e g quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr these properties provide us with a virtually unlimited amount of unique tracer particles which make dnacol a promising tool for hydrological and colloidal contaminant transport research transport

silica colloids can enhance contaminant transport dai et al 2020 hou et al 2021 mendes de oliveira et al 2017 qin et al 2020 in the subsurface therefore all of the aforementioned physicochemical factors can influence aggregation deposition and remobilization of colloidal matter to better predict the behavior of dnacol as a tracer or surrogate we conducted a series of saturated sand column experiments the objective of this study was two fold first to systematically explore the use of dnacol in columns of quartz sand in order to compare deposition kinetics with existing literature second we wanted to identify removal of dnacol under various saturated porous media conditions in order to start predicting their value in environmental applications thereto we carried out column experiments with dnacol in which we varied solution chemistry flow rate and grain size in addition we used hydrus 1d to quantify transport parameters and assist in analyzing colloid grain surface interaction processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 the dna tagged silica particle the dnacol was composed of a silica outer shell sio2 a layer of dna molecules and a silica core paunescu et al 2013 a 1 ml 10 mg ml 1 dnacol suspension equal to 4 1011 particles ml 1 paunescu et al 2013 was kindly fabricated and provided by the functional materials laboratory group at eth zurich average diameter of dna tagged silica particles was 270 nm and density of 2 2 g cm 1 mora et al 2015 the double stranded dna sequence which was sandwiched between silica core and protective cover layer was 80 nucleotides long details in the supporting information prior to use dnacol was washed in a diluted commercial bleach solution 10 μl bleach to 10 ml water to ensure no free dna in suspension then 1000 diluted dnacol batches 5 μl to 5 ml dnacol concentration 0 001 mg ml 1 or 4 107 particles ml 1 were prepared in milli q water nacl 33 mm ph 5 5 and cacl2 41 mm ph 5 8 the effect of solution chemistries on the

c temperature and the dielectric constant of water medium 78 54 thereto three dnacol batches were prepared in milli q water resistivity 18 mω cm nacl is 33 mm ph 5 5 and cacl2 is 41 mm ph 5 8 in a 10 ppm concentration 0 01 mg ml 1 after vortexing ζ was 42 5 5 3 mv in milli q water 33 9 6 1 mv in nacl and 20 7 3 3 mv in cacl2 solution respectively we used these values for dlvo calculations see supporting information 2 2 porous medium we used two different sand types one was quartz sand j t baker inc phillipsburg new jersey sieved to a fraction of 1000 1400 μm grain size range coarse sand and the other was so called silver sand m31 sibelco belgium sieved to a fraction of 500 630 μm grain size range fine sand to remove impurities the sands were soaked in 65 concentrated 4 n hno3 solution for 2 h at 100 c after cooling the acid was decanted and the sand was rinsed repeatedly with deionized water until the ph stabilized around 7 and the electrical conductivity of the rinse water became less than 1 2 μs cm 1 then the acid washed sand was oven dried for 24 h at 105 c the clean and dry sand was stored in a capped container for further use the zeta potential of both fine and coarse sand was determined with a crushed fraction thereto both fine and coarse sand were ground manually using a mortar and pestle then 0 5 g of crushed sand was added to 10 ml of each milli q water nacl and cacl2 solution each suspension was vortexed three times and allowed to settle for 2 min the supernatant was used for measuring the zeta potential the ξ for fine sand was 34 4 5 4 mv in milli q water 39 4 5 4 mv in nacl and 15 3 4 3 mv in cacl2 while for coarse sand it was 33 1 4 7 mv in milli q water 41 2 7 1 mv in nacl and 11 3 4 5 mv in cacl2 the mean and standard deviation values are calculated from the average of mean and standard deviation of triplicate measurements 2 3 column experiments soil column experiments were conducted with adjustable height chromatography columns made of borosilicate glass omnifit cambridge uk the column with an inner diameter of 2 5 cm was wet packed with one of the two sands to a height of 6 5 cm before packing the column co2 gas was flushed into the dry sand to increase wettability of the sand upon wet packing during wet packing the column was vibrated with a plastic bar to facilitate uniform packing after connecting the pump demineralized water was injected in an upward direction at a constant flow rate typically two columns were prepared one with fine sand and one with coarse sand these columns were run in parallel at similar pump speed see table 1 for an overview first 2 2 5 pore volumes of nacl solution was injected in order to determine dispersivity and porosity of the sand thereto at specific time intervals as a proxy for nacl concentration the electrical conductivity ec of the effluent was measured then the influent solution was switched back to demineralized water dm water to flush out remaining nacl solution next a 2 2 5 pore volumes pv of a 10 3 mg ml 1 4 107 particles ml 1 dnacol suspension in dm water under continuous mixing was injected in the column followed by at least 3 pv flushing with dnacol free solution the column was flushed overnight with nacl and then a 2 2 5 pv of a 10 3 mg ml 1 4 107 particles ml 1 dnacol suspension in nacl under continuous mixing was injected in the column followed by at least 3 pv flushing with dnacol free solution the column was flushed overnight with cacl2 and then a 2 2 5 pv of a 10 3 mg ml 1 4 107 particles ml 1 dnacol suspension in cacl2 under continuous mixing was injected in the column followed by at least 3 pv flushing with dnacol free solution so per column a total of 4 experiments were carried out the tubing pore volume was negligible for a number of experiments extra milli q water flush in see table 1 at the end of the experiment we applied a 3 pv flush of demineralized water in order to mimic transient chemistry conditions and to possibly re entrain previously attached dnacol most experiments were carried out in duplicate for each experiment 0 8 ml column effluent was collected in a 20 ml centrifuge tube using a fraction

applying the regression function in the cq determination mode as opposed to the manually adjustable baseline subtraction dnacol concentrations were then read from a calibration curve from duplicated samples which was prepared for each solution chemistry supporting information 2 5 modeling transport of dnacol transport of silica colloids in saturated porous media can be described by the advection

large number of advection dispersion models have been developed to describe solute and colloid transport in porous media analytically and or numerically either with one or two site kinetic attachment or adsorption selim et al 1987 van genuchten and wagenet 1989 van genuchten et al 2012 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2017 schijven and šimůnek 2002 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2019 in this work we used hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 to determine values of dispersivity porosity and attachment and detachment rate coefficients the first two parameters i e dispersivity λ l porosity ε were determined by fitting the nacl tracer data while for the latter two parameters first order attachment k att and detachment rate coefficients k det the dnacol breakthrough data were used by invoking porosity and dispersivity values obtained from the nacl tracer experiment whereby the code was set to log resident concentrations in doing so we excluded colloid size dependent dispersivity and mechanical equilibrium see introduction section the former assumption underestimated colloid dispersivity also gravity effects were excluded since the dnacol was small resulting in negligible restricted settling velocity as a function of column orientation and flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 the model presented here eqs 1 and 2 is implemented in the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 briefly a galerkin type linear finite element method was used for spatial discretization while finite difference methods were used to approximate temporal derivatives and a crank nicholson finite difference scheme was used for solution of the advection dispersion equation parameter optimization was carried out by first defining an objective function šimůnek et al 1998 which was then minimized using the levenberg marquardt non linear minimization method which is a weighted least squares approach based on marquardt s maximum neighborhood method marquardt 1963 we used hydrus 1d because it is open source widely used and well documented and it includes various colloid transport models including the one we used the dimensionless sticking efficiency α was then

defined as the fraction of dnacol sticking to the sand grain surface over the total dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface when α 0 then no dnacol would stick to the surface and when α 1 then all dnacol colliding would also stick the collision efficiency was determined using the tufenkji and elimelech te correlation equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 thereto 2 2 g cm 3 was assumed for the dnacol mora et al 2015 while the hamaker constant was assumed to be 0 7 10 20 j for the combination of silica water silica rhodes 2008 2 6 evaluating hypothetical dnacol removal upon traveled

breakthrough curves btcs in case of nacl from 0 to 0 5 pv the relative concentration c c0 nacl whereby c is the effluent ec value as a proxy for nacl concentration and c0 the influent ec value was around 1 10 3 see fig 1a d the values were not lower since the ec of the sand column effluent prior to nacl injection was around 1 2 μs cm 1 and the ec of the nacl tracer injected through the column was around 4 103 μs cm 1 at pv 1 c c0 nacl in all cases reached 0 5 and then continued to rise to 1 at pv 2 2 5 when c c0 nacl was 1 we stopped injection of nacl tracer we considered this to be of sufficient contrast to determine dispersivity and porosity with hydrus 1d the shape of the nacl tracer breakthrough curve also confirmed the setup of the column in all cases was adequate without leakage and the front displacement inside the column was perpendicular to flow in our experimental conditions since peclet numbers were high 1 an indication of advection dominant transport the dispersivity value of dnacol was taken from the nacl tracer experiments upon injection of dnacol in dm water c c0 dnacol started to rise slightly difference than the initial rise of the nacl tracer fig 1e h at 1 5 2 0 pv c c0 dnacol reached 1 fig 1e h during elution c c0 dnacol rapidly decreased at pv 3 4 and at pv 4 6 the tail of the breakthrough curve in most cases flattened fig 1e h in case of dnacol in nacl more specifically the coarse sand high flow case fig 1i the moment of rise rising limb plateau phase and declining limb of c c0 dnacol were comparable to c c0 dnacol in dm water in other words attachment was negligible in this case however for the fine sand and or low flow rates conditions maximum c c0 dnacol during the plateau phase decreased from 0 06 in fig 1j to 0 02 in case of fig 1k and l during elution after pv 3 5 c c0 dnacol in nacl declined sharply and after pv 4 became constant at 1 10 3 fig 1k l in case of fig 1k and l an extra milli q water flush was passed through the columns giving rise to a peak c c0 dnacol at pv 7 of 200 times the maximum c c0 dnacol during the plateau phase in fig 1l in case of dnacol in cacl2 fig 1m p maximum c c0 dnacol during the plateau phase was 0 5 fig 1m and this value decreased to 0 015 for fig 1n and o and to 0 004 for fig 1p respectively after pv 4 during elution c c0 dnacol of fig 1m remained rather high at 1 103 while for the other btcs fig 1n p c c0 dnacol during tailing was lower at 1 10 4 to 1 10 3 like in the nacl case an extra milli q water flush which was passed through the columns fig 1o and p gave rise to a peak c c0 dnacol at pv 7 of 200 times the maximum c c0 dnacol during the plateau phase fig 1p finally in some btcs e g fig 1i and j from 0 to 0 5 pv the c c0 dnacol varied between 1 10 4 and 1 10 3 this was because we used sybr green to detect dna sybr green is a non specific dye which also shows amplification of non target dna in fact when c c0 dnacol was 1 10 4 the detection limit of the qpcr analysis was reached see supporting information for details regarding the standard curves negative control or no template control ntc the lowest limit of detection level the cutoff value was assigned to ct 30 3 2 modeling with hydrus and determining sticking efficiencies all dnacol btcs could be well fitted with an attachment rate k att and a detachment rate coefficient k det except for the experiment in cacl2 fine sand low flow yielding very low breakthrough the r2 values of the models ranged between 25 and 92 table 2 fitted curves overestimated c c0 dnacol between pv 2 and 3 which gave rise to somewhat lowered r2 values attachment of dnacol in dm water was lowest with k att ranging from 2 68 10 4 to 9 37 10 3 while in cacl2 k att of dnacol was highest and ranged from 5 78 10 3 to 1 97 10 1 for detachment we observed the opposite in dm water k det ranged from 2 32 10 3 to 1 07 10 1 and was relatively high while in cacl2 k det ranged from 8 56 10 6 to 5 25 10 2 which was relatively speaking the lowest set of detachment rate coefficients we identified three reasons for the 25 92 efficiency variations firstly the high sensitivity of the qpcr technique which is essentially an enzyme based technique to determine concentrations we used in detecting target dna in each sample a variation error of cq values was inevitable because errors may propagate from pipetting or intrinsic variances of enzymatic efficiency due to minor temperature differences in the qpcr apparatus foppen et al 2013 secondly the use of the one site kinetic model eqs 1 and 2 may have oversimplified the true dnacol transport processes in the columns thirdly we observed that the model could not capture the earlier breakthrough curve of dnacol data in several cases this limitation was associated with assigning the dispersivity value of nacl tracer to the dnacol as mentioned in the methods section such assumption can lead to underestimation of the colloid dispersivity from k att values determined with hydrus we calculated the sticking efficiency values of the dnacol per experiment by making use of eq 3 table 2 in dm water sticking efficiencies ranged from 0 008 0 27 and in both nacl and cacl2 sticking efficiencies ranged from 0 02 to 1 56 based on these values we concluded that sticking efficiencies in dm water were relatively lowest while in nacl and cacl2 they were highest also there was no significant difference between the use of either nacl or cacl2 solution chemistry when applying dnacol sticking efficiencies higher than 1 are physically impossible since the fraction sticking to the sand grain surface cannot exceed the total fraction dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface we attributed this to the irregular shapes of the collector silica grains the correlation equation we used in order to determine single collector efficiency was essentially developed for spherical collectors and not irregularly shaped collector grains which likely gave rise to inaccuracies in determining sticking efficiencies the calculated sticking efficiencies demonstrated that in our experiments a large fraction and in some experiments all dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface did also stick to the surface 4 discussion in this work we aimed at investigating the sensitivity of dna tagged silica particles to solution chemistry and studied mechanisms controlling transport and retention based on the hydrus 1d modeling of the observed breakthrough curves we concluded that the transport of dnacol in columns of saturated quartz sand could be well described by a first order kinetic attachment and detachment rate coefficient however for several cases we observed discrepancies between experimental data and the fitted model likely more elaborate models including two kinetic sites gravity effects colloid size dependent dispersivity and or nanoscale heterogeneity need to be invoked in order to further reduce these discrepancies which we however considered to be outside the scope of this work in their 14 5 cm sand columns saiers et al 1994 arrived at a similar description of the silica colloid removal process although their silica concentrations were much higher the silica particles smaller 91 nm and the zeta potential more negative 65 mv furthermore the ionic strength of the solutions they used was much lower 10 3 m nacl and ph 8 5 while darcian velocities 5 7 cm hr 1 were comparable to ours 2 and 10 cm hr 1 the removal of silica in their case however was less than 10 fig 1 saiers et al 1994 while in our case removal could be as high as 2 2 5 log units or more than 90 johnson et al 1996 their fig 2 used 10 cm columns of quartz sand prolate spheroidal shaped 0 32 nominal grain diameter 300 nm silica colloids in dilute 10 3 m kcl and at comparable darcian velocity or approach velocity as ours arrived at similar first order kinetic removal of silica colloids whereby their silica colloid removal rates less than 5 were in the same range as saiers et al 1994 we think this difference is due to a combination of higher ionic strength used 3 3 10 2 m nacl and 4 1 10 2 m cacl2 in our work larger dnacol diameter and a less negative zeta potential of the dnacol ionic strength matters as is clear from the work of zeng et al 2017 liu et al 2017 and wang et al 2012 these authors used a first order kinetic removal mechanism and observed a decrease in maximum relative concentration as a function of ionic strength of the solution on the other hand under high salinity conditions 8 10 w v nacl cacl2 brines kim et al 2015 observed aggregation of silica colloids which could be transported through a 30 cm column of 0 35 mm ottawa sand the high darcian flow 71 m day 1 kim et al 2015 used could well have contributed to the lack of first order kinetic attachment in addition to first order kinetic attachment we used a first order kinetic rate constant to describe detachment of previously attached particles while maintaining identical ionic strength conditions in all cases detachment during the tail of the breakthrough curve from pv 4 6 did not lead to high c c0 dnacol values and was a few orders of magnitude lower than maximum c c0 dnacol from pv 2 3 detachment rate constants were generally higher for the dm water cases plus the fast flow coarse sand experiments while in most experiments using nacl and cacl2 solutions detachment rate constants were low in the order of 10 4 10 5 despite the use of a first order kinetic detachment rate constant in literature without exception silica colloid breakthrough curves are shown using a linear vertical axis liu et al 2017 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2012 zeng et al 2017 saiers et al 1994 johnson et al 1996 vitorge et al 2014 2014a emphasizing the effect of flow velocity on the normalized peak value concentration and the type of plateau e g steady state increasing or decreasing over time but which does not make clear how un important the detachment process is for the low flow nacl and cacl2 cases fig 1k l o and p at the end of the experiment when we applied a flush of milli q water we observed massive reentrainment of previously attached particles zeng et al 2017 also observed massive reentrainment of silica colloids due to dm water flushing at the end of their experiments which was up to 800 times maximum c c0 they attributed this to strong electrostatic repulsion between sand collector and silica colloids as the surfaces of both materials possessed a high concentration of negative charge under the experimental conditions used zeng et al 2017 also liu et al 2017 at the end of the column experiment after a flush of demineralised water observed reentrainment of silica colloids up to 0 9 times maximum c c0 their two site dynamic model fitting results showed that reversible retention was related to first order straining since the average diameter of the dnacol in our case was 270 nm and the median of the finest grain size we used was 565 μm the ratio of the two was 4 8 10 4 which was well below 0 003 defined by bradford et al 2007 to be the lowest ratio for spherical grains at which straining would occur in other words in our case we think straining was relatively unimportant and the observed reentrainment was due to electrostatic interaction variations as a result of the transient chemistry conditions we applied in order to make our case we calculated the dlvo profiles and added them to the supporting information since all zeta potential values were more negative than 20 mv we assumed aggregation did not take place in our column experiments from the dlvo profiles a primary energy minimum and secondary energy minimum appeared for both nacl and cacl2 however in case of nacl the energy barrier was higher 600 kbt than for cacl2 100 kbt possibly giving rise to more attachment in the primary energy minimum for the latter case furthermore the massive reentrainment of the attached dnacol when we applied the flushing step of milli q water to the soil columns after nacl and cacl2 experiments was well explained by the dlvo profile in milli q water from calculating the sticking efficiencies we concluded that a large fraction if not all dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface did also stick to that sand grain surface from the reentrainment of dnacol under transient chemistry conditions we also conclude that in terms of dlvo theory a large fraction of retained dnacol resided in the secondary energy minimum hereby we assumed a negative charge for both silica sand and dnacol giving rise to a primary energy minimum due to attractive van der waals forces at close distance of the sand grain nm range an energy barrier further away followed by a secondary energy minimum as a result of the net electrostatic forces between dnacol and sand grain in literature we have not come across sticking efficiency values for silica colloid silica collector grains under conditions of similarly charged surfaces from transport of bacteria and viruses in aquifers we know that sticking efficiencies must be in the order of 10 4 for viruses and 10 3 for bacteria in order to be able to travel through an aquifer e g foppen and schijven 2006 as sticking efficiencies in the order of 0 1 1 lead to the immediate removal of the biocolloid at short distance from where it enters the aquifer assuming a sticking efficiency of 0 59 which is the average of all our experiments and a darcy flow velocity of 300 m y 1 and a porosity of 0 35 we determined the relative dnacol concentration as a function of transport distance fig 2 upon traveling through aquifers composed of 1 5 mm size silica grains if the vial of 1 ml 10 mg ml 1 dnacol suspension we used in this study equal to 4 1011 particles ml 1 would have been completely diluted in 1 l aquifer water which would have been injected into the aquifer without further dilution and if we assume a lowest limit of detection of 5 individual dnacol in a 4 μl sample in a qpcr well or 1 25 105 dnacol per l then a removal of 4 1011 1 25 105 3 2 106 can be allowed for detection this assumes no further dilution will take place due to diverging or converging flow lines in the aquifer e g due to injection or abstraction also this assumes the aquifer is fully composed of negative surface charge which is due to the presence of minerals like calcite or iron iii oxyhydroxide coatings around aquifer grains not very realistic in such cases removal of dnacol will likely be higher li and cathles 2014 johnson et al 1996 ryan et al 1999 finally this assumes no detachment is taking place which is not true in reality detachment takes place but with such slow detachment rate that it has negligible effect for an aquifer composed of 1 mm silica grains the maximum traveled distance would be 5 m and for a 5 mm silica grain aquifer maximum travel distance would be 20 m larger transport distances are of course possible by increasing dnacol injection mass or by up concentrating sample volumes this example serves to illustrate the potential of dnacol for fine grained aquifers e g silts clays or mixtures dnacol will have limited applicability under natural groundwater chemistry since the particle will not travel very far straining of dnacol in such conditions will of course further limit dnacol transport also due to this dnacol mass loss attachment straining etc it will be impossible to determine the entire dnacol mass and to prepare a mass balance also since chemical conditions in the aquifer will be transient in nature by default previously attached dnacol can likely be reentrained for aquifers predominantly composed of silica dnacol can be used in high concentrations in case of short distance high flow coarse aquifer grain conditions to map contaminant sources understand flowpaths and determine travel times there is a fair chance the aquifer grains will be covered by a layer of humic substances and or a biofilm in those cases reaching the secondary minimum might be sterically hindered which reduces dnacol attachment and increases transport distance on the other hand zhang et al 2020 observed clustering of si nanoparticles and humic acid due to calcium bridging which increased retention due to the presence of ca2 so those same humic substances can also increase attachment and reduce transport distance finally the dnacol can be pre conditioned whereby the formation of an eco corona at the outer surface of each individual dna silica colloid is allowed to take place e g xu et al 2020 galloway et al 2017 lynch et al 2014 in order to reduce removal and to enhance dnacol transport for those conditions the fate of each unique dnacol should be studied and more research work is required 5 conclusions we are the first to explore the deposition kinetics of this new dna tagged silica tracer for different pore water chemistries flow rates and sand grain size distributions in a series of saturated sand column experiments in order to predict environmental conditions for which the dna tagged silica tracer can best be employed based on the hydrus modeling of the observed breakthrough curves we concluded that the transport of the dnacol in columns of saturated quartz sand could be well described by a first order kinetic attachment and detachment rate coefficient attachment was primarily in the secondary energy minimum so the dnacol could be reentrained under transient flow conditions based on calculated average sticking efficiencies we concluded that a large fraction if not all the dnacol colliding with the sand grain surface did also stick to that sand grain surface therefore the potential of current dnacol as a tracer for fine grained aquifers e g fine sand silts and natural groundwater will be limited since the particle will not travel very far for such cases dnacol with different physio chemical characteristics need to be developed for sandy aquifers the dnacol can be used potentially in high concentrations in case of short distance i e meter scale high flow velocities coarse aquifer grain conditions and distinct preferential flow paths to map contaminant sources understand flowpaths and determine travel times overall the dnacol exhibited some limitations for the application as a generic hydrological tracer in subsurface flow especially in the presence of fine grains or low flow velocity despite such limitations dnacol showed potential to be used as colloidal tracer to study fate and transport of biological
