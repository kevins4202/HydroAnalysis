8745,semiconductor based photocatalysts have been an efficient technology for water and wastewater remediation addressing the concepts of green chemistry and sustainable development owing to narrow and suitable band structure biobr is a promising candidate for efficient wastewater treatment via photocatalysis enhancement of photocatalytic properties can be obtained by various techniques like doping element rich strategy facet engineering and defect control this review primarily focuses on the band engineering of single biobr its binary ternary composites and their applications in degradation of hazardous pollutants in wastewater moreover current challenges and future perspectives were discussed along with concluding comments graphical abstract image 1 keywords bismuth oxybromide biobr composites nanomaterials heterojunction heterogeneous catalysis radicals data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction industrialization has been a beneficial factor in our lives but it is also caused of environmental pollution including air water and soil pollution the rapid increase in the population has increased this pollution particularly water pollution which is a major challenge that is threatening the existence of the human world 1 2 reports suggest the presence of a variety of pollutants in wastewater including pharmaceuticals heavy metals dyes and other organic pollutants 3 6 these contaminants create huge problems for the environment in general and the human population in particular reportedly there is an abundance of pharmaceutical products such as antibiotics and other drugs in water bodies and it results in the generation of antibiotics resistance among bacteria rendering them ineffective and also cause major health risks to humankind 7 8 limited exposure to heavy metals has minimal effect on environment but long term exposure is hazardous for humans leading to the failure of human body systems most of the heavy metals are carcinogenic and they cause skin diseases kidney failure lung damage and fragility of bones 4 9 dyes present in the wastewater are toxic to aquatic life and cause cancers in human beings 10 12 summarily dyes containing wastewater is highly hazardous for ecosystem and the health of living beings it should be treated before entering into water bodies it is a prerequisite for good human health to drink clean water free from toxic materials such as pharmaceuticals dyes heavy metals organic waste and harmful microorganisms a report published by the united nations on world water development suggests an increase in the demand for clean water by nearly one third in next 30 years 13 other than primary requirement of clean water for human health various industries such as food electronics and pharmaceuticals also need clean and potable water for their proper functioning 8 14 to reduce the health risks environmental hazards and to meet world water demands it is needed to effectively treat the wastewater however conventional techniques for wastewater remediation process are not efficient enough to remove emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals dyes and organic pollutants 15 16 owing to the failure of conventional wastewater treatment plants in handling of aforementioned contaminants it is essentially needed to develop new technologies for proper removal of these hazardous materials 17 for wastewater treatment aimed at removal of these chemically stable highly persistent and non biodegradable contaminants various advanced technologies have been employed these advanced wastewater treatment technologies include electrochemical reduction 18 membrane filtration 12 19 precipitation 20 electrodialysis 21 photocatalysis 22 23 and electrodeionization 24 these technologies except photocatalysis are not suitable for wastewater treatment in terms of efficiency and economy large intake of energy complicated process wastes and by products formation are the major disadvantages of these techniques among all of these photocatalysis is the best technique owing to its efficiency and cost effectiveness photocatalysis is the process in which of sunlight energy is converted into chemical energy through a series of reaction steps that is further used to degrade the pollutants in wastewater it converts complex pollutants into simple and harmless molecules using mild conditions and consuming abundantly available sunlight these features make this technique very economical and environment friendly 22 25 photocatalysis is a state of the art oxidation process and it mechanism involves generation of electrons and holes after striking of sunlight photon on the surface of photocatalyst degradation reaction of wastewater contaminant is initiated by electrons and holes that are photogenerated in valence and conduction band respectively 23 26 suitable properties of semiconductor photocatalyst determine rate and efficiency of photocatalysis therefore an ideal catalyst must be chemically biologically stable photo active cost effective photo stable and reusable and must have a narrowband gap so that it can harvest the maximum portion of sunlight energy in broad spectrum owing to the importance of photocatalysis the developments and improvements in the properties of photocatalyst are widely researched areas in this field as exhibited by excellent reviews referenced here 27 29 owing to the beneficial presence of oxygen in photocatalyst various metal oxide semiconductors including fe2o3 30 tio2 3 31 32 zno 33 bi2o3 zno heterojunction 34 bi3 zno 35 ce2o3 36 bifeo3 37 and bismuth oxyhalides biox x cl br i based photocatalysts have been synthesized aimed at photocatalytic wastewater treatment 28 38 39 as compared to the conventional metal oxides biox offers more suitable properties for efficient photocatalytic process such as better chemical stability biological inertness better positioned band structure narrowband gap for maximum sunlight energy harvesting and unique layered structure that enhances rate of photocatalysis 40 biox has unique lamellar structure in which x2 2 slabs are interleaving bi2o2 layers and bi x show weak van der waals interaction and bi o strongly bonded through covalent bond as shown in fig 1 this novel structure supports the production of electric field internally that acts as facilitator for more charge separation and enhancing overall photocatalytic process 41 42 among biox biobr is an ideal photocatalyst owing to its small band gap 2 75 ev 43 making it capable of maximum visible sunlight energy harvesting photocatalyst 44 biocl has a broad band gap of 3 3 ev with strong absorption in uv region light while bismuth oxyiodide bioi has a small band gap of 1 77 ev and it is a visible light active photocatalyst although biobr and bioi both have narrowband gap but there is a high recombination frequency of charges in bioi that results in decimation of energy without effective photocatalytic activity the effectiveness of a photocatalyst is determined by its capability to absorb light and utilize that light energy to excite electrons from valence and these electrons jump to the conduction band followed by creation of holes in the former band provided that band gap of semiconductors is equal to or less than absorbed light these generated electron hole pairs initiate chemical reaction that degrade contaminants in the wastewater treatment process other than band gap the efficiency of photocatalyst is also influenced by the speed with which electrons and holes pair recombine the swift recombination of charges decreases the photocatalytic performance 45 49 conclusively bismuth oxybromide biobr is the most efficient photocatalyst as it has a suitably small band gap 2 75 ev 43 and suitable band structure that minimize rapid recombination of electrons and holes however this rate is not suitable for large scale applications however there are some shortcomings that restrict practical applications of single biobr at large scale wastewater treatment these shortcomings include rapid recombination rate and less separation of photo generated charge carriers poor sunlight utilization and difficult recovery of catalyst for reuse 50 various methods have been developed to overcome these limitations such as photosensitization facet control defect engineering doping bismuth rich strategy and heterojunction formation etc in photosensitization a photosensitizer such as metal porphyrin or phthalocyanine is introduced with biobr to generate a heterostructure photocatalyst with better charge separation and visible light absorption 51 to maximize the reactive surface of photocatalyst facet control strategy is used such as formation of nanosheets which enhance the exposed reactive sites and narrow the band gap of biobr photocatalyst 52 in defect engineering metal oxygen vacancies are created to modulate absorption range enhance charge separation and increase active site area for example introduction of bismuth vacancy in biobr nanosheets reduced the charge carrier recombination rate and enhanced the photocatalytic performance to address the rapid recombination of electrons and holes transition metals are introduced as dopants yttrium doping on biobr can increase about 17 of photocatalytic performance in degradation of ciprofloxacin 53 to increase the surface area and narrow down the band gap a bismuth rich strategy is commonly used 54 the formation of heterojunctions of biobr with other materials such sns2 and bi2s3 enhances the electron hole separation and increases photocatalytic activity 48 55 in the process of heterojunction formation two or more semiconductors with compatible band structure and band gap are coupled to take photocatalytic process at higher level for wastewater treatment various studies on heterojunction formation portray this method as a most suitable solution to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of semiconductor photocatalyst recently heaps of work has been reported on the binary and ternary composites aimed at improving photocatalytic efficiency of biobr photocatalyst 49 56 58 there is limitation in binary composites that transfer of electron hole pairs and its participation in redox reaction is quite a complicated process and causes lagging in overall degradation reaction to overcome this limitation researchers gave more focus to the design and development of ternary composites having improved efficiency intrinsically ternary composites are better than binary composites in terms of providing more active sites and suppressing the recombination of photo induced charges 59 63 the significance of biobr in photocatalytic wastewater treatment is increased by its maximum visible light harvesting capability coupled with more reactive sites and suppressed electron hole pair recombination phenomenon to date according to our knowledge no review has been published focusing on binary and ternary composites of biobr as a photocatalyst for wastewater treatment the purpose of this review is to elaborate recent research on binary and ternary composites of biobr with primary focus on band engineering for maximizing its photocatalytic efficiency the hazardous effects of wastewater pollutants on the environment and human health are also critically analyzed while outlining synthesis approaches for binary and ternary biobr composites for addressing this environmental issue this review provides elaborative information to the reader about band gap engineering techniques particularly heterojunction formation and significance of this technique in the application of biobr binary and ternary composites for photocatalytic wastewater treatment 2 synthesis of biobr composites the combination of two or three semiconductors has been successful in enhancing light harvesting capacity increasing charge separation providing more active sites and suppressing charge recombination the coupling of semiconductors having compatible band structures results in the synergistic role of each semiconductor used and enhances the surface area ultimately leading to improvement in photocatalytic efficiency of composites biobr based binary and ternary composites have been prepared mainly by solvothermal 54 ultrasonication 64 ion exchange 65 wet chemical 66 co precipitation 67 and hydrothermal methods 68 as exhibited in fig 2 the subsequent paragraphs give a brief outlook of these synthetic methods 2 1 solvothermal method in solvothermal method the precursors are treated with heat at high pressure generated in an autoclave this autogenous pressure is the main reason for the initiation of a reaction that was not possible to achieve at normal pressure a variety of the solvents are used to produce precursor solutions such as ethylene glycol 50 ethanol 69 and glycerol 70 for instance cds biobr binary composites have been synthesized using solvothermal route in which ethylene glycol is used as solvent and the product was employed for degradation of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin antibiotics 71 li and coworker reported synthesis of fe3o4 biobr bioi ternary composites through solvothermal method employing ethylene glycol as solvent and studies their photocatalytic activity by degrading chemical dye rhodamine b 50 solvothermal approach offers high crystal quality uniform particle size and high yield other biobr based composites synthesized through solvothermal method include pani biobr znfe2o4 72 fe3o4 msio2 biobr 69 and biocl biobr 73 2 2 ultrasonication method in this method reaction mixtures undergo ultrasonic processing for a suitable time qu et al synthesized k g c3n4 biobr ternary system through ultrasonication of reaction mixture k g c3n4 was ultrasonicated before addition of bismuth nitrate as a precursor and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab as a surfactant in suspension the reaction mixture was heated in a water bath for 2 h at 80 c excessive ctab and other impurities were removed by washing with ultrapure water and alcohol 64 cheng et al synthesized biobr bi2o2co3 binary composite through same route in ultrasonication of only 40 min after mixing sodium bromide in deionized water and then dispersing bi2o2co3 the ph of the solution determined the surface area of the product ph 2 was ideal for preparing photocatalyst with highest efficiency 74 this method demands high edge technologies resulting in the high cost of photocatalyst synthesis 2 3 ion exchange method in this method already present ionic species in the material template are replaced by desired chemical species leading to the formation of new product lyu et al 65 synthesized bi biobr agbr by employing ion exchange method in which br biobr was added in ethylene glycol solution of agno3 and stirred for 12 h to collect the product centrifugation was employed and it was dried for several hours at 80 c before using it as a photocatalyst to degrade of rhodamine b similarly agbr g c3n4 biobr based ternary photocatalyst was also synthesized through ion exchange rout which was employed for the photocatalytic degradation of industrial dyes and pharmaceutical products present in wastewater 75 2 4 wet chemical method this method is simple liquid phase synthesis of composites in deionized water or any other suitable liquid li et al employed this method in the synthesis of ag biobr go in which separate solutions of biobr and agno3 were blended together and stirred for 10 15 min graphene oxide and nabh4 were added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 1 h to wash the product ultrapure water was used and it was oven dried for 24 48 h at 60 c 66 gao et al reported the synthesis of bipo4 biobr binary composites by mixing biobr in ethanol and adding phosphoric acid h3po4 dropwise with continuous vigorous stirring for 20 min the product was obtained in the form of precipitates that were washed several times and placed in an oven at 80 c for 12 h 76 it has been known that toxicity and by product formation are major limitations of this method 2 5 co precipitation method in co precipitation method the components are precipitated simultaneously with the help of co precipitating agent such as nabh4 this method is environment friendly in terms of its less time consumption and requirement of low temperature as compared to other methods guo et al synthesized ag cdots biobr through this method it involved the dispersion of cdots biobr in deionized water with agno3 and then the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred until a suspension was formed the dropwise addition of nabh4 solution in the suspension resulted in the co precipitation of product that was separated after centrifugation the product was employed to degrade 4 chlorophenol wastewater contaminant through photocatalysis under sunlight 67 in the co precipitation method nucleation and product growth kinetics can be controlled by manipulating release of component ions similarly biobr biocl pani was synthesized by the same method and the product was employed for degradation of wastewater abundant dye methyl orange 77 other composite synthesized through co precipitation route is biobr tio2 78 2 6 hydrothermal method there is a slight difference of employed solvent between solvothermal methods where various organic solvents are used while in hydrothermal route water is employed as a solvent normally precursors are dissolved in distilled water and transferred into an autoclave followed by heating for a suitable time and temperature autogenous pressure initiates the reaction and a variety of heterostructures are produced time and temperature of reaction precursor and medium of solution are major determining factors for the quality of product jiang et al synthesized biobr bioi binary composites through a hydrothermal method in which precursors were mixed in water nitric acid and then heated for 12 h at temperature ranging from 110 to 260 c the product with varying ratios of oxygen and halides were employed for the photocatalytic degradation of wastewater contaminants such as phenols and crystal violet dyes 68 ternary composites of biobr fe3o4 rgo were also synthesized by the hydrothermal method as shown in fig 3 62 hydrothermal synthesis is cost effective less toxic and controllable in terms of size and morphology other biobr composites synthesized by hydrothermal method include agbr g c3n4 biobr 75 cqds biocl biobr 79 biocl biobr 80 and bi2s3 biobr 81 3 photocatalysis photocatalysis is a phenomenon in which a semiconductor based photocatalyst is employed to absorb sunlight and initiates the degradation reaction sunlight energy is converted into chemical energy that is used to degrade a variety of pollutants including organic molecules dyes pharmaceuticals pesticides personal care products oils and inorganic molecules 82 84 electrons excited by sunlight energy jump from the valence band to the conduction band followed by the creation of holes in the same band this excitation requires striking of sunlight photons on the photocatalyst surface provided that they have energy more than the band gap of the photocatalyst the energy consumed by this process is provided by the sunlight photons semiconductor with narrowband gap such as biobr 85 is more suitable the photocatalyst because narrow band gap enables photocatalyst to harvest the maximum visible sunlight portion photo excited electrons holes are separated and transferred to the surface of semiconductor these electrons holes may recombine producing phonons and heat leading to the decreased number of charge carries and ultimately less efficient photocatalysis this step can be prevented by development of binary and ternary composites of visible light photocatalyst such as bioi biobr 43 and g c3n4 bi biobr 86 binary and ternary heterojunctions enhance the photocatalysis rate by narrowing the band gap and suppressing electron hole pair s recombination rate in photocatalytic reaction electrons and holes are generated when light strikes on the surface of photocatalyst the major function of photo generated electrons is to reduce contaminants in wastewater and to react with oxygen to produce highly reactive superoxide radicals o2 2 in the same process when these electrons react with water molecules present in the environment they produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and they are used in further enhancement of the pollutant degradation process the radical species react with organic contaminants and convert them into simple less toxic molecules with expected final degradation products such as co2 and h2o on the other hand photo generated holes react with water molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals that react with contaminants and convert them into simple molecules photogenerated holes also react directly with pollutants such as methylene blue dyes and convert them into carbon dioxide and water directly photocatalytic mechanism has been further elaborated in excellent reviews referenced here 87 89 another factor that can influence photocatalysis rate is the adsorption of pollutant material on the photocatalyst surface as this process can increase the charge movement and enhance rate of redox reaction 26 90 the high rate of charges recombination and broad gap of photocatalyst render photocatalyst incapable of working at higher scale various strategies are employed to overcome these limitations and the formation of heterojunction is one of them for visible light photocatalyst biobr based binary and ternary composites are promising photocatalysts for wastewater treatment at higher level without compromising efficiency for instance ternary composite heterojunction pani biobr znfe2o4 has been used to degrade of organic pollutants such as benzene through photocatalysis as shown in fig 4 72 4 strategies for enhancement of photocatalytic activity 4 1 photosensitization photosensitization is a process of associating sensitizer with a photocatalyst to significantly enhance photocatalytic activity a photosensitizer is a chemical specie that facilitates absorption of sunlight energy from ultraviolet to visible region and transfers this energy to a photocatalyst to initiate a reaction degradation reaction in this case it acts as an additional energy source for photocatalyst to drive a degradation reaction photosensitizers based on transition metals are widely used in diverse fields and they have coordinated complex with conjugated ligands 91 basically photosensitizer enhance the sunlight absorption of photocatalyst by extending its absorption spectrum from uv light to visible region by employing chemi sorbing or physico sorbing substances the photosensitization mechanism involves the transfer of visible light excited electron to the conduction band from the valence band of photocatalyst where these electrons are used to progress the photocatalytic reaction owing to photostability and excellent photosensitizing properties photosensitizers based on organometallic complex are widely used the examples include ruthenium complexes copper complexes and zinc complexes 92 95 aimed at wastewater treatment degradation of phenols and orange ii dye has been performed on cu phthalocyanine cu pc sensitized biobr rgo under simulated sunlight the result showed that loading of 0 25 of photosensitizer onto the photocatalyst surface gave significantly better results as compared to unloaded 51 96 there are a large number of conjugated ligands that make porphyrins capable of absorbing a wide range in visible regions and owing to this feature its complexes with transition metals are excellent photosensitizers for photocatalytic process photosensitization of biobr biocl pani with sn porphyrin sn pp results in excellent photodegradation of methyl orange with 96 degradation efficiency in only 10 min sn pp sensitized biobr biocl pani showed 7 more degradation efficiency than unloaded photocatalyst and this enhanced activity is due to the small band gap of sn pp and resultant more absorption in the visible region 97 photosensitization process can only extend the absorption spectrum of photocatalyst and it has limited use because it cannot narrow down the band gap or reduce charged recombination and also they are expensive to use and their performance is lower than the composite materials 4 2 facet control facet of crystalline photocatalyst is an important feature that can change the absorption of sunlight geometry electronic structure surface physiochemical properties and intrinsic activity to enhance the photocatalytic properties of semiconductor material facet engineering has been in focus recently 98 101 different studies reported about four mechanisms that are followed in enhancement of photocatalytic activity through facet engineering 1 adsorption and activation of molecules caused by atomic re arrangement in surface area and through this selectivity catalytic activity is tuned 102 103 2 redox capabilities of electron hole pairs are tuned by changing electric band structures through face engineering resulting in better efficiency of photocatalyst 104 3 crystal orientation determines separation and transfer of their photoinduced charged carriers leading to variation in charged density on surface reactions 105 4 spatial charge separation results in accumulation of photo generated electron hole pairs at different facets and this can be achieved through facet control 106 zhang et al synthesized 001 and 102 in biobr nanosheets through hydrothermal route and investigated their photocatalytic properties for environmental applications such as degradation of industrial dyes the photocatalyst with 102 exposed facets successfully degraded the dye in 16 min of irradiation while 001 facet was slow to degrade proving better efficiency of 102 exposed facets in biobr nanosheets fig 5 presents a comparison of photocatalytic activity of both facets better photocatalytic performance by 102 is attributed to better band structure as it has higher valence band maximum and lower conduction band minimum and further more in 102 facet electron ejection is more efficient redox capability of photoinduced charge is higher and it has narrowband gap 1 44ev than 001 facets 2 22ev 107 in a similar process lamellas of biobr sheets having a thickness range of 9 32 nm with 001 exposed facet were synthesized through a simple hydrolysis system and to achieve desired properties temperature and solvent conditions were tuned to make this synthesis easy and greener no capping agent or surfactant was used as a result the active surface area of the photocatalyst was enhanced from 83 to 94 and this increased active surface areas was confirmed by enhancement in photocatalytic performance in degradation of rhodamine dye this increase in photocatalytic activity is due to increased adsorption of dyes on the active surface of the photocatalyst 108 facet controlled photocatalytic materials are far from practical application owing to their difficult and harsh conditions requiring synthesis use of expensive and toxic surfactants and multiple issues in their up scaling there are limited methods of synthesis of facet controlled photocatalyst and shortcomings of characterization techniques are not adequate for detailed study of charge kinetics at facet surface 4 3 defect engineering recently defect engineering in semiconductor photocatalysis has been focused owing to the ability of this technique to modulate charge separation charge density surface microstructure and electronic structure even coordination structure can be changed by introduction of an appropriate defect in semiconductor photocatalyst 109 111 owing to easiness in creation and prevalence in oxide materials oxygen vacancies are the most studied defects in photocatalyst photogenerated electrons can stay on oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst and it results in reducing recombination of charges oxygen vacancies increase adsorption of substrate and this adsorption enhances the rate of electron transfer due to coupling effect both these factors are highly beneficial for the overall photocatalytic process 112 113 there are limited studies in which metal vacancies have been created to improve photocatalytic activity due to the absence of credible process and difficulty in operation of metal defects however wang et al synthesized biobr with oxygen defect through solvothermal method as a case study to portray defect engineered photocatalyst as an ideal procedure for environmental remediation oxygen rich photocatalyst was employed for degradation of 4 chlorophenol and results showed 10 9 times better efficiency of defect engineered photocatalyst as compared to simple biobr photocatalyst this better photocatalytic property is ascribed to higher capturing capability in the visible region of light and high charge separation due to solid solutions and its synergistic effect with oxygen vacancy as they can narrow down band gap and impedes charge recombination 114 oxygen based vacancies are easy to create but they require a synergizing factor through doping or doping to act as an efficient photocatalyst there are several studies reporting oxygen vacancy created in bismuth oxybromide aimed at enhancement of photocatalytic activity for a variety of purposes such as degradation of pollutants and ammonia synthesis 115 116 bismuth based vacancies are rare case for instance di et al synthesized biobr with bismuth vacancy through ionic liquid assisted technique at room temperature defect engineered photocatalyst showed 3 8 times higher photocatalytic performance as compared to simple biobr photocatalyst this enhanced activity of biobr ultrathin nanosheets with bismuth vacancy is due to more suitable electronic structure and improved interaction of the substrate with its surface 117 to get benefit from the synergistic effect of metal and oxygen vacancy bi3o4br nanosheets with bismuth defects has also been reported the synergistic effect of two vacancies has been employed to increase the electron hole separation through tuning of electronic structure and atomic arrangement resultant photocatalyst with double vacancy showed 30 times greater photocatalytic activity than simple photocatalyst 111 major limitations of defect engineering are harsh synthetic conditions and difficulty to industrialize 4 4 elemental doping doping is a widely reported phenomenon aimed at enhancement of photocatalytic properties of biobr photocatalyst doping inhibits electron hole recombination enhances visible light absorption and redox capability of photoexcited charge carriers 118 it is necessary to add appropriate amount of dopant because excess amount of dopant can be sited for recombination of photo generated charges as demonstrated by song et al excess amount of zinc ion zn2 as dopant on biobr results in decreased photocatalytic activity 119 dopant must have capability of electron hole capture and should facilitate their separation and easy release towards surface migration for reaction initiation 120 in most studies rare earth metals noble metals and transition metals have been used in cationic doping of biobr palladium is one of the noble metals that have been used as dopant in hydrothermally synthesized biobr by meng et al employing photodeposition method as illustrated in fig 6 there was no covalent bonding between pd and biobr the dopant was only surface dispersed on the photocatalyst pd loaded photocatalyst was used to degrade phenol and it degraded 100 while pristine biobr was able to degrade only 67 noble metal dopant enhance photocatalytic activity of semiconductor photocatalyst by two mechanisms 1 enhancement of visible light absorption through surface plasmon effect and 2 inhibition of photoexcited electron hole pairs recombination 121 the synthesis process of doped photocatalyst also influences the photocatalytic activity for instance pd doped biobr was synthesized through one pot facile synthesis but their activity was not good as compared to the aforementioned method incomplete reduction of pd 2 to pd nps and non uniform dispersion of dopant are two limitation of one pot facile synthesis that results in less photocatalytic activity 122 other noble metals employed for doping of biobr are silver rhodium platinum and gold 123 125 among rare earth metals erbium er yttrium y cerium ce and lanthanum la have been employed as dopant for biobr for photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants such as ciprofloxacin and rhodamine b 53 126 appropriate amount of dopant is an essential factor in rare earth metals doping for instance imam et al synthesized biobr through chemical precipitation method with 1 3 and 5 doping of la 3 and employed them for degradation of ciprofloxacin maximum degradation was exhibited by 3 y biobr was 87 6 degradation of wastewater contaminant as compared to pristine biobr which was 71 7 only increase in photocatalytic activity till 3 y biobr is ascribed to the increased surface area from 19 65 m2 g for pristine to 31 2 m2 g improved electron hole separation and enhanced absorption and in 5 recombination sites for electron hole are formed that results in decrease of photocatalytic activity 53 similarly er biobr has also been reported with varying amount 1 3 5 and 8 of er and increases photocatalytic activity was observed till 3 and then decreased which is attributed to formation of electron holes recombination centers 126 widely studied transition metal doping increases the life span of charged carriers by inhibiting their recombination through tuning band structure as in the case of zn doped biobr 119 some studies also reported that transition metal doping enhances the visible light absorption for instance liu et al synthesized trivalent iron fe3 doped biobr and studied their photocatalytic activity by degradation of methyl orange doped photocatalyst showed better degradation as compared to pristine biobr attributed to the increased absorption in the visible region of light and rapid electron hole transfer 128 other transition metals employed for doping of biobr include titanium ti copper cu cobalt co manganese mn and niobium nb 129 132 there are limited number of studies that report anionic doping biobr in a similar example of anionic dopant introduction monovalent iodine anion was doped on biobr produced by precipitation method and employed for sunlight driven degradation of methyl orange iodine doped biobr showed more degradation of wastewater pollutant than pristine photocatalyst and this increase in photocatalytic activity is attributed to more electron holes generation and broadening of light absorption from ultraviolet to visible region this broadening of light absorption occurred due to decrease in band of gaps from 2 77 ev for pristine to 1 93 for iodine doped photocatalyst fig 7 127 noble metals are expensive and this render their doping an expensive procedure and not suitable for large scale applications there is no single doping element that can increase surface area narrowband gap enhance charge separation and transfer inhibits charge recombination and cost effective other than these limitations of elemental doping necessity of appropriate amount of dopant is another issue 4 5 bismuth rich strategy band structure particularly position of conduction band is important for photocatalytic activity of semiconductor and this property is restricted by positive position of cb reactivity of electrons that react with water to produce reacting radicals is directly proportional to the negative position of cb more negative position of cb more potent reducing electrons and vice versa density functional theory dft suggests that the valence bond in biobr is primarily based on hybridization of 2p orbital of oxygen and 4p orbital of bromine while 6p orbital of bismuth gives rise to the valence band 133 136 there are several studies which revealed that increase in bismuth content in biobr semiconductor enhances the photocatalytic performance for instance mi et al synthesized belt like bi4o5br2 nanomaterials through one step hydrolysis method at varying temperature and employed them in photocatalytic degradation of salicylic acid and resorcinol belt like bi4o5br2 b 25 synthesized at 25 c showed 97 resorcinol degradation after 8 h and 95 salicylic acid degradation after 4 h and it was 50 higher than simple biobr this enhanced photocatalytic property is due to increased surface area narrower band gap and more negative cb of bi4o5br2 b 25 as shown in fig 8 belt like bi4o5br2 b 25 has more negative cb ecb 0 37 than plate like bi4o5br2 ecb 0 34 and biobr ecb 0 23 and band gap narrow downed to 2 28 ev from 2 67 ev 54 in similar studies various bismuth rich oxybromides have been reported including bi4o5br2 137 140 bi5o7br 141 142 bi3o4br 143 bi12o17br2 144 bi24o31br10 127 145 and employed for environmental remediation like wastewater treatment synthesis of bismuth rich oxybromide is an ideal technique for optimization of band gap and band structure but it is difficult process to control amount of bismuth during synthesis these developments are still far from practical applications to achieve highly efficient bismuth rich oxybromide photocatalyst for large scale application such as wastewater treatment there is need for surface modification better morphological control and tuning of internal electric field 4 6 composite formation heterojunctions are constructed through binary and ternary composite formation aimed at enhancement of photocatalytic activity in these composites there is heterojunction at the interface of two different semiconductors with suitable band gap and band structure that inhibits photoinduced electron holes recombination the need of composite formation arose due to inefficiency of single biobr photocatalyst in practical applications at industrial scale several studies proved that composite formation is an effective way to increase photocatalytic activity and this increase is due to its better visible light harvesting more charges separation layered structure endowed high surface area and ideal band structure for deep redox potential 146 147 for instance hu et al synthesized p n heterojunction forming biobr bi2wo6 composite through solvothermal method and employed them for photocatalytic degradation of industrial dyes and phenolic compounds in wastewater photocatalytic degradation efficiency of composites was investigated by its employment in degradation of phenol and methylene blue and it was able to degrade 96 of methylene blue relative to biobr with degradation of 43 and bi2wo6 with degradation of 62 this increase in photocatalytic activity was the result of p n junction formation that enhanced the separation and rapid transfer of photogenerated electron holes pair 148 morphology of structure is an important factor for photocatalytic activity for instance rashid et al synthesized butterfly cluster like lamellar biobr tio2 binary composite through in situ deposition method at room temperature and employed them for photocatalytic breakdown of ciprofloxacin light absorption was increased owing to increased surface area up to 160 797 from 124 6 m2 g due to butterfly cluster morphology of biobr see fig 9 to determine suitability of the product for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment it was employed for the photocatalytic breakdown of 25 mg l aqueous solution of ciprofloxacin under direct sunlight and marvelously 100 degradation was observed binary composites showed 5 2 and 9 4 times more photocatalytic activity than pristine biobr and tio2 content percentage of biobr in binary composites was another factor that determined degradation rate and percentage of photocatalyst highest photocatalytic activity was showed by 15 biobr tio2 and it was more than binary composite containing 10 20 5 and pristine biobr other than surface area inhibition of electron holes recombination was another factor that enhanced photocatalytic activity of binary composite in such a way that tio2 acted as an electron sink and holes in biobr initiated the reaction of ciprofloxacin degradation 149 photocatalytic activity obtained for binary composites is still far from practical use owing to loss of activity during multiple cycle chemical instability in the industrial environment and difficult photocatalyst recovery process for advancement of photocatalytic properties of binary composites three methods are employed including doping 64 photosensitization 51 and formation of ternary composites 61 in case of binary composites of biobr doping and photosensitization could not produce desired result with limitations due to expensive cost of dopant and sensitizers however ternary composites proved to be promising candidates in fulfilling the requirement of an ideal photocatalyst for wastewater treatment at industrial level formation of ternary composites has solved the problem of photocatalyst recovery by introducing magnetic ternary composites for instance li and co workers reported synthesis of fe3o4 biobr bioi based ternary composite photocatalyst by solvothermal route to degrade rhodamine b a textile wastewater dye the ternary composite exhibited 100 degradation of dye in 80 min showing superior photocatalytic activity to the fe3o4 biobr binary composite this increase in photocatalytic activity was due to better light absorption owing to more suitable band gap and band structure in ternary composites synthetic method greatly influences the surface area of the photocatalyst and ultimately photocatalytic activity for example solvothermally synthesized fe3o4 biobr bioi has more active surface area 48 30 m2 g than that of a similar composite synthesized by co precipitation method 50 ternary composites offer improved light absorption high quantum yield rapid electron transfer and better photocatalytic activity for instance zhang et al synthesized pani biobr znfe2o4 and tried to harness high charge carrier mobility and environmental stability of the conducting polymer polyaniline pani for photocatalytic treatment of textile wastewater the synthesized ternary composite completely degraded the rhodamine b dye in 30 min ternary composite showed better photocatalytic performance as compared to the binary composite and individual components and its enhancement is attributed to the increased charge carriers generation and their rapid transfer and separation to assess the wide applicability of pani biobr znfe2o4 ternary composite it was used for photocatalytic removal of various other organic pollutants such as norfloxacin methylene blue bisphenol a and methyl orange with removal rates of 89 7 90 97 75 64 and 95 32 respectively and after 60 min visible irradiation recorded the effect of ph on photocatalytic activity of photocatalyst was also studied and reportedly pani biobr znfe2o4 ternary composite showed higher photocatalytic activity at neutral ph 7 in alkaline solution degradation efficiency was enhanced due to the increased interaction of photocatalyst and dye owing to negative charge of biobr and positive charge on rhodamine b acidic conditions decreased photocatalytic performance of ternary composite and this decrease was due to positive charge on biobr resulting in electrostatic repulsion and less interaction for practical applications other than chemical stability photostability and reusability are crucial to determine reusability ternary composite was used to degrade rhodamine b three time and only trivial 1 4 decrease in photocatalytic activity was recorded as compared to biobr where this decrease was significant 10 for three cycle x ray diffraction xrd pattern of pani biobr znfe2o4 after three cycles of its usage showed lack of differences thus indicating its high photostability 72 conclusively binary and ternary composites of biobr are the most optimized and promising candidates for photocatalytic wastewater treatment owing to their highest optimization in terms of band gap band structure recovery reusability photostability chemical stability and quantum yield in subsequent paragraphs we will discuss the application of biobr based binary ad ternary composite for wastewater treatment 5 application of biobr based binary and ternary composites in wastewater treatment a literature on the application of biobr based binary and ternary composites in wastewater treatment is widely available this section aims to deliberate the mechanism of photocatalytic activity enhancement through formation of binary and ternary composites table 1 clearly demonstrates that binary and ternary composite results in better degradation of wastewater pollutants compared to biobr the average increase in degradation percentage is more than 50 for instance in the case of biobr nabio3 chlorophenol degradation percentage was increased from 0 8 biobr to more than 92 with quantum yield of about 0 365 multiple factors are involved in this enhancement of photocatalytic activity including band gap band structure and interface modulation of band gap is the leading factor that is contributing mainly towards enhanced efficiency by formation of binary composite band gap was optimally narrowed down from its component band gap of nabio3 is 2 60 ev and that of biobr is 2 88 ev while after formation of binary composite it is reduced to 2 52 ev which is optimum in terms of both efficient sunlight harvesting and charge carrier generation valence band is based in biobr and its amount is important for generation of suitable band structure for maximum photocatalytic activity in this case 9 biobr is ideal for highest photocatalytic efficiency increase results in change in band structure and reduction of photocatalytic activity significance of the interface was determined by comparing photocatalytic activity of 9 biobr nabio3 mechanical mixture which gave only 72 photodegradation efficiency about 20 less than original catalyst in composite form two interfaces were closely coupled that reduce electron and hole recombination while in case of mechanical mixture there is no influence of interface in reducing charge recombination conclusively binary composite results in efficient visible light harvesting due to modulated band gap rapid separation with high redox potential interface to prevent recombination of electrons and holes and 9 amount of biobr to balance the redox ability and separation efficiency of photogenerated charges 150 synthesis of binary composites results in improved photocatalytic activity but developments are still far from practical applications to harness the interfacial aspect of composites leading to enhanced surface area and increased charge separation researchers have switched to the synthesis of ternary composites for wastewater treatment for instance bi biobr agbr has about two times greater photodegradation percentage against rhodamine b than pristine biobr which can only degrade 48 of wastewater pollutants while ternary composites easily degraded about 95 of the dye this enhanced photocatalytic performance is ascribed to major three factors high absorption capacity in the visible region instant electron transfer and high charge separation efficiency in this case presence of bi metallic nanoparticles results in surface plasmon resonance that cause more absorption in visible region it has also been reported that higher visible light absorption is not only contributing factor towards enhanced photocatalytic activity of ternary composites but also the smaller arc radius enhances charge separation efficiency and speed of electron transfer 65 recovery of catalyst from wastewater after degradation of target pollutant is a one of the still not solved challenges synthesis of magnetic ternary composites containing fe2o3 makes it easier to recover the photocatalyst moreover the presence of metal oxygen bond is beneficial as it can enhance photocatalytic activity by increasing surface area and facilitating adsorption of pollutants for example fe3o4 biobr bioi 50 fe3o4 msio2 biobr 69 biobr fe3o4 rgo 62 and fe3o4 biobr cqds 151 irrespective of synthetic method ternary composites are better than binary composites owing to ideally modulated band gap more suitable band structure and more adsorption area for pollutants such as bi biobr agbr has better degradation efficacy than binary composites of its components and showed 4 9 and 1 4 times faster degradation of rhodamine b than biobr agbr and bi biobr respectively 65 similarly biobr tio2 g was found to be a better photocatalyst than biobr tio2 prepared for variety of pollutant degradation 78 149 152 154 and g c3n4 bioi biobr can degrade different wastewater pollutants more efficiently than binary composites of its components such as bioi biobr 49 54 146 155 157 summarily biobr based composites whether binary or ternary are better photocatalyst for wastewater treatment than pure biobr these composites offer more visible light harvesting to the photocatalyst through narrowband gap increased charge separation reduced charge recombination by suitable band structures and increased surface area for both enhanced absorption of sunlight and adsorption of target pollutant last but not the least such photocatalysts can be easily recovered after photocatalytic action if magnetic components are employed in composites 6 current challenges though reported literature it is evident that a significant development in the field of biobr based binary and ternary composites has been made however these developments are still far from practical applications composites result in increased surface active sites but their role in enhancing photocatalytic activity is undefined and cannot be manipulated positively immobilization of substrate on the surface of photocatalyst is one of the crucial steps it needs to explored for better performance in laboratory it is easy to degrade model pollutant but real wastewater is complex mixture that demands more optimization in terms of selectivity and environmental conditions such ph temperature and nature of wastewater reported photocatalysts are specialized for only single or a group of pollutants that is challenging to degrade real wastewater by a single photocatalyst to employ biobr based composite photocatalysts at large scale for industrial wastewater their manufacturing at commercial level is one of the major challenge that needs to be addressed conclusively other than band gap band structure surface optimization reusability recovery and absence of solid supports are huge challenges 7 conclusion owing to the layered structure of biobr their composites are efficient photocatalysts for wastewater treatment for enhancement of photocatalytic activity other techniques such as doping facet control and defect engineering are available to form binary and ternary composites in this review recent literature was summarized to extract vital information for enhancement strategies for biobr based photocatalysts and primarily focusing on binary and ternary composite for photocatalytic wastewater treatment while briefly outlining their synthesis methods this information is substantial for researchers to move forward in application of these binary and ternary composites at industrial scale wastewater treatment the synergistic effect of individual components in the composites along with other enhancement strategies can be beneficial for large scale applications for efficient removal of pollutants from wastewater we believe that future research should be focused on coupling photocatalytic process with complementing techniques such as membrane based technologies and anaerobic digestion therefore more advanced research is expected in this field aimed at designing new composites having more suitable band gap band structure better chemical and physical stability and surface properties that could revolutionize photocatalytic wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8745,semiconductor based photocatalysts have been an efficient technology for water and wastewater remediation addressing the concepts of green chemistry and sustainable development owing to narrow and suitable band structure biobr is a promising candidate for efficient wastewater treatment via photocatalysis enhancement of photocatalytic properties can be obtained by various techniques like doping element rich strategy facet engineering and defect control this review primarily focuses on the band engineering of single biobr its binary ternary composites and their applications in degradation of hazardous pollutants in wastewater moreover current challenges and future perspectives were discussed along with concluding comments graphical abstract image 1 keywords bismuth oxybromide biobr composites nanomaterials heterojunction heterogeneous catalysis radicals data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction industrialization has been a beneficial factor in our lives but it is also caused of environmental pollution including air water and soil pollution the rapid increase in the population has increased this pollution particularly water pollution which is a major challenge that is threatening the existence of the human world 1 2 reports suggest the presence of a variety of pollutants in wastewater including pharmaceuticals heavy metals dyes and other organic pollutants 3 6 these contaminants create huge problems for the environment in general and the human population in particular reportedly there is an abundance of pharmaceutical products such as antibiotics and other drugs in water bodies and it results in the generation of antibiotics resistance among bacteria rendering them ineffective and also cause major health risks to humankind 7 8 limited exposure to heavy metals has minimal effect on environment but long term exposure is hazardous for humans leading to the failure of human body systems most of the heavy metals are carcinogenic and they cause skin diseases kidney failure lung damage and fragility of bones 4 9 dyes present in the wastewater are toxic to aquatic life and cause cancers in human beings 10 12 summarily dyes containing wastewater is highly hazardous for ecosystem and the health of living beings it should be treated before entering into water bodies it is a prerequisite for good human health to drink clean water free from toxic materials such as pharmaceuticals dyes heavy metals organic waste and harmful microorganisms a report published by the united nations on world water development suggests an increase in the demand for clean water by nearly one third in next 30 years 13 other than primary requirement of clean water for human health various industries such as food electronics and pharmaceuticals also need clean and potable water for their proper functioning 8 14 to reduce the health risks environmental hazards and to meet world water demands it is needed to effectively treat the wastewater however conventional techniques for wastewater remediation process are not efficient enough to remove emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals dyes and organic pollutants 15 16 owing to the failure of conventional wastewater treatment plants in handling of aforementioned contaminants it is essentially needed to develop new technologies for proper removal of these hazardous materials 17 for wastewater treatment aimed at removal of these chemically stable highly persistent and non biodegradable contaminants various advanced technologies have been employed these advanced wastewater treatment technologies include electrochemical reduction 18 membrane filtration 12 19 precipitation 20 electrodialysis 21 photocatalysis 22 23 and electrodeionization 24 these technologies except photocatalysis are not suitable for wastewater treatment in terms of efficiency and economy large intake of energy complicated process wastes and by products formation are the major disadvantages of these techniques among all of these photocatalysis is the best technique owing to its efficiency and cost effectiveness photocatalysis is the process in which of sunlight energy is converted into chemical energy through a series of reaction steps that is further used to degrade the pollutants in wastewater it converts complex pollutants into simple and harmless molecules using mild conditions and consuming abundantly available sunlight these features make this technique very economical and environment friendly 22 25 photocatalysis is a state of the art oxidation process and it mechanism involves generation of electrons and holes after striking of sunlight photon on the surface of photocatalyst degradation reaction of wastewater contaminant is initiated by electrons and holes that are photogenerated in valence and conduction band respectively 23 26 suitable properties of semiconductor photocatalyst determine rate and efficiency of photocatalysis therefore an ideal catalyst must be chemically biologically stable photo active cost effective photo stable and reusable and must have a narrowband gap so that it can harvest the maximum portion of sunlight energy in broad spectrum owing to the importance of photocatalysis the developments and improvements in the properties of photocatalyst are widely researched areas in this field as exhibited by excellent reviews referenced here 27 29 owing to the beneficial presence of oxygen in photocatalyst various metal oxide semiconductors including fe2o3 30 tio2 3 31 32 zno 33 bi2o3 zno heterojunction 34 bi3 zno 35 ce2o3 36 bifeo3 37 and bismuth oxyhalides biox x cl br i based photocatalysts have been synthesized aimed at photocatalytic wastewater treatment 28 38 39 as compared to the conventional metal oxides biox offers more suitable properties for efficient photocatalytic process such as better chemical stability biological inertness better positioned band structure narrowband gap for maximum sunlight energy harvesting and unique layered structure that enhances rate of photocatalysis 40 biox has unique lamellar structure in which x2 2 slabs are interleaving bi2o2 layers and bi x show weak van der waals interaction and bi o strongly bonded through covalent bond as shown in fig 1 this novel structure supports the production of electric field internally that acts as facilitator for more charge separation and enhancing overall photocatalytic process 41 42 among biox biobr is an ideal photocatalyst owing to its small band gap 2 75 ev 43 making it capable of maximum visible sunlight energy harvesting photocatalyst 44 biocl has a broad band gap of 3 3 ev with strong absorption in uv region light while bismuth oxyiodide bioi has a small band gap of 1 77 ev and it is a visible light active photocatalyst although biobr and bioi both have narrowband gap but there is a high recombination frequency of charges in bioi that results in decimation of energy without effective photocatalytic activity the effectiveness of a photocatalyst is determined by its capability to absorb light and utilize that light energy to excite electrons from valence and these electrons jump to the conduction band followed by creation of holes in the former band provided that band gap of semiconductors is equal to or less than absorbed light these generated electron hole pairs initiate chemical reaction that degrade contaminants in the wastewater treatment process other than band gap the efficiency of photocatalyst is also influenced by the speed with which electrons and holes pair recombine the swift recombination of charges decreases the photocatalytic performance 45 49 conclusively bismuth oxybromide biobr is the most efficient photocatalyst as it has a suitably small band gap 2 75 ev 43 and suitable band structure that minimize rapid recombination of electrons and holes however this rate is not suitable for large scale applications however there are some shortcomings that restrict practical applications of single biobr at large scale wastewater treatment these shortcomings include rapid recombination rate and less separation of photo generated charge carriers poor sunlight utilization and difficult recovery of catalyst for reuse 50 various methods have been developed to overcome these limitations such as photosensitization facet control defect engineering doping bismuth rich strategy and heterojunction formation etc in photosensitization a photosensitizer such as metal porphyrin or phthalocyanine is introduced with biobr to generate a heterostructure photocatalyst with better charge separation and visible light absorption 51 to maximize the reactive surface of photocatalyst facet control strategy is used such as formation of nanosheets which enhance the exposed reactive sites and narrow the band gap of biobr photocatalyst 52 in defect engineering metal oxygen vacancies are created to modulate absorption range enhance charge separation and increase active site area for example introduction of bismuth vacancy in biobr nanosheets reduced the charge carrier recombination rate and enhanced the photocatalytic performance to address the rapid recombination of electrons and holes transition metals are introduced as dopants yttrium doping on biobr can increase about 17 of photocatalytic performance in degradation of ciprofloxacin 53 to increase the surface area and narrow down the band gap a bismuth rich strategy is commonly used 54 the formation of heterojunctions of biobr with other materials such sns2 and bi2s3 enhances the electron hole separation and increases photocatalytic activity 48 55 in the process of heterojunction formation two or more semiconductors with compatible band structure and band gap are coupled to take photocatalytic process at higher level for wastewater treatment various studies on heterojunction formation portray this method as a most suitable solution to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of semiconductor photocatalyst recently heaps of work has been reported on the binary and ternary composites aimed at improving photocatalytic efficiency of biobr photocatalyst 49 56 58 there is limitation in binary composites that transfer of electron hole pairs and its participation in redox reaction is quite a complicated process and causes lagging in overall degradation reaction to overcome this limitation researchers gave more focus to the design and development of ternary composites having improved efficiency intrinsically ternary composites are better than binary composites in terms of providing more active sites and suppressing the recombination of photo induced charges 59 63 the significance of biobr in photocatalytic wastewater treatment is increased by its maximum visible light harvesting capability coupled with more reactive sites and suppressed electron hole pair recombination phenomenon to date according to our knowledge no review has been published focusing on binary and ternary composites of biobr as a photocatalyst for wastewater treatment the purpose of this review is to elaborate recent research on binary and ternary composites of biobr with primary focus on band engineering for maximizing its photocatalytic efficiency the hazardous effects of wastewater pollutants on the environment and human health are also critically analyzed while outlining synthesis approaches for binary and ternary biobr composites for addressing this environmental issue this review provides elaborative information to the reader about band gap engineering techniques particularly heterojunction formation and significance of this technique in the application of biobr binary and ternary composites for photocatalytic wastewater treatment 2 synthesis of biobr composites the combination of two or three semiconductors has been successful in enhancing light harvesting capacity increasing charge separation providing more active sites and suppressing charge recombination the coupling of semiconductors having compatible band structures results in the synergistic role of each semiconductor used and enhances the surface area ultimately leading to improvement in photocatalytic efficiency of composites biobr based binary and ternary composites have been prepared mainly by solvothermal 54 ultrasonication 64 ion exchange 65 wet chemical 66 co precipitation 67 and hydrothermal methods 68 as exhibited in fig 2 the subsequent paragraphs give a brief outlook of these synthetic methods 2 1 solvothermal method in solvothermal method the precursors are treated with heat at high pressure generated in an autoclave this autogenous pressure is the main reason for the initiation of a reaction that was not possible to achieve at normal pressure a variety of the solvents are used to produce precursor solutions such as ethylene glycol 50 ethanol 69 and glycerol 70 for instance cds biobr binary composites have been synthesized using solvothermal route in which ethylene glycol is used as solvent and the product was employed for degradation of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin antibiotics 71 li and coworker reported synthesis of fe3o4 biobr bioi ternary composites through solvothermal method employing ethylene glycol as solvent and studies their photocatalytic activity by degrading chemical dye rhodamine b 50 solvothermal approach offers high crystal quality uniform particle size and high yield other biobr based composites synthesized through solvothermal method include pani biobr znfe2o4 72 fe3o4 msio2 biobr 69 and biocl biobr 73 2 2 ultrasonication method in this method reaction mixtures undergo ultrasonic processing for a suitable time qu et al synthesized k g c3n4 biobr ternary system through ultrasonication of reaction mixture k g c3n4 was ultrasonicated before addition of bismuth nitrate as a precursor and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab as a surfactant in suspension the reaction mixture was heated in a water bath for 2 h at 80 c excessive ctab and other impurities were removed by washing with ultrapure water and alcohol 64 cheng et al synthesized biobr bi2o2co3 binary composite through same route in ultrasonication of only 40 min after mixing sodium bromide in deionized water and then dispersing bi2o2co3 the ph of the solution determined the surface area of the product ph 2 was ideal for preparing photocatalyst with highest efficiency 74 this method demands high edge technologies resulting in the high cost of photocatalyst synthesis 2 3 ion exchange method in this method already present ionic species in the material template are replaced by desired chemical species leading to the formation of new product lyu et al 65 synthesized bi biobr agbr by employing ion exchange method in which br biobr was added in ethylene glycol solution of agno3 and stirred for 12 h to collect the product centrifugation was employed and it was dried for several hours at 80 c before using it as a photocatalyst to degrade of rhodamine b similarly agbr g c3n4 biobr based ternary photocatalyst was also synthesized through ion exchange rout which was employed for the photocatalytic degradation of industrial dyes and pharmaceutical products present in wastewater 75 2 4 wet chemical method this method is simple liquid phase synthesis of composites in deionized water or any other suitable liquid li et al employed this method in the synthesis of ag biobr go in which separate solutions of biobr and agno3 were blended together and stirred for 10 15 min graphene oxide and nabh4 were added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 1 h to wash the product ultrapure water was used and it was oven dried for 24 48 h at 60 c 66 gao et al reported the synthesis of bipo4 biobr binary composites by mixing biobr in ethanol and adding phosphoric acid h3po4 dropwise with continuous vigorous stirring for 20 min the product was obtained in the form of precipitates that were washed several times and placed in an oven at 80 c for 12 h 76 it has been known that toxicity and by product formation are major limitations of this method 2 5 co precipitation method in co precipitation method the components are precipitated simultaneously with the help of co precipitating agent such as nabh4 this method is environment friendly in terms of its less time consumption and requirement of low temperature as compared to other methods guo et al synthesized ag cdots biobr through this method it involved the dispersion of cdots biobr in deionized water with agno3 and then the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred until a suspension was formed the dropwise addition of nabh4 solution in the suspension resulted in the co precipitation of product that was separated after centrifugation the product was employed to degrade 4 chlorophenol wastewater contaminant through photocatalysis under sunlight 67 in the co precipitation method nucleation and product growth kinetics can be controlled by manipulating release of component ions similarly biobr biocl pani was synthesized by the same method and the product was employed for degradation of wastewater abundant dye methyl orange 77 other composite synthesized through co precipitation route is biobr tio2 78 2 6 hydrothermal method there is a slight difference of employed solvent between solvothermal methods where various organic solvents are used while in hydrothermal route water is employed as a solvent normally precursors are dissolved in distilled water and transferred into an autoclave followed by heating for a suitable time and temperature autogenous pressure initiates the reaction and a variety of heterostructures are produced time and temperature of reaction precursor and medium of solution are major determining factors for the quality of product jiang et al synthesized biobr bioi binary composites through a hydrothermal method in which precursors were mixed in water nitric acid and then heated for 12 h at temperature ranging from 110 to 260 c the product with varying ratios of oxygen and halides were employed for the photocatalytic degradation of wastewater contaminants such as phenols and crystal violet dyes 68 ternary composites of biobr fe3o4 rgo were also synthesized by the hydrothermal method as shown in fig 3 62 hydrothermal synthesis is cost effective less toxic and controllable in terms of size and morphology other biobr composites synthesized by hydrothermal method include agbr g c3n4 biobr 75 cqds biocl biobr 79 biocl biobr 80 and bi2s3 biobr 81 3 photocatalysis photocatalysis is a phenomenon in which a semiconductor based photocatalyst is employed to absorb sunlight and initiates the degradation reaction sunlight energy is converted into chemical energy that is used to degrade a variety of pollutants including organic molecules dyes pharmaceuticals pesticides personal care products oils and inorganic molecules 82 84 electrons excited by sunlight energy jump from the valence band to the conduction band followed by the creation of holes in the same band this excitation requires striking of sunlight photons on the photocatalyst surface provided that they have energy more than the band gap of the photocatalyst the energy consumed by this process is provided by the sunlight photons semiconductor with narrowband gap such as biobr 85 is more suitable the photocatalyst because narrow band gap enables photocatalyst to harvest the maximum visible sunlight portion photo excited electrons holes are separated and transferred to the surface of semiconductor these electrons holes may recombine producing phonons and heat leading to the decreased number of charge carries and ultimately less efficient photocatalysis this step can be prevented by development of binary and ternary composites of visible light photocatalyst such as bioi biobr 43 and g c3n4 bi biobr 86 binary and ternary heterojunctions enhance the photocatalysis rate by narrowing the band gap and suppressing electron hole pair s recombination rate in photocatalytic reaction electrons and holes are generated when light strikes on the surface of photocatalyst the major function of photo generated electrons is to reduce contaminants in wastewater and to react with oxygen to produce highly reactive superoxide radicals o2 2 in the same process when these electrons react with water molecules present in the environment they produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and they are used in further enhancement of the pollutant degradation process the radical species react with organic contaminants and convert them into simple less toxic molecules with expected final degradation products such as co2 and h2o on the other hand photo generated holes react with water molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals that react with contaminants and convert them into simple molecules photogenerated holes also react directly with pollutants such as methylene blue dyes and convert them into carbon dioxide and water directly photocatalytic mechanism has been further elaborated in excellent reviews referenced here 87 89 another factor that can influence photocatalysis rate is the adsorption of pollutant material on the photocatalyst surface as this process can increase the charge movement and enhance rate of redox reaction 26 90 the high rate of charges recombination and broad gap of photocatalyst render photocatalyst incapable of working at higher scale various strategies are employed to overcome these limitations and the formation of heterojunction is one of them for visible light photocatalyst biobr based binary and ternary composites are promising photocatalysts for wastewater treatment at higher level without compromising efficiency for instance ternary composite heterojunction pani biobr znfe2o4 has been used to degrade of organic pollutants such as benzene through photocatalysis as shown in fig 4 72 4 strategies for enhancement of photocatalytic activity 4 1 photosensitization photosensitization is a process of associating sensitizer with a photocatalyst to significantly enhance photocatalytic activity a photosensitizer is a chemical specie that facilitates absorption of sunlight energy from ultraviolet to visible region and transfers this energy to a photocatalyst to initiate a reaction degradation reaction in this case it acts as an additional energy source for photocatalyst to drive a degradation reaction photosensitizers based on transition metals are widely used in diverse fields and they have coordinated complex with conjugated ligands 91 basically photosensitizer enhance the sunlight absorption of photocatalyst by extending its absorption spectrum from uv light to visible region by employing chemi sorbing or physico sorbing substances the photosensitization mechanism involves the transfer of visible light excited electron to the conduction band from the valence band of photocatalyst where these electrons are used to progress the photocatalytic reaction owing to photostability and excellent photosensitizing properties photosensitizers based on organometallic complex are widely used the examples include ruthenium complexes copper complexes and zinc complexes 92 95 aimed at wastewater treatment degradation of phenols and orange ii dye has been performed on cu phthalocyanine cu pc sensitized biobr rgo under simulated sunlight the result showed that loading of 0 25 of photosensitizer onto the photocatalyst surface gave significantly better results as compared to unloaded 51 96 there are a large number of conjugated ligands that make porphyrins capable of absorbing a wide range in visible regions and owing to this feature its complexes with transition metals are excellent photosensitizers for photocatalytic process photosensitization of biobr biocl pani with sn porphyrin sn pp results in excellent photodegradation of methyl orange with 96 degradation efficiency in only 10 min sn pp sensitized biobr biocl pani showed 7 more degradation efficiency than unloaded photocatalyst and this enhanced activity is due to the small band gap of sn pp and resultant more absorption in the visible region 97 photosensitization process can only extend the absorption spectrum of photocatalyst and it has limited use because it cannot narrow down the band gap or reduce charged recombination and also they are expensive to use and their performance is lower than the composite materials 4 2 facet control facet of crystalline photocatalyst is an important feature that can change the absorption of sunlight geometry electronic structure surface physiochemical properties and intrinsic activity to enhance the photocatalytic properties of semiconductor material facet engineering has been in focus recently 98 101 different studies reported about four mechanisms that are followed in enhancement of photocatalytic activity through facet engineering 1 adsorption and activation of molecules caused by atomic re arrangement in surface area and through this selectivity catalytic activity is tuned 102 103 2 redox capabilities of electron hole pairs are tuned by changing electric band structures through face engineering resulting in better efficiency of photocatalyst 104 3 crystal orientation determines separation and transfer of their photoinduced charged carriers leading to variation in charged density on surface reactions 105 4 spatial charge separation results in accumulation of photo generated electron hole pairs at different facets and this can be achieved through facet control 106 zhang et al synthesized 001 and 102 in biobr nanosheets through hydrothermal route and investigated their photocatalytic properties for environmental applications such as degradation of industrial dyes the photocatalyst with 102 exposed facets successfully degraded the dye in 16 min of irradiation while 001 facet was slow to degrade proving better efficiency of 102 exposed facets in biobr nanosheets fig 5 presents a comparison of photocatalytic activity of both facets better photocatalytic performance by 102 is attributed to better band structure as it has higher valence band maximum and lower conduction band minimum and further more in 102 facet electron ejection is more efficient redox capability of photoinduced charge is higher and it has narrowband gap 1 44ev than 001 facets 2 22ev 107 in a similar process lamellas of biobr sheets having a thickness range of 9 32 nm with 001 exposed facet were synthesized through a simple hydrolysis system and to achieve desired properties temperature and solvent conditions were tuned to make this synthesis easy and greener no capping agent or surfactant was used as a result the active surface area of the photocatalyst was enhanced from 83 to 94 and this increased active surface areas was confirmed by enhancement in photocatalytic performance in degradation of rhodamine dye this increase in photocatalytic activity is due to increased adsorption of dyes on the active surface of the photocatalyst 108 facet controlled photocatalytic materials are far from practical application owing to their difficult and harsh conditions requiring synthesis use of expensive and toxic surfactants and multiple issues in their up scaling there are limited methods of synthesis of facet controlled photocatalyst and shortcomings of characterization techniques are not adequate for detailed study of charge kinetics at facet surface 4 3 defect engineering recently defect engineering in semiconductor photocatalysis has been focused owing to the ability of this technique to modulate charge separation charge density surface microstructure and electronic structure even coordination structure can be changed by introduction of an appropriate defect in semiconductor photocatalyst 109 111 owing to easiness in creation and prevalence in oxide materials oxygen vacancies are the most studied defects in photocatalyst photogenerated electrons can stay on oxygen vacancy on the surface of photocatalyst and it results in reducing recombination of charges oxygen vacancies increase adsorption of substrate and this adsorption enhances the rate of electron transfer due to coupling effect both these factors are highly beneficial for the overall photocatalytic process 112 113 there are limited studies in which metal vacancies have been created to improve photocatalytic activity due to the absence of credible process and difficulty in operation of metal defects however wang et al synthesized biobr with oxygen defect through solvothermal method as a case study to portray defect engineered photocatalyst as an ideal procedure for environmental remediation oxygen rich photocatalyst was employed for degradation of 4 chlorophenol and results showed 10 9 times better efficiency of defect engineered photocatalyst as compared to simple biobr photocatalyst this better photocatalytic property is ascribed to higher capturing capability in the visible region of light and high charge separation due to solid solutions and its synergistic effect with oxygen vacancy as they can narrow down band gap and impedes charge recombination 114 oxygen based vacancies are easy to create but they require a synergizing factor through doping or doping to act as an efficient photocatalyst there are several studies reporting oxygen vacancy created in bismuth oxybromide aimed at enhancement of photocatalytic activity for a variety of purposes such as degradation of pollutants and ammonia synthesis 115 116 bismuth based vacancies are rare case for instance di et al synthesized biobr with bismuth vacancy through ionic liquid assisted technique at room temperature defect engineered photocatalyst showed 3 8 times higher photocatalytic performance as compared to simple biobr photocatalyst this enhanced activity of biobr ultrathin nanosheets with bismuth vacancy is due to more suitable electronic structure and improved interaction of the substrate with its surface 117 to get benefit from the synergistic effect of metal and oxygen vacancy bi3o4br nanosheets with bismuth defects has also been reported the synergistic effect of two vacancies has been employed to increase the electron hole separation through tuning of electronic structure and atomic arrangement resultant photocatalyst with double vacancy showed 30 times greater photocatalytic activity than simple photocatalyst 111 major limitations of defect engineering are harsh synthetic conditions and difficulty to industrialize 4 4 elemental doping doping is a widely reported phenomenon aimed at enhancement of photocatalytic properties of biobr photocatalyst doping inhibits electron hole recombination enhances visible light absorption and redox capability of photoexcited charge carriers 118 it is necessary to add appropriate amount of dopant because excess amount of dopant can be sited for recombination of photo generated charges as demonstrated by song et al excess amount of zinc ion zn2 as dopant on biobr results in decreased photocatalytic activity 119 dopant must have capability of electron hole capture and should facilitate their separation and easy release towards surface migration for reaction initiation 120 in most studies rare earth metals noble metals and transition metals have been used in cationic doping of biobr palladium is one of the noble metals that have been used as dopant in hydrothermally synthesized biobr by meng et al employing photodeposition method as illustrated in fig 6 there was no covalent bonding between pd and biobr the dopant was only surface dispersed on the photocatalyst pd loaded photocatalyst was used to degrade phenol and it degraded 100 while pristine biobr was able to degrade only 67 noble metal dopant enhance photocatalytic activity of semiconductor photocatalyst by two mechanisms 1 enhancement of visible light absorption through surface plasmon effect and 2 inhibition of photoexcited electron hole pairs recombination 121 the synthesis process of doped photocatalyst also influences the photocatalytic activity for instance pd doped biobr was synthesized through one pot facile synthesis but their activity was not good as compared to the aforementioned method incomplete reduction of pd 2 to pd nps and non uniform dispersion of dopant are two limitation of one pot facile synthesis that results in less photocatalytic activity 122 other noble metals employed for doping of biobr are silver rhodium platinum and gold 123 125 among rare earth metals erbium er yttrium y cerium ce and lanthanum la have been employed as dopant for biobr for photocatalytic degradation of environmental pollutants such as ciprofloxacin and rhodamine b 53 126 appropriate amount of dopant is an essential factor in rare earth metals doping for instance imam et al synthesized biobr through chemical precipitation method with 1 3 and 5 doping of la 3 and employed them for degradation of ciprofloxacin maximum degradation was exhibited by 3 y biobr was 87 6 degradation of wastewater contaminant as compared to pristine biobr which was 71 7 only increase in photocatalytic activity till 3 y biobr is ascribed to the increased surface area from 19 65 m2 g for pristine to 31 2 m2 g improved electron hole separation and enhanced absorption and in 5 recombination sites for electron hole are formed that results in decrease of photocatalytic activity 53 similarly er biobr has also been reported with varying amount 1 3 5 and 8 of er and increases photocatalytic activity was observed till 3 and then decreased which is attributed to formation of electron holes recombination centers 126 widely studied transition metal doping increases the life span of charged carriers by inhibiting their recombination through tuning band structure as in the case of zn doped biobr 119 some studies also reported that transition metal doping enhances the visible light absorption for instance liu et al synthesized trivalent iron fe3 doped biobr and studied their photocatalytic activity by degradation of methyl orange doped photocatalyst showed better degradation as compared to pristine biobr attributed to the increased absorption in the visible region of light and rapid electron hole transfer 128 other transition metals employed for doping of biobr include titanium ti copper cu cobalt co manganese mn and niobium nb 129 132 there are limited number of studies that report anionic doping biobr in a similar example of anionic dopant introduction monovalent iodine anion was doped on biobr produced by precipitation method and employed for sunlight driven degradation of methyl orange iodine doped biobr showed more degradation of wastewater pollutant than pristine photocatalyst and this increase in photocatalytic activity is attributed to more electron holes generation and broadening of light absorption from ultraviolet to visible region this broadening of light absorption occurred due to decrease in band of gaps from 2 77 ev for pristine to 1 93 for iodine doped photocatalyst fig 7 127 noble metals are expensive and this render their doping an expensive procedure and not suitable for large scale applications there is no single doping element that can increase surface area narrowband gap enhance charge separation and transfer inhibits charge recombination and cost effective other than these limitations of elemental doping necessity of appropriate amount of dopant is another issue 4 5 bismuth rich strategy band structure particularly position of conduction band is important for photocatalytic activity of semiconductor and this property is restricted by positive position of cb reactivity of electrons that react with water to produce reacting radicals is directly proportional to the negative position of cb more negative position of cb more potent reducing electrons and vice versa density functional theory dft suggests that the valence bond in biobr is primarily based on hybridization of 2p orbital of oxygen and 4p orbital of bromine while 6p orbital of bismuth gives rise to the valence band 133 136 there are several studies which revealed that increase in bismuth content in biobr semiconductor enhances the photocatalytic performance for instance mi et al synthesized belt like bi4o5br2 nanomaterials through one step hydrolysis method at varying temperature and employed them in photocatalytic degradation of salicylic acid and resorcinol belt like bi4o5br2 b 25 synthesized at 25 c showed 97 resorcinol degradation after 8 h and 95 salicylic acid degradation after 4 h and it was 50 higher than simple biobr this enhanced photocatalytic property is due to increased surface area narrower band gap and more negative cb of bi4o5br2 b 25 as shown in fig 8 belt like bi4o5br2 b 25 has more negative cb ecb 0 37 than plate like bi4o5br2 ecb 0 34 and biobr ecb 0 23 and band gap narrow downed to 2 28 ev from 2 67 ev 54 in similar studies various bismuth rich oxybromides have been reported including bi4o5br2 137 140 bi5o7br 141 142 bi3o4br 143 bi12o17br2 144 bi24o31br10 127 145 and employed for environmental remediation like wastewater treatment synthesis of bismuth rich oxybromide is an ideal technique for optimization of band gap and band structure but it is difficult process to control amount of bismuth during synthesis these developments are still far from practical applications to achieve highly efficient bismuth rich oxybromide photocatalyst for large scale application such as wastewater treatment there is need for surface modification better morphological control and tuning of internal electric field 4 6 composite formation heterojunctions are constructed through binary and ternary composite formation aimed at enhancement of photocatalytic activity in these composites there is heterojunction at the interface of two different semiconductors with suitable band gap and band structure that inhibits photoinduced electron holes recombination the need of composite formation arose due to inefficiency of single biobr photocatalyst in practical applications at industrial scale several studies proved that composite formation is an effective way to increase photocatalytic activity and this increase is due to its better visible light harvesting more charges separation layered structure endowed high surface area and ideal band structure for deep redox potential 146 147 for instance hu et al synthesized p n heterojunction forming biobr bi2wo6 composite through solvothermal method and employed them for photocatalytic degradation of industrial dyes and phenolic compounds in wastewater photocatalytic degradation efficiency of composites was investigated by its employment in degradation of phenol and methylene blue and it was able to degrade 96 of methylene blue relative to biobr with degradation of 43 and bi2wo6 with degradation of 62 this increase in photocatalytic activity was the result of p n junction formation that enhanced the separation and rapid transfer of photogenerated electron holes pair 148 morphology of structure is an important factor for photocatalytic activity for instance rashid et al synthesized butterfly cluster like lamellar biobr tio2 binary composite through in situ deposition method at room temperature and employed them for photocatalytic breakdown of ciprofloxacin light absorption was increased owing to increased surface area up to 160 797 from 124 6 m2 g due to butterfly cluster morphology of biobr see fig 9 to determine suitability of the product for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment it was employed for the photocatalytic breakdown of 25 mg l aqueous solution of ciprofloxacin under direct sunlight and marvelously 100 degradation was observed binary composites showed 5 2 and 9 4 times more photocatalytic activity than pristine biobr and tio2 content percentage of biobr in binary composites was another factor that determined degradation rate and percentage of photocatalyst highest photocatalytic activity was showed by 15 biobr tio2 and it was more than binary composite containing 10 20 5 and pristine biobr other than surface area inhibition of electron holes recombination was another factor that enhanced photocatalytic activity of binary composite in such a way that tio2 acted as an electron sink and holes in biobr initiated the reaction of ciprofloxacin degradation 149 photocatalytic activity obtained for binary composites is still far from practical use owing to loss of activity during multiple cycle chemical instability in the industrial environment and difficult photocatalyst recovery process for advancement of photocatalytic properties of binary composites three methods are employed including doping 64 photosensitization 51 and formation of ternary composites 61 in case of binary composites of biobr doping and photosensitization could not produce desired result with limitations due to expensive cost of dopant and sensitizers however ternary composites proved to be promising candidates in fulfilling the requirement of an ideal photocatalyst for wastewater treatment at industrial level formation of ternary composites has solved the problem of photocatalyst recovery by introducing magnetic ternary composites for instance li and co workers reported synthesis of fe3o4 biobr bioi based ternary composite photocatalyst by solvothermal route to degrade rhodamine b a textile wastewater dye the ternary composite exhibited 100 degradation of dye in 80 min showing superior photocatalytic activity to the fe3o4 biobr binary composite this increase in photocatalytic activity was due to better light absorption owing to more suitable band gap and band structure in ternary composites synthetic method greatly influences the surface area of the photocatalyst and ultimately photocatalytic activity for example solvothermally synthesized fe3o4 biobr bioi has more active surface area 48 30 m2 g than that of a similar composite synthesized by co precipitation method 50 ternary composites offer improved light absorption high quantum yield rapid electron transfer and better photocatalytic activity for instance zhang et al synthesized pani biobr znfe2o4 and tried to harness high charge carrier mobility and environmental stability of the conducting polymer polyaniline pani for photocatalytic treatment of textile wastewater the synthesized ternary composite completely degraded the rhodamine b dye in 30 min ternary composite showed better photocatalytic performance as compared to the binary composite and individual components and its enhancement is attributed to the increased charge carriers generation and their rapid transfer and separation to assess the wide applicability of pani biobr znfe2o4 ternary composite it was used for photocatalytic removal of various other organic pollutants such as norfloxacin methylene blue bisphenol a and methyl orange with removal rates of 89 7 90 97 75 64 and 95 32 respectively and after 60 min visible irradiation recorded the effect of ph on photocatalytic activity of photocatalyst was also studied and reportedly pani biobr znfe2o4 ternary composite showed higher photocatalytic activity at neutral ph 7 in alkaline solution degradation efficiency was enhanced due to the increased interaction of photocatalyst and dye owing to negative charge of biobr and positive charge on rhodamine b acidic conditions decreased photocatalytic performance of ternary composite and this decrease was due to positive charge on biobr resulting in electrostatic repulsion and less interaction for practical applications other than chemical stability photostability and reusability are crucial to determine reusability ternary composite was used to degrade rhodamine b three time and only trivial 1 4 decrease in photocatalytic activity was recorded as compared to biobr where this decrease was significant 10 for three cycle x ray diffraction xrd pattern of pani biobr znfe2o4 after three cycles of its usage showed lack of differences thus indicating its high photostability 72 conclusively binary and ternary composites of biobr are the most optimized and promising candidates for photocatalytic wastewater treatment owing to their highest optimization in terms of band gap band structure recovery reusability photostability chemical stability and quantum yield in subsequent paragraphs we will discuss the application of biobr based binary ad ternary composite for wastewater treatment 5 application of biobr based binary and ternary composites in wastewater treatment a literature on the application of biobr based binary and ternary composites in wastewater treatment is widely available this section aims to deliberate the mechanism of photocatalytic activity enhancement through formation of binary and ternary composites table 1 clearly demonstrates that binary and ternary composite results in better degradation of wastewater pollutants compared to biobr the average increase in degradation percentage is more than 50 for instance in the case of biobr nabio3 chlorophenol degradation percentage was increased from 0 8 biobr to more than 92 with quantum yield of about 0 365 multiple factors are involved in this enhancement of photocatalytic activity including band gap band structure and interface modulation of band gap is the leading factor that is contributing mainly towards enhanced efficiency by formation of binary composite band gap was optimally narrowed down from its component band gap of nabio3 is 2 60 ev and that of biobr is 2 88 ev while after formation of binary composite it is reduced to 2 52 ev which is optimum in terms of both efficient sunlight harvesting and charge carrier generation valence band is based in biobr and its amount is important for generation of suitable band structure for maximum photocatalytic activity in this case 9 biobr is ideal for highest photocatalytic efficiency increase results in change in band structure and reduction of photocatalytic activity significance of the interface was determined by comparing photocatalytic activity of 9 biobr nabio3 mechanical mixture which gave only 72 photodegradation efficiency about 20 less than original catalyst in composite form two interfaces were closely coupled that reduce electron and hole recombination while in case of mechanical mixture there is no influence of interface in reducing charge recombination conclusively binary composite results in efficient visible light harvesting due to modulated band gap rapid separation with high redox potential interface to prevent recombination of electrons and holes and 9 amount of biobr to balance the redox ability and separation efficiency of photogenerated charges 150 synthesis of binary composites results in improved photocatalytic activity but developments are still far from practical applications to harness the interfacial aspect of composites leading to enhanced surface area and increased charge separation researchers have switched to the synthesis of ternary composites for wastewater treatment for instance bi biobr agbr has about two times greater photodegradation percentage against rhodamine b than pristine biobr which can only degrade 48 of wastewater pollutants while ternary composites easily degraded about 95 of the dye this enhanced photocatalytic performance is ascribed to major three factors high absorption capacity in the visible region instant electron transfer and high charge separation efficiency in this case presence of bi metallic nanoparticles results in surface plasmon resonance that cause more absorption in visible region it has also been reported that higher visible light absorption is not only contributing factor towards enhanced photocatalytic activity of ternary composites but also the smaller arc radius enhances charge separation efficiency and speed of electron transfer 65 recovery of catalyst from wastewater after degradation of target pollutant is a one of the still not solved challenges synthesis of magnetic ternary composites containing fe2o3 makes it easier to recover the photocatalyst moreover the presence of metal oxygen bond is beneficial as it can enhance photocatalytic activity by increasing surface area and facilitating adsorption of pollutants for example fe3o4 biobr bioi 50 fe3o4 msio2 biobr 69 biobr fe3o4 rgo 62 and fe3o4 biobr cqds 151 irrespective of synthetic method ternary composites are better than binary composites owing to ideally modulated band gap more suitable band structure and more adsorption area for pollutants such as bi biobr agbr has better degradation efficacy than binary composites of its components and showed 4 9 and 1 4 times faster degradation of rhodamine b than biobr agbr and bi biobr respectively 65 similarly biobr tio2 g was found to be a better photocatalyst than biobr tio2 prepared for variety of pollutant degradation 78 149 152 154 and g c3n4 bioi biobr can degrade different wastewater pollutants more efficiently than binary composites of its components such as bioi biobr 49 54 146 155 157 summarily biobr based composites whether binary or ternary are better photocatalyst for wastewater treatment than pure biobr these composites offer more visible light harvesting to the photocatalyst through narrowband gap increased charge separation reduced charge recombination by suitable band structures and increased surface area for both enhanced absorption of sunlight and adsorption of target pollutant last but not the least such photocatalysts can be easily recovered after photocatalytic action if magnetic components are employed in composites 6 current challenges though reported literature it is evident that a significant development in the field of biobr based binary and ternary composites has been made however these developments are still far from practical applications composites result in increased surface active sites but their role in enhancing photocatalytic activity is undefined and cannot be manipulated positively immobilization of substrate on the surface of photocatalyst is one of the crucial steps it needs to explored for better performance in laboratory it is easy to degrade model pollutant but real wastewater is complex mixture that demands more optimization in terms of selectivity and environmental conditions such ph temperature and nature of wastewater reported photocatalysts are specialized for only single or a group of pollutants that is challenging to degrade real wastewater by a single photocatalyst to employ biobr based composite photocatalysts at large scale for industrial wastewater their manufacturing at commercial level is one of the major challenge that needs to be addressed conclusively other than band gap band structure surface optimization reusability recovery and absence of solid supports are huge challenges 7 conclusion owing to the layered structure of biobr their composites are efficient photocatalysts for wastewater treatment for enhancement of photocatalytic activity other techniques such as doping facet control and defect engineering are available to form binary and ternary composites in this review recent literature was summarized to extract vital information for enhancement strategies for biobr based photocatalysts and primarily focusing on binary and ternary composite for photocatalytic wastewater treatment while briefly outlining their synthesis methods this information is substantial for researchers to move forward in application of these binary and ternary composites at industrial scale wastewater treatment the synergistic effect of individual components in the composites along with other enhancement strategies can be beneficial for large scale applications for efficient removal of pollutants from wastewater we believe that future research should be focused on coupling photocatalytic process with complementing techniques such as membrane based technologies and anaerobic digestion therefore more advanced research is expected in this field aimed at designing new composites having more suitable band gap band structure better chemical and physical stability and surface properties that could revolutionize photocatalytic wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8746,hydrazine has been largely replaced by carbohydrazide chz as an oxygen scavenger due to safety and health concerns and chz is now used in saline water conversion corporation swcc high pressure boilers however the operational problem of phosphate hide out has become a continuous challenge for the plant operators advances in boiler water treatment have shown that effective corrosion control and prevention of scaling can be achieved by using a mixture of film forming and alkalizing amines and polycarboxylates film forming amine product ffap with the use of ffap carbohydrazide ammonia treatment of make up water and phosphate treatment in the drum will not be required a uniform ffap formulation was used throughout the test the evaluation study was carried out at a boiler of the yanbu phase 1 desalination and power plant mitsubishi generating 60 mwh with make up water of 15 t h 1 producing 330 t h 1 steam at a pressure of 67 barg and temperature of 480 c the trial provided evidence that ffap was a good alternative to use of an oxygen scavenger changeover from chz to ffap without phosphate addition in the drum was done initially by dosing ffap from both hydrazine tank and phosphate tank so that ph was maintained to the required values in both feed water and drum water with the optimal dose rate 0 6 ppm maintaining ffap in the range of 0 3 1 0 ppm in feed water all the key parameters ph ammonia and specific conductivity were within the specified boiler design limits the average corrosion rates on the water side were low for both chz and ffap treatment 0 009 0 001 mm y 1 however ffap treated coupons showed much lower corrosion rates compared to chz in the steam side 0 0006 0 0003 mm y 1 cf 0 0075 0 0006 mm y 1 keywords boiler carbohydrazide corrosion oxygen scavenger polyamine data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the saline water conversion corporation swcc produces electrical power and drinking water for the kingdom of saudi arabia through its dual purpose plants located in al jubail al khobar al khafji shoaibah yanbu al shoqaiq and ras al khair the total power generated from these plants is approximately 5000 mw the core of the power generation process are the boilers 60 throughout the swcc system which produce high pressure steam that drives the blades of the turbines for generating electricity in all these boilers oxygen scavengers are used to control oxygen and maintain a passive magnetite layer inside the boiler tubes the feed water used in boilers is usually the make up water produced from demineralization plant and the returned condensate from turbines and brine heaters there is a high chance of contamination of the feed water with dissolved solids dissolved gases and suspended matter the common gases that have a strong impact on boiler chemistry are oxygen and carbon dioxide dissolved in feed water dissolved oxygen is a constant threat to steam generator tube integrity and acts as a catalyst for many types of corrosion 1 small quantities of dissolved oxygen can cause severe pitting corrosion in boilers and assist in the ammonia corrosion on copper alloy 2 air leakage into the system is another source of oxygen incomplete removal of oxygen from the feed water allows it to reach the boiler where it will flash off with the steam and together with ingressed oxygen can cause condensate corrosion problems 3 generally deaerators are employed in power plants to control and mechanically eliminate oxygen from feed water however deaerators cannot totally eliminate dissolved oxygen from feed water the most popular technique to achieve almost complete elimination of dissolved oxygen in boiler feed water is through the use of chemical oxygen scavengers 4 5 among the many oxygen scavengers available are hydrazine carbohydrazide n diethyl hydroxylamine hydroxyquinone and erythorbic acid 6 12 hydrazine has been extensively used as an effective oxygen scavenger 12 and was previously utilized in many of the high pressure boilers of swcc at low temperatures the scavenging effect of hydrazine is quite slow 13 14 in addition health concerns have been raised over the use of hydrazine 15 carbohydrazide is a less hazardous compound that presents fewer health and safety concerns and has the same limits to its effectiveness as hydrazine since it decomposes to hydrazine in the boiler though carbohydrazide was able to resolve the issue of safety and health concerns congruent phosphate treatment cpt led to significant problems in phosphate hideout 16 18 cpt is maintenance of the na po4 ratio at around 2 6 while also maintaining the alkalinity high enough to minimize corrosion 19 20 boiler water in a high heat flux zone is likely to concentrate due to evaporation local conditions may prevent adequate mixing with bulk liquid phase and over time a concentration gradient will develop between the bulk boiler water and the localized solution in contact with the magnetite surface localized concentrations for some species may thus be two or more orders of magnitude higher than in the bulk boiler 21 under these conditions salts with limited solubility such as those incorporating phosphate species may exceed their solubility limits and undergo precipitation or hideout hideout can be at its worst in a cycling unit shutdowns and startups and even load changes cause precipitation and dissolution of phosphates this in turn causes wide fluctuations in boiler water chemistry phosphate hideout appears to be further influenced by the cleanliness of the boiler tubes and becomes more severe with increased deposit loading particularly iron oxides the evidence indicates that sodium phosphates form a sodium iron phosphate complex with the magnetite layer severe hideout and the reverse dissolution process have been known to force boiler water ph below 7 in cycling units 21 in order to make a preliminary choice for evaluation of a suitable alternative to oxygen scavenger in swcc commercial boilers available literature of the products was reviewed including technical datasheets reports of practical applications on commercial running boilers and toxicity certificates of the products a commercial film forming amine product helamin ffap consisting of film forming polyamines steam volatile amines and polycarboxylates of varying volatility which allows control of the ph at the beginning middle and end section of the condensate system as well as the boiler feed water tanks was selected as the most suitable alternative to oxygen scavenger for evaluation this formulation contains a film forming amine which is adsorbed by the boiler or pipe surface to form a hydrophobic membrane protecting the metal against corrosion and encouraging formation of a smooth and compact magnetite layer which inhibits corrosion 22 at high temperatures it has been found to improve the structure of magnetite layer and increase the protective effect 23 30 thermal and oxidative decomposition show formation of organic anions formate acetate and propionate in very low concentration with negligible effect on the ph of the condensate the main criterion for selection of ffap was to avoid the phosphate hideout problem as with use of film forming additives no phosphate treatment is required a solution to this problem had been requested by the operations and maintenance team at yanbu dual purpose plant 1 1 research objectives the main objective of this study was to study the use of a film forming amine polyamine alkalizing amine and polycarboxylate formulation film forming amine product ffap as an alternative to oxygen scavenger without the phosphate treatment in the high pressure boiler of the swcc plant at yanbu further objectives were to optimize dose rate and determine corrosion rate 2 experimental boiler 2 of phase 1 at the yanbu swcc integrated water and power plants which produces high pressure steam that drives the blades of turbines each generating 60 mwh was selected for the trial tests the boiler is a pressurized box type water tube boiler of mitsubishi make with makeup water of 15 t h 1 fig 1 the maximum continuous rating of steam is 330 t h 1 the feed comprising condensed steam plus make up water is first passed through the deaerator at a pressure of 2 bar and temperature of 132 c after the deaerator the feed water is dosed with a chemical scavenger and then is heated at hp heater at a temperature of 320 c coordinated phosphate treatment is done in boiler drum for ph adjustment from the boiler drum it is passed into the super heater the superheated steam at a temperature of 480 c and 67 barg goes to the turbine the steam leaving the turbine is sent to heat the recycled brine of desalination plants fig 1 the material of brine heater is made of copper alloys baseline data using the original treatment comprising dosing with ammonia make up water carbohydrazide feed water and phosphate boiler drum was developed over a period of three months this data consisted of operation as well as chemical parameters such as iron and copper concentrations in the feed water sample and other control parameters ph ammonia chloride specific conductivity and dissolved oxygen carbohydrazide was injected in feed water at the deaerator outlet at a dose rate of 0 5 ppm with residual of 20 40 ppb all boiler chemistry limits and test conditions were maintained in the boiler tables 1 and 2 original dosage requirements of the commercial ffap helamin were specified by the supplier as 5 ppm with respect to the feed water flow with a residual of 1 0 2 0 ppm in boiler feed water 2 1 start up procedure with ffap before filling of the boiler both dosing tanks hydrazine and phosphate were thoroughly cleaned by flushing the tanks with demineralized water 25 ffap solution was then prepared in both the dosing tanks by transferring 125 l of ffap and diluting to 500 l then mixing for 5 min with the mixer at the hydrazine dosing point ffap dosing commenced with 100 pump stroke new pump equivalent to 6 l h 1 until the boiler filling was completed at the phosphate tank ffap dosing commenced with 100 pump stroke equivalent to 4 5 l h 1 until the boiler filling was completed initially the ffap dosing pump hydrazine and phosphate was maintained at 100 stroke if all the parameters are satisfactory boiler water ph in the range of 9 5 10 and feed water and condensate in the range of 8 8 9 5 the ffap dosing was stopped at phosphate tank and boiler blow down was opened if required and adjusted according to yanbu power plant design values table 2 2 2 analytical parameters and procedures 2 2 1 boiler water chemistry the following parameters for boiler water chemistry were

following locations boiler drum two coupons of carbon steel were placed in the water side and two coupons on the steam side steam condensate two coupons of carbon steel ffap test two coupons of cupronickel chz test the coupons were withdrawn during the boiler shutdown for physical examination and evaluated for corrosion potential by weight loss photographs were taken of the coupons before and after exposure 2 2 3 boiler shutdown inspection internal inspection of the boiler was carried out at the end of testing besides visual checks and photographic documentation chemical analysis of several deposit samples was carried out by sem edx jeol model jsm 640 lv oxford inca model 7573 edx detector data was collected and analyzed with inca software 2 2 4 photometric determination of ffap the ffap contains a mixture of alkylamines which react with 4 5 6 7 tetrachloro 2 4 5 7 tetraiodofluorescein rose bengal compound 31 to form a colored complex of alkanolamines which dissolves in acetic acid this was measured using a hach dr5000 uv vis spectrometer 565 nm this method can be calibrated with standard solutions to measure between 0 05 and 30 0 ppm of ffap 2 2 5 thermal efficiency

dw ss and ls with ffap n 86 and with carbohydrazide determined in the same month 2016 n 4 and one year previously 2015 n 92 are shown in fig 2 the ph values for both chz and ffap were found to be maintained within the required limits of 8 8 and 9 5 for bhc fw ss ls and tc whereas for dw ph was at the extreme upper end of the required limits of 9 5 and 10 the ph values determined for make up water during the trial tests fell on average below the required limits of 8 8 and 9 2 the average values for ammonia determined with ffap showed a slight increase compared to chz 2015 but were found to be within the limits in the range of 0 3 1 0 ppm for fw bhc and tc respectively for ls and dw average values for ammonia were in the range of 0 1 0 ppm fig 3 specific conductivity values were higher with ffap than with carbohydrazide 2015 measurements consistent with the higher ph values observed but the average values determined were found to be within the limits in the range of 0 7 5 μs cm 1 for fw ss tc and bhc for ls in the range of 0 6 5 μs cm 1 and dw was 15 100 μs cm 1 fig 4 the slightly higher values may be attributed to ammonia contamination from other boilers that were treated with ammonia and due to common condenser header and mixing of condensate 32 with ffap dosing the average concentrations for iron and copper in fw dw bhc ss ls and tc were found to be at trace levels however bhc fw and tc showed elevated levels of cu early in the operation of the system suggesting that ffap was having a cleaning effect on the cu ni tubes of the brine heater average dissolved oxygen with both carbohydrazide and ffap in the feed water was found to be 5 ppb chloride determined for both carbohydrazide and ffap in dw was also found to be in the limit range of 0 0 5 ppm fig 5 silica in dw and ls treated with ffap was found to be in trace levels cation conductivity is one of the best ways to monitor for contaminants within a steam or water sample it is also referred to as conductivity after ion exchange cace acid conductivity and after exchange conductivity however many operators find it difficult to interpret cation conductivity readings particularly at plants whose steam generators use water containing either naturally occurring or purposefully added organic compounds the major turbine manufacturers demand conductivity of steam 0 2 μs cm 1 a slight increase in cation conductivity in the steam generation system with use of ppf the cation conductivity may go up to 0 5 μs cm 1 industry experience proves that even at increased cation conductivity operation of the cycle in the presence of ffap is possible without failure or damage 33 unfortunately cace could not be determined in the present study due to the non functioning of the cation conductivity system the boiler operation parameters were maintained within the normally experienced range and the average thermal efficiency for chz treatment was found to be 96 3 0 9 and for ffap treatment 96 5 0 5 3 2 optimization of ffap dose rate with optimized dose rates for chz residual hydrazine should be maintained around 20 ppb in feed water according to plant specifications but the values determined were not consistent and most frequently zero within the limits of detection this suggests that the dosage of chz used was not sufficient to maintain the necessary residual in the feed water and thus in the system changeover from chz to ffap without phosphate addition in the drum was done initially by dosing ffap from both hydrazine tank and phosphate tank so that ph was maintained to the required values in both feed water and drum water initially 25 concentration of ffap was prepared in both tanks at both the dosing pumps hydrazine and phosphate 100 pump stroke was maintained till all the parameters were satisfactory boiler water ph in the range of 9 5 10 and feed water and condensate in the range of 8 8 9 5 boiler blow down was opened if required and adjusted according to yanbu power plant design values table 2 when all the parameters were stabilized and the boiler operation was as per normal ffap injection at the phosphate tank was stopped and dose rate optimized by controlling the ffap concentration in the hydrazine tank and pump stroke till the ffap residual in feed water was consistent in the range of 0 3 1 ppm fig 6 the dose rate was optimized to 1 8 l h 1 30 pump stroke equivalent to 0 6 ppm with ffap concentration of 10 in the hydrazine tank by monitoring ffap residual as equivalent to 0 3 1 ppm in feed water all the key parameters ph ammonia and specific conductivity were found to be within the baseline limits figs 2 4 ffap was also monitored in dw ss ls tc and bhc in all the locations the residual ffap was found to be well maintained fig 6 3 3 corrosion studies the exposed coupons with chz treatment were visually examined a uniform and non porous oxide film was found to be adhered on the coupons indicating the protective nature of the films plate 1 coupons exposed with ffap treatment were found to have uniform and non porous black coating type film adhered on the coupons indicating the protective polyamine film was formed plate 2 efforts to remove the film from the coupons for investigation were unsuccessful the average corrosion rates determined with chz dosing for carbon steel coupons fixed in the boiler drum at water side and steam side were 0 0097 mm y 1 and 0 0075 mm y 1 respectively table 3 whereas that determined with ffap treatment were 0 0094 mm y 1 and 0 0006 mm y 1 respectively table 4 though the corrosion rate for water side was comparable for both chz and ffap steam side corrosion rates with ffap treatment showed remarkable reduction this indicated the ffap gave better protection from corrosion at the steam side consistent with previous reports of its effectiveness 34 although the steam condenser material is copper nickel carbon steel coupons were installed in both environments due to the unavailability of cu ni coupons at the time of the ffap tests this provides an indicative corrosion rate for comparison of the two treatments in the steam condenser the average corrosion rates with chz treatment were found to be higher 0 0189 0 0010 mm y 1 on cupronickel than with the ffap 0 0049 0 0002 mm y 1 on carbon steel thickness of the coupons measured after the treatment fig 7 showed that the coupons treated with chz were thicker than those treated with ffap indicating that a very thin protecting layer of ffap polymer was adherent on the coupons 34 3 4 physical examination of coupons physical examination of the carbon steel coupons treated with carbohydrazide retrieved from the drum water and steam side plate 1 showed dark grey oxide scales and these scales appeared to be protective with ffap treatment coupons retrieved from both water and steam side of the drum were found to have uniform non porous dark grey polyamine film adhered and appeared to be protective plate 2 the presence of a film on the surface as deduced from the observation that water droplets did not wet the surface sem edx of exposed coupons water side with carbohydrazide treatment showed predominantly iron and traces of manganese and phosphate fig 8 a the phosphate deposits are expected because of the phosphate treatment the coupons exposed with ffap treatment also showed predominantly iron with substantial amounts of copper and nickel fig 8 b the presence of copper and nickel can be attributed to corrosion products from the cu ni tubes in the top brine heater which are deposited on the coupons in the water side of the boiler after the initial cleaning effect of the ffap becoming occluded in the protective layer 3 5 boiler inspection and deposits analysis the inside of the boiler drum treated with carbohydrazide was covered with an adherent dark grey uniform layer of oxide scale analysis of the deposits treated with carbohydrazide showed that iron was predominant along with significant amounts of copper 11 23 and nickel 3 15 the presence of high concentration of copper and nickel was attributed to carryover of corrosion products from the copper alloy heat exchanger tubes of the top brine heater which became occluded in the oxide layer with ffap treatment the inside of the drum was covered with a uniform thin black powdery layer of polyamine that could not be removed in good quantity for analysis the corresponding deposits on the corrosion coupons were analyzed and found to be mainly composed of iron with substantial amounts of copper and nickel indicating carryover of corrosion products fig 8 3 6 boiler restart with ffap after trial test completion after ffap treatment the boiler was restarted to confirm that no negative effects were caused by the test since phosphate treatment was used in the boiler drum for the base line data collected with chz treatment residual phosphate was still present in the boiler water this was flushed by opening the boiler blow down till the phosphate value was zero after restarting the boiler phosphate values were checked and no phosphate was detected under ffap treatment an increase in the boiler feed water pump pressure 0 09 bar maximum was observed and the strainer was found to have deposits the deposits collected and analyzed were found to be corrosion products predominantly iron oxides the iron oxides found in the feed water pump strainer were attributed to a long boiler shutdown and restart 10 12 months after the chz treatment and previous to the ffap test in the beginning of boiler start up the iron level in both feed water and boiler water was in the range of 20 ppb but this fell to the limits of detection within one month restarting the boiler after the trial test shutdown and after more than one month of operation no increase in the boiler feed water pump pressure was observed and the feed water pump strainer was found to be clean four months data was recorded after the restart of the boiler the boiler water chemistry and the boiler operation parameters were found to be maintained within the design values residual ffap was also found to be maintained at an average of 1 ppm 4 conclusions the suitability and efficiency of a commercial film forming amine polyamine polycarboxylate alkalizing amines formulation ffap helamin as an alternative to oxygen scavenger in swcc high pressure boiler was confirmed omitting phosphate and ammonia treatment at the optimized dose rate of 0 6 ppm while maintaining the boiler chemistry within design limits it is important to continue with continuous boiler blow down and regular intermittent blow down and not to overdose ffap during the cleaning process the dose rate was optimized to maintain ffap residual between 0 3 and 1 0 ppm in feed water by adjustment to 1 8 l h 1 30 pump stroke equivalent to 0 6 ppm with ffap concentration of 10 iron and copper levels measured at boiler feed water and drum water were reduced to trace levels the average corrosion rates indicated similar corrosion in the presence of either chz 0 0097 0 0004 mm y 1 or ffap 0 0094 0 0013 mm y 1 on the water side however ffap 0 0006 0 0003 mm y 1 showed much lower rates compared to chz 0 0075 0 0006 mm y 1 on the steam side in the condenser the average corrosion rates with chz treatment were found to be higher 0 0189 0 0010 mm y 1 than ffap 0 0049 0 0002 mm y 1 thickness of the coupons measured after the treatment before cleaning showed that the coupons treated with chz had higher thickness than that treated with ffap indicating that a very thin protecting layer of ffap polymer was adhered on the coupons physical examination of the chz exposed coupons revealed the development of uniform non porous iron oxide film adhered on the metal indicating the protective nature of the film whereas ffap exposed coupons were found to have uniform non porous dark grey polyamine film adhered which appeared to be protective overall ffap was found to be a suitable additive for corrosion control in the boilers of the swcc high pressure boilers

8746,hydrazine has been largely replaced by carbohydrazide chz as an oxygen scavenger due to safety and health concerns and chz is now used in saline water conversion corporation swcc high pressure boilers however the operational problem of phosphate hide out has become a continuous challenge for the plant operators advances in boiler water treatment have shown that effective corrosion control and prevention of scaling can be achieved by using a mixture of film forming and alkalizing amines and polycarboxylates film forming amine product ffap with the use of ffap carbohydrazide ammonia treatment of make up water and phosphate treatment in the drum will not be required a uniform ffap formulation was used throughout the test the evaluation study was carried out at a boiler of the yanbu phase 1 desalination and power plant mitsubishi generating 60 mwh with make up water of 15 t h 1 producing 330 t h 1 steam at a pressure of 67 barg and temperature of 480 c the trial provided evidence that ffap was a good alternative to use of an oxygen scavenger changeover from chz to ffap without phosphate addition in the drum was done initially by dosing ffap from both hydrazine tank and phosphate tank so that ph was maintained to the required values in both feed water and drum water with the optimal dose rate 0 6 ppm maintaining ffap in the range of 0 3 1 0 ppm in feed water all the key parameters ph ammonia and specific conductivity were within the specified boiler design limits the average corrosion rates on the water side were low for both chz and ffap treatment 0 009 0 001 mm y 1 however ffap treated coupons showed much lower corrosion rates compared to chz in the steam side 0 0006 0 0003 mm y 1 cf 0 0075 0 0006 mm y 1 keywords boiler carbohydrazide corrosion oxygen scavenger polyamine data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the saline water conversion corporation swcc produces electrical power and drinking water for the kingdom of saudi arabia through its dual purpose plants located in al jubail al khobar al khafji shoaibah yanbu al shoqaiq and ras al khair the total power generated from these plants is approximately 5000 mw the core of the power generation process are the boilers 60 throughout the swcc system which produce high pressure steam that drives the blades of the turbines for generating electricity in all these boilers oxygen scavengers are used to control oxygen and maintain a passive magnetite layer inside the boiler tubes the feed water used in boilers is usually the make up water produced from demineralization plant and the returned condensate from turbines and brine heaters there is a high chance of contamination of the feed water with dissolved solids dissolved gases and suspended matter the common gases that have a strong impact on boiler chemistry are oxygen and carbon dioxide dissolved in feed water dissolved oxygen is a constant threat to steam generator tube integrity and acts as a catalyst for many types of corrosion 1 small quantities of dissolved oxygen can cause severe pitting corrosion in boilers and assist in the ammonia corrosion on copper alloy 2 air leakage into the system is another source of oxygen incomplete removal of oxygen from the feed water allows it to reach the boiler where it will flash off with the steam and together with ingressed oxygen can cause condensate corrosion problems 3 generally deaerators are employed in power plants to control and mechanically eliminate oxygen from feed water however deaerators cannot totally eliminate dissolved oxygen from feed water the most popular technique to achieve almost complete elimination of dissolved oxygen in boiler feed water is through the use of chemical oxygen scavengers 4 5 among the many oxygen scavengers available are hydrazine carbohydrazide n diethyl hydroxylamine hydroxyquinone and erythorbic acid 6 12 hydrazine has been extensively used as an effective oxygen scavenger 12 and was previously utilized in many of the high pressure boilers of swcc at low temperatures the scavenging effect of hydrazine is quite slow 13 14 in addition health concerns have been raised over the use of hydrazine 15 carbohydrazide is a less hazardous compound that presents fewer health and safety concerns and has the same limits to its effectiveness as hydrazine since it decomposes to hydrazine in the boiler though carbohydrazide was able to resolve the issue of safety and health concerns congruent phosphate treatment cpt led to significant problems in phosphate hideout 16 18 cpt is maintenance of the na po4 ratio at around 2 6 while also maintaining the alkalinity high enough to minimize corrosion 19 20 boiler water in a high heat flux zone is likely to concentrate due to evaporation local conditions may prevent adequate mixing with bulk liquid phase and over time a concentration gradient will develop between the bulk boiler water and the localized solution in contact with the magnetite surface localized concentrations for some species may thus be two or more orders of magnitude higher than in the bulk boiler 21 under these conditions salts with limited solubility such as those incorporating phosphate species may exceed their solubility limits and undergo precipitation or hideout hideout can be at its worst in a cycling unit shutdowns and startups and even load changes cause precipitation and dissolution of phosphates this in turn causes wide fluctuations in boiler water chemistry phosphate hideout appears to be further influenced by the cleanliness of the boiler tubes and becomes more severe with increased deposit loading particularly iron oxides the evidence indicates that sodium phosphates form a sodium iron phosphate complex with the magnetite layer severe hideout and the reverse dissolution process have been known to force boiler water ph below 7 in cycling units 21 in order to make a preliminary choice for evaluation of a suitable alternative to oxygen scavenger in swcc commercial boilers available literature of the products was reviewed including technical datasheets reports of practical applications on commercial running boilers and toxicity certificates of the products a commercial film forming amine product helamin ffap consisting of film forming polyamines steam volatile amines and polycarboxylates of varying volatility which allows control of the ph at the beginning middle and end section of the condensate system as well as the boiler feed water tanks was selected as the most suitable alternative to oxygen scavenger for evaluation this formulation contains a film forming amine which is adsorbed by the boiler or pipe surface to form a hydrophobic membrane protecting the metal against corrosion and encouraging formation of a smooth and compact magnetite layer which inhibits corrosion 22 at high temperatures it has been found to improve the structure of magnetite layer and increase the protective effect 23 30 thermal and oxidative decomposition show formation of organic anions formate acetate and propionate in very low concentration with negligible effect on the ph of the condensate the main criterion for selection of ffap was to avoid the phosphate hideout problem as with use of film forming additives no phosphate treatment is required a solution to this problem had been requested by the operations and maintenance team at yanbu dual purpose plant 1 1 research objectives the main objective of this study was to study the use of a film forming amine polyamine alkalizing amine and polycarboxylate formulation film forming amine product ffap as an alternative to oxygen scavenger without the phosphate treatment in the high pressure boiler of the swcc plant at yanbu further objectives were to optimize dose rate and determine corrosion rate 2 experimental boiler 2 of phase 1 at the yanbu swcc integrated water and power plants which produces high pressure steam that drives the blades of turbines each generating 60 mwh was selected for the trial tests the boiler is a pressurized box type water tube boiler of mitsubishi make with makeup water of 15 t h 1 fig 1 the maximum continuous rating of steam is 330 t h 1 the feed comprising condensed steam plus make up water is first passed through the deaerator at a pressure of 2 bar and temperature of 132 c after the deaerator the feed water is dosed with a chemical scavenger and then is heated at hp heater at a temperature of 320 c coordinated phosphate treatment is done in boiler drum for ph adjustment from the boiler drum it is passed into the super heater the superheated steam at a temperature of 480 c and 67 barg goes to the turbine the steam leaving the turbine is sent to heat the recycled brine of desalination plants fig 1 the material of brine heater is made of copper alloys baseline data using the original treatment comprising dosing with ammonia make up water carbohydrazide feed water and phosphate boiler drum was developed over a period of three months this data consisted of operation as well as chemical parameters such as iron and copper concentrations in the feed water sample and other control parameters ph ammonia chloride specific conductivity and dissolved oxygen carbohydrazide was injected in feed water at the deaerator outlet at a dose rate of 0 5 ppm with residual of 20 40 ppb all boiler chemistry limits and test conditions were maintained in the boiler tables 1 and 2 original dosage requirements of the commercial ffap helamin were specified by the supplier as 5 ppm with respect to the feed water flow with a residual of 1 0 2 0 ppm in boiler feed water 2 1 start up procedure with ffap before filling of the boiler both dosing tanks hydrazine and phosphate were thoroughly cleaned by flushing the tanks with demineralized water 25 ffap solution was then prepared in both the dosing tanks by transferring 125 l of ffap and diluting to 500 l then mixing for 5 min with the mixer at the hydrazine dosing point ffap dosing commenced with 100 pump stroke new pump equivalent to 6 l h 1 until the boiler filling was completed at the phosphate tank ffap dosing commenced with 100 pump stroke equivalent to 4 5 l h 1 until the boiler filling was completed initially the ffap dosing pump hydrazine and phosphate was maintained at 100 stroke if all the parameters are satisfactory boiler water ph in the range of 9 5 10 and feed water and condensate in the range of 8 8 9 5 the ffap dosing was stopped at phosphate tank and boiler blow down was opened if required and adjusted according to yanbu power plant design values table 2 2 2 analytical parameters and procedures 2 2 1 boiler water chemistry the following parameters for boiler water chemistry were

following locations boiler drum two coupons of carbon steel were placed in the water side and two coupons on the steam side steam condensate two coupons of carbon steel ffap test two coupons of cupronickel chz test the coupons were withdrawn during the boiler shutdown for physical examination and evaluated for corrosion potential by weight loss photographs were taken of the coupons before and after exposure 2 2 3 boiler shutdown inspection internal inspection of the boiler was carried out at the end of testing besides visual checks and photographic documentation chemical analysis of several deposit samples was carried out by sem edx jeol model jsm 640 lv oxford inca model 7573 edx detector data was collected and analyzed with inca software 2 2 4 photometric determination of ffap the ffap contains a mixture of alkylamines which react with 4 5 6 7 tetrachloro 2 4 5 7 tetraiodofluorescein rose bengal compound 31 to form a colored complex of alkanolamines which dissolves in acetic acid this was measured using a hach dr5000 uv vis spectrometer 565 nm this method can be calibrated with standard solutions to measure between 0 05 and 30 0 ppm of ffap 2 2 5 thermal efficiency

dw ss and ls with ffap n 86 and with carbohydrazide determined in the same month 2016 n 4 and one year previously 2015 n 92 are shown in fig 2 the ph values for both chz and ffap were found to be maintained within the required limits of 8 8 and 9 5 for bhc fw ss ls and tc whereas for dw ph was at the extreme upper end of the required limits of 9 5 and 10 the ph values determined for make up water during the trial tests fell on average below the required limits of 8 8 and 9 2 the average values for ammonia determined with ffap showed a slight increase compared to chz 2015 but were found to be within the limits in the range of 0 3 1 0 ppm for fw bhc and tc respectively for ls and dw average values for ammonia were in the range of 0 1 0 ppm fig 3 specific conductivity values were higher with ffap than with carbohydrazide 2015 measurements consistent with the higher ph values observed but the average values determined were found to be within the limits in the range of 0 7 5 μs cm 1 for fw ss tc and bhc for ls in the range of 0 6 5 μs cm 1 and dw was 15 100 μs cm 1 fig 4 the slightly higher values may be attributed to ammonia contamination from other boilers that were treated with ammonia and due to common condenser header and mixing of condensate 32 with ffap dosing the average concentrations for iron and copper in fw dw bhc ss ls and tc were found to be at trace levels however bhc fw and tc showed elevated levels of cu early in the operation of the system suggesting that ffap was having a cleaning effect on the cu ni tubes of the brine heater average dissolved oxygen with both carbohydrazide and ffap in the feed water was found to be 5 ppb chloride determined for both carbohydrazide and ffap in dw was also found to be in the limit range of 0 0 5 ppm fig 5 silica in dw and ls treated with ffap was found to be in trace levels cation conductivity is one of the best ways to monitor for contaminants within a steam or water sample it is also referred to as conductivity after ion exchange cace acid conductivity and after exchange conductivity however many operators find it difficult to interpret cation conductivity readings particularly at plants whose steam generators use water containing either naturally occurring or purposefully added organic compounds the major turbine manufacturers demand conductivity of steam 0 2 μs cm 1 a slight increase in cation conductivity in the steam generation system with use of ppf the cation conductivity may go up to 0 5 μs cm 1 industry experience proves that even at increased cation conductivity operation of the cycle in the presence of ffap is possible without failure or damage 33 unfortunately cace could not be determined in the present study due to the non functioning of the cation conductivity system the boiler operation parameters were maintained within the normally experienced range and the average thermal efficiency for chz treatment was found to be 96 3 0 9 and for ffap treatment 96 5 0 5 3 2 optimization of ffap dose rate with optimized dose rates for chz residual hydrazine should be maintained around 20 ppb in feed water according to plant specifications but the values determined were not consistent and most frequently zero within the limits of detection this suggests that the dosage of chz used was not sufficient to maintain the necessary residual in the feed water and thus in the system changeover from chz to ffap without phosphate addition in the drum was done initially by dosing ffap from both hydrazine tank and phosphate tank so that ph was maintained to the required values in both feed water and drum water initially 25 concentration of ffap was prepared in both tanks at both the dosing pumps hydrazine and phosphate 100 pump stroke was maintained till all the parameters were satisfactory boiler water ph in the range of 9 5 10 and feed water and condensate in the range of 8 8 9 5 boiler blow down was opened if required and adjusted according to yanbu power plant design values table 2 when all the parameters were stabilized and the boiler operation was as per normal ffap injection at the phosphate tank was stopped and dose rate optimized by controlling the ffap concentration in the hydrazine tank and pump stroke till the ffap residual in feed water was consistent in the range of 0 3 1 ppm fig 6 the dose rate was optimized to 1 8 l h 1 30 pump stroke equivalent to 0 6 ppm with ffap concentration of 10 in the hydrazine tank by monitoring ffap residual as equivalent to 0 3 1 ppm in feed water all the key parameters ph ammonia and specific conductivity were found to be within the baseline limits figs 2 4 ffap was also monitored in dw ss ls tc and bhc in all the locations the residual ffap was found to be well maintained fig 6 3 3 corrosion studies the exposed coupons with chz treatment were visually examined a uniform and non porous oxide film was found to be adhered on the coupons indicating the protective nature of the films plate 1 coupons exposed with ffap treatment were found to have uniform and non porous black coating type film adhered on the coupons indicating the protective polyamine film was formed plate 2 efforts to remove the film from the coupons for investigation were unsuccessful the average corrosion rates determined with chz dosing for carbon steel coupons fixed in the boiler drum at water side and steam side were 0 0097 mm y 1 and 0 0075 mm y 1 respectively table 3 whereas that determined with ffap treatment were 0 0094 mm y 1 and 0 0006 mm y 1 respectively table 4 though the corrosion rate for water side was comparable for both chz and ffap steam side corrosion rates with ffap treatment showed remarkable reduction this indicated the ffap gave better protection from corrosion at the steam side consistent with previous reports of its effectiveness 34 although the steam condenser material is copper nickel carbon steel coupons were installed in both environments due to the unavailability of cu ni coupons at the time of the ffap tests this provides an indicative corrosion rate for comparison of the two treatments in the steam condenser the average corrosion rates with chz treatment were found to be higher 0 0189 0 0010 mm y 1 on cupronickel than with the ffap 0 0049 0 0002 mm y 1 on carbon steel thickness of the coupons measured after the treatment fig 7 showed that the coupons treated with chz were thicker than those treated with ffap indicating that a very thin protecting layer of ffap polymer was adherent on the coupons 34 3 4 physical examination of coupons physical examination of the carbon steel coupons treated with carbohydrazide retrieved from the drum water and steam side plate 1 showed dark grey oxide scales and these scales appeared to be protective with ffap treatment coupons retrieved from both water and steam side of the drum were found to have uniform non porous dark grey polyamine film adhered and appeared to be protective plate 2 the presence of a film on the surface as deduced from the observation that water droplets did not wet the surface sem edx of exposed coupons water side with carbohydrazide treatment showed predominantly iron and traces of manganese and phosphate fig 8 a the phosphate deposits are expected because of the phosphate treatment the coupons exposed with ffap treatment also showed predominantly iron with substantial amounts of copper and nickel fig 8 b the presence of copper and nickel can be attributed to corrosion products from the cu ni tubes in the top brine heater which are deposited on the coupons in the water side of the boiler after the initial cleaning effect of the ffap becoming occluded in the protective layer 3 5 boiler inspection and deposits analysis the inside of the boiler drum treated with carbohydrazide was covered with an adherent dark grey uniform layer of oxide scale analysis of the deposits treated with carbohydrazide showed that iron was predominant along with significant amounts of copper 11 23 and nickel 3 15 the presence of high concentration of copper and nickel was attributed to carryover of corrosion products from the copper alloy heat exchanger tubes of the top brine heater which became occluded in the oxide layer with ffap treatment the inside of the drum was covered with a uniform thin black powdery layer of polyamine that could not be removed in good quantity for analysis the corresponding deposits on the corrosion coupons were analyzed and found to be mainly composed of iron with substantial amounts of copper and nickel indicating carryover of corrosion products fig 8 3 6 boiler restart with ffap after trial test completion after ffap treatment the boiler was restarted to confirm that no negative effects were caused by the test since phosphate treatment was used in the boiler drum for the base line data collected with chz treatment residual phosphate was still present in the boiler water this was flushed by opening the boiler blow down till the phosphate value was zero after restarting the boiler phosphate values were checked and no phosphate was detected under ffap treatment an increase in the boiler feed water pump pressure 0 09 bar maximum was observed and the strainer was found to have deposits the deposits collected and analyzed were found to be corrosion products predominantly iron oxides the iron oxides found in the feed water pump strainer were attributed to a long boiler shutdown and restart 10 12 months after the chz treatment and previous to the ffap test in the beginning of boiler start up the iron level in both feed water and boiler water was in the range of 20 ppb but this fell to the limits of detection within one month restarting the boiler after the trial test shutdown and after more than one month of operation no increase in the boiler feed water pump pressure was observed and the feed water pump strainer was found to be clean four months data was recorded after the restart of the boiler the boiler water chemistry and the boiler operation parameters were found to be maintained within the design values residual ffap was also found to be maintained at an average of 1 ppm 4 conclusions the suitability and efficiency of a commercial film forming amine polyamine polycarboxylate alkalizing amines formulation ffap helamin as an alternative to oxygen scavenger in swcc high pressure boiler was confirmed omitting phosphate and ammonia treatment at the optimized dose rate of 0 6 ppm while maintaining the boiler chemistry within design limits it is important to continue with continuous boiler blow down and regular intermittent blow down and not to overdose ffap during the cleaning process the dose rate was optimized to maintain ffap residual between 0 3 and 1 0 ppm in feed water by adjustment to 1 8 l h 1 30 pump stroke equivalent to 0 6 ppm with ffap concentration of 10 iron

8747,the european union s environmental technology verification etv program aims to foster innovative environmental technologies to reach the market and reassure potential users this paper presents an investigation of using etv for three technologies being developed within the eu zero brine research and innovation project the technologies were designed to recover high quality water salts and minerals from brine solutions the technologies in focus are the forward feed med evaporator the multi feed plug flow reactor crystalliser and eutectic freeze crystallization the study sought to understand the challenges of the etv process the readiness and eligibility of technologies and possible preparations within the project lifetime challenges identified included understanding what sufficient market readiness is and achieving this within the duration of a project also linked to funding allocation for the etv process and developing suitable performance claims supported with sufficient levels of test data a simple framework is presented to aid the integration of etv into the development process it promotes the use of life cycle assessment to understand the environmental added value of the technology and aid the development of performance claims keywords performance claims environmental technology verification forward feed multiple effect distillation multi feed plug flow reactor crystalliser mf pfr eutectic freeze crystallization efc 1 introduction there are many well documented environmental challenges currently facing society with water stress and water pollution being of the utmost concern 1 2 water treatment technologies offer hope to tackle many of these issues but as with many other environmental technologies they face numerous obstacles in going from concept to market 3 a prominent hurdle is adequately demonstrating the added value of the new technology to potential investors and customers for example one survey launched by the european commission found that only 11 of potential customers trusted the claims of vendors 4 one tool specifically tailored to help environmental technologies the market is environmental technology verification etv innovative environmental technologies are defined within the program as technologies presenting a novelty in terms of design raw materials and energy involved production process use recyclability or final disposal when compared with relevant alternatives 5 the eu etv aims to provide a transparent robust and credible process in which a third party expert assesses the performance claims of the technology provider 5 it strives to confirm the performance claims of environmental innovation as opposed to proving compliance to regulatory thresholds this aligns with previous etv programs in other countries 6 etv has a long history globally having been used in the us since the late 1990 s and has been implemented in several other countries 7 it differs from certification or assessment standards as the technologies are not assessed against predefined criteria or standards but stated claims 8 it therefore facilitates flexibility in which parameters are verified so that technologies whose performance are not covered through regulations standards or existing schemes e g labelling can be included in europe it has recently been made a permanent programme to aid the development and marketing of innovative technologies 8 the pilot programme for the eu etv began in 2011 and was implemented together with the eco innovation action plan ecoap to promote and support eco innovation 9 to date there have been 278 applications for the etv with 123 initiated verifications and 47 verified technologies 10 the etv process uses the iso 17020 standard to support the impartiality and quality of the etv procedure and the verification body should be accredited to comply with its requirements 8 iso 17020 provides the standard for conformity of bodies organisations that perform inspections the quality of the provided performance test data must also be compliant to the requirements stipulated in iso 17025 and the verification body is responsible for deciding which requirements of iso 17025 are relevant 5 the outcome of the eu etv is a verification report and statement of verification that present the verified performance claims 11 etv is targeted at market ready innovative solutions within the categories of water treatment and monitoring energy technologies or materials waste and resources 8 nonetheless there are challenges for technology developers and research teams not familiar with the etv process to understand the terminology data and procedural requirements for instance it may initially be unclear what is meant by a sufficient level of technological innovation with regard to design raw materials production process and recyclability that the website discusses 8 the general verification protocol gvp contains definitions 5 but interpreting the information can still be challenging for an etv applicant the website therefore encourages applicants to contact a registered verification body which will eventually lead to a cost but can aid the initial process 8 there is a paucity of academic literature on etv and limited examples of its application within research and development projects molenda and ratman kłosińska 7 provide a summary and review of the eu etv pilot programme marruci et al 12 examine sustainable production and consumption tools for the circular economy and provide a comparative review of etv against ems and ecodesign whereas etv evaluates the environmental performance of technologies the ecodesign directive sets requirements for products 12 marruci et al 12 suggest that the connection of these tools to the circular economy ce could be improved by embedding a life cycle perspective in other words if the tools are to facilitate progress towards a ce for improved environmental performance the full life cycle performance of the system should be assessed this is to avoid adoption of technologies that enable circular solutions e g the recovery of constituents from water but transfer or increase the environmental burdens e g increase in overall climate change impact of the system this aligns with ce literature that stresses the use of life cycle assessment lca over circularity indicators which only measure circularity of material or value and not environmental impact 13 the few technical examples of etv include an approach in china to use etv to analyse earthwork composting technology 14 and a us example where air monitoring technology was assessed under the us epa etv programme 15 this paper is part of a special issue on the eu zero brine project a four year research and innovation project running from 2017 to 2021 the project consists of four case studies with specific industrial brine effluents that utilise tailored zero brine systems to treat the effluents and recover useful by products including salts the systems consist of existing technologies combined with three innovative technologies being developed within the research project the three technologies are eutectic freeze evaporation efc multi feed plug flow reactor crystalliser mf pfr 16 and a forward feed multiple effect distillation med evaporator 13 the objectives of the paper are to understand the etv process requirements review the technologies and readiness levels for etv identify which preparations could be made within the zero brine project highlight the challenges involved suggest a framework to aid technology vendors in preparation for the etv the focus within the project was to prepare for undergoing an etv and not complete the process within the project timespan section 2 describes the methodology used to support the technology developers herein referred to as the proposers in this project next section 3 presents the etv process the review of the technologies preparing for the etv and identification of the challenges involved finally the paper ends with a discussion and framework for how to prepare for the etv within a research and innovation project 2 methodology for etv preparation the etv work began in 2018 before the eu etv programme became permanent the partners involved in the etv consisted of a facilitator task leaders and researchers at ivl swedish environmental research institute helping three proposers participating in the zero brine project to understand and prepare for the etv process these consisted of two universities tu delft in the netherlands and università degli studi di palermo unipa in italy and an sme focussed on brine treatment technology called sealeau the three water technologies are described in detail in section 3 1 multiple effect distillation forward feed design evaporator from sealeau 2 multi feed plug flow reactor crystalliser mf pfr from resourseas unipa spin off company 3 eutectic freeze crystallization efc from tu delft as discussed in section 1 these technologies are integrated in configurations with other technologies in four cases studies in the zero brine project to treat brine effluents and recover valuable compounds brine is a growing concern due to its impacts on aqueous systems increasing industrial volumes and associated costs common industrial water treatment processes such as nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and ion exchange iex all produce both clean water and a brine waste stream bench scale tests were first carried out for each of the technologies allowing further development and optimisation each of the technologies were then utilised within a treatment system at pilot scale at one or more of the case studies within a zero brine system for further information see ref 17 the methodology for assessing and preparing for the etv consisted of the following steps 1 understand etv process requirements 2 review the technologies 3 preparation for etv within zero brine 4 identify challenges and next steps these are discussed in the following sections 2 1 etv process requirements the first task was to understand the etv process and its requirements this would help determine whether the technologies were suitable their readiness data and testing requirements and what could be performed within the scope of the zero brine demonstration project it was not known for instance whether historical test data such as bench and pilot scale were required this task consisted of first reviewing the academic literature and available etv documentation to support the proposers in the etv process 2 2 review the technologies the purpose of reviewing the technologies was to comprehend i what they do and ii the technological readiness e g technology readiness level for the etv from this we could deduce how to prepare for the etv within zero brine the first stage consisted of gathering the technical and performance information of the technologies to form a mutual understanding of the task a workshop was held with the proposers the workshop explained the etv process and the proposers presented their technologies and discussed the trl status to assess and compare the readiness of the technologies they were assessed against the high level trl and etv requirements in this project we did not conduct and lca on the individual technologies although a lca was conducted on the zero brine four case studies on a complete system basis 17 2 3 preparations for etv within zero brine after reviewing the etv process and readiness of the technologies the preparations that could be made within the project were to i begin developing performance claims and ii complete a quick scan form for each technology iii contact a verification body the performance claims and quick scan documents were developed on an iterative basis between the task leaders and the proposers a second workshop was held to discuss and aid the process of completing the quick scan a verification body was subsequently contacted to review the quick scans and assess whether the technologies were ready and appropriate for etv 2 4 identify challenges and next steps the final step in the study was to identify and collate the challenges that were experienced by the facilitator and the proposers this consisted of retrospective analysis of the issues that have been highlighted discussed and collated in the process of preparing the technologies and proposers for the etv 3 results this section describes the review of the etv process and the available information the review of the technologies and preparations for etv that were performed within the zero brine project finally the challenges experienced in preparing for the etv are summarised 3 1 understanding the etv process at the start of this research 2018 less information was available on the etv website than is currently but the etv process was described in an online video flyer and several documents 10 these include the comprehensive guide for proposers to the eu environmental technologies verification pilot programme 11 and the environmental technology verification pilot programme report that replaces the gvp 5 in addition the standard iso 14034 environmental verification technology details verification principles testing and data quality to meet the etv requirements however the standard was not purchased since we were not undergoing a complete etv within the zero brine project the eu scheme for the etv process is well described in various publicised materials and is shown in fig 1 11 5 it shows that there are six main phases to the etv process with outcomes shown in the right side of the figure the verification begins when the proposer contacts a verification body who can aid the proposer in the completion of a quick scan form the quick scan consists of gathering the information shown in table 1 which is then reviewed by the verification body this is an additional step to iso 14034 and is intended as an initial less demanding exercise where the verification body can determine the eligibility and readiness of the technology for etv at this stage the verification body can also provide additional details on the process required information and costs it is the individual verification body that determines the level of exchange provided before engaging in a contractual arrangement the purpose of the quick scan is therefore to assess the technology against the criteria in table 1 including clarity of description market readiness environmental added value innovativeness and performance most critical is the market readiness which according to the etv guidelines on the eligibility assessment of technologies refers to one of two criteria the technology is available on the market or the technology is at least available at a stage where no substantial stage affecting the performance will be implemented before introducing the technology on the market 18 pg 9 if the technology is eligible the proposer and verification body can enter into a contractual agreement to develop a test plan and verification report which leads to the statement of verification the statement of verification provide a summary description of the technology the verified performance the procedures followed including the test bodies and other information that may aid the description of the technology for a research and innovation project such as zero brine which involves demonstration and pilot plants several gaps were identified these include a lack of simple user friendly guides and practical examples to aid demonstration projects to i understand the trl requirements ii aid the development of performance claims and iii help understand the test data requirements for demonstrating the environmental added value and maturity of the technology 3 2 review of the technologies this section provides an overview of the functioning of the three technologies 3 2 1 multiple effect distillation forward feed design evaporator ff med the med evaporator was designed to recover high quality water from brines and a high purity brine concentrate the pilot scale unit was demonstrated at a demineralised water plant in the netherlands in a treatment system to recover water and salts from the waste brine the med evaporator is made up of two consecutive effects as shown in fig 2 and operates below atmospheric pressure in each of the med effects brine is evaporated resulting in the production of two subsequent streams i a water vapour stream that is then condensed and recovered as fresh water and ii a concentrated brine stream the vapour stream of the first effect is used to heat the concentrated brine produced in the second effect this is then sprayed on top of the bundle and runs down over the tubes by gravity therefore the necessary latent heat for brine vaporization in the second effect is provided by internal heat gain and energy recovery the vapour stream produced by the second effect is used to pre heat the inlet brine using a heat exchanger steam is the main heat supply and heats the brine in the first effect using another heat exchanger a steam trap removes any remaining water or condensate in the system the evaporator unit can work with waste heat or electricity a mathematical model was developed for each med s components based on mass and energy balances these models were used for the development of a simulator that was built in visual basic environment 19 the models are utilised to select suitable materials that minimize the formation of limescale or fouling by other deposits at the high tds concentration conditions the aim is to utilise the lowest cost materials to reduce investment cost and provide a competitive advantage whilst reducing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions 3 2 2 multiple feed plug flow reactor mf pfr crystallizer the mf pfr facilitates the recovery of minerals from brine with the use of a reagent solution it is a modular reactor that mixes the reactants e g brine and an alkaline water solution to generate sufficient contact 16 to remove compounds from effluents such as divalent ions in the first step the brine is mixed with an alkali solution for example sodium hydroxide to precipitate remove magnesium next the ph is increased using a basic solution e g sodium hydrogen carbonate to separate calcium ions the accurate control of the ph is of primary importance and is enabled by the geometries of the mf pfr as illustrated in fig 3 this shows that the brine in vessel a is fed into the mf pfr b along with naoh to achieve the precipitation of magnesium as a hydroxide at a ph of 10 4 subsequently the resulting slurry is collected in a decanter c to allow the magnesium hydroxide crystals to settle when the crystals have settled the clarified brine is collected in another feed tank d from where it is returned to the crystallizer along with additional naoh solution the calcium then precipitates in the form of calcium hydroxide at a ph above 13 finally the resultant slurry is collected in a second decanter to settle the calcium hydroxide crystals when compared to a conventional crystallizer such as the continuously stirred tank reactors cstr the mf pfr technology achieves better performance in terms of product purity control of the crystals size distribution and energy efficiency the mf pfr was demonstrated in a zero brine case study to recover magnesium and calcium from brine in the form of hydroxides brucite and portlandite 3 2 3 eutectic freeze crystallization eutectic freeze crystallization can recover pure water and salt such as na2so4 10h2o from waste and process streams of aqueous electrolyte solutions it can be used for the treatment of concentrated solutions including salty brines and retentates from reverse osmosis it takes advantage of the lower energy consumption of fusion crystallization from freezing compared to evaporation which is 6 01 kj mol compared to 40 65 kj mol respectively 20 when saturated solutions of various compounds are super cooled two solid phases consisting of ice and inorganic crystals separate from solution simultaneously as illustrated in fig 4 a the ice floats and the inorganic crystals settle leaving behind an aqueous solution of concentrated ions consisting of the more soluble inorganic compounds fig 4b yields of ice and salt are controlled via the heat flux withdrawn from the crystallizer the outlet of the crystallizer is connected to the solid separator where ice and salt are separated by gravity the underflow of the separator is fed to a filter where liquid is removed from the salt crystals and recycled to the crystallizer the top flow of the separator containing the ice crystals flows into a wash column ice is washed by a reflux stream of molten ice crystals and pure water leaves the top of the column wash liquor leaving the bottom of the column is recycled to the crystallizer 3 2 4 assess the status of the technologies table 2 compares the technologies against the main trl and etv requirements the efc which began at a trl 3 rose to trl 5 during the zero brine project whilst the mf pfr went from trl 4 to 7 and the ff med from trl 5 to trl 7 for etv requirements none of the technologies are ready for commercialisation however the mf pfr and med are considered close as no substantial changes affecting the performance are expected therefore table 2 suggests that the mf pfr and ff med may be ready to begin preparations for etv by developing performance requirements contacting a verification body and initiating a quick scan document 3 3 prepare for etv within zero brine 3 3 1 initiate performance claims this section presents the performance of the technologies based on the pilot plant tests and how these relate to the development of suitable performance claims 3 3 2 mf pfr the mf pfr was first tested in the laboratory and then at the industrial case study company with waste brine it performed well recovering high quality magnesium and calcium hydroxides with purities above 98 for further information on test results see ref 21 the performance claims of the mf pfr focus on the purity of the precipitated minerals the control of the particle sizes distribution and reduced electrical energy compared to the conventional continuously stirred tank reactor cstr crystallizers the quantification and comparison with the best alternative technology bat is shown in table 3 3 3 3 ff med the evaporator technology was first tested at pilot scale during the eu sol brine project 22 23 and then its upgraded version utilisation of waste heat piloted at the evides site i and evides site ii with industrial brine water the performance claims of the med focus on achieving an increased concentration factor that results in three times the amount of water recovered compared to a standard desalination system e g ro it can also utilise low grade waste heat from industrial processes and solar energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the performance claims compared to bat are shown in table 4 3 3 4 efc the efc technology was tested at three locations within the project the evides site ii with industrial brine from the ro unit a coal mine site pgg with brine effluent and a chemical industry iqe with high salinity wastewater from silica production at the pilot test at evides site ii the efc recovered 81 of available water and na2so4 salt with a purity of 99 97 the coal mine tests showed that the efc could recover salt even with highly contaminated feed water the pilot plant at iqe compared the efc with evaporation this showed that the efc recovered a higher purity salt na2so4 10h2o at 99 9 with lower energy consumption 2 4 fold reduction and higher total salt recovery in addition when operating in continuous mode the efc can recover over 85 of water although the water quality was slightly lower than that recovered by the evaporator it could still be reused internally at iqe due to the currently low trl level the development and identification of adequate performance claims was challenging and is still ongoing the initial proposed claims are shown in table 5 and are linked to the benefits of the lower operating temperature and associated energy consumption in comparison to conventional evaporation this results in minor thermal degradation of heat sensitive compounds and minimal corrosion of the construction material in addition chemical addition is not required and the large difference in density between salt and ice enables easier separation in addition separation by gravity can be incorporated and operating costs are typically 85 of evaporation crystallization 20 3 3 5 quick scan the proposers of the mf pfr and ff med were able to complete a quick scan for the technologies which was submitted to a verification body for an initial review however the efc was not sufficiently developed to allow the proposers to adequately complete a quick scan the verification bodies for the mf pfr and ff med assessed the quick scans as shown in table 6 further details are confidential both technologies were deemed suitable for the etv verification process and offers were received on the estimated costs to engage the verification bodies for the process only the mf pfr was assessed as potentially market ready although a further check of the test plan methods and suitability of the test body are required by the verification body during the process for the ff med the verification body provided several comments asking for further information and clarification for example they asked whether the technology can treat any kind of brine and highlighted that the verification statement could not be used with other types of water furthermore because the proposer stated that each unit would be designed and customised to match each purpose there is a need to understand whether this would influence the performance of the technology which could impact the verification statement 3 4 challenges in preparing for the etv the three technologies are in various stages of development and have faced different challenges in preparing for the etv process within the project in summary we identified the following challenges in preparing the three technologies for etv 1 locating and interpretating explanations of the terms and requirements for etv particularly with regard to its application within the scope of a demonstration project several guides are available but information is therefore spread across multiple documents meaning that time is needed to fully understand the process and requirements for example the quick scan has many requirements and it was difficult to find adequate explanations of requirements particularly with regard to demonstration projects and whether response would be acceptable the proposers had difficulties knowing how to prepare and what can be done before engaging a verification body such as how to collect structure and present data relevant for the etv although it is stated in the gvp that this must conform to iso 14034 2 defining market readiness sufficient for an etv and achieving this within the duration of a project it is clearly stated that the technology should be market ready or at a level where the performance does not change however the wording where no substantial stage affecting the performance will be implemented before introducing the technology on the market is still open to interpretation 3 developing performance claims for the technologies was challenging for the technology vendors this was due to the potential for further development of the technologies and insufficient levels of test data and ongoing tests to help quantify the performance claims in addition there was insufficient knowledge on the market needs and innovation requirements for the challenge that the technologies are aiming to address 4 funding of the etv process and testing within a research and demonstration project in house testing by proposers within a research project may not be sufficient to meet the quality requirements of an etv therefore if an etv is targeted within a research project there is a need to budget for both additional testing internal time of the proposer and engagement of the verifier we estimate a need for funding of 10 40 000 to engage a verifier and support the process internally costs obtained from verifiers within this project we did not determine additional costs for tests that conform to relevant iso standards these are further discussed in the next section 4 discussion 4 1 summary of technology status the three technologies have all advanced in trl during the project but they still cannot be considered as market ready for the etv both mf pfr and ff med reached trl 7 whist the efc reached trl 5 each of the technologies or variations of them have been under development for several years and hence it is perhaps not surprising that market readiness was not achieved during the duration of the project the most advanced the mf pfr has demonstrated excellent empirical results in the pilot demonstrations with high purity of the recovered products and lower energy than conventional cstr crystalliser the performance claims require further development to establish the final quantities values and other claims may be added based on further market understanding the ff med also performed well and overcame challenges identified in a previous demonstration project sol brine including scaling of the heat exchangers and utilising waste heat scaling was reduced through a combination of nanofiltration and forward feed evaporation a follow up eu research project sea4value will also test novel composite materials to reduce scaling furthermore the integration of waste heat is critical to reduce energy intensity and ghg emissions for example an ff med utilising waste heat in an evaporator instead of current best practice could save 160 000 tons of co2 eq for desalination in cyprus 24 the efc also demonstrated excellent results at the three pilot plants recovering a high percentage of water 80 and a very high purity of salt but with lower energy consumption than the alternative evaporation technology it therefore has strong potential but did not reach a high trl within this project and therefore was not ready for the etv nonetheless several commercial efc units are available 25 in summary performance claims were developed for all three technologies based on such factors as low energy consumption high recovery of water and salts as well as high salt purity these are supported by the empirical and demonstration results suggesting that when market ready the technologies can achieve their performance claims and attain etv status 4 2 challenges with the etv procedure in the zero brine project the challenges identified in section 3 6 are discussed in the following sections 4 2 1 difficult for the uninitiated to assimilate etv requirements it was difficult for the project participants to understand what will be required and how preparations can begin in conclusion a verification body should have been contacted at an earlier stage in the process to help clarify requirements during the early stages of the study questions were raised on how to collect structure and present data relevant for the etv since the proposers had conducted bench scale tests and pilot projects it was not known whether this data could be used or how it could be structured the critical issue is that the role of test data is to support the performance claims and it is therefore necessary to first develop these if the technology is not mature enough it is not possible to plan for adequate testing compliant to the standards demanded by the etv guidance could therefore promote the importance of developing performance claims relevant to market needs at an early stage in the technology s development low trl this could also be beneficial for optimisation of life cycle design to help the technology achieve the most environmentally beneficial performance 4 2 2 market readiness and timing a further challenge is aligning the market readiness with project funding streams so that market readiness testing and verification occur when funding is available for instance eu horizon funding is only available within the project lifetime as agreed in the grant agreement the etv documentation states that a full verification can only be performed once the technology is market ready however the verification can be started earlier by starting with a quick scan form although ideally at trl 7 when there are no expected changes to performance hence the verification procedure from quick scan to full verification would need to correspond to the project funding period if applicable normal times for a full verification are 9 18 months 26 it is always challenging to ensure within a project that trl advancement can be made and contingency plans may therefore be needed in case the verification and testing continues after the research project finishes 4 2 3 performance claims the correct selection of the performance claims is one of the most critical aspects on which the technologies are verified and marketed upon appropriate claims were difficult to establish for technologies in this project due to the low trl in the case of the efc but also because tests were ongoing and further tests could help to assure performance claims it is evident that to fully utilise the potential of etv for marketing performance claims should be linked to market needs hence a market analysis should be performed to understand customer requirements and market demand an lca could be utilised to further understand the potential environmental added value of the technology to refine the performance claims and increase the depth of knowledge finally the performance claims should also be quantitative and measurable the chosen claims should show that the presented technology performs better than similar technologies on the market or that the performance equals similar technologies but have less or minor drawbacks 4 2 4 funding sources for verification costs early documents suggested that the cost for an etv including engaging a verification body and additional costs for a testing body could be as much as 90 000 european commission dg env 2008 however more recent evidence is much lower with average costs from the etv pilot programme being 15 000 according to the website 10 nonetheless the cost of performing tests in accordance with requirements relevant to the technology in accordance to iso iec 17025 should be considered this is dependent on the technology in question and the quality of the tests already conducted 27 grants are available but whether the full costs are covered by the grant depends on the timespan of completing the verification procedure if the grant time runs out alternative financing will be required to complete the etv 4 3 utilising life cycle assessment performing a life cycle assessment lca of the technology could aid the etv process for several reasons firstly it increases the knowledge of the system wide performance and the added value from an environmental perspective for examples the life cycle environmental impact of manufacturing a product where the technology is used as part of the manufacturing process it can help to collect data for an etv and provide evidence of environmental benefits compared to alternative existing technologies secondly it can aid the assessment of the eligibility of the technology for an etv thirdly a lca can help to identify and define performance claims in terms of performance claims this could help to widen the scope of those claims for example typical performance claims of water treatment technology can focus on reduced energy and improved water quality lca s however enable a full assessment of the system for application so could include reduced greenhouse gas emissions across the life cycle or that recovered compounds such as magnesium hydroxide have a lower environmental footprint than conventional production this could enable a wider range of performance claims however this may also lead to challenges in proving these claims within the etv process as they would only be applicable to specific cases therefore performance claims should be restricted to those that can be proven to be applicable in generic circumstances lca s performed at a low trl level also help with initiating data collection thereby laying the foundations for subsequent stages to improve data quality 17 the final lca at trl 7 or beyond should aim to demonstrate the key improvements in environmental performance that the innovative technology provides in comparison to conventional or existing alternatives the final lca should be done before engaging in etv so that the performance and performance claims do not change within the etv process as this would increase costs and process duration 4 4 summary and recommendations in summary we recommend that the proposer reviews the following at an early stage of technological development the value of the etv for their technology the market needs and potential performance claims in addition as discussed above a lca performed at a low trl e g trl 4 would help to understand potential environmental hotspots and benefits a life cycle costing lcc would additionally provide similar knowledge on economic hotspots and opportunities for improvement furthermore contacting a verification body early on would be beneficial these aspects are summarised in fig 5 which describes the process of preparing for the etv within a technology development framework during the initial stages of development research market analysis is performed to understand the market needs and how these are met by the technology at the same time lca and lcc can be started to identify environmental hotspots initiate data collection understand full life cycle benefits and identify areas for improvement to inform the design process together these form the basis for identifying the technologies selling points which can be linked to the performance claims funding of the etv process also needs to be considered at a low trl and could be incorporated into research funding the etv process can begin when the trl increases above trl 7 with the quick scan it then proceeds to the next step when final performance claims are set and when no substantial stage affecting the performance will be implemented before introducing the technology on the market 18 fig 5 also highlights that care should be taken with data quality that may be used in the etv process test data used in the etv needs to comply with relevant and assured quality management such as iso 17025 5 5 conclusion this paper presented the efforts made to prepare three technologies being advanced in a demonstration project for the etv process within the four years of the zero brine project two of the three technologies advanced to a sufficient level to develop performance claims and complete an etv quick scan the ff med and mf pfr achieved trl 7 whilst the efc achieved trl 5 both the mf pfr and ff med technologies are not expected to undergo substantial changes in performance supporting their eligibility to begin the etv process however performance claims need to be checked and finalised within the verification process challenges identified in the paper include a lack of simple guidelines and practical examples to help understand trl requirements aid the development of performance claims and understand the test data requirements to aid integration of etv into the technology development process a simple framework was introduced this highlights the importance of a market analysis to develop selling points and performance claims whilst a life cycle assessment and life cycle costing can support identification of economic and environmental hotspots impacts and benefits the lca can help to identify the added environmental benefits of the technology and therefore aid development of performance claims for the etv author

8747,the european union s environmental technology verification etv program aims to foster innovative environmental technologies to reach the market and reassure potential users this paper presents an investigation of using etv for three technologies being developed within the eu zero brine research and innovation project the technologies were designed to recover high quality water salts and minerals from brine solutions the technologies in focus are the forward feed med evaporator the multi feed plug flow reactor crystalliser and eutectic freeze crystallization the study sought to understand the challenges of the etv process the readiness and eligibility of technologies and possible preparations within the project lifetime challenges identified included understanding what sufficient market readiness is and achieving this within the duration of a project also linked to funding allocation for the etv process and developing suitable performance claims supported with sufficient levels of test data a simple framework is presented to aid the integration of etv into the development process it promotes the use of life cycle assessment to understand the environmental

flow reactor crystalliser mf pfr eutectic freeze crystallization efc 1 introduction there are many well documented environmental challenges currently facing society with water stress and water pollution being of the utmost concern 1 2 water treatment technologies offer hope to tackle many of these issues but as with many other environmental technologies they face numerous obstacles in going from concept to market 3 a prominent hurdle is adequately demonstrating the added value of the new technology to potential investors and customers for example one survey launched by the european commission found that only 11 of potential customers trusted the claims of vendors 4 one tool specifically tailored to help environmental technologies the market is environmental technology verification etv innovative environmental technologies are defined within the program as technologies presenting a novelty in terms of design raw materials and energy involved production process use recyclability or final disposal when compared with relevant alternatives 5 the eu etv aims to provide a transparent robust and credible process in which a third party expert assesses the performance claims of the technology provider 5 it strives to confirm the performance claims of environmental innovation as opposed to proving compliance to regulatory thresholds this aligns with previous etv programs in other countries 6 etv has a long history globally having been used in the us since the late 1990 s and has been implemented in several other countries 7 it differs from certification or assessment standards as the technologies are not assessed against predefined criteria or standards but stated claims 8 it therefore facilitates flexibility in which parameters are verified so that technologies whose performance are not covered through regulations standards or existing schemes e g labelling can be included in europe it has recently been made a permanent programme to aid the development and marketing of innovative technologies 8 the pilot programme for the eu etv began in 2011 and was implemented together with the eco innovation action plan ecoap to promote and support eco innovation 9 to date there have been 278 applications for the etv with 123 initiated verifications and 47 verified technologies 10 the etv process uses the iso 17020 standard to support the impartiality and quality of the etv procedure and the verification body should be accredited to comply with its requirements 8 iso 17020 provides the standard for conformity of bodies organisations that perform inspections the quality of the provided performance test data must also be compliant to the requirements stipulated in iso 17025 and the verification body is responsible for deciding which requirements of iso 17025 are relevant 5 the outcome of the eu etv is a verification report and statement of verification that present the verified performance claims 11 etv is targeted at market ready innovative solutions within the categories of water treatment and monitoring energy technologies or materials waste and resources 8 nonetheless there are challenges for technology developers and research teams not familiar with the etv process to understand the terminology data and procedural requirements for instance it may initially be unclear what is meant by a sufficient level of technological innovation with regard to design raw materials production process and recyclability that the website discusses 8 the general verification protocol gvp contains definitions 5 but interpreting the information can still be challenging for an etv applicant the website therefore encourages applicants to contact a registered verification body which will eventually lead to a cost but can aid the initial process 8 there is a paucity of academic literature on etv and limited examples of its application within research and development projects molenda and ratman kłosińska 7 provide a summary and review of the eu etv pilot programme marruci et al 12 examine sustainable production and consumption tools for the circular economy and provide a comparative review of etv against ems and ecodesign whereas etv evaluates the environmental performance of technologies the ecodesign directive sets requirements for products 12 marruci et al 12 suggest that the connection of these tools to the circular economy ce could be improved by embedding a life cycle perspective in other words if the tools are to facilitate progress towards a ce for improved environmental performance the full life cycle performance of the system should be assessed this is to avoid adoption of technologies that enable circular solutions e g the recovery of constituents from water but transfer or increase the environmental burdens e g increase in overall climate change impact of the system this aligns with ce literature that stresses the use of life cycle assessment lca over circularity indicators which only measure circularity of material or value and not environmental impact 13 the few technical examples of etv include an approach in china to use etv to analyse earthwork composting technology 14 and a us example where air monitoring technology was assessed under the us epa etv programme 15 this paper is part of a special issue on the eu zero brine project a four year research and innovation project running from 2017 to 2021 the project consists of four case studies with specific industrial brine effluents that utilise tailored zero brine systems to treat the effluents and recover useful by products including salts the systems consist of existing technologies combined with three innovative technologies being developed within the research project the three technologies are eutectic freeze evaporation efc multi feed plug flow reactor crystalliser mf pfr 16 and a forward feed multiple effect distillation med evaporator 13 the objectives of the paper are to understand the etv process requirements review the technologies and readiness levels for etv identify which preparations could be made within the zero brine project highlight the challenges involved suggest a framework to aid technology vendors in preparation for the etv the focus within the project was to prepare for undergoing an etv and not complete the process within the project timespan section 2 describes the methodology used to support the technology developers herein referred to as the proposers in this project next section 3 presents the etv process the review of the technologies preparing for the etv and identification of the challenges involved finally the paper ends with a discussion and framework for how to prepare for the etv within a research and innovation project 2 methodology for etv preparation the etv work began in 2018 before the eu etv programme became permanent the partners involved in the etv consisted of a facilitator task leaders and researchers at ivl swedish environmental research institute helping three proposers participating in the zero brine project to understand and prepare for the etv process these consisted of two universities tu delft in the netherlands and università degli studi di palermo unipa in italy and an sme focussed on brine treatment technology called sealeau the three water technologies are described in detail in section 3 1 multiple effect distillation forward feed design evaporator from sealeau 2 multi feed plug flow reactor crystalliser mf pfr from resourseas unipa spin off company 3 eutectic freeze crystallization efc from tu delft as discussed in section 1 these technologies are integrated in configurations with other technologies in four cases studies in the zero brine project to treat brine effluents and recover valuable compounds brine is a growing concern due to its impacts on aqueous systems increasing industrial volumes and associated costs common industrial water treatment processes such as nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and ion exchange iex all produce both clean water and a brine waste stream bench scale tests were first carried out for each of the technologies allowing further development and optimisation each of the technologies were then utilised within a treatment system at pilot scale at one or more of the case studies within a zero brine system for further information see ref 17 the methodology for assessing and preparing for the etv consisted of the following steps 1 understand etv process requirements 2 review the technologies 3 preparation for etv within zero brine 4 identify challenges and next steps these are discussed in the following sections 2 1 etv process requirements the first task was to understand the etv process and its requirements this would help determine whether the technologies were suitable their readiness data and testing requirements and what could be performed within the scope of the zero brine demonstration project it was not known for instance whether historical test data such as bench and pilot scale were required this task consisted of first reviewing the academic literature and available etv documentation to support the proposers in the etv process 2 2 review the technologies the purpose of reviewing the technologies was to comprehend i what they do and ii the technological readiness e g technology readiness level for the etv from this we could deduce how to prepare for the etv within zero brine the first stage consisted of gathering the technical and performance information of the technologies to form a mutual understanding of the task a workshop was held with the proposers the workshop explained the etv process and the proposers presented their technologies and discussed the trl status to assess and compare the readiness of the technologies they were assessed against the high level trl and etv requirements in this project we did not conduct and lca on the individual technologies although a lca was conducted on the zero brine four case studies on a complete system basis 17 2 3 preparations for etv within zero brine after reviewing the etv process and readiness of the technologies the preparations that could be made within the project were to i begin developing performance claims and ii complete a quick scan form for each technology iii contact a verification body the performance claims and quick scan documents were developed on an iterative basis between the task leaders and the proposers a second workshop was held to discuss and aid the process of completing the quick scan a verification body was subsequently contacted to review the quick scans and assess whether the technologies were ready and appropriate for etv 2 4 identify challenges and next steps the final step in the study was to identify and collate the challenges that were experienced by the facilitator and the proposers this consisted of retrospective analysis of the issues that have been highlighted discussed and collated in the process of preparing the technologies and proposers for the etv 3 results this section describes the review of the etv process and the available information the review of the technologies and preparations for etv that were performed within the zero brine project finally the challenges experienced in preparing for the etv are summarised 3 1 understanding the etv process at the start of this research 2018 less information was available on the etv website than is currently but the etv process was described in an online video flyer and several documents 10 these include the comprehensive guide for proposers to the eu environmental technologies verification pilot programme 11 and the environmental technology verification pilot programme report that replaces the gvp 5 in addition the standard iso 14034 environmental verification technology details verification principles testing and data quality to meet the etv requirements however the standard was not purchased since we were not undergoing a complete etv within the zero brine project the eu scheme for the etv process is well described in various publicised materials and is shown in fig 1 11 5 it shows that there are six main phases to the etv process with outcomes shown in the right side of the figure the verification begins when the proposer contacts a verification body who can aid the proposer in the completion of a quick scan form the quick scan consists of gathering the information shown in table 1 which is then reviewed by the verification body this is an additional step to iso 14034 and is intended as an initial less demanding exercise where the verification body can determine the eligibility and readiness of the technology for etv at this stage the verification body can also provide additional details on the process required information and costs it is the individual verification body that determines the level of exchange provided before engaging in a contractual arrangement the purpose of the quick scan is therefore to assess the technology against the criteria in table 1 including clarity of description market readiness environmental added value innovativeness and performance most critical is the market readiness which according to the etv guidelines on the eligibility assessment of technologies refers to one of two criteria the technology is available on the market or the technology is at least available at a stage where no substantial stage affecting the performance will be implemented before introducing the technology on the market 18 pg 9 if the technology is eligible the proposer and verification body can enter into a contractual agreement to develop a test plan and verification report which leads to the statement of verification the statement of verification provide a summary description of the technology the verified performance the procedures followed including the test bodies and other information that may aid the description of the technology for a research and innovation project such as zero brine which involves demonstration and pilot plants several gaps were identified these include a lack of simple user friendly guides and practical examples to aid demonstration projects to i understand the trl requirements ii aid the development of performance claims and iii help understand the test data requirements for demonstrating the environmental added value and maturity of the technology 3 2 review of the technologies this section provides an overview of the functioning of the three technologies 3 2 1 multiple effect distillation forward feed design evaporator ff med the med evaporator was designed to recover high quality water from brines and a high purity brine concentrate the pilot scale unit was demonstrated at a demineralised water plant in the netherlands in a treatment system to recover water and salts from the waste brine the med evaporator is made up of two consecutive effects as shown in fig 2 and operates below atmospheric pressure in each of the med effects brine is evaporated resulting in the production of two subsequent streams i a water vapour stream that is then condensed and recovered as fresh water and ii a concentrated brine stream the vapour stream of the first effect is used to heat the concentrated brine produced in the second effect this is then sprayed on top of the bundle and runs down over the tubes by gravity therefore the necessary latent heat for brine vaporization in the second effect is provided by internal heat gain and energy recovery the vapour stream produced by the second effect is used to pre heat the inlet brine using a heat exchanger steam is the main heat supply and heats the brine in the first effect using another heat exchanger a steam trap removes any remaining water or condensate in the system the evaporator unit can work with waste heat or electricity a mathematical model was developed for each med s components based on mass and energy balances these models were used for the development of a simulator that was built in visual basic environment 19 the models are utilised to select suitable materials that minimize the formation of limescale or fouling by other deposits at the high tds concentration conditions the aim is to utilise the lowest cost materials to reduce investment cost and provide a competitive advantage whilst reducing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions 3 2 2 multiple feed plug flow reactor mf pfr crystallizer the mf pfr facilitates the recovery of minerals from brine with the use of a reagent solution it is a modular reactor that mixes the reactants e g brine and an alkaline water solution to generate sufficient contact 16 to remove compounds from effluents such as divalent ions in the first step the brine is mixed with an alkali solution for example sodium hydroxide to precipitate remove magnesium next the ph is increased using a basic solution e g sodium hydrogen carbonate to separate calcium ions the accurate control of the ph is of primary importance and is enabled by the geometries of the mf pfr as illustrated in fig 3 this shows that the brine in vessel a is fed into the mf pfr b along with naoh to achieve the precipitation of magnesium as a hydroxide at a ph of 10 4 subsequently the resulting slurry is collected in a decanter c to allow the magnesium hydroxide crystals to settle when the crystals have settled the clarified brine is collected in another feed tank d from where it is returned to the crystallizer along with additional naoh solution the calcium then precipitates in the form of calcium hydroxide at a ph above 13 finally the resultant slurry is collected in a second decanter to settle the calcium hydroxide crystals when compared to a conventional crystallizer such as the continuously stirred tank reactors cstr the mf pfr technology achieves better performance in terms of product purity control of the crystals size distribution and energy efficiency the mf pfr was demonstrated in a zero brine case study to recover magnesium and calcium from brine in the form of hydroxides brucite and portlandite 3 2 3 eutectic freeze crystallization eutectic freeze crystallization can recover pure water and salt such as na2so4 10h2o from waste and process streams of aqueous electrolyte solutions it can be used for the treatment of concentrated solutions including salty brines and retentates from reverse osmosis it takes advantage of the lower energy consumption of fusion crystallization from freezing compared to evaporation which is 6 01 kj mol compared to 40 65 kj mol respectively 20 when saturated solutions of various compounds are super cooled two solid phases consisting of ice and inorganic crystals separate from solution simultaneously as illustrated in fig 4 a the ice floats and the inorganic crystals settle leaving behind an aqueous solution of concentrated ions consisting of the more soluble inorganic compounds fig 4b yields of ice and salt are controlled via the heat flux withdrawn from the crystallizer the outlet of the crystallizer is connected to the solid separator where ice and salt are separated by gravity the underflow of the separator is fed to a filter where liquid is removed from the salt crystals and recycled to the crystallizer the top flow of the separator containing the ice crystals flows into a wash column ice is washed by a reflux stream of molten ice crystals and pure water leaves the top of the column wash liquor leaving the bottom of the column is recycled to the crystallizer 3 2 4 assess the status of the technologies table 2 compares the technologies against the main trl and etv requirements the efc which began at a trl 3 rose to trl 5 during the zero brine project whilst the mf pfr went from trl 4 to 7 and the ff med from trl 5 to trl 7 for etv requirements none of the technologies are ready for commercialisation however the mf pfr and med are considered close as no substantial changes affecting the performance are expected therefore table 2 suggests that the mf pfr and ff med may be ready to begin preparations for etv by developing performance requirements contacting a verification body and initiating a quick scan document 3 3 prepare for etv within zero brine 3 3 1 initiate performance claims this section presents the performance of the technologies based on the pilot plant tests and how these relate to the development of suitable performance claims 3 3 2 mf pfr the mf pfr was first tested in the laboratory and then at the industrial case study company with waste brine it performed well recovering high quality magnesium and calcium hydroxides with purities above 98 for further information on test results see ref 21 the performance claims of the mf pfr focus on the purity of the precipitated minerals the control of the particle sizes distribution and reduced electrical energy compared to the conventional continuously stirred tank reactor cstr crystallizers the quantification and comparison with the best alternative technology bat is shown in table 3 3 3 3 ff med the evaporator technology was first tested at pilot scale during the eu sol brine project 22 23 and then its upgraded version utilisation of waste heat piloted at the evides site i and evides site ii with industrial brine water the performance claims of the med focus on achieving an increased concentration factor that results in three times the amount of water recovered compared to a standard desalination system e g ro it can also utilise low grade waste heat from industrial processes and solar energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the performance claims compared to bat are shown in table 4 3 3 4 efc the efc technology was tested at three locations within the project the evides site ii with industrial brine from the ro unit a coal mine site pgg with brine effluent and a chemical industry iqe with high salinity wastewater from silica production at the pilot test at evides site ii the efc recovered 81 of available water and na2so4 salt with a purity of 99 97 the coal mine tests showed that the efc could recover salt even with highly contaminated feed water the pilot plant at iqe compared the efc with evaporation this showed that the efc recovered a higher purity salt na2so4 10h2o at 99 9 with lower energy consumption 2 4 fold reduction and higher total salt recovery in addition when operating in continuous mode the efc can recover over 85 of water although the water quality was slightly lower than that recovered by the evaporator it could still be reused internally at iqe due to the currently low trl level the development and identification of adequate performance claims was challenging and is still ongoing the initial proposed claims are shown in table 5 and are linked to the benefits of the lower operating temperature and associated energy consumption in comparison to conventional evaporation this results in minor thermal degradation of heat sensitive compounds and minimal corrosion of the construction material in addition chemical addition is not required and the large difference in density between salt and ice enables easier separation in addition separation by gravity can be incorporated and operating costs are typically 85 of evaporation crystallization 20 3 3 5 quick scan the proposers of the mf pfr and ff med were able to complete a quick scan for the technologies which was submitted to a verification body for an initial review however the efc was not sufficiently developed to allow the proposers to adequately complete a quick scan the verification bodies for the mf pfr and ff med assessed the quick scans as shown in table 6 further details are confidential both technologies were deemed suitable for the etv verification process and offers were received on the estimated costs to engage the verification bodies for the process only the mf pfr was assessed as potentially market ready although a further check of the test plan methods and suitability of the test body are required by the verification body during the process for the ff med the verification body provided several comments asking for further information and clarification for example they asked whether the technology can treat any kind of brine and highlighted that the verification statement could not be used with other types of water furthermore because the proposer stated that each unit would be designed and customised to match each purpose there is a need to understand whether this would influence the performance of the technology which could impact the verification statement 3 4 challenges in preparing for the etv the three technologies are in various stages of development and have faced different challenges in preparing for the etv process within the project in summary we identified the following challenges in preparing the three technologies for etv 1 locating and interpretating explanations of the terms and requirements for etv particularly with regard to its application within the scope of a demonstration project several guides are available but information is therefore spread across multiple documents meaning that time is needed to fully understand the process and requirements for example the quick scan has many requirements and it was difficult to find adequate explanations of requirements particularly with regard to demonstration projects and whether response would be acceptable the proposers had difficulties knowing how to prepare and what can be done before engaging a verification body such as how to collect structure and present data relevant for the etv although it is stated in the gvp that this must conform to iso 14034 2 defining market readiness sufficient for an etv and achieving this within the duration of a project it is clearly stated that the technology should be market ready or at a level where the performance does not change however the wording where no substantial stage affecting the performance will be implemented before introducing the technology on the market is still open to interpretation 3 developing performance claims for the technologies was challenging for the technology vendors this was due to the potential for further development of the technologies and insufficient levels of test data and ongoing tests to help quantify the performance claims in addition there was insufficient knowledge on the market needs and innovation requirements for the challenge that the technologies are aiming to address 4 funding of the etv process and testing within a research and demonstration project in house testing by proposers within a research project may not be sufficient to meet the quality requirements of an etv therefore if an etv is targeted within a research project there is a need to budget for both additional testing internal time of the proposer and engagement of the verifier we estimate a need for funding of 10 40 000 to engage a verifier and support the process internally costs obtained from verifiers within this project we did not determine additional costs for tests that conform to relevant iso standards these are further discussed in the next section 4 discussion 4 1 summary of technology status the three technologies have all advanced in trl during the project but they still cannot be considered as market ready for the etv both mf pfr and ff med reached trl 7 whist the efc reached trl 5 each of the technologies or variations of them have been under development for several years and hence it is perhaps not surprising that market readiness was not achieved during the duration of the project the most advanced the mf pfr has demonstrated excellent empirical results in the pilot demonstrations with high purity of the recovered products and lower energy than conventional cstr crystalliser the performance claims require further development to establish the final quantities values and other claims may be added based on further market understanding the ff med also performed well and overcame challenges identified in a previous demonstration project sol brine including scaling of the heat exchangers and utilising waste heat scaling was reduced through a combination of nanofiltration and forward feed evaporation a follow up eu research project sea4value will also test novel composite materials to reduce scaling furthermore the integration of waste heat is critical to reduce energy intensity and ghg emissions for example an ff med utilising waste heat in an evaporator instead of current best practice could save 160 000 tons of co2 eq for desalination in cyprus 24 the efc also demonstrated excellent results at the three pilot plants recovering a high percentage of water 80 and a very high purity of salt but with lower energy consumption than the alternative evaporation technology it therefore has strong potential but did not reach a high trl within this project and therefore was not ready for the etv nonetheless several commercial efc units are available 25 in summary performance claims were developed for all three technologies based on such factors as low energy consumption high recovery of water and salts as well as high salt purity these are supported by the empirical and demonstration results suggesting that when market ready the technologies can achieve their performance claims and attain etv status 4 2 challenges with the etv procedure in the zero brine project the challenges identified in section 3 6 are discussed in the following sections 4 2 1 difficult for the uninitiated to assimilate etv requirements it was difficult for the project participants to understand what will be required and how preparations can begin in conclusion a verification body should have been contacted at an earlier stage in the process to help clarify requirements during the early stages of the study questions were raised on how to collect structure and present data relevant for the etv since the proposers had conducted bench scale tests and pilot projects it was not known whether this data could be used or how it could be structured the critical issue is that the role of test data is to support the performance claims and it is therefore necessary to first develop these if the technology is not mature enough it is not possible to plan for adequate testing compliant to the standards demanded by the etv guidance could therefore promote the importance of developing performance claims relevant to market needs at an early stage in the technology s development low trl this could also be beneficial for optimisation of life cycle design to help the technology achieve the most environmentally beneficial performance 4 2 2 market readiness and timing a further challenge is aligning the market readiness with project funding streams so that market readiness testing and verification occur when funding is available for instance eu horizon funding is only available within the project lifetime as agreed in the grant agreement the etv documentation states that a full verification can only be performed once the technology is market ready however the verification can be started earlier by starting with a quick scan form although ideally at trl 7 when there are no expected changes to performance hence the verification procedure from quick scan to full verification would need to correspond to the project funding period if applicable normal times for a full verification are 9 18 months 26 it is always challenging to ensure within a project that trl advancement can be made and contingency plans may therefore be needed in case the verification and testing continues after the research project finishes 4 2 3 performance claims the correct selection of the performance claims is one of the most critical aspects on which the technologies are verified and marketed upon appropriate claims were difficult to establish for technologies in this project due to the low trl in the case of the efc but also because tests were ongoing and further tests could help to assure performance claims it is evident that to fully utilise the potential of etv for marketing performance claims should be linked to market needs hence a market analysis should be performed to understand customer requirements and market demand an lca could be utilised to further understand the potential environmental added value of the technology to refine the performance claims and increase the depth of knowledge finally the performance claims should also be quantitative and measurable the chosen claims should show that the presented technology performs better than similar technologies on the market or that the performance equals similar technologies but have less or minor drawbacks 4 2 4 funding sources for verification costs early documents suggested that the cost for an etv including engaging a verification body and additional costs for a testing body could be as much as 90 000 european commission dg env 2008 however more recent evidence is much lower with average costs from the etv pilot programme being 15 000 according to the website 10 nonetheless the cost of performing tests in accordance with requirements relevant to the technology in accordance to iso iec 17025 should be considered this is dependent on the technology in question and the quality of the tests already conducted 27 grants are available but whether the full costs are covered by the grant depends on the timespan of completing the verification procedure if the grant time runs out alternative financing will be required to complete the etv 4 3 utilising life cycle assessment performing a life cycle assessment lca of the technology could aid the etv process for several reasons firstly it increases the knowledge of the system wide performance and the added value from an environmental perspective for examples the life cycle environmental impact of manufacturing a product where the technology is used as part of the manufacturing process it can help to collect data for an etv and provide evidence of environmental benefits compared to alternative existing technologies secondly it can aid the assessment of the eligibility of the technology for an etv thirdly a lca can help to identify and define performance claims in terms of performance claims this could help to widen the scope of those claims for example typical performance claims of water treatment technology can focus on reduced energy and improved water quality lca s however enable a full assessment of the system for application so could include reduced greenhouse gas emissions across the life cycle or that recovered compounds such as magnesium hydroxide have a lower environmental footprint than conventional production this could enable a wider range of performance claims however this may also lead to challenges in proving these claims within the etv process as they would only be applicable to specific cases therefore performance claims should be restricted to those that can be proven to be applicable in generic circumstances lca s performed at a low trl level also help with initiating data collection thereby laying the foundations for subsequent stages to improve data quality 17 the final lca at trl 7 or beyond should aim to demonstrate the key improvements in environmental performance that the innovative technology provides in comparison to conventional or existing alternatives the final lca should be done before engaging in etv so that the performance and performance claims do not change within the etv process as this would increase costs and process duration 4 4 summary and recommendations in summary we recommend that the proposer reviews the following at an early stage of technological development the value of the etv for their technology the market needs and potential performance claims in addition as discussed above a lca performed at a low trl e g trl 4 would help to understand potential environmental hotspots and benefits a life cycle costing lcc would additionally provide similar knowledge on economic hotspots and opportunities for improvement furthermore contacting a verification body early on would be beneficial these aspects are summarised in fig 5 which describes the process of preparing for the etv within a technology development framework during the initial stages of development research market analysis is performed to understand the market needs and how these are met by the technology at the same time lca and lcc can be started to identify environmental hotspots initiate data collection understand full life cycle benefits and identify areas for improvement to inform the design process together these form the basis for identifying the technologies selling points which can be linked to the performance claims funding of the etv process also needs to be considered at a low trl and could be incorporated into research funding the etv process can begin when the trl increases above trl 7 with the quick scan it then proceeds to the next step when final performance claims are set and when no substantial stage affecting the performance will be implemented before introducing the technology on the market 18 fig 5 also highlights that care should be taken with data quality that may be used in the etv process test data used in the etv needs to comply with relevant and assured quality management such as iso 17025 5 5 conclusion this paper presented the efforts made to prepare three technologies being advanced in a demonstration project for the etv process within the four years of the zero brine project two of the three technologies advanced to a sufficient level to develop performance claims and complete an etv quick scan the ff med and mf pfr achieved trl 7 whilst the efc achieved trl 5 both the mf pfr and ff med technologies are not expected to undergo substantial changes in performance supporting their eligibility to begin the etv process however performance claims need to be checked and finalised within the verification process challenges identified in the paper include a lack of simple guidelines and practical examples to help understand trl requirements aid the development of performance claims and understand the test data requirements to aid integration of etv into the technology development process a simple framework was introduced this highlights the importance of a market analysis to develop selling points and performance claims whilst a life cycle assessment and life cycle costing can support identification of economic and environmental hotspots impacts and benefits the lca can help to identify the added environmental benefits of the technology and therefore aid development of performance claims for the etv author

8748,coal mine effluent treatment has the potential to both reduce the environmental impact of the effluent and provide economic opportunities by recovering valuable minerals and clean water in this study we modeled a novel treatment process which includes nanofiltration nf two step crystallization reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed multi effect distillation med and a nacl crystallizer and performed a techno economic analysis of its full scale implementation using a circular economy approach we estimated the thermal and electrical energy consumption to be 745 5 kwhth tonnacl and 565 1 kwhel tonnacl or 13 6 kwhth and 10 3 kwhel per m3 of feed effluent respectively the levelized cost of the nacl salt that accounts for the revenue from the plant s co products mg oh 2 caso4 and pure water was estimated to be 203 usd tonnacl the economic viability of the treatment chain can be improved by using renewable electricity sources reducing the total expenditure on nf and ro and integrating alternate technologies into the treatment plant keywords circular economy coal mine effluent wastewater treatment mineral recovery electrodialysis zero brine 1 introduction as the european union eu aims to achieve net zero emissions of greenhouse gases ghg by 2050 with measures such as rapid phasing out of coal from the power and heating sector 1 coal remains an important component of the energy mix for several member states including poland 2 the country is a dominant producer of hard coal in the eu having produced 61 6 million tons or 92 of the eu s hard coal production in 2019 2 however the mining sector exerts tremendous pressure on the water resources accounting for 13 2 of the industrial water usage 3 and has serious human health and environmental consequences including water pollution 4 through a mine water discharge of approximately 350 000 m3 day the polish coal mines discharge around 4000 ton day of chlorides and sulfates to rivers 5 making the water unsuitable for drinking or even bathing 6 water protection is one of the priorities of the eu 7 8 and the pretreatment of coal mine effluents to recover useable water and remove impurities from them before discharging into water bodies is essential in addition to preventing the pollution of water bodies the recovery of marketable products such as water nacl salt and minerals such as calcium and magnesium where the latter is identified as a critical raw material by the european commission 9 can help incentivize the additional treatment of the effluents ericsson et al 10 studied a zero discharge treatment plant to treat the wastewater from two adjacent coal mines in poland debiensko and budryk the treatment plant involved pretreatment and reverse osmosis ro and consisted of a thermal plant for brine concentration and crystallization of sodium chloride nacl the paper summarized the initial results of the plant operation and noted a combined energy consumption of 318 kwh tonnacl by the brine concentrator and crystallizer turek et al 5 proposed pre concentrating the effluent from the debiensko polish coal mine using an electrodialysis electrodialysis reversal ed edr two step process instead of a brine concentrator before evaporating the salt they estimated a reduction in the energy consumption from 970 kwh tonnacl to 500 kwh tonnacl turek et al 11 proposed the use of nanofiltration nf as a pretreatment to remove ca 2 and so4 2 ions to enable the use of low energy vapor compression vc thermal desalination and estimated an energy consumption of 450 kwh tonnacl the current study is developed within the framework of an eu funded project called zero brine 12 which aims at closing the loop by recovering minerals and water from industrial wastewater using a circular economy approach within this project a pilot scale plant to treat the effluent from the bolesław śmiały coal mine in the upper silesian coal basin uscb was developed and demonstrated 13 the pilot plant which consists of technologies such as nf crystallizers ro ed and med recovers demineralized water mg oh 2 caso4 and nacl salts under this project mitko et al 14 investigated two cases for the treatment of the effluent from the bolesław śmiały coal mine in łaziska górne poland i direct use of ed to concentrate the effluent ii pre concentration of the effluent in an nf ro system and then feeding it to the ed they observed that pre concentration in the nf ro system was necessary to obtain saturated brine from the ed within the same project micari et al 15 performed a techno economic analysis of treating the effluent from a polish coal mine wherein they analyzed five treatment chains to extract ions in the form of marketable minerals such as magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 calcium sulfate caso4 calcium carbonate caco3 and nacl they considered several combinations of technologies in the pretreatment phase nf crystallization and concentration phase ro membrane distillation md multi effect distillation med and salt crystallization for a brine having total dissolved solids tds of 23 kg m3 and a magnesium content of 0 28 kg m3 the treatment plant with the lowest levelized cost of nacl salt lsc 90 usd tonnacl consisted of two nfs a three step crystallizer to recover mg oh 2 caso4 and caco3 a med and a nacl crystallizer this study builds on and extends these studies 14 15 by including additional processes such as ed using real brine data from the bolesław śmiały coal mine and adopting a new modeling approach to simulate the implemented process flow in the pilot scale plant to determine the plant economics corresponding to its full scale implementation 2 methodology in this section the implemented pilot plant and the assumptions used in its modeling are discussed in detail the techno economic parameters of the modeled technologies are discussed with a focus on ed lastly the method used for the economic and sensitivity analyses is explained 2 1 description of the modeled treatment plant after initial treatment in the ultrafiltration and decarbonization units excluded from this analysis of the pilot plant the coal mine effluent containing ions of na cl ca2 mg2 and so4 2 was sent to the proposed treatment plant which consisted of two phases see fig 1 pretreatment and concentration 15 the first phase is used to separate bivalent ions i e ca2 mg2 and so4 2 from the effluent using a nanofiltration nf unit and to recover two co products mg oh 2 and caso4 using an alkaline solution such as dolime in a crystallization unit the effluent is then sent to the second phase where the monovalent ions na and cl are concentrated to obtain another co product demineralized water and the main product nacl salt based on the choice of the main product we obtained the corresponding levelized cost from the simulation as the levelized cost in this case the levelized cost of nacl salt lsc fig 2 shows the treatment plant modeled in this study in greater detail the modeled plant differs slightly from the implemented pilot plant discussed later in this section the pretreatment phase included two nanofiltration units and a two stage crystallization process in the pretreatment part the effluent is passed through the first nanofiltration unit nf1 which mainly separates bivalent ions such as ca2 mg2 and so4 2 the retentate from nf1 rich in these bivalent ions is sent to a two step crystallization train wherein we first extracted the mg2 ions in the form of mg oh 2 using a 10 wt dolime solution ca oh 2 mg oh 2 followed by the precipitation of ca2 in the form of caso4 in the second step the precipitation of caso4 occurs due to the supersaturation of the effluent solution the availability of additional mg2 and ca2 ions from the dolime suspension increases the yields of mg oh 2 and caso4 the crystallizer effluent is recycled by mixing with the coal mine effluent in mixer1 before it enters nf1 the permeate from nf1 rich in monovalent ions such as na and cl was fed to another nanofiltration unit nf2 to remove the remaining bivalent ions the retentate from nf2 is also recycled and mixed with the crystallizer effluent in mixer2 in the concentration phase the permeate from nf2 is fed to an ro unit which concentrates the effluent to a specified retentate concentration expressed in ppm of nacl while providing demineralized water in the form of ro permeate based on a user specified ratio d i l c o n r a t i o i the ro retentate is then split into concentrate and diluate streams for the ed unit based on the chosen current density i and the desired salinity of the ed concentrate outlet expressed in ppm of nacl the concentration of the concentrate stream increases along the length of the ed stack whereas that of the diluate stream decreases the diluate outlet from the ed is recirculated and mixed with the feed of ro in mixer3 whilst the concentrate outlet is sent to the med unit for further concentration in the med unit pure water is obtained as a distillate whereas the concentrate is sent to a nacl crystallizer to obtain nacl salt crystals it should be noted that the recycling of streams to the preceding components through mixer3 made it difficult to simulate and design the ro and ed units this is because mixer3 requires the flow rates and ionic compositions of both the nf2 permeate and the ed diluate outlet to size the successive technologies in the treatment chain ro ed med and nacl crystallizer however until the nf2 permeate passes through the ro and ed units the flow rate at the ed diluate outlet could not be obtained to solve this issue we modeled dummy ro and ed units which treat only the nf2 permeate the diluate outlet from the dummy ed is then mixed with the permeate of nf2 in mixer3 and fed to the actual ro and ed models which are considered for the techno economic analysis it is noteworthy that although a similar design issue exists for nf1 wherein the streams are recycled using two mixers mixer1 and mixer2 we addressed it by directly using the mass flow rate and ionic composition available from the pilot plant measurements at the nf1 inlet secondly the ed system implemented in the pilot plant is a cascade system comprising two ed units the ed unit that we modeled has three salinities as an input parameter at the concentrate inlet s c i the concentrate outlet s c o and the diluate inlet s d i in this case it is not possible to model each ed unit independently because in a cascade operation one unit depends on the output of the other therefore we modeled the ed as a single unit instead of a cascade system lastly the crystallization train at the pilot plant first precipitates caso4 followed by the addition of a dolime solution to recover mg oh 2 in our crystallizer model this sequence is reversed and we assume that a 100 recovery of minerals is possible this could result in a deviation in the amount of minerals recovered elaborated in the results and discussion section the primary effluent characteristics of the modeled treatment plant are summarized in table 1 the ion concentration of the effluent at the feed of nf1 and the required salinities of the ro retentate ed concentrate outlet and med concentrate were chosen using on site measurements at the pilot plant to simulate a full scale plant we increased the coal mine effluent flow rate used in the pilot plant by 100 times 50 from 0 5 m3 h comparable to the volumes produced at coal mines 15 2 2 techno economic modeling of the technologies the techno economic modeling of all technologies of the proposed treatment plant except ed has been done and described in previous works under the zb project med and nf models 16 17 ro 18 and crystallizers 15 the relevant models have been implemented on python and integrated on a common simulation platform called rce remote component environment 19 to simulate the treatment plant the input parameters selected for these models are listed in table 2 some of these parameters were the same as those considered in the pilot plant such as the feed pressure and percentage recovery in the nfs recovery is the ratio of the flow rate in the permeate to that in the feed stream we assumed that apart from the mass flow rate other parameters in a full scale plant would remain unchanged in this study an ed model was developed based on the work of nayar et al 20 which itself is adapted from the model of mcgovern et al 21 an ed system consists of several pairs n c p of anion exchange membranes aem and cation exchange membranes cem wherein each pair of aem and cem constitutes one cell pair 20 these cell pairs together with the cathode anode concentrate and diluate channels make up the ed stack in this study the ed unit used for concentrating the brine was modeled as a single stage design implying that the change in the concentrate salinity from the inlet s c i to the outlet s c o occurs across a single ed cell pair 20 to simulate salt and water transportation across the stack for the calculation of the cell pair area a c p the length of the stack required discretization into small computational cells a c p t o t represents the total effective cell pair area and was calculated by multiplying a c p with n c p it should be noted that in the referred literature a finite difference method was used to perform the species balance on each channel 20 22 in our work we did not perform this analysis and neglected the water flux in the calculation of a c p this resulted in a lower a c p t o t compared to that computed by nayar et al 20 for an industrial stack self calculation 20 5 m2 nayar et al 22 7 m2 and reference industrial stack 24 m2 to improve the accuracy of the economic and energy consumption calculations we introduced an area correction factor which increases the a c p t o t by 17 in this example from 20 5 m2 to 24 m2 based on the new cell pair area a c p t o t c o r r e c t e d we recalculated n c p which was then used for the calculation of the cell pair voltage v c p this method of calculating the electricity consumption was validated by comparing our model results with those of nayar et al 20 for a standalone ed system having the following parameters a concentrate inlet flow rate of 50 m3 h a d i l c o n r a t i o i of 80 an ed current density of 300 a m2 a concentrate and diluate inlet salinity s c i and s d i respectively of 35 gsalt kgsol each a concentrate outlet salinity s c o of 200 gsalt kgsol and a corresponding annual salt production of 96 836 tonnacl year based on nayar et al s method for the same conditions our model estimated a specific energy consumption of 210 kwhel tonnacl against that of 219 kwhel tonnacl estimated by nayar et al calculated to be within 4 1 thus the calculation of cell pair area and electricity consumption using our ed model was validated the main technical parameters of ed used in this study are listed in table 2 tanaka et al 23 stated that a current density of 300 a m2 was optimal for a low energy consumption of ed stacks using seawater and desalination feeds however we selected a current density of 400 a m2 based on the current densities tested at the pilot plant 400 and 650 a m2 14 and subsequently performed a sensitivity analysis the economic model of ed was based on nayar et al 20 wherein the specific capital cost of the ed plant was assumed to be 600 usd m2 membrane the membrane cost and lifetime were taken as 222 usd m2 membrane and 7 years respectively we assumed a plant life of 30 years for the economic analysis of other technologies the capital cost of nf was based on the verberne cost model 16 whereas those of the crystallizers 16 and med 17 were estimated using the module costing technique 25 the capital cost estimation for ro 18 was based on the literature these costs were updated to january 2018 using a cepci index of 576 7 and then annualized using technology specific depreciation periods an interest rate of 6 and a plant availability of 94 the annualized total expenditure totex was calculated using the summation of capital and operational expenditures capex and opex respectively the annual revenues were computed based on the amount of water and minerals recovered through their respective technologies the technology wise annualized expenditures and revenues were then expressed as a levelized cost of the main product nacl salt lsceffective as follows 15 l s c e f f e c t i v e t e c h u s d t o n n a c l c a p e x t e c h o p e x t e c h r e v e n u e w a t e r o r c a s o 4 o r m g o h 2 u s d y e a r n a c l c r y s t a l s p r o d u c e d t o n n a c l y e a r if each component of the l s c e f f e c t i v e t e c h was expressed independently it would be referred to as l s c c a p e x l s c o p e x and l s c r e v e n u e respectively adding the l s c e f f e c t i v e t e c h for each technology in the treatment chain gave l s c c u m u l a t i v e which is the minimum price at which nacl salt needs to be sold for the treatment plant to reach a break even table 3 lists the economic assumptions the heating cost was based on a low temperature heat source available at an industrial site 17 the cost parameters for each technology could be found in the literature 15 18 20 to account for the variations in the levelized cost of the main product nacl salt or lsc due to input energy cost and by product price variations we performed a sensitivity analysis by independently varying the values of the chosen sensitivity parameters by up to 50 on either side in steps of 25 as compared to those of the base case the following parameters were selected for the sensitivity analysis the costs of electricity and heating and selling prices of water mg oh 2 and caso4 an additional parameter current density i across the ed stack was considered 3 results and discussion we first assess the performance of the simulated treatment process and then discuss the results energy consumption of the treatment plant amount of minerals and water recovered economic analysis discussing the technology wise annual revenues and expenditures and levelized cost of the main product and its contributors in this section the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented and validated by comparing them with the pilot plant measurements 3 1 performance of the integrated process in this sub section the performance of individual technology models and their integration in the simulation platform rce are assessed we first examine the effectiveness of ion separation in the modeled technologies table 4 below shows the ion concentrations of key streams as seen the two nfs were able to reject ions like mg ca and so4 to the retentate streams 2 and 4 which could be recovered in the two step crystallizer due to the requirement of the tools for ro ed and med technologies the ion concentration is indicated in terms of nacl salinity as the effluent moves through these tools the ion concentration increases from 25 108 ppm before ro to 241 671 ppm after med and these salinities match those from the pilot plant cf table 1 next the flow rates of key streams are compared with that of the pilot plant adjusted to full scale it can be seen that although recovery ratio feed to permeate conversion ratio is nf tool s input parameter and was set to 75 for both nfs the simulated nfs estimate a slightly higher recovery of 78 and 80 respectively in contrast despite the resulting higher permeate flow rates from both nfs the simulated ro feed flowrate stream 7 was lower than that observed in the pilot plant this could be due to the higher recovery from the simulated ro 57 generally the ion concentrations and flow rates of the modeled treatment plant are comparable with the pilot plant data aside from the above mentioned deviations 3 2 recovery of minerals and energy consumption the modeled treatment chain recovers demineralized water from ro and med and three minerals caso4 mg oh 2 and nacl at the expense of dolime fig 3 shows the hourly flow rates of these substances in the treatment chain as seen nacl and mg oh 2 represent the largest and smallest amounts of mineral recovery respectively with nacl accounting for over 80 of the recovered minerals interestingly the two step crystallizer consumed 4 more raw material dolime by weight than the amount of minerals caso4 and mg oh 2 it recovered with an effluent flow rate of 50 m3 h the treatment chain can recover 34 m3 h of demineralized water although water is recovered in both ro and med the ro unit recovers the bulk of it 96 not shown in the figure four technologies nf two step crystallization ro and ed consume only electricity while two technologies med and nacl crystallization consume both heat and electricity table 5 lists the electric and thermal power required for each technology as observed except for the two step crystallizer and med other technologies required much high electric power nf2 required 38 less power than that required by nf1 explained by the reduced feed and ion concentrations cf table 4 the heating power of med is 2 5 times more than that of the nacl crystallizer fig 4 shows the specific electricity and heat consumption of these technologies corresponding to the annual production of nacl crystals and the effluent feed rate the med dominated in terms of heat 72 of the total heat as well as total energy consumption 41 of the total energy this was followed by the heat consumption of the nacl crystallizer 210 8 kwhth tonnacl or 28 of the total heat and 16 of the total energy nf consumed the highest amount of electricity in the treatment plant 37 of the total electricity and 16 of the total energy the electricity consumptions of ro and ed were comparable whereas those of med and the two step crystallizer were negligible overall the treatment chain has a thermal and electrical energy requirement of 745 5 kwhth tonnacl and 565 1 kwhel tonnacl or 13 6 kwhth and 10 3 kwhel per m3 of feed coal mine effluent respectively 3 3 economic analysis fig 5 compares the annual expenditures capex and opex for each technology within the treatment plant and the generated revenues for a detailed breakdown of the annual expenditures refer to table a 1 in the appendix the depicted water revenue is the combined value of that of ro and med the capex and opex of nf1 nf2 and ro are comparable and higher than those of any other technology when combined the nf units account for 55 and 46 of the overall capex and opex respectively the capex and opex of the nf system were dominated by the costs of the energy supply system 88 and quality control and installation 44 respectively cf table a 1 the capex and opex of ro are driven by structural 53 and maintenance 47 costs respectively structural costs include the costs of membranes pressure vessels and piping and instrumentation the combined totex of the nf and ro units accounted for more than 75 of that of the entire treatment plant among all the technologies only ed med and nacl crystallizer had an opex higher than their capex in the cases of ed and nacl crystallizer electricity consumption was the biggest contributor to their opex 44 and 84 respectively in the case of either crystallizer it is observed that the revenue generated by the recovered minerals substantially outweighs their totex the revenue from mg oh 2 accounts for more than 90 of the total revenue generated by the two step crystallizer despite accounting for only 23 by weight of its mineral recovery cf fig 3 the revenues generated by the two step crystallizer ro and nacl crystallizer account for 742 46 and 549 of their annual expenses respectively the total annual revenue 1 42 million usd year accounts for 60 of the total annual expenditure the bar and line plots in fig 6 depict the technology wise distribution of the effective levelized cost of salt l s c e f f e c t i v e and the l s c c u m u l a t i v e along the treatment chain respectively it can be seen that only the two step crystallization unit had a negative l s c e f f e c t i v e 62 usd tonnacl mainly due to the large revenues generated from mg oh 2 cf fig 5 although the ro unit had l s c c a p e x and l s c o p e x comparable to those of the nf1 and nf2 units its l s c e f f e c t i v e is reduced considerably due to its water revenue the nf units were the biggest cost contributors with a combined l s c e f f e c t i v e of 157 usd tonnacl accounting for over 77 of the total l s c e f f e c t i v e of 203 usd tonnacl the lsc contributions of the med and nacl crystallizer were relatively small 3 4 sensitivity analysis using the lsc 203 usd tonnacl calculated in the preceding subsection as the base case a sensitivity analysis was performed the results are shown in fig 7 as expected increasing the price of the by products mg oh 2 caso4 and water of the treatment chain reduced the lsc quadrant iv of the graph and vice versa it was observed that an increase in the price of mg oh 2 had the greatest impact on the reduction of lsc 171 usd tonnacl whereas that of caso4 had the least 200 usd tonnacl this effect is due to the revenue from mg oh 2 being considerably higher than that of caso4 cf fig 5 increasing the price of water by 50 resulted in an lsc of 185 usd tonnacl in contrast reducing the price of mg oh 2 caso4 and water increased the lsc to 236 207 and 222 usd tonnacl respectively despite the variation in the current density of ed exhibiting a similar behavior it is likely to be a non linear one because increasing the current density by 50 to 600 a m2 results in a marginal reduction in lsc 202 usd tonnacl compared to the increase in lsc 221 usd tonnacl upon reducing the current density to 200 a m2 on the other hand as expected decreasing the energy cost electricity and heat decreased the lsc quadrant iii of the graph although thermal energy dominated the energy consumption of the entire treatment plant see subsection 3 2 the impact on lsc upon decreasing the electricity cost is considerably higher impact up to 174 usd tonnacl compared to that up to 200 usd tonnacl upon reducing the heat cost similarly increasing the electricity and heat costs increases the lsc to up to 233 and 207 usd tonnacl respectively 3 5 discussion and analysis we validated the material recovery and electricity consumption values calculated using the rce model of the treatment plant by comparing them with the pilot plant measurements this is followed by a discussion of potential opportunities to reduce the lsc table 6 compares the recovery amounts of minerals and water it can be seen that the model estimates a considerably larger recovery of caso4 compared to the site measurement this could be due to a combination of factors such as the relatively small scale of the pilot plant as well as model limitations assumption of complete mineral recovery in the two step crystallizer precipitation of caso4 after the addition of dolime solution that is in the second step instead of the first as is the case in the pilot plant however this should not affect plant economics considerably given the low share of caso4 in revenue generation cf fig 5 moreover the model s estimation of mg oh 2 water and nacl recovery is comparable to the site measurements table 7 presents a comparison of the energy consumption of the technologies within the pilot plant with the model results as observed the energy consumption of the modeled nf and ro technologies closely matches that of the pilot plant however the estimated electricity consumption of the modeled ed which is a single unit and single stage system is less than half of that of the pilot plant s two unit cascade system indicating its high energy efficiency in the case of med the pilot plant value is based on the literature for a fully electric and modern med and thus could not be directly compared with the modeled med which primarily used thermal energy in the form of low temperature steam at 100 c thus apart from a few deviations the rce model of the treatment chain was validated against the pilot plant with comparable estimations in terms of mineral water recovery and energy consumption based on the discussed model assumptions and techno economic parameters of the technology models we estimated a salt cost of 203 usd tonnacl this was 35 153 higher than the typical market value of high purity 99 5 nacl salt ranging between 80 and 150 usd tonnacl 15 the nf and ro units were the biggest cost factors accounting for over 75 of the plant s annual expenditures cf subsection 3 3 this limits the potential economic benefits of modifying the parameters and technologies downstream of the treatment plant since the capex and opex of the nf unit were fairly distributed cf fig 5 it could be beneficial to investigate their main contributors the costs of the energy system 88 of capex and quality control and installation 44 of opex based on the results of our sensitivity analysis a reduction in the electricity cost and an increase in the market prices of mg oh 2 and water will have the maximum impact on lsc reduction procuring electricity from a renewable source especially onshore wind 1 mw whose auctioned price in poland between 2016 and 2019 is as low as 37 of our assumed electricity price 28 can considerably reduce the lsc as shown by our sensitivity analysis a 50 reduction in electricity price brought the difference between the lsc and market price to as low as 14 the possibility of additional cost reductions could be investigated by using different technology combinations downstream ro ed nacl crystallization ed med nacl crystallization etc 4 limitations and areas of future research although every attempt was made to model the pilot plant as closely and robustly as possible addressing the following points can improve the accuracy of the results modeling ultrafiltration and decarbonization techno economic modeling of these two technologies can provide a more accurate estimation of the lsc water transport calculation across the ed membrane to simplify the calculation of the cell pair area a c p we neglected water transportation across the membrane although we accounted for the resulting underestimation of the cell pair area by a correction factor its value was based on a comparison with an industrial ed operating at a current density of 250 a m2 whereas the ed unit in our analysis operated at 400 a m2 using a finite difference method to model salt and water transportation as used by nayar et al 20 could estimate the value of a c p more reliably two unit cascade system of ed modeling two ed units working in a cascade system as in the pilot plant may help make the replication of the pilot plant in the model more accurate the modeling of such a system could be possible by performing an optimization instead of a simulation as used in this study modeling transport of non nacl ions in ed and ro the current models for ro and ed only characterized the transportation of na and cl ions although the presence of other ions at the ro and ed inlets was negligible in this study characterizing their transport will increase the versatility of the models for a broader range of applications reducing recovery from the crystallizers since a 100 recovery of minerals is practically not possible the crystallizer model should ideally include percentage recovery as a parameter based on experimental results 5 conclusion coal mine effluents pose a serious threat to the local environment if left untreated in this study we modeled a treatment chain that was tested in an experimental pilot plant the following technologies were included in our model nf two stage crystallization ro ed med and nacl crystallizer we found that the recovery of minerals especially mg oh 2 and demineralized water offered considerable cost benefits the annual expenditure of the treatment plant was dominated by the nf and ro units accounting for over 75 of it the modeled treatment plant was able to replicate the pilot plant s mineral water recovery and energy consumption with a fair degree of accuracy based on the parameter assumptions we estimated the levelized cost of salt lsc to be 203 usd tonnacl considerably higher than the market value which range between 80 and 150 usd tonnacl further investigation into the cost parameters of the highest cost contributing technologies nf and ro use of renewable electricity and modification in the treatment plant by adding or subtracting a technology could potentially make the treatment of coal mine effluents economically attractive declaration of competing interest the authors declare the

8748,coal mine effluent treatment has the potential to both reduce the environmental impact of the effluent and provide economic opportunities by recovering valuable minerals and clean water in this study we modeled a novel treatment process which includes nanofiltration nf two step crystallization reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed multi effect distillation med and a nacl crystallizer and performed a techno economic analysis of its full scale implementation using a circular economy approach we estimated the thermal and electrical energy consumption to be 745 5 kwhth tonnacl and 565 1 kwhel tonnacl or 13 6 kwhth and 10 3 kwhel per m3 of feed effluent respectively the levelized cost of the nacl salt that accounts for the revenue from the plant s co products mg oh 2 caso4 and pure water was estimated to be 203 usd tonnacl the economic viability of the treatment chain can be improved by using renewable electricity sources reducing the total expenditure on nf and ro and integrating alternate technologies into the treatment plant keywords circular economy coal mine effluent wastewater treatment mineral recovery electrodialysis zero brine 1 introduction as the european union eu aims to achieve net zero emissions of greenhouse gases ghg by 2050 with measures such as rapid phasing out of coal from the power and heating sector 1 coal remains an important component of the energy mix for several member states including poland 2 the country is a dominant producer of hard coal in the eu having produced 61 6 million tons or 92 of the eu s hard coal production in 2019 2 however the mining sector exerts tremendous pressure on the water resources accounting for 13 2 of the industrial water usage 3 and has serious human health and environmental consequences including water pollution 4 through a mine water discharge of approximately 350 000 m3 day the polish coal mines discharge around 4000 ton day of chlorides and sulfates to rivers 5 making the water unsuitable for drinking or even bathing 6 water protection is one of the priorities of the eu 7 8 and the pretreatment of coal mine effluents to recover useable water and remove impurities from them before discharging into water bodies is essential in addition to preventing the pollution of water bodies the recovery of marketable products such as water nacl salt and minerals such as calcium and magnesium where the latter is identified as a critical raw material by the european commission 9 can help incentivize the additional treatment of the effluents ericsson et al 10 studied a zero discharge treatment plant to treat the wastewater from two adjacent coal mines in poland debiensko and budryk the treatment plant involved pretreatment and reverse osmosis ro and consisted of a thermal plant for brine concentration and crystallization of sodium chloride nacl the paper summarized the initial results of the plant operation and noted a combined energy consumption of 318 kwh tonnacl by the brine concentrator and crystallizer turek et al 5 proposed pre concentrating the effluent from the debiensko polish coal mine using an electrodialysis electrodialysis reversal ed edr two step process instead of a brine concentrator before evaporating the salt they estimated a reduction in the energy consumption from 970 kwh tonnacl to 500 kwh tonnacl turek et al 11 proposed the use of nanofiltration nf as a pretreatment to remove ca 2 and so4 2 ions to enable the use of low energy vapor compression vc thermal desalination and estimated an energy consumption of 450 kwh tonnacl the current study is developed within the framework of an eu funded project called zero brine 12 which aims at closing the loop by recovering minerals and water from industrial wastewater using a circular economy approach within this project a pilot scale plant to treat the effluent from the bolesław śmiały coal mine in the upper silesian coal basin uscb was developed and demonstrated 13 the pilot plant which consists of technologies such as nf crystallizers ro ed and med recovers demineralized water mg oh 2 caso4 and nacl salts under this project mitko et al 14 investigated two cases for the treatment of the effluent from the bolesław śmiały coal mine in łaziska górne poland i direct use of ed to concentrate the effluent ii pre concentration of the effluent in an nf ro system and then feeding it to the ed they observed that pre concentration in the nf ro system was necessary to obtain saturated brine from the ed within the same project micari et al 15 performed a techno economic analysis of treating the effluent from a polish coal mine wherein they analyzed five treatment chains to extract ions in the form of marketable minerals such as magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 calcium sulfate caso4 calcium carbonate caco3 and nacl they considered several combinations of technologies in the pretreatment phase nf crystallization and concentration phase ro membrane distillation md multi effect distillation med and salt crystallization for a brine having total dissolved solids tds of 23 kg m3 and a magnesium content of 0 28 kg m3 the treatment plant with the lowest levelized cost of nacl salt lsc 90 usd tonnacl consisted of two nfs a three step crystallizer to recover mg oh 2 caso4 and caco3 a med and a nacl crystallizer this study builds on and extends these studies 14 15 by including additional processes such as ed using real brine data from the bolesław śmiały coal mine and adopting a new modeling approach to simulate the implemented process flow in the pilot scale plant to determine the plant economics corresponding to its full scale implementation 2 methodology in this section the implemented pilot plant and the assumptions used in its modeling are discussed in detail the techno economic parameters of the modeled technologies are discussed with a focus on ed lastly the method used for the economic and sensitivity analyses is explained 2 1 description of the modeled treatment plant after initial treatment in the ultrafiltration and decarbonization units excluded from this analysis of the pilot plant the coal mine effluent containing ions of na cl ca2 mg2 and so4 2 was sent to the proposed treatment plant which consisted of two phases see fig 1 pretreatment and concentration 15 the first phase is used to separate bivalent ions i e ca2 mg2 and so4 2 from the effluent using a nanofiltration nf unit and to recover two co products mg oh 2 and caso4 using an alkaline solution such as dolime in a crystallization unit the effluent is then sent to the second phase where the monovalent ions na and cl are concentrated to obtain another co product demineralized water and the main product nacl salt based on the choice of the main product we obtained the corresponding levelized cost from the simulation as the levelized cost in this case the levelized cost of nacl salt lsc fig 2 shows the treatment plant modeled in this study in greater detail the modeled plant differs slightly from the implemented pilot plant discussed later in this section the pretreatment phase included two nanofiltration units and a two stage crystallization process in the pretreatment part the effluent is passed through the first nanofiltration unit nf1 which mainly separates bivalent ions such as ca2 mg2 and so4 2 the retentate from nf1 rich in these bivalent ions is sent to a two step crystallization train wherein we first extracted the mg2 ions in the form of mg oh 2 using a 10 wt dolime solution ca oh 2 mg oh 2 followed by the precipitation of ca2 in the form of caso4 in the second step the precipitation of caso4 occurs due to the supersaturation of the effluent solution the availability of additional mg2 and ca2 ions from the dolime suspension increases the yields of mg oh 2 and caso4 the crystallizer effluent is recycled by mixing with the coal mine effluent in mixer1 before it enters nf1 the permeate from nf1 rich in monovalent ions such as na and cl was fed to another nanofiltration unit nf2 to remove the remaining bivalent ions the retentate from nf2 is also recycled and mixed with the crystallizer effluent in mixer2 in the concentration phase the permeate from nf2 is fed to an ro unit which concentrates the effluent to a specified retentate concentration expressed in ppm of nacl while providing demineralized water in the form of ro permeate based on a user specified ratio d i l c o n r a t i o i the ro retentate is then split into concentrate and diluate streams for the ed unit based on the chosen current density i and the desired salinity of the ed concentrate outlet expressed in ppm of nacl the concentration of the concentrate stream increases along the length of the ed stack whereas that of the diluate stream decreases the diluate outlet from the ed is recirculated and mixed with the feed of ro in mixer3 whilst the concentrate outlet is sent to the med unit for further concentration in the med unit pure water is obtained as a distillate whereas the concentrate is sent to a nacl crystallizer to obtain nacl salt crystals it should be noted that the recycling of streams to the preceding components through mixer3 made it difficult to simulate and design the ro and ed units this is because mixer3 requires the flow rates and ionic compositions of both the nf2 permeate and the ed diluate outlet to size the successive technologies in the treatment chain ro ed med and nacl crystallizer however until the nf2 permeate passes through the ro and ed units the flow rate at the ed diluate outlet could not be obtained to solve this issue we modeled dummy ro and ed units which treat only the nf2 permeate the diluate outlet from the dummy ed is then mixed with the permeate of nf2 in mixer3 and fed to the actual ro and ed models which are considered for the techno economic analysis it is noteworthy that although a similar design issue exists for nf1 wherein the streams are recycled using two mixers mixer1 and mixer2 we addressed it by directly using the mass flow rate and ionic composition available from the pilot plant measurements at the nf1 inlet secondly the ed system implemented in the pilot plant is a cascade system comprising two ed units the ed unit that we modeled has three salinities as an input parameter at the concentrate inlet s c i the concentrate outlet s c o and the diluate inlet s d i in this case it is not possible to model each ed unit independently because in a cascade operation one unit depends on the output of the other therefore we modeled the ed as a single unit instead of a cascade system lastly the crystallization train at the pilot plant first precipitates caso4 followed by the addition of a dolime solution to recover mg oh 2 in our crystallizer model this sequence is reversed and we assume that a 100 recovery of minerals is possible this could result in a deviation in the amount of minerals recovered elaborated in the results and discussion section the primary effluent characteristics of the modeled treatment plant are summarized in table 1 the ion concentration of the effluent at the feed of nf1 and the required salinities of the ro retentate ed concentrate outlet and med concentrate were chosen using on site measurements at the pilot plant to simulate a full scale plant we increased the coal mine effluent flow rate used in the pilot plant by 100 times 50 from 0 5 m3 h comparable to the volumes produced at coal mines 15 2 2 techno economic modeling of the technologies the techno economic modeling of all technologies of the proposed treatment plant except ed has been done and described in previous works under the zb project med and nf models 16 17 ro 18 and crystallizers 15 the relevant models have been implemented on python and integrated on a common simulation platform called rce remote component environment 19 to simulate the treatment plant the input parameters selected for these models are listed in table 2 some of these parameters were the same as those considered in the pilot plant such as the feed pressure and percentage recovery in the nfs recovery is the ratio of the flow rate in the permeate to that in the feed stream we assumed that apart from the mass flow rate other parameters in a full scale plant would remain unchanged in this study an ed model was developed based on the work of nayar et al 20 which itself is adapted from the model of mcgovern et al 21 an ed system consists of several pairs n c p of anion exchange membranes aem and cation exchange membranes cem wherein each pair of aem and cem constitutes one cell pair 20 these cell pairs together with the cathode anode concentrate and diluate channels make up the ed stack in this study the ed unit used for concentrating the brine was modeled as a single stage design implying that the change in the concentrate salinity from the inlet s c i to the outlet s c o occurs across a single ed cell pair 20 to simulate salt and water transportation across the stack for the calculation of the cell pair area a c p the length of the stack required discretization into small computational cells a c p t o t represents the total effective cell pair area and was calculated by multiplying a c p with n c p it should be noted that in the referred literature a finite difference method was used to perform the species balance on each channel 20 22 in our work we did not perform this analysis and neglected the water flux in the calculation of a c p this resulted in a lower a c p t o t compared to that computed by nayar et al 20 for an industrial stack self calculation 20 5 m2 nayar et al 22 7 m2 and reference industrial stack 24 m2 to improve the accuracy of the economic and energy consumption calculations we introduced an area correction factor which increases the a c p t o t by 17 in this example from 20 5 m2 to 24 m2 based on the new cell pair area a c p t o t c o r r e c t e d we recalculated n c p which was then used for the calculation of the cell pair voltage v c p this method of calculating the electricity consumption was validated by comparing our model results with those of nayar et al 20 for a standalone ed system having the following parameters a concentrate inlet flow rate of 50 m3 h a d i l c o n r a t i o i of 80 an ed current density of 300 a m2 a concentrate and diluate inlet salinity s c i and s d i respectively of 35 gsalt kgsol each a concentrate outlet salinity s c o of 200 gsalt kgsol and a corresponding annual salt production of 96 836 tonnacl year based on nayar et al s method for the same conditions our model estimated a specific energy consumption of 210 kwhel tonnacl against that of 219 kwhel tonnacl estimated by nayar et al calculated to be within 4 1 thus the calculation of cell pair area and electricity consumption using our ed model was validated the main technical parameters of ed used in this study are listed in table 2 tanaka et al 23 stated that a current density of 300 a m2 was optimal for a low energy consumption of ed stacks using seawater and desalination feeds however we selected a current density of 400 a m2 based on the current densities tested at the pilot plant 400 and 650 a m2 14 and subsequently performed a sensitivity analysis the economic model of ed was based on nayar et al 20 wherein the specific capital cost of the ed plant was assumed to be 600 usd m2 membrane the membrane cost and lifetime were taken as 222 usd m2 membrane and 7 years respectively we assumed a plant life of 30 years for the economic analysis of other technologies the capital cost of nf was based on the verberne cost model 16 whereas those of the crystallizers 16 and med 17 were estimated using the module costing technique 25 the capital cost estimation for ro 18 was based on the literature these costs were updated to january 2018 using a cepci index of 576 7 and then annualized using technology specific depreciation periods an interest rate of 6 and a plant availability of 94 the annualized total expenditure totex was calculated using the summation of capital and operational expenditures capex and opex respectively the annual revenues were computed based on the amount of water and minerals recovered through their respective technologies the technology wise annualized expenditures and revenues were then expressed as a levelized cost of the main product nacl salt lsceffective as follows 15 l s c e f f e c t i v e t e c h u s d t o n n a c l c a p e x t e c h o p e x t e c h r e v e n u e w a t e r o r c a s o 4 o r m g o h 2 u s d y e a r n a c l c r y s t a l s p r o d u c e d t o n n a c l y e a r if each component of the l s c e f f e c t i v e t e c h was expressed independently it would be referred to as l s c c a p e x l s c o p e x and l s c r e v e n u e respectively adding the l s c e f f e c t i v e t e c h for each technology in the treatment chain gave l s c c u m u l a t i v e which is the minimum price at which nacl salt needs to be sold for the treatment plant to reach a break even table 3 lists the economic assumptions the heating cost was based on a low temperature heat source available at an industrial site 17 the cost parameters for each technology could be found in the literature 15 18 20 to account for the variations in the levelized cost of the main product nacl salt or lsc due to input energy cost and by product price variations we performed a sensitivity analysis by independently varying the values of the chosen sensitivity parameters by up to 50 on either side in steps of 25 as compared to those of the base case the following parameters were selected for the sensitivity analysis the costs of electricity and heating and selling prices of water mg oh 2 and caso4 an additional parameter current density i across the ed stack was considered 3 results and discussion we first assess the performance of the simulated treatment process and then discuss the results energy consumption of the treatment plant amount of minerals and water recovered economic analysis discussing the technology wise annual revenues and expenditures and levelized cost of the main product and its contributors in this section the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented and validated by comparing them with the pilot plant measurements 3 1 performance of the integrated process in this sub section the performance of individual technology models and their integration in the simulation platform rce are assessed we first examine the effectiveness of ion separation in the modeled technologies table 4 below shows the ion concentrations of key streams as seen the two nfs were able to reject ions like mg ca and so4 to the retentate streams 2 and 4 which could be recovered in the two step crystallizer due to the requirement of the tools for ro ed and med technologies the ion concentration is indicated in terms of nacl salinity as the effluent moves through these tools the ion concentration increases from 25 108 ppm before ro to 241 671 ppm after med and these salinities match those from the pilot plant cf table 1 next the flow rates of key streams are compared with that of the pilot plant adjusted to full scale it can be seen that although recovery ratio feed to permeate conversion ratio is nf tool s input parameter and was set to 75 for both nfs the simulated nfs estimate a slightly higher recovery of 78 and 80 respectively in contrast despite the resulting higher permeate flow rates from both nfs the simulated ro feed flowrate stream 7 was lower than that observed in the pilot plant this could be due to the higher recovery from the simulated ro 57 generally the ion concentrations and flow rates of the modeled treatment plant are comparable with the pilot plant data aside from the above mentioned deviations 3 2 recovery of minerals and energy consumption the modeled treatment chain recovers demineralized water from ro and med and three minerals caso4 mg oh 2 and nacl at the expense of dolime fig 3 shows the hourly flow rates of these substances in the treatment chain as seen nacl and mg oh 2 represent the largest and smallest amounts of mineral recovery respectively with nacl accounting for over 80 of the recovered minerals interestingly the two step crystallizer consumed 4 more raw material dolime by weight than the amount of minerals caso4 and mg oh 2 it recovered with an effluent flow rate of 50 m3 h the treatment chain can recover 34 m3 h of demineralized water although water is recovered in both ro and med the ro unit recovers the bulk of it 96 not shown in the figure four technologies nf two step crystallization ro and ed consume only electricity while two technologies med and nacl crystallization consume both heat and electricity table 5 lists the electric and thermal power required for each technology as observed except for the two step crystallizer and med other technologies required much high electric power nf2 required 38 less power than that required by nf1 explained by the reduced feed and ion concentrations cf table 4 the heating power of med is 2 5 times more than that of the nacl crystallizer fig 4 shows the specific electricity and heat consumption of these technologies corresponding to the annual production of nacl crystals and the effluent feed rate the med dominated in terms of heat 72 of the total heat as well as total energy consumption 41 of the total energy this was followed by the heat consumption of the nacl crystallizer 210 8 kwhth tonnacl or 28 of the total heat and 16 of the total energy nf consumed the highest amount of electricity in the treatment plant 37 of the total electricity and 16 of the total energy the electricity consumptions of ro and ed were comparable whereas those of med and the two step crystallizer were negligible overall the treatment chain has a thermal and electrical energy requirement of 745 5 kwhth tonnacl and 565 1 kwhel tonnacl or 13 6 kwhth and 10 3 kwhel per m3 of feed coal mine effluent respectively 3 3 economic analysis fig 5 compares the annual expenditures capex and opex for each technology within the treatment plant and the generated revenues for a detailed breakdown of the annual expenditures refer to table a 1 in the appendix the depicted water revenue is the combined value of that of ro and med the capex and opex of nf1 nf2 and ro are comparable and higher than those of any other technology when combined the nf units account for 55 and 46 of the overall capex and opex respectively the capex and opex of the nf system were dominated by the costs of the energy supply system 88 and quality control and installation 44 respectively cf table a 1 the capex and opex of ro are driven by structural 53 and maintenance 47 costs respectively structural costs include the costs of membranes pressure vessels and piping and instrumentation the combined totex of the nf and ro units accounted for more than 75 of that of the entire treatment plant among all the technologies only ed med and nacl crystallizer had an opex higher than their capex in the cases of ed and nacl crystallizer electricity consumption was the biggest contributor to their opex 44 and 84 respectively in the case of either crystallizer it is observed that the revenue generated by the recovered minerals substantially outweighs their totex the revenue from mg oh 2 accounts for more than 90 of the total revenue generated by the two step crystallizer despite accounting for only 23 by weight of its mineral recovery cf fig 3 the revenues generated by the two step crystallizer ro and nacl crystallizer account for 742 46 and 549 of their annual expenses respectively the total annual revenue 1 42 million usd year accounts for 60 of the total annual expenditure the bar and line plots in fig 6 depict the technology wise distribution of the effective levelized cost of salt l s c e f f e c t i v e and the l s c c u m u l a t i v e along the treatment chain respectively it can be seen that only the two step crystallization unit had a negative l s c e f f e c t i v e 62 usd tonnacl mainly due to the large revenues generated from mg oh 2 cf fig 5 although the ro unit had l s c c a p e x and l s c o p e x comparable to those of the nf1 and nf2 units its l s c e f f e c t i v e is reduced considerably due to its water revenue the nf units were the biggest cost contributors with a combined l s c e f f e c t i v e of 157 usd tonnacl accounting for over 77 of the total l s c e f f e c t i v e of 203 usd tonnacl the lsc contributions of the med and nacl crystallizer were relatively small 3 4 sensitivity analysis using the lsc 203 usd tonnacl calculated in the preceding subsection as the base case a sensitivity analysis was performed the results are shown in fig 7 as expected increasing the price of the by products mg oh 2 caso4 and water of the treatment chain reduced the lsc quadrant iv of the graph and vice versa it was observed that an increase in the price of mg oh 2 had the greatest impact on the reduction of lsc 171 usd tonnacl whereas that of caso4 had the least 200 usd tonnacl this effect is due to the revenue from mg oh 2 being considerably higher than that of caso4 cf fig 5 increasing the price of water by 50 resulted in an lsc of 185 usd tonnacl in contrast reducing the price of mg oh 2 caso4 and water increased the lsc to 236 207 and 222 usd tonnacl respectively despite the variation in the current density of ed exhibiting a similar behavior it is likely to be a non linear one because increasing the current density by 50 to 600 a m2 results in a marginal reduction in lsc 202 usd tonnacl compared to the increase in lsc 221 usd tonnacl upon reducing the current density to 200 a m2 on the other hand as expected decreasing the energy cost electricity and heat decreased the lsc quadrant iii of the graph although thermal energy dominated the energy consumption of the entire treatment plant see subsection 3 2 the impact on lsc upon decreasing the electricity cost is considerably higher impact up to 174 usd tonnacl compared to that up to 200 usd tonnacl upon reducing the heat cost similarly increasing the electricity and heat costs increases the lsc to up to 233 and 207 usd tonnacl respectively 3 5 discussion and analysis we validated the material recovery and electricity consumption values calculated using the rce model of the treatment plant by comparing them with the pilot plant measurements this is followed by a discussion of potential opportunities to reduce the lsc table 6 compares the recovery amounts of minerals and water it can be seen that the model estimates a considerably larger recovery of caso4 compared to the site measurement this could be due to a combination of factors such as the relatively small scale of the pilot plant as well as model limitations assumption of complete mineral recovery in the two step crystallizer precipitation of caso4 after the addition of dolime solution that is in the second step instead of the first as is the case in the pilot plant however this should not affect plant economics considerably given the low share of caso4 in revenue generation cf fig 5 moreover the model s estimation of mg oh 2 water and nacl recovery is comparable to the site measurements table 7 presents a comparison of the energy consumption of the technologies within the pilot plant with the model results as observed the energy consumption of the modeled nf and ro technologies closely matches that of the pilot plant however the estimated electricity consumption of the modeled ed which is a single unit and single stage system is less than half of that of the pilot plant s two unit cascade system indicating its high energy efficiency in the case of med the pilot plant value is based on the literature for a fully electric and modern med and thus could not be directly compared with the modeled med which primarily used thermal energy in the form of low temperature steam at 100 c thus apart from a few deviations the rce model of the treatment chain was validated against the pilot plant with comparable estimations in terms of mineral water recovery and energy consumption based on the discussed model assumptions and techno economic parameters of the technology models we estimated a salt cost of 203 usd tonnacl this was 35 153 higher than the typical market value of high purity 99 5 nacl salt ranging between 80 and 150 usd tonnacl 15 the nf and ro units were the biggest cost factors accounting for over 75 of the plant s annual expenditures cf subsection 3 3 this limits the potential economic benefits of modifying the parameters and technologies downstream of the treatment plant since the capex and opex of the nf unit were fairly distributed cf fig 5 it could be beneficial to investigate their main contributors the costs of the energy system 88 of capex and quality control and installation 44 of opex based on the results of our sensitivity analysis a reduction in the electricity cost and an increase in the market prices of mg oh 2 and water will have the maximum impact on lsc reduction procuring electricity from a renewable source especially onshore wind 1 mw whose auctioned price in poland between 2016 and 2019 is as low as 37 of our assumed electricity price 28 can considerably reduce the lsc as shown by our sensitivity analysis a 50 reduction in electricity price brought the difference between the lsc and market price to as low as 14 the possibility of additional cost reductions could be investigated by using different technology combinations downstream ro ed nacl crystallization ed med nacl crystallization etc 4 limitations and areas of future research although every attempt was made to model the pilot plant as closely and robustly as possible addressing the following points can improve the accuracy of the results modeling ultrafiltration and decarbonization techno economic modeling of these two technologies can provide a more accurate estimation of the lsc water transport calculation across the ed membrane to simplify the calculation of the cell pair area a c p we neglected water transportation across the membrane although we accounted for the resulting underestimation of the cell pair area by a correction factor its value was based on a comparison with an industrial ed operating at a current density of 250 a m2 whereas the ed unit in our analysis operated at 400 a m2 using a finite difference method to model salt and water transportation as used by nayar et al 20 could estimate the value of a c p more reliably two unit cascade system of ed modeling two ed units working in a cascade system as in the pilot plant may help make the replication of the pilot plant in the model more accurate the modeling of such a system could be possible by performing an optimization instead of a simulation as used in this study modeling transport of non nacl ions in ed and ro the current models for ro and ed only characterized the transportation of na and cl ions although the presence of other ions at the ro and ed inlets was negligible in this study characterizing their transport will increase the versatility of the models for a broader range of applications reducing recovery from the crystallizers since a 100 recovery of minerals is practically not possible the crystallizer model should ideally include percentage recovery as a parameter based on experimental results 5 conclusion coal mine effluents pose a serious threat to the local environment if left untreated in this study we modeled a treatment chain that was tested in an experimental pilot plant the following technologies were included in our model nf two stage crystallization ro ed med and nacl crystallizer we found that the recovery of minerals especially mg oh 2 and demineralized water offered considerable cost benefits the annual expenditure of the treatment plant was dominated by the nf and ro units accounting for over 75 of it the modeled treatment plant was able to replicate the pilot plant s mineral water recovery and energy consumption with a fair degree of accuracy based on the parameter assumptions we estimated the levelized cost of salt lsc to be 203 usd tonnacl considerably higher than the market value which range between 80 and 150 usd tonnacl further investigation into the cost parameters of the highest cost contributing technologies nf and ro use of renewable electricity and modification in the treatment plant by adding or subtracting a technology could potentially make the treatment of coal mine effluents economically attractive declaration of competing interest the authors declare the

8749,it is critical that the development of new technologies to solve environmental problems do not shift the burdens impacts to other mediums therefore to ensure the optimum environmental design of water treatment and recovery systems it is pertinent to apply life cycle assessment lca at an early stage of development using lca at an early developmental stage is known as prospective lca and is particularly challenging due to the low data availability or quality the aim of this study is to highlight the opportunities and challenges of using prospective lca in the development of water treatment and recovery technologies to do this we utilise two case studies from the eu zero brine project and apply lca at two developmental stages the treatment systems are specifically tailored for each case to treat the individual brine compositions and selectively recover its constituents the first stage lcas are based on laboratory experiments and engineering based calculations whilst the second stage assessments use improved input data from pilot plants and simulation the paper compares the analyses of both stages identifies key differences and discusses these disparities in addition it provides insights on the challenges of applying lca for the design and development of wastewater treatment and recovery systems keywords zero liquid discharge brine industrial symbiosis prospective

membranes efc eutectic freeze crystallization wwtp wastewater treatment plan ro reverse osmosis trl technology readiness level gwp global warming potential ap acidification potential 1 introduction brine is the common name for high salinity water and is a waste product of several industrial sectors that is produced in increasing volumes its management is therefore a growing challenge with three main options direct discharge to a receiving body concentration of the brine with membrane and evaporation technologies or valorization with emerging technologies 1 discharge and dispersion of brine into a receiving body is a commonly used route due to its low costs but can cause adverse effects on aquatic environments for example if the salinity increases above the habitual values of posidonia oceanica seagrass its mortality increases and its growth rate reduces 2 a study monitoring a p oceanica seagrass meadow under brine discharge impact showed high epiphyte cover and nitrogen content in the meadow 3 brine discharge causes a decrease in the infaunal diversity and changes in the types of fauna present 4 in addition to salinity brine discharges can also contain significant amounts of chemicals and heavy metals such as copper and antiscalants 5 the latter might cause eutrophication in coastal waters 6 furthermore brines can also contain valuable materials such as minerals and salts that are lost upon discharge the alternative to discharge is to minimise the production of reject brine as in zero liquid discharge zld approach 7 or reuse the brine in industrial processes 8 an extensive technical and economic comparison of brine management technologies can be found in morillo et al 8 morillo 2014 found that concentrators and crystallizers are good options from a technical perspective but are currently expensive technologies that aim to recover commercial salts are potentially more economic than those that only reduce effluent volumes but are more complex 8 research in this area is therefore growing stimulated by the potential to vastly improve the economic performance through the valorization of brine s constituents however it is critical that the design of new treatment systems are optimised to minimise resource and energy use 9 in addition there is a need to avoid the transferral of environmental impacts to other parts of the supply chain or life cycle such as by increasing chemical consumption 9 a tool to aid this process is life cycle assessment lca which has been used across numerous product systems for assessment and increasingly for design purposes 10 lca has been widely used for the evaluation of desalination processes including the disposal of brine 11 but lca studies of emerging brine management technologies are limited salih et al 12 used lca to compare near zld treatment with the discharge of brine to deep wells with and without by product recovery the study found that energy consumption during the treatment process creates the largest environmental impacts and near zld technologies performed worse than discharge to deep well in a pioneering study azapagic et al 13 proposed introducing sustainability assessment into the design process in three steps i identification of sustainability criteria at the start of the design process ii preliminarily sustainability assessment based on preliminary design and iii full assessment based on detailed design prospective lca can be used during the design process or at different technology readiness levels trl to model an emerging technology or system at industrial scale 10 assessment at a low trl can provide information for technology developers to identify opportunities to increase the environmental economic and technical performance 9 however technology development is a dynamic process and therefore the results of sustainability assessment during this period are not absolute nonetheless the results can provide valuable information for both technology developers and policy makers 14 although prospective assessments are useful tools there are some challenges to overcome commonly mentioned challenges of prospective lcas are comparability scaling data availability and uncertainty 15 16 the issues already experienced in conventional lca s intensify such as comparability data availability and uncertainty in addition issues like temporal mismatch of background and foreground data unknown potential impacts of new materials and unavailability of characterization factors exist 10 17 despite these challenges prospective lca is developing and methods are emerging that help to overcome these issues 18 however few studies have illustrated the use of lca in the design process and how the results from prospective lca evolve during the development process due to improved input data therefore this paper aims to help fill this void by illustrating i the challenges of using prospective lca in the design process and ii how lca results can change at different stage the paper utilise two case studies from the eu zero brine zb project where prospective lca was used to evaluate innovative brine treatment and recovery systems the intention in zb was to introduce sustainability considerations early in the development process to aid the design and maximise sustainability performance this paper evaluates the implications of performing lca at two stages of development which therefore utilised different input data from each stage the objectives are to i identify the impact on lca results using first stage initial design bench scale data compared to data from second stage pilot scale and software simulations ii assess the consequences for informing the design process iii identify the key challenges in early application of lca and propose methods to manage to our knowledge it is the first time environmental assessments at different stages of an emerging technology have been compared which makes this a novel study it is therefore hoped that the paper will aid future studies that involve early stage lca s technology development additionally the proposed pilot scale treatment trains have not been assessed before 2 materials and method in the scope of the zb project innovative tailor made zb systems were designed and developed to treat brine from different sources with different characteristics and recover its constituents lcas were conducted in parallel with the technology design and development process at two different stages lca consists of four main phases 1 goal and scope definition 2 inventory analysis 3 impact assessment and 4 interpretation in this study we applied lca in two stages and on two brine treatment case studies a coal mine in poland and textile industry in turkey these are described in the following sections in the first stage lca data was utilised from engineering calculations and bench scale experimental data 9 second stage lcas were conducted using data from pilot scale site tests the cases were modelled using simapro software and ecoinvent database 3 4 was used for background processes for all lcas the functional unit is chosen as the treatment of 1 m3 brine system boundaries of lcas cover operation of the treatment and resource recovery units and credits provided by recovered products recovered products are gypsum deionized water sodium chloride and magnesium hydroxide the environmental benefits of recovering these were credited by using system expansion method in the lca model this means that it was assumed that the same amount of recovered product would have been produced conventionally if it was not recovered in the brine management processes and this credit was deducted from impact category results fig 1 shows the general system boundary of the lcas and its expansion to cover the production of recovered items with conventional processes construction and operation of the brine producing facilities and resource recovery units are out of the system boundaries chemical and energy consumptions as well as component replacement for each process was included in the lcas the international reference life cycle data system ilcd 2011 midpoint 19 method was used to calculate impact category results for climate change acidification freshwater eutrophication and abiotic resource depletion for mineral fossil and renewable resources characterization results were then normalized using the normalization method for environmental footprints benini et al 2014 the life cycle inventories normalized results and contribution analysis of the first and second stage lcas were compared to identify differences between the assessments it should be noted that during the time between the first and second stage assessments bench and pilot scale zb system design evolved and the process configurations used in the treatment train changed perturbation analysis was conducted to assess the effect of parameter uncertainties on the climate change results following the method described in clavreul et al 2012 sensitivity ratios for 10 and 10 variations for some parameters were calculated using equation 1 and higher srs for each parameter were kept 1 s r δ r e s u l t i n i t i a l r e s u l t δ p a r a m e t e r i n i t i a l p a r a m e t e r 2 1 coal mine case study this case study involves a treatment chain that was designed to treat and recover compounds from a brine emitted from a coal mine in poland the composition of the brine is shown in table 1 a flow chart of the first stage treatment train design is shown in fig 2 in the first stage the life cycle inventory table 2 was generated using experimental data and ph redox equilibrium phreeqc simulations the initial design of the treatment train which the first stage lca is based on was composed of nanofiltration reverse osmosis electrodialysis crystallization and magnesium precipitation units which are included in the system boundary in this configuration deionized water is recovered from the reverse osmosis unit sodium chloride and gypsum are recovered from the crystallization unit and magnesium hydroxide is recovered by precipitation operation of the coal mine is excluded from the system boundary since the assessment focuses on the management of the brine and the small quantity of wastewater produced by the zb system was assumed to be treated in a standard wastewater treatment plant the second stage lca uses improved empirical data from a pilot plant with a treatment capacity of 1 m3 h that was tested at the mine as mentioned above the design was altered during the second stage and consists of the treatment units shown in fig 3 the empirical data was upscaled to a conceptual plant with 50 m3 h plant capacity to generate the life cycle inventory the units depicted in green in fig 3 are the common units also used in the first stage in addition to these units pre treatment ultrafiltration decarbonization crystallization with ion exchange membranes criem evaporation and eutectic freeze crystallization efc units are included the pretreatment ultrafiltration decarbonization was required because the feed water was not suitable to be directly fed to nanofiltration it would result in blockage evaporation was added because the electrodialysis alone produced a lower salinity output than required in this configuration deionized water is recovered in the evaporation and efc units gypsum is recovered in crystallization and efc units magnesium hydroxide is recovered in the criem and sodium chloride is recovered in the efc unit landfilling solid waste produced in the criem unit is also included in the model aggregated life cycle inventory of the second stage lca is given in table 2 2 2 textile plant case study the textile case study concerns the treatment of brine effluent from a factory that produces polyester yarn and cotton textiles in kirklareli turkey table 3 presents the brine s composition which originates from the reverse osmosis unit of the wastewater treatment plan wwtp the lci for the first stage lca was generated using experimental data of the brine treatment processes and phreeqc simulations and is provided in table 4 the flow chart of the first stage design is illustrated in fig 4 the first stage configuration is composed of ion exchange ozonation and reverse osmosis units in this configuration sodium chloride and deionized water are recovered in the reverse osmosis unit a second stage lca was conducted two years after the first stage lca during this time the treatment process increased from trl 3 4 laboratory scale to 5 6 pilot scale the second stage lci was generated using data from pilot plant operation table 4 the treatment train was redesigned as shown in fig 5 with the addition of nanofiltration units in the second stage configuration deionized water and sodium chloride are outputs from the reverse osmosis and ion exchange units respectively treatment of wastewater produced as an output of the treatment train is also covered in the second stage lca 3 results and discussion the results are presented in the following sections in three parts a contribution analysis is first made for each case study to compare the environmental impacts of the first and second stage plants and understand which components are most impacting next a sensitivity analysis is made which aims to understand how sensitive the results are to the input data and therefore how inaccuracies might affect results we then compare the results of our study to similar literature and finally discuss the main challenges for early stage lca of developing water technology 3 1 coal mine case results the design of the coal mine zb system changed substantially in the second stage several steps including pretreatment ultrafiltration decarbonation evaporation eutectic freeze crystallization and crystallization with ion exchange membrane units have been added to the treatment train this alone would be expected to significantly alter the lca results and it is therefore difficult to separate from the changes that occur from the improved second stage data a comparison of the lca results of both stages is shown in fig 6 it shows that for the second stage climate change and acidification impacts are 10 and 25 higher respectively on the other hand freshwater eutrophication is 18 lower in the second stage the benefits or avoided burdens from the recovery of by products denoted by the negative impact are shown to be double in the second stage analysis see fig 7 contribution analysis for both lca results show that the electricity consumption of the zb systems is the major contributor to climate change acidification and freshwater eutrophication categories fig 6a and 6b the total amount of energy consumption is 9 and 11 1 kwh in the first and second stages respectively electricity use in the second stage was mainly utilised in the electrodialysis nanofiltration 1 2 reverse osmosis and efc crystallization units 33 7 28 4 15 3 12 8 respectively in the first stage the electricity consumption of each unit process was not measured separately so it is not possible to compare with the second stage on a unit basis auxiliary materials used in the first stage were sodium tripolyphosphate and edta for nanofiltration dolomite for magnesium precipitation hydrochloric acid for reverse osmosis and dolomite production is the main contributor in the second stage auxiliary materials are hydrochloric acid compressed air components propylene glycol tap water lime and sodium sulfate the consumption of hydrochloric acid in the decarbonation stage is the most important contributor for auxiliary materials the share of impacts from the use of hydrochloric acid within the auxiliary materials are 47 65 56 and 77 for climate change acidification freshwater eutrophication and resource depletion categories respectively the higher electricity consumption of the second stage results in an increased impact for climate change and acidification hydrochloric acid consumption in the second stage also contributes to an increase in the acidification category therefore the addition of a decarbonation unit results in an increase in acidification on the other hand replacing magnesium precipitation unit with crystallization with ion exchange membranes to recover magnesium hydroxide prevents dolomite consumption and this is one of the reasons of the enhancement in freshwater eutrophication sodium chloride recovery provides most of the benefits in both stages in the first and second stage lcas 6 5 and 16 5 kg of sodium chloride is recovered respectively this increased recovery in the second stage is the cause for the increase in avoided burdens in all categories another important result of the contribution analysis is that the increases in deionized water recovery 0 7 0 8 m3 and gypsum recovery 0 03 0 67 kg do not noticeably influence the total results the decrease in magnesium hydroxide recovery from 1 1 to 0 45 kg means that the avoided burdens are reduced 3 2 textile plant case results the comparison of the first and second stage assessments for the textile case study shows that the second stage results are higher for all impact categories except resource depletion fig 8 climate change acidification and freshwater eutrophication results are 10 17 and 28 higher in the second stage respectively the mineral fossil and renewable resource depletion category has a different figure while in the first stage total environmental impact is burden in the second stage there is a net gain see fig 9 in the first stage textile plant lca fig 8a shows that electricity consumption causes most of the impacts in climate change acidification and freshwater eutrophication categories the total calculated electricity is 19 1 kwh of which 18 4 kwh is consumed by the reverse osmosis unit in the second stage electricity consumption is 22 2 kwh which is mostly consumed by ozonation 14 kwh and reverse osmosis 4 4 kwh the increase in electricity consumption results in increased impacts for the second stage as shown in fig 8 and in the contribution graph fig 8b the contribution of impacts caused by auxiliary materials in the first and second stages are 16 and 10 for climate change 6 and 8 for acidification 2 and 7 for freshwater eutrophication and 21 and 17 for resource depletion in the first lca the treatment of wastewater from the ion exchange unit was not considered due to lack of data however the second stage analysis shows that this has only a minor impact in the second stage compressed air is the major contributor of auxiliary materials which has 71 84 98 and 63 shares in climate change acidification freshwater eutrophication and resource depletion categories respectively all of the other processes chemicals waste disposal and components have only minor impacts on the total results except electricity and compressed air in the textile plant case recovered resources are deionized water and sodium chloride deionized water recovery increased from 0 6 to 0 86 m3 in the second stage but does not result in any visible reduction in impacts due to avoided burdens fig 8 the avoided burdens due to recovered sodium chloride are the same for both stages since the recovered salt amounts are the same 3 3 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of electricity and uncertainties of recovered products on climate change is shown in table 5 climate change was selected as early analysis showed that climate change was one of the most critical impact categories and largely representative of other impact categories 20 this is linked to the importance of electricity in the production of chemicals and its consumption in the zb systems in addition the recovery of compounds and water from the brine is linked to offsetting climate change impact the results show that for all cases the climate change results are very sensitive to electricity consumption with the sr varying between 0 88 and 0 99 which means 10 variation of electricity consumption causes 8 8 9 9 variation of the results according to the results the amount of sodium chloride recovered results in less change to climate change in the textile plant case compared to the coal mine case in addition climate change impact is not sensitive to the amount of recovered deionized water or gypsum amounts in either of the cases these results indicate that a reduction in electricity consumption or an improvement in the electricity mix to include more renewable energy would enable a large reduction in environmental impacts such as climate change 4 summary and discussion the ability to compare the lca results of the first and second stage coal mine results is significantly affected by the substantial design changes therefore due to the design changes our study has been unable to demonstrate the affects of expected data and performance improvements in going from bench scale to pilot scale typically we would have expected improvements in efficiency and a lowering of environmental impacts going from lab to pilot scale i e using data from bench scale results and then pilot scale however design changes necessary to counteract technical issues such as fouling or salinity of outputs caused an increase in climate change and acidification impacts this was primarily due to electricity consumption suggesting that a switch to lower carbon intensive electricity would reduce most of the impacts and enable the benefits of recovered substances and reduced resource depletion to be realised this is supported by the sensitivity analysis which demonstrates the importance and sensitivity of electricity consumption on the results in the textile case electricity consumption is responsible for most of the impacts and therefore the increase in electricity consumption in the second stage design causes an increase in climate change acidification and freshwater eutrophication however the decrease in the impacts of auxiliary materials generates an improvement in the resource depletion category even though the avoided burdens from recovering resources has not improved substantially in the second stage 4 1 key challenges in early application of lca despite the apparent value of the preliminary lca highlighting the environmental hotspots the results were unfortunately of limited use for the process design team this is because the focus during the pilot stage was solving technical issues and minimizing energy consumption in addition the additional steps of pretreatment ultrafiltration and decarbonization were required to treat the feed water to a suitable quality that could be fed into the nanofiltration evaporation was added because the electrodialysis alone did not produced as high salinity as expected scaling to model full scale performance based on experimental data is an ongoing challenge the available data in this study was laboratory scale for the first stage lca and pilot scale for the second stage lca this data was combined with simulations and engineering based calculations for scaling up the proposed treatment systems to industrial scale for the upscaling it is recommended to work with technology developers and experts 21 in the investigated zero brine case studies scaling up was executed in collaboration with technology developers as recommended the issue of data availability is one of the most important issues in conventional lcas as well as prospective lca this issue was overcome by the close collaboration of technology developers pilot plant implementers and lca team in the investigated case studies therefore it is recommended to establish a close collaboration for future prospective lca studies a temporal mismatch between background and foreground data can occur due to temporal difference between the assessment and the deployment of the technology 10 the results of this study showed that for zb technologies electricity consumption is the major contributor in all impact categories therefore background electricity production processes which determine the mix of coal and other sources have a crucial impact on the lca results considering the increasing demand and use of renewable energy it can be expected that future zero brine plants will have lower impacts in poland where the coal mine is located total renewable energy production capacity was 2178 mw in 2010 and in 2019 increased to 9326 mw in turkey textile plant case the total renewable energy production capacity increased from 17369 mw 2010 to 44587 mw 2019 in 10 years 22 the global movement to renewables is therefore expected to also reduce the environmental impact of inputs such as chemicals to the zb plants this will mean that not only is the energy performance of the plant likely to improve but the impacts of the future supply chain of chemicals should be lower this will in turn lead to an increased viability of zb treatment and recovery technology 5 conclusion the intended focus of the paper was to compare the implications of using different data sources stage 1 and stage 2 on the performance in development projects it is commonly expected that the performance of full scale plants are superior and therefore the chemical and energy consumption is lower similarly results improve between bench and pilot scale due to economies of scale however due to significant design changes in the case studies between stage one and two and the inclusion of additional process steps this was not evidenced nonetheless the actual increase in impacts was minimal in the coal mine case despite the addition of several process steps in addition the freshwater eutrophication impact actually decreased due to changes in the use of raw materials in the textile case the consumption of compressed air in the ozonation process of the second stage led to a large increase in impacts as with other similar research the study highlights the importance of chemical and energy use for environmental impact however much of the impact of chemical production is due to the current energy production mix in the source countries therefore with a continued and potentially accelerated increasing share of renewable energy the environmental impact of water treatment and recovery systems is likely to reduce making them increasingly viable the paper also highlights the limited influence that the lca results had on the design process at this early stage due to the technical challenges despite this the lca s have identified several issues that can aid future development including energy and chemical use and sourcing this suggests that the time spent performing a lca should be carefully weighed against potential future changes in design future projects would benefit

8749,it is critical that the development of new technologies to solve environmental problems do not shift the burdens impacts to other mediums therefore to ensure the optimum environmental design of water treatment and recovery systems it is pertinent to apply life cycle assessment lca at an early stage of development using lca at an early developmental stage is known as prospective lca and is particularly challenging due to the low data availability or quality the aim of this study is to highlight the opportunities and challenges of using prospective lca in the development of water treatment and recovery technologies to do this we utilise two case studies from the eu zero brine project and apply lca at two developmental stages the treatment systems are specifically tailored for each case to treat the individual brine compositions and selectively recover its constituents the first stage lcas are based on laboratory experiments and engineering based calculations whilst the second stage assessments use improved input data from pilot plants and simulation the paper compares the analyses of both stages identifies key differences and discusses these disparities in addition it provides insights on the challenges of applying lca for the design and development of wastewater treatment and recovery systems keywords zero liquid discharge brine industrial symbiosis prospective

brine is the common name for high salinity water and is a waste product of several industrial sectors that is produced in increasing volumes its management is therefore a growing challenge with three main options direct discharge to a receiving body concentration of the brine with membrane and evaporation technologies or valorization with emerging technologies 1 discharge and dispersion of brine into a receiving body is a commonly used route due to its low costs but can cause adverse effects on aquatic environments for example if the salinity increases above the habitual values of posidonia oceanica seagrass its mortality increases and its growth rate reduces 2 a study monitoring a p oceanica seagrass meadow under brine discharge impact showed high epiphyte cover and nitrogen content in the meadow 3 brine discharge causes a decrease in the infaunal diversity and changes in the types of fauna present 4 in addition to salinity brine discharges can also contain significant amounts of chemicals and heavy metals such as copper and antiscalants 5 the latter might cause eutrophication in coastal waters 6 furthermore brines can also contain valuable materials such as minerals and salts that are lost upon discharge the alternative to discharge is to minimise the production of reject brine as in zero liquid discharge zld approach 7 or reuse the brine in industrial processes 8 an extensive technical and economic comparison of brine management technologies can be found in morillo et al 8 morillo 2014 found that concentrators and crystallizers are good options from a technical perspective but are currently expensive technologies that aim to recover commercial salts are potentially more economic than those that only reduce effluent volumes but are more complex 8 research in this area is therefore growing stimulated by the potential to vastly improve the economic performance through the valorization of brine s constituents however it is critical that the design of new treatment systems are optimised to minimise resource and energy use 9 in addition there is a need to avoid the transferral of environmental impacts to other parts of the supply chain or life cycle such as by increasing chemical consumption 9 a tool to aid this process is life cycle assessment lca which has been used across numerous product systems for assessment and increasingly for design purposes 10 lca has been widely used for the evaluation of desalination processes including the disposal of brine 11 but lca studies of emerging brine management technologies are limited salih et al 12 used lca to compare near zld treatment with the discharge of brine to deep wells with and without by product recovery the study found that energy consumption during the treatment process creates the largest environmental impacts and near zld technologies performed worse than discharge to deep well in a pioneering study azapagic et al 13 proposed introducing sustainability assessment into the design process in three steps i identification of sustainability criteria at the start of the design process ii preliminarily sustainability assessment based on preliminary design and iii full assessment based on detailed design prospective lca can be used during the design process or at different technology readiness levels trl to model an emerging technology or system at industrial scale 10 assessment at a low trl can provide information for technology developers to identify opportunities to increase the environmental economic and technical performance 9 however technology development is a dynamic process and therefore the results of sustainability assessment during this period are not absolute nonetheless the results can provide valuable information for both technology developers and policy makers 14 although prospective assessments are useful tools there are some challenges to overcome commonly mentioned challenges of prospective lcas are comparability scaling data availability and uncertainty 15 16 the issues already experienced in conventional lca s intensify such as comparability data availability and uncertainty in addition issues like temporal mismatch of background and foreground data unknown potential impacts of new materials and unavailability of characterization factors exist 10 17 despite these challenges prospective lca is developing and methods are emerging that help to overcome these issues 18 however few studies have illustrated the use of lca in the design process and how the results from prospective lca evolve during the development process due to improved input data therefore this paper aims to help fill this void by illustrating i the challenges of using prospective lca in the design process and ii how lca results can change at different stage the paper utilise two case studies from the eu zero brine zb project where prospective lca was used to evaluate innovative brine treatment and recovery systems the intention in zb was to introduce sustainability considerations early in the development process to aid the design and maximise sustainability performance this paper evaluates the implications of performing lca at two stages of development which therefore utilised different input data from each stage the objectives are to i identify the impact on lca results using first stage initial design bench scale data compared to data from second stage pilot scale and software simulations ii assess the consequences for informing the design process iii identify the key challenges in early application of lca and propose methods to manage to our knowledge it is the first time environmental assessments at different stages of an emerging technology have been compared which makes this a novel study it is therefore hoped that the paper will aid future studies that involve early stage lca s technology development additionally the proposed pilot scale treatment trains have not been assessed before 2 materials and method in the scope of the zb project innovative tailor made zb systems were designed and developed to treat brine from different sources with different characteristics and recover its constituents lcas were conducted in parallel with the technology design and development process at two different stages lca consists of four main phases 1 goal and scope definition 2 inventory analysis 3 impact assessment and 4 interpretation in this study we applied lca in two stages and on two brine treatment case studies a coal mine in poland and textile industry in turkey these are described in the following sections in the first stage lca data was utilised from engineering calculations and bench scale experimental data 9 second stage lcas were conducted using data from pilot scale site tests the cases were modelled using simapro software and ecoinvent database 3 4 was used for background processes for all lcas the functional unit is chosen as the treatment of 1 m3 brine system boundaries of lcas cover operation of the treatment and resource recovery units and credits provided by recovered products recovered products are gypsum deionized water sodium chloride and magnesium hydroxide the environmental benefits of recovering these were credited by using system expansion method in the lca model this means that it was assumed that the same amount of recovered product would have been produced conventionally if it was not recovered in the brine management processes and this credit was deducted from impact category results fig 1 shows the general system boundary of the lcas and its expansion to cover the production of recovered items with conventional processes construction and operation of the brine producing facilities and resource recovery units are out of the system boundaries chemical and energy consumptions as well as component replacement for each process was included in the lcas the international reference life cycle data system ilcd 2011 midpoint 19 method was used to calculate impact category results for climate change acidification freshwater eutrophication and abiotic resource depletion for mineral fossil and renewable resources characterization results were then normalized using the normalization method for environmental footprints benini et al 2014 the life cycle inventories normalized results and contribution analysis of the first and second stage lcas were compared to identify differences between the assessments it should be noted that during the time between the first and second stage assessments bench and pilot scale zb system design evolved and the process configurations used in the treatment train changed perturbation analysis was conducted to assess the effect of parameter uncertainties on the climate change results following the method described in clavreul et al 2012 sensitivity ratios for 10 and 10 variations for some parameters were calculated using equation 1 and higher srs for each parameter were kept 1 s r δ r e s u l t i n i t i a l r e s u l t δ p a r a m e t e r i n i t i a l p a r a m e t e r 2 1 coal mine case study this case study involves a treatment chain that was designed to treat and recover compounds from a brine emitted from a coal mine in poland the composition of the brine is shown in table 1 a flow chart of the first stage treatment train design is shown in fig 2 in the first stage the life cycle inventory table 2 was generated using experimental data and ph redox equilibrium phreeqc simulations the initial design of the treatment train which the first stage lca is based on was composed of nanofiltration reverse osmosis electrodialysis crystallization and magnesium precipitation units which are included in the system boundary in this configuration deionized water is recovered from the reverse osmosis unit sodium chloride and gypsum are recovered from the crystallization unit and magnesium hydroxide is recovered by precipitation operation of the coal mine is excluded from the system boundary since the assessment focuses on the management of the brine and the small quantity of wastewater produced by the zb system was assumed to be treated in a standard wastewater treatment plant the second stage lca uses improved empirical data from a pilot plant with a treatment capacity of 1 m3 h that was tested at the mine as mentioned above the design was altered during the second stage and consists of the treatment units shown in fig 3 the empirical data was upscaled to a conceptual plant with 50 m3 h plant capacity to generate the life cycle inventory the units depicted in green in fig 3 are the common units also used in the first stage in addition to these units pre treatment ultrafiltration decarbonization crystallization with ion exchange membranes criem evaporation and eutectic freeze crystallization efc units are included the pretreatment ultrafiltration decarbonization was required because the feed water was not suitable to be directly fed to nanofiltration it would result in blockage evaporation was added because the electrodialysis alone produced a lower salinity output than required in this configuration deionized water is recovered in the evaporation and efc units gypsum is recovered in crystallization and efc units magnesium hydroxide is recovered in the criem and sodium chloride is recovered in the efc unit landfilling solid waste produced in the criem unit is also included in the model aggregated life cycle inventory of the second stage lca is given in table 2 2 2 textile plant case study the textile case study concerns the treatment of brine effluent from a factory that produces polyester yarn and cotton textiles in kirklareli turkey table 3 presents the brine s composition which originates from the reverse osmosis unit of the wastewater treatment plan wwtp the lci for the first stage lca was generated using experimental data of the brine treatment processes and phreeqc

this configuration sodium chloride and deionized water are recovered in the reverse osmosis unit a second stage lca was conducted two years after the first stage lca during this time the treatment process increased from trl 3 4 laboratory scale to 5 6 pilot scale the second stage lci was generated using data from pilot plant operation table 4 the treatment train was redesigned as shown in fig 5 with the addition of nanofiltration units in the second stage configuration deionized water and sodium chloride are outputs from the reverse osmosis and ion exchange units respectively treatment of wastewater produced as an output of the treatment train is also covered in the second stage lca 3 results and discussion the results are presented in the following sections in three parts a contribution analysis is first made for each case study to compare the environmental impacts of the first and second stage plants and understand which components are most impacting next a sensitivity analysis is made which aims to understand how sensitive the results are to the input data and therefore how inaccuracies might affect results we then compare the results of our study to similar literature and finally discuss the main challenges for early stage lca of developing water technology 3 1 coal mine case results the design of the coal mine zb system changed substantially in the second stage several steps including pretreatment ultrafiltration decarbonation evaporation eutectic freeze crystallization and crystallization with ion exchange membrane units have been added to the treatment train this alone would be expected to significantly alter the lca results and it is therefore difficult to separate from the changes that occur from the improved second stage data a comparison of the lca results of both stages is shown in fig 6 it shows that for the second stage climate change and acidification impacts are 10 and 25 higher respectively on the other hand freshwater eutrophication is 18 lower in the second stage the benefits or avoided burdens from the recovery of by products denoted by the negative impact are shown to be double in the second stage analysis see fig 7 contribution analysis for both lca results show that the electricity consumption of the zb systems is the major contributor to climate change acidification and freshwater eutrophication categories fig 6a and 6b the total amount of energy consumption is 9 and 11 1 kwh in the first and second stages respectively electricity use in the second stage was mainly utilised in the electrodialysis nanofiltration 1 2 reverse osmosis and efc crystallization units 33 7 28 4 15 3 12 8 respectively in the first stage the electricity consumption of each unit process was not measured separately so it is not possible to compare with the second stage on a unit basis auxiliary materials used in the first stage were sodium tripolyphosphate and edta for nanofiltration dolomite

the higher electricity consumption of the second stage results in an increased impact for climate change and acidification hydrochloric acid consumption in the second stage also contributes to an increase in the acidification category therefore the addition of a decarbonation unit results in an increase in acidification on the other hand replacing magnesium precipitation unit with crystallization with ion exchange membranes to recover magnesium hydroxide prevents dolomite consumption and this is one of the reasons of the enhancement in freshwater eutrophication sodium chloride recovery provides most of the benefits in both stages in the first and second stage lcas 6 5 and 16 5 kg of sodium chloride is recovered respectively this increased recovery in the second stage is the cause for the increase in avoided burdens in all categories another important result of the contribution analysis is that the increases in deionized water recovery 0 7 0 8 m3 and gypsum recovery 0 03 0 67 kg do not noticeably influence the total results the decrease in magnesium hydroxide recovery from 1 1 to 0 45 kg means that the avoided burdens are reduced 3 2 textile plant case results the comparison of the first and second stage assessments for the textile case study shows that the second stage results are higher for all impact categories except resource depletion fig 8 climate change acidification and freshwater eutrophication results are 10 17 and 28 higher in the second stage respectively the mineral fossil and renewable resource depletion category has a different figure while in the first stage total environmental impact is burden in the second stage there is a net gain see fig 9 in the first stage textile plant lca fig 8a shows that electricity consumption causes most of

second stage electricity consumption is 22 2 kwh which is mostly consumed by ozonation 14 kwh and reverse osmosis 4 4 kwh the increase in electricity consumption results in increased impacts for the second stage as shown in fig 8 and in the contribution graph fig 8b the contribution of impacts caused by auxiliary materials in the first and second stages are 16 and 10 for climate change 6 and 8 for acidification 2 and 7 for freshwater eutrophication and 21 and 17 for resource depletion in the first lca the treatment of wastewater from the ion exchange unit was not considered due to lack of data however the second stage analysis shows that this has only a minor impact in the second stage compressed air is the major contributor of auxiliary materials which has 71 84 98 and 63 shares in climate change acidification freshwater eutrophication and resource depletion categories respectively all of the other processes chemicals waste disposal and components have only minor impacts on the total results except electricity and compressed air in the textile plant case recovered resources are deionized water and sodium chloride deionized water recovery increased from 0 6 to 0 86 m3 in the second stage but does not result in any visible reduction in impacts due to avoided burdens fig 8 the avoided burdens due to recovered sodium chloride are the same for both stages since the recovered salt amounts are the same 3 3 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of electricity and uncertainties of recovered products on climate change is shown in table 5 climate change was selected as early analysis showed that climate change was one of the most critical impact categories and largely representative of other impact categories 20 this is linked

temporal difference between the assessment and the deployment of the technology 10 the results of this study showed that for zb technologies electricity consumption is the major contributor in all impact categories therefore background electricity production processes which determine the mix of coal and other sources have a crucial impact on the lca results considering the increasing demand and use of renewable energy it can be expected that future zero brine plants will have lower impacts in poland where the coal mine is located total renewable energy production capacity was 2178 mw in 2010 and in 2019 increased to 9326 mw in turkey textile plant case the total renewable energy production capacity increased from 17369 mw 2010 to 44587 mw 2019 in 10 years 22 the global movement to renewables is therefore expected to also reduce the environmental impact of inputs such as chemicals to the zb plants this will mean that not only is the energy performance of the plant likely to improve but the impacts of the future supply chain of chemicals should be lower this will in turn lead to an increased viability of zb treatment and recovery technology 5 conclusion the intended focus of the paper was to compare the implications of using different data sources stage 1 and stage 2 on the performance in development projects it is commonly expected that the performance of full scale plants are superior and therefore the chemical and energy consumption is lower similarly results improve between bench and pilot scale due to economies of scale however due to significant design changes in the case studies between stage one and two and the inclusion of additional process steps this was not evidenced nonetheless the actual increase in impacts was minimal in the coal mine case despite the addition of several process steps in addition the freshwater eutrophication impact actually decreased due to changes in the use of raw materials in the textile case the consumption of compressed air in the ozonation process of the second stage led to a large increase in impacts as with other similar research the study highlights the importance of chemical and energy use for environmental impact however much of the impact of chemical production is due to the current energy production mix in the source countries therefore with a continued and potentially accelerated increasing share of renewable energy the environmental impact of water treatment and recovery systems is likely to reduce making them increasingly viable the paper also highlights the limited influence that the lca results had on the design process at this early stage due to the technical challenges despite this the lca s have identified several issues that can aid future development including energy and chemical use and sourcing this suggests that the time spent performing a lca should be carefully weighed against potential future changes in design future projects would benefit by ensuring close and continual collaboration from the start between the lca team and technology design team to maximise outcomes declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following
