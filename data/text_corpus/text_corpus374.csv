1870,soil moisture drought as one of the most important drought categories is determined by both water supply e g precipitation and demand e g potential evapotranspiration to shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving soil moisture drought the statistical multiple linear regression machine learning and modeling experiments methods have been pervasively used in early studies however these methods neglect the collinearity and interactions of climate variables and thus cannot reflect the direct and indirect interaction of factors leading to soil moisture drought to reveal the synergistic effects of water supply and demand on soil moisture drought this study quantified the contributions of key drivers to the change of soil moisture drought by a path analysis method to exhibit the relationships between atmospheric movement state and soil moisture drought prior to applying the systematic path analysis model we identified the spatial patterns of soil moisture droughts at different depths by using a state of art three dimensional drought recognition method in china our results showed that precipitation deficits dominated the interannual variation of soil moisture drought while increasing potential evapotranspiration only had marginal intensification in drought the response of soil moisture drought to potential evapotranspiration was magnified by drought deterioration especially in basically severe drought conditions the total column water vapor and the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux as well as temperature directly affected precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and led to soil moisture drought through various direct and indirect processes this study highlighted that the interactions among precipitation potential evapotranspiration and atmospheric vapor movement state in space and time were important for understanding the drought development mechanisms keywords soil moisture drought drought severity standardized soil moisture index path analysis 1 introduction drought is one of the most serious natural disasters with complex origins perennial occurrence and severe destruction wilhite et al 2000 the deterioration of drought severity disturbs the biodiversity conservation of the natural ecosystem and the sustainable development of the social economy gu et al 2020a kreibich et al 2022 drought is typically defined as a long term imbalance in the water budget or between supply and demand and can occur in all compartments of the hydrological cycle van loon 2015 generally drought is categorized into meteorological atmosphere hydrological streamflow and groundwater agricultural soil moisture and socioeconomic human types gu et al 2020b heim 2002 wu et al 2022 agricultural drought is one of the most critical hazards which is commonly defined as a deficit in soil moisture that affects plant growth or crop yields hong et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b therefore soil moisture has been widely used to evaluate agricultural drought conditions cai et al 2021 deng et al 2021 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 even though soil moisture drought has multiple natural properties manning et al 2018 it usually can be seen as the result of the imbalance of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration affected by the energy budget and water cycle of the land atmosphere coupling system the water supply precipitation which can alleviate soil moisture drought has spatial heterogeneity in the land atmosphere system and its variation is mostly influenced by the water vapor movement he et al 2022 liu et al 2017 many studies investigated the response mechanism of soil moisture drought to the changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration cheng and huang 2016 luo et al 2017 song et al 2020 wang et al 2018 it is also widely accepted that the changing temperature promotes soil moisture drought indirectly by increasing potential evapotranspiration stefanon et al 2014 statistical multiple linear regression methods machine learning and modeling experiments with control variables are usually used to investigate the complex interrelationships between water supply and demand for soil moisture drought in previous studies for example bai et al 2019 used multiple linear regression to calculate the rate of contribution of precipitation and temperature to soil moisture changes in the tibetan plateau and found that precipitation is the dominant factor compared to the temperature zhang et al 2022 used various explainable machine learning methods to simulate flash soil moisture drought over china by considering the multiple meteorological variables in the adjacent time to drought onset and found that the lack of precipitation and the increase of evaporation demand have different effects on drought in different regions luo et al 2017 used a set of modeling experiments controlling for different climate variables to analyze the reason for the multiyear agricultural drought in california and revealed that precipitation deficits are largely responsible for the agricultural drought however due to the nonlinear and collinearity problems among climate factors the number of independent variables used for drought analysis was limited and varied from partition to partition especially for the multiple linear regression methods liu et al 2022 although machine learning and modeling experiments can interpret all the drivers contributions and achieve good performance in constructing nonlinear interactions among variables machine learning cannot quantify the effect of a factor alone and neither of them considers the role of interactions among climate factors in soil moisture drought moreover the response mechanisms of soil moisture are complex with both direct and indirect factors in previous studies the impacts of various climatic factors on the development of soil moisture drought were evaluated from the perspective of direct impacts while how certain factors directly or indirectly affect the development of soil moisture drought simultaneously still remains poorly understood nemergut et al 2011 waldrop et al 2017 path analysis is a specific technique for analyzing conceptual models by quantifying the relationships and interactions between networks of factors which allows simultaneous analysis of multiple direct and indirect relationships among variables and can solve covariance problems caused by correlations gui et al 2017 velayati et al 2021 it is often referred to as causal analysis because it is used to test or confirm prior models based on empirical data keller et al 2022 path analysis has the advantage of simultaneously assessing all relevant trajectories accounting for the role of independent and or dependent mediators in outcome development devlieger and rosseel 2017 many studies used path analysis in psychology business economics and mathematics to reveal the complex relationships of the variables that affected them bennett et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 due to the simplicity of its underlying statistical theory and its potential to solve important substantive problems it is also used by many ecologists in the attribution analysis of agricultural land use and soil ecological change a et al 2019 keller et al 2022 therefore as a primary method of attribution analysis path analysis has a great potential to analyze the mechanisms of direct and indirect effects of individual variables on soil water drought in complex environments however to the best of our knowledge this method has not been used to quantify the contributions of climate variables to soil moisture drought accordingly this study proposes for the first time the use of the path analysis method to investigate the direct and indirect relationships between driving factors and soil moisture drought specifically the path analysis model is constructed to quantify the impact of demand and supply on soil moisture drought from the perspective of the atmospheric water cycle to advance our understanding of the water supply and demand for soil moisture drought the main factors of atmospheric water vapor change e g the total column water vapor tcwv and the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux divq and temperature were used as the extrinsic climatic forcing factors that indirectly affect soil moisture the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are considered to be factors directly affecting soil moisture drought 2 dataset and study area 2 1 study area this study quantified the contribution of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration anomalies to soil moisture drought in china china is located in east asia and borders the pacific ocean spanning from 3 n to 54 n and from 73 e to 135 e wu et al 2020 covering an area of 9 6 106 km2 to analyze the soil moisture drought characteristics over different climate regimes four subregions were defined based on the multi year average aridity index ai precipitation potential evapotranspiration for the 1950 2021 period huang et al 2014 liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the four subregions consist of arid ai 0 2 sub arid 0 2 ai 0 5 sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 and humid ai 0 65 2 2 era5 data this study used the fifth generation of european reanalysis era5 data to characterize the drought era5 is the latest reanalysis product from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf it covers the period from 1950 to the present and is updated daily with a latency of five days viggiano et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the product is produced using 4d var data and the latest european medium range weather forecast model cy41r2 that was operational in 2016 combining many historical observations including ozone aircraft and surface pressure new decommissioning and a variety of the latest data sets and instruments era5 is one of the most widely used reanalysis datasets for the study of soil moisture due to its good adaptability and high spatial and temporal resolutions ling et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b the used variables in this study included monthly precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration total column water vapor the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux and three layers of soil moisture including 0 7 cm 7 28 cm and 28 100 cm for the 1950 2021 period with a spatial resolution of 0 25 2 3 in situ datasets the in situ soil moisture data were used to evaluate the performance of era5 in simulating soil moisture which were downloaded from the national meteorological information center of china cma https cdc cma gov cn home do the data have been collected from 778 agricultural meteorological stations covering the period from 1991 to 2013 with a temporal resolution of every 10 days on days 8 18 and 28 of each month an et al 2016 this dataset contains soil relative humidity for 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 100 cm the distribution of stations is shown in fig 1 since the in situ soil moisture data are relative value θ while era5 simulations are soil volumetric water contents θ v m3 m 3 the observed data were transformed to the same form of era5 data by the following equation 1 θ v θ θ f ρ b where θ f is the field capacity and ρ b is the dry bulk density the in situ field capacity and dry bulk density data set were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration https cdc cma gov cn home do for the 1981 1998 period to compare era5 data with observed data at different depths the soil volumetric water content obtained by era5 was calculated by taking the soil thickness as the weighting coefficient to obtain the corresponding soil volumetric water content for 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 50 cm and 50 70 cm due to the poorer quality of the observed data for other seasons only soil moisture in summer june august was used to evaluate the era5 data 3 methods 3 1 soil moisture drought identification standardized soil moisture index ssi is one of the most straightforward indices developed and validated in many studies to monitor agricultural droughts afshar et al 2022 mpelasoka et al 2008 in this study ssi was estimated as a standardized anomaly for the 1950 2021 period the negative value of ssi indicates that soil moisture is lower than the average level during the study period which is used to characterize the degree of drought grids with ssi 1 were used in this study for drought recognition the soil moisture droughts were identified using a spatial identification procedure which was based on a clustering algorithm that incorporates spatial contiguity andreadis et al 2005 lloyd hughes 2012 from a three dimensional perspective longitude latitude and time the three dimensional drought can be expressed by di nlon nlat nt where nlon and nlat are the number of girds along longitude and latitude respectively and nt is the number of months along time dimension xu et al 2015 the recognition processes of drought events include the following three steps step 1 identifying drought patches for each moment we set a minimum drought index threshold ssi 1 0 in this study to identify the drought state of each grid considering spatial continuity then we cluster the grids with the value of index less than 1 into several drought patches to obtain patch numbering matrix l step 2 determining the connection of drought patches on two adjacent months we first determine a minimum drought patch area a o and the drought patches which are smaller than this threshold will be omitted the threshold a o is an important parameter in this three dimensional method a o is a function of the total number of droughts and the duration of droughts which determines the spatiotemporal behaviors of drought patches it also depends on the size of study area based on a sensitivity test wang et al 2011 suggested a minimum drought patch area of 150000 km2 approximately 1 5 of the study area for china liu et al 2019 and zhu et al 2019 also used a similar criterion equivalent to 1 5 of the study area to analyze droughts in their study areas in our study the same threshold standard 150000 km2 was employed as the minimum drought patch area as shown in fig s1 considering the two adjacent months t and t 1 if any couples of patches denoted by et 1 and et between the two months have an overlap area larger than a o et 1 and et belong to the same drought event otherwise they are different drought events step 3 identifying drought events repeated step 2 until the last period from the second month of the 72 years to the last month finally all the drought patches with spatio temporal continuity are assigned a unique number that is three dimensional drought events four parameters are calculated to describe the determined drought events they are defined as follows 1 duration d is the duration of a drought event calculated as the time interval between the start and end of a drought event 2 severity s is an expression of water shortage indicating the total amount of water on a spatio temporal scale that is needed to recover back to normal conditions the severity of the drought event taking the e th as an example is defined as 2 s e t 1 n t j 1 n a r e a t j d i t j where se is the severity of the e th drought event km2 month s is the severity the of voxels km2 month nt and n are the duration and the number of covering grids of the three dimensional precipitation event area t j is the area of grids in the attribution section we defaulted the area of each grid point to one unit according to the method of yan et al 2018 3 affected area a is the area swept by a drought event it is a region projected onto the surface of latitude and longitude in a three dimensional space time domain 4 centroid c is the center of the drought event which represents the position of the drought event in three dimensional space time longitude latitude and time 3 2 influence factors analysis for drought events 3 2 1 path analytic method the sensitivity of soil moisture drought to precipitation potential evapotranspiration and other possible drivers was estimated using path analysis from the perspective of correlation before using the path analysis we first standardized potential evapotranspiration precipitation tcwv divq temperature with z scores the structural model was based on areas where three dimensional soil moisture drought occurred fig 2 to perform path analysis the variables were divided into three main categories input intermediate and output ebrahimi et al 2021 with tcwv temperature and divq used as input variables although many studies have found that atmospheric water vapor movement and temperature strongly influence soil moisture drought they do not cause such changes by themselves potential evapotranspiration and precipitation were assumed to directly affect ssi and the tcwv divq and temperature indirectly affect ssi through them we calculated the standardized total effects of input and intermediate properties on the ssi to show the relative effects of water supply and demand factors atmospheric water vapor movement and temperature on ssi change we also calculated the standardized effects of atmospheric water vapor movement and temperature on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in different pathways to show the relative importance of different pathways in mediating climate variables change on ssi all path analyses were conducted using package lavaan in r 4 0 5 hou et al 2018 rosseel 2012 3 2 2 quantile regression under different severity of drought the influence mechanisms are various in order to further analyze the influence of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on different degrees of drought especially extreme drought we used a quantile regression model proposed by koenker and bassett 1978 to measure the impact of different quantiles of drought on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration compared with conventional linear regression quantile regression is less affected by outliers which can better analyze the influence of explanatory variables on the conditional distribution of explanatory variables in different quantiles chen et al 2019 quantile regression is regarded as an extension of least squares regression which not only yields a regression to the mean but also provides a statistical way to express the change in the percentile of the data let y be a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function f y the τ quantile function of y is defined as q τ such that p y q τ τ for the quantile τ the quantile regression can be written as 3 y x β τ ε τ where y y1 y2 yk t represents the explained variable in our study the monthly total ssi in the model x 1 x1 x2 xk t is the explanatory variable in our study the monthly total precipitation and monthly total potential evapotranspiration βτ β0 β1 βk is the parameter vector ετ ε1τ ε2τ εkτ t is the error vector 0 τ 1 represents a specific quantile and the estimated parameter is mainly calculated by weighted residuals and minimum values in this study the explanatory variables monthly total precipitation and monthly total potential evapotranspiration are standardized by z scores to have zero mean and unit standard deviation this type of standardization allows us to quantify the impact of one unit standard deviation on the regression in the explained variable which makes it feasible to compare the relative importance of each variable 4 results 4 1 era5 soil moisture evaluation the gauged soil moisture at different depths is adopted to verify that obtained from era5 the spatial patterns of the 22 year 1992 2011 averaged soil moisture for the observations and era5 product at four different soil layer depths were analyzed during june august jja fig 3 the observed soil moisture which is considered real soil moisture data is larger in northeast and southwest china and smaller in northwest china at four depths the observed soil moisture values decrease from southeast to northwest generally era5 can capture the overall spatial distribution of the observed soil moisture at the four different depths era5 shows positive biases for drier regions and negative biases for wetter regions since the observed data are too limited especially for southern and northwestern china this comparison is only used to get a rough insight into the similar spatial pattern of era5 and gauged soil moisture data the era5 data have been widely used in china to investigate soil moisture drought zhang et al 2021a we then investigate the temporal correlation of soil moisture between observations and era5 fig 4 generally the temporal correlation is reasonably good between observed and era5 data in northeast north and northwest china with correlation coefficients being higher than 0 5 and the stations with high correlation and passing the significance test p 0 1 are distributed all over the country which is consistent with li et al 2021 the significant correlations are found on 27 23 66 20 51 and 16 67 of the stations with correlation coefficients larger than 0 45 0 44 0 43 0 46 at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 50 cm and 50 70 cm depths respectively with the deepening of soil layer depths the correlation coefficient shows a downward trend overall it can be concluded that the era5 can capture the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of observed soil moisture at different depths in china 4 2 spatial variation of soil moisture droughts at different depths fig 5 plots the spatial distribution of all drought centroids at different depths here circles of different colors represent different durations while circles of various sizes represent varying severities during 1950 2021 soil moisture droughts with greater severity and longer duration at 0 10 cm soil layer depth mainly cluster over northwest north and central china than other regions fig 5a generally the distribution patterns of drought event severities at 0 20 cm 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm depths are similar to that at the depth of 0 10 cm however with the increase of soil layer depth the total drought count decreases while drought duration increases in total 661 614 529 and 462 droughts events were identified at 0 10 cm 0 20 cm 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm respectively of those the durations of 116 17 5 119 19 4 130 24 6 and 121 26 2 droughts are longer than 3 months at four depths which indicates the proportion of long duration droughts is greater when the soil layer is deeper 4 3 impacts of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on droughts 4 3 1 overall climate impacts on ssi at different depths soil moisture drought is affected by a changing and interacting set of extrinsic climatic forcing factors and hydrological properties we select four different soil layer depths to show the driving factors response to soil moisture droughts at different soil layer depths over china fig 6 the path analysis models are considered acceptable according to table s1 the water supply and demand can well explain the change in ssi the direct effect of precipitation on ssi is consistently positive and larger than the negative direct effect of potential evapotranspiration on ssi at different depths which means precipitation deficits dominate the interannual variation of soil moisture drought with standardized path coefficients larger than 0 7 however with the increase of the depth the variance explanation rate r2 of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for soil moisture drought decreases which indicates that there are other hydrological factors such as runoff that affected soil moisture drought for 0 10 cm soil moisture drought precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explain 77 7 of the change in ssi while for 0 20 cm 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm the values are 73 2 63 2 and 56 7 tcwv negatively affects soil moisture drought by having a positive effect on precipitation and a negative effect on potential evapotranspiration moreover divq positively affects soil moisture drought through the enhancement of potential evapotranspiration and attenuation of precipitation temperature exacerbates drought by intensifying potential evapotranspiration some of the paths are not statistically significant owing to the calculation at the national scale especially for deep soil layers from 0 to 10 cm to 0 70 cm soil depth the absolute value of the standardized potential evapotranspiration path coefficient decreases mainly from 0 37 to 0 23 in addition the effect of potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought is not significant at 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm and so does the tcwv divq and temperature it indicates that at the depth of 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm only precipitation has a statistically significant effect on soil moisture drought 4 3 2 climate impacts on ssi in different regions the path analysis results of soil moisture drought in different regions humid sub humid sub arid and arid are presented in fig 7 the model results show that precipitation and atmospheric vapor movement are the main influencing factors for soil moisture drought in different regions however the effects of atmospheric vapor movement and temperature on soil moisture drought are in contrast between humid and arid regions in other words the effects are more significant in humid regions than in arid regions the number of insignificant pathways is increasing mainly from 1 to 4 and the proportion of explained variation in precipitation decreases in these models mainly from 90 to 45 from the humid to the arid regions in humid sub humid and sub arid areas precipitation positively affects soil moisture drought and potential evapotranspiration negatively affects soil moisture drought significantly while in the arid area the effect of potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought is not significant the negative effect of precipitation on soil moisture drought is gradually increasing from the humid area to the arid area especially in the arid region where the effect of potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought is very small fig s2 by analyzing the range of the standardized direct effect of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought in different regions we find that the effect changes smoothly for 0 50 and 0 70 cm from humid to arid areas while for 0 10 and 0 20 cm the effect shows a larger turnaround between sub humid and sub arid areas mainly from 0 75 to 0 9 shallow soil moisture drought has a rapid response to different climate anomaly patterns while deep soil moisture drought has a strong persistence in the soil layer and its response to climate anomaly needs a longer time to accumulate 4 3 3 climate impacts on ssi at different seasons after investigating the spatial patterns of driving mechanisms of soil moisture drought we also probe into the temporal disciplines of the main mechanism of soil moisture drought fig 8 we use 0 10 cm drought for demonstration for other depths the seasonal effect pattern is similar to 0 10 cm fig s3 we do not analyze soil moisture drought in winter due to freezing in northern and frigid zones soil moisture shows little change in addition the seasonal path analysis in the arid area is either not analyzed because precipitation dominates the drought in the arid area with standardized path coefficients larger than 0 89 at different depths section 4 3 1 the results show that summer soil moisture drought is mainly dominated by potential evapotranspiration with a standardized effect of about 0 9 while spring and autumn droughts are mainly affected by the deficiency of precipitation further analysis shows that drought severity dominated by potential evapotranspiration is higher while that dominated by precipitation is relatively lower when drought occurs lower soil moisture and higher temperature in summer contribute to the increase of potential evapotranspiration which has an increasing impact on soil moisture drought 4 3 4 impacts change with drought severity of main factors in section 4 2 we find that potential evapotranspiration effects on soil moisture drought are larger in summer when soil moisture drought is more severe to further compare the relative influence of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on different drought groups based on severity the quantile regression method is used to measure the impact of different quantiles of soil moisture drought on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from 1950 to 2021 at different depths over different regions fig 9 it can be seen that the parameter estimates of the same variable under various quantiles are different on the whole the precipitation coefficient is greater than potential evapotranspiration in absolute value for most cases for droughts at 0 10 cm and 0 20 cm the regression coefficient of precipitation ranges from 0 75 to 1 05 from 1950 to 2021 and that of potential evapotranspiration ranges from 1 0 to 0 4 for droughts at 0 50 cm and 0 60 cm the regression coefficient of precipitation ranges from 0 75 to 0 9 the regression coefficient of potential evapotranspiration ranges from 0 9 to 0 5 at different depths the influence of precipitation on ssi increases first and then decreases at the national scale but the influence of potential evapotranspiration on ssi decreases with the increase of quantile the absolute value of the regression coefficient reaches the maximum at 0 1 quantiles indicating that with the increase of soil moisture drought severity the potential evapotranspiration effect is enhanced which means that the potential evapotranspiration contributes relatively more to severe droughts fig 9 a fig 9b shows the changes in the regression coefficients of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in different quantiles of drought corresponding to different zones taking the quantile regression method for 0 10 cm soil moisture drought as an example the regression coefficients of potential evapotranspiration in different zones show similar changes to that in the whole country and the absolute values increase with the severity of soil drought the change in the regression coefficient of precipitation in different regions does not show a definite trend the effects on other soil depths drought are similar to that on 0 10 cm fig s4 this suggests that potential evapotranspiration is a better indicator of soil moisture drought severity than precipitation 5 discussions 5 1 soil moisture drought at different depths soil moisture drought determines the available water resources for crop growth and influences agricultural production the root depth of plants increases during the growing seasons thus enlarging the main soil moisture depth and extent where plants can extract water cao et al 2019 the reductions in soil moisture are typically associated with water stress for vegetation in this study soil moisture droughts at four different depths 0 10 cm 0 20 cm 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm were analyzed by a three dimensional drought identification method we found that the duration of drought in deep layer was higher than that of soil moisture drought in surface layer this was related to the length of time that soil water existed in different water layer depths xu et al 2021 with the increase of soil layer depth the total number of drought counts decreases these findings demonstrate that significant variation exists among different soil moisture drought at different depths they help us to understand the characteristics and mechanisms of droughts at different development stages and provide a reference for the future analysis of soil depth selection of different agricultural droughts 5 2 response patterns of soil moisture drought the path analysis model was used to quantify the response of ssi to the changes in atmospheric water vapor movement tcwv divq temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration tcwv divq and temperature were considered to be extrinsic climatic forcing factors while precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were considered to be the most direct factors affecting soil moisture drought other factors such as relative humidity and wind speed were also used in existing studies to explain the change in soil moisture drought karimi et al 2020 trnka et al 2015 the use of relative humidity wind speed precipitation minus evapotranspiration and atmosphere net inflow moisture flux in the path analysis models were also tested in this study we found these variables bring limited improvement in the ability of the path model in terms of the variance explanation rate of the soil moisture drought this is expected since these variables indirectly affect soil moisture by influencing precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and they have high similarity with the selected factors in our study moreover the use of a more complex path model would bring larger uncertainty in the results in this study precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explained more than 50 of ssi at different soil depths in different seasons and regions thus it is quite feasible to select them as the main factors affecting ssi table s1 generally the path analysis model proposed in this study in investigating climate effects on soil moisture drought performed reasonably well for both the surface and deep soil layers in different regions although the climate effects were mostly larger for the surface than for the deep layers and in the humid areas than in the arid areas this is expected since the climate effect on soil is a top down process jobbagy and jackson 2000 the surface soil moisture is more related to the change in climate factors while the deep soil moisture tends to have a thermal lag effect on climate factors change in addition the climate effects on soil moisture drought in humid areas being more significant than that in arid areas are also expected since the land atmosphere interaction is more obvious in humid areas than in arid areas in the process of soil moisture drought in the arid areas in the process periods of soil moisture drought the soil moisture will be too dry to evaporate and the evapotranspiration would be too weak to affect the atmospheric water vapor which will confine the land atmosphere water circulation gao et al 2019 zeng and yuan 2018 the land atmosphere coupling over humid areas can be also strong during relatively dry periods 5 3 increasing effect of potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought both the negative anomaly of precipitation and the positive anomaly of potential evapotranspiration have extensive effects on soil moisture drought precipitation has been found to play a major role in drought fig 9 however under the context of global warming and changing water demand in the atmosphere the importance of potential evapotranspiration in drought cannot be ignored dai 2013 in this study we found that there were different trends in the effect of the deficiency of precipitation on soil moisture drought with the drought severity in different regions and at different depths fig 9 it indicated that the impact of precipitation on drought does not show an obvious increase or decrease pattern we also found that the effect of potential evapotranspiration on drought increases with increasing drought severity fig 8 and fig 9 and these results cannot be found in previous studies using the conventional linear regression analysis further potential evapotranspiration is mainly dominated by temperature in most cases when drought occurred and temperature could explain 70 or more of the change of potential evapotranspiration in many cases the temperature is also higher in the period of severe drought fig s5 and the effect of temperature on drought decreased with the increase of soil moisture drought severity the increase in temperature further aggravates the increase of potential evapotranspiration promotes soil evapotranspiration and aggravates soil moisture drought miralles et al 2014 yin et al 2014 in other words the high temperature situation increases the potential evapotranspiration and the atmosphere needs more water from the soil to reach saturation further aggravating the soil moisture drought meanwhile the continuous reduction of soil moisture and limited water vapor available for evaporation have weakened land atmosphere interaction and water cycle processes the reduction of water vapor in the atmosphere inhibits precipitation further leading to a smaller contribution of precipitation this shows that in extreme drought situations soil moisture drought is mainly caused by the continuous increase of potential evapotranspiration due to the increase in temperature wang and yuan 2022 5 4 uncertain effect of precipitation on soil moisture drought the tcwv and divq s proportion of explained variation in precipitation varies with regions and seasons fig 7 and fig 8 since atmospheric evaporation in humid regions is greater than that in arid regions and the air atmosphere is more likely to saturate to form precipitation it is therefore expected that the proportion of explained variation in precipitation decreases from the humid to arid areas moreover in different seasons summer has the lowest variance explanation rate for precipitation compared with spring and autumn this is because the temperature is the highest in summer and the continued warm temperature makes it difficult for air to saturate and thus hard for precipitation to form lu et al 2011 the anomaly of precipitation is closely related to the dynamic evolution of water vapor structure guan et al 2019 kingston et al 2015 in this study the change in the impact of precipitation on ssi was regulated by tcwv and divq in section 5 3 we found that the effect of tcwv on soil moisture drought decreases with the aggravation of soil moisture drought but the effect of divq fluctuates which further leads to uncertainty in the effect of precipitation on soil moisture drought by quantifying the effects of divq and tcwv on precipitation fig s6 we found that the influence of divq gradually increases with the decrease of precipitation in different depths and regions during the dry period of soil moisture and the change of tcwv is uncertain which shows that the divq can explain the precipitation better than tcwv to some extent the definite effect of divq and the ambiguous effect of tcwv on precipitation further enlarge the uncertainty of the effect of precipitation on soil moisture drought 6 conclusions this study first identified soil moisture drought at different depths in china from 1950 to 2021 by using a three dimensional drought identification method and then established a path analysis model based on atmospheric water vapor change and water vapor circulation to investigate the synergistic effects of water supply and demand on soil moisture droughts at different depths and regions the primary conclusions are as follows 1 generally the distribution patterns of drought event severities at different depths were similar however with the increase of soil layer depth the number of drought events decreased and averaged drought duration increased 2 precipitation deficits due to the change of atmospheric movement dominated the interannual variation of soil moisture drought while increasing potential evapotranspiration due to the increased temperature less exacerbated drought independent of the climatic zone and soil depth 3 the impact of potential evapotranspiration to drought increased with the severity of drought the magnitude of the response of soil moisture drought to potential evapotranspiration was exacerbated by the deterioration of drought at high temperatures and was most pronounced during extreme drought 4 the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can explain more than 50 of the change of soil moisture drought among which the explanation proportion of precipitation is larger than that of the potential evapotranspiration the total explanation proportion decreased continuously with increasing soil depth and the response of shallow soil drought to changes in climate factors was greater than that of the deep drought 5 from the spatial perspective the climate effects on soil moisture drought in humid areas are more significant than that in arid areas at the temporal scale precipitation plays the dominant role in soil moisture drought at the spring and autumn while potential evapotranspiration dominates soil moisture drought in summer data availability statement data used in this

1870,soil moisture drought as one of the most important drought categories is determined by both water supply e g precipitation and demand e g potential evapotranspiration to shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving soil moisture drought the statistical multiple linear regression machine learning and modeling experiments methods have been pervasively used in early studies however these methods neglect the collinearity and interactions of climate variables and thus cannot reflect the direct and indirect interaction of factors leading to soil moisture drought to reveal the synergistic effects of water supply and demand on soil moisture drought this study quantified the contributions of key drivers to the change of soil moisture drought by a path analysis method to exhibit the relationships between atmospheric movement state and soil moisture drought prior to applying the systematic path analysis model we identified the spatial patterns of soil moisture droughts at different depths by using a state of art three dimensional drought recognition method in china our results showed that precipitation deficits dominated the interannual variation of soil moisture drought while increasing potential evapotranspiration only had marginal intensification in drought the response of soil moisture drought to potential evapotranspiration was magnified by drought deterioration especially in basically severe drought conditions the total column water vapor and the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux as well as temperature directly affected precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and led to soil moisture drought through various direct and indirect processes this study highlighted that the interactions among precipitation potential evapotranspiration and atmospheric vapor movement state in space and time were important for understanding the drought development mechanisms keywords soil moisture drought drought severity standardized soil moisture index path analysis 1 introduction drought is one of the most serious natural disasters with complex origins perennial occurrence and severe destruction wilhite et al 2000 the deterioration of drought severity disturbs the biodiversity conservation of the natural ecosystem and the sustainable development of the social economy gu et al 2020a kreibich et al 2022 drought is typically defined as a long term imbalance in the water budget or between supply and demand and can occur in all compartments of the hydrological cycle van loon 2015 generally drought is categorized into meteorological atmosphere hydrological streamflow and groundwater agricultural soil moisture and socioeconomic human types gu et al 2020b heim 2002 wu et al 2022 agricultural drought is one of the most critical hazards which is commonly defined as a deficit in soil moisture that affects plant growth or crop yields hong et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b therefore soil moisture has been widely used to evaluate agricultural drought conditions cai et al 2021 deng et al 2021 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 even though soil moisture drought has multiple natural properties manning et al 2018 it usually can be seen as the result of the imbalance of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration affected by the energy budget and water cycle of the land atmosphere coupling system the water supply precipitation which can alleviate soil moisture drought has spatial heterogeneity in the land atmosphere system and its variation is mostly influenced by the water vapor movement he et al 2022 liu et al 2017 many studies investigated the response mechanism of soil moisture drought to the changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration cheng and huang 2016 luo et al 2017 song et al 2020 wang et al 2018 it is also widely accepted that the changing temperature promotes soil moisture drought indirectly by increasing potential evapotranspiration stefanon et al 2014 statistical multiple linear regression methods machine learning and modeling experiments with control variables are usually used to investigate the complex interrelationships between water supply and demand for soil moisture drought in previous studies for example bai et al 2019 used multiple linear regression to calculate the rate of contribution of precipitation and temperature to soil moisture changes in the tibetan plateau and found that precipitation is the dominant factor compared to the temperature zhang et al 2022 used various explainable machine learning methods to simulate flash soil moisture drought over china by considering the multiple meteorological variables in the adjacent time to drought onset and found that the lack of precipitation and the increase of evaporation demand have different effects on drought in different regions luo et al 2017 used a set of modeling experiments controlling for different climate variables to analyze the reason for the multiyear agricultural drought in california and revealed that precipitation deficits are largely responsible for the agricultural drought however due to the nonlinear and collinearity problems among climate factors the number of independent variables used for drought analysis was limited and varied from partition to partition especially for the multiple linear regression methods liu et al 2022 although machine learning and modeling experiments can interpret all the drivers contributions and achieve good performance in constructing nonlinear interactions among variables machine learning cannot quantify the effect of a factor alone and neither of them considers the role of interactions among climate factors in soil moisture drought moreover the response mechanisms of soil moisture are complex with both direct and indirect factors in previous studies the impacts of various climatic factors on the development of soil moisture drought were evaluated from the perspective of direct impacts while how certain factors directly or indirectly affect the development of soil moisture drought simultaneously still remains poorly understood nemergut et al 2011 waldrop et al 2017 path analysis is a specific technique for analyzing conceptual models by quantifying the relationships and interactions between networks of factors which allows simultaneous analysis of multiple direct and indirect relationships among variables and can solve covariance problems caused by correlations gui et al 2017 velayati et al 2021 it is often referred to as causal analysis because it is used to test or confirm prior models based on empirical data keller et al 2022 path analysis has the advantage of simultaneously assessing all relevant trajectories accounting for the role of independent and or dependent mediators in outcome development devlieger and rosseel 2017 many studies used path analysis in psychology business economics and mathematics to reveal the complex relationships of the variables that affected them bennett et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 due to the simplicity of its underlying statistical theory and its potential to solve important substantive problems it is also used by many ecologists in the attribution analysis of agricultural land use and soil ecological change a et al 2019 keller et al 2022 therefore as a primary method of attribution analysis path analysis has a great potential to analyze the mechanisms of direct and indirect effects of individual variables on soil water drought in complex environments however to the best of our knowledge this method has not been used to quantify the contributions of climate variables to soil moisture drought accordingly this study proposes for the first time the use of the path analysis method to investigate the direct and indirect relationships between driving factors and soil moisture drought specifically the path analysis model is constructed to quantify the impact of demand and supply on soil moisture drought from the perspective of the atmospheric water cycle to advance our understanding of the water supply and demand for soil moisture drought the main factors of atmospheric water vapor change e g the total column water vapor tcwv and the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux divq and temperature were used as the extrinsic climatic forcing factors that indirectly affect soil moisture the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are considered to be factors directly affecting soil moisture drought 2 dataset and study area 2 1 study area this study quantified the contribution of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration anomalies to soil moisture drought in china china is located in east asia and borders the pacific ocean spanning from 3 n to 54 n and from 73 e to 135 e wu et al 2020 covering an area of 9 6 106 km2 to analyze the soil moisture drought characteristics over different climate regimes four subregions were defined based on the multi year average aridity index ai precipitation potential evapotranspiration for the 1950 2021 period huang et al 2014 liu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the four subregions consist of arid ai 0 2 sub arid 0 2 ai 0 5 sub humid 0 5 ai 0 65 and humid ai 0 65 2 2 era5 data this study used the fifth generation of european reanalysis era5 data to characterize the drought era5 is the latest reanalysis product from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf it covers the period from 1950 to the present and is updated daily with a latency of five days viggiano et al 2021 yang et al 2021 the product is produced using 4d var data and the latest european medium range weather forecast model cy41r2 that was operational in 2016 combining many historical observations including ozone aircraft and surface pressure new decommissioning and a variety of the latest data sets and instruments era5 is one of the most widely used reanalysis datasets for the study of soil moisture due to its good adaptability and high spatial and temporal resolutions ling et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b the used variables in this study included monthly precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration total column water vapor the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux and three layers of soil moisture including 0 7 cm 7 28 cm and 28 100 cm for the 1950 2021 period with a spatial resolution of 0 25 2 3 in situ datasets the in situ soil moisture data were used to evaluate the performance of era5 in simulating soil moisture which were downloaded from the national meteorological information center of china cma https cdc cma gov cn home do the data have been collected from 778 agricultural meteorological stations covering the period from 1991 to 2013 with a temporal resolution of every 10 days on days 8 18 and 28 of each month an et al 2016 this dataset contains soil relative humidity for 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 100 cm the distribution of stations is shown in fig 1 since the in situ soil moisture data are relative value θ while era5 simulations are soil volumetric water contents θ v m3 m 3 the observed data were transformed to the same form of era5 data by the following equation 1 θ v θ θ f ρ b where θ f is the field capacity and ρ b is the dry bulk density the in situ field capacity and dry bulk density data set were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the china meteorological administration https cdc cma gov cn home do for the 1981 1998 period to compare era5 data with observed data at different depths the soil volumetric water content obtained by era5 was calculated by taking the soil thickness as the weighting coefficient to obtain the corresponding soil volumetric water content for 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 50 cm and 50 70 cm due to the poorer quality of the observed data for other seasons only soil moisture in summer june august was used to evaluate the era5 data 3 methods 3 1 soil moisture drought identification standardized soil moisture index ssi is one of the most straightforward indices developed and validated in many studies to monitor agricultural droughts afshar et al 2022 mpelasoka et al 2008 in this study ssi was estimated as a standardized anomaly for the 1950 2021 period the negative value of ssi indicates that soil moisture is lower than the average level during the study period which is used to characterize the degree of drought grids with ssi 1 were used in this study for drought recognition the soil moisture droughts were identified using a spatial identification procedure which was based on a clustering algorithm that incorporates spatial contiguity andreadis et al 2005 lloyd hughes 2012 from a three dimensional perspective longitude latitude and time the three dimensional drought can be expressed by di nlon nlat nt where nlon and nlat are the number of girds along longitude and latitude respectively and nt is the number of months along time dimension xu et al 2015 the recognition processes of drought events include the following three steps step 1 identifying drought patches for each moment we set a minimum drought index threshold ssi 1 0 in this study to identify the drought state of each grid considering spatial continuity then we cluster the grids with the value of index less than 1 into several drought patches to obtain patch numbering matrix l step 2 determining the connection of drought patches on two adjacent months we first determine a minimum drought patch area a o and the drought patches which are smaller than this threshold will be omitted the threshold a o is an important parameter in this three dimensional method a o is a function of the total number of droughts and the duration of droughts which determines the spatiotemporal behaviors of drought patches it also depends on the size of study area based on a sensitivity test wang et al 2011 suggested a minimum drought patch area of 150000 km2 approximately 1 5 of the study area for china liu et al 2019 and zhu et al 2019 also used a similar criterion equivalent to 1 5 of the study area to analyze droughts in their study areas in our study the same threshold standard 150000 km2 was employed as the minimum drought patch area as shown in fig s1 considering the two adjacent months t and t 1 if any couples of patches denoted by et 1 and et between the two months have an overlap area larger than a o et 1 and et belong to the same drought event otherwise they are different drought events step 3 identifying drought events repeated step 2 until the last period from the second month of the 72 years to the last month finally all the drought patches with spatio temporal continuity are assigned a unique number that is three dimensional drought events four parameters are calculated to describe the determined drought events they are defined as follows 1 duration d is the duration of a drought event calculated as the time interval between the start and end of a drought event 2 severity s is an expression of water shortage indicating the total amount of water on a spatio temporal scale that is needed to recover back to normal conditions the severity of the drought event taking the e th as an example is defined as 2 s e t 1 n t j 1 n a r e a t j d i t j where se is the severity of the e th drought event km2 month s is the severity the of voxels km2 month nt and n are the duration and the number of covering grids of the three dimensional precipitation event area t j is the area of grids in the attribution section we defaulted the area of each grid point to one unit according to the method of yan et al 2018 3 affected area a is the area swept by a drought event it is a region projected onto the surface of latitude and longitude in a three dimensional space time domain 4 centroid c is the center of the drought event which represents the position of the drought event in three dimensional space time longitude latitude and time 3 2 influence factors analysis for drought events 3 2 1 path analytic method the sensitivity of soil moisture drought to precipitation potential evapotranspiration and other possible drivers was estimated using path analysis from the perspective of correlation before using the path analysis we first standardized potential evapotranspiration precipitation tcwv divq temperature with z scores the structural model was based on areas where three dimensional soil moisture drought occurred fig 2 to perform path analysis the variables were divided into three main categories input intermediate and output ebrahimi et al 2021 with tcwv temperature and divq used as input variables although many studies have found that atmospheric water vapor movement and temperature strongly influence soil moisture drought they do not cause such changes by themselves potential evapotranspiration and precipitation were assumed to directly affect ssi and the tcwv divq and temperature indirectly affect ssi through them we calculated the standardized total effects of input and intermediate properties on the ssi to show the relative effects of water supply and demand factors atmospheric water vapor movement and temperature on ssi change we also calculated the standardized effects of atmospheric water vapor movement and temperature on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in different pathways to show the relative importance of different pathways in mediating climate variables change on ssi all path analyses were conducted using package lavaan in r 4 0 5 hou et al 2018 rosseel 2012 3 2 2 quantile regression under different severity of drought the influence mechanisms are various in order to further analyze the influence of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on different degrees of drought especially extreme drought we used a quantile regression model proposed by koenker and bassett 1978 to measure the impact of different quantiles of drought on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration compared with conventional linear regression quantile regression is less affected by outliers which can better analyze the influence of explanatory variables on the conditional distribution of explanatory variables in different quantiles chen et al 2019 quantile regression is regarded as an extension of least squares regression which not only yields a regression to the mean but also provides a statistical way to express the change in the percentile of the data let y be a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function f y the τ quantile function of y is defined as q τ such that p y q τ τ for the quantile τ the quantile regression can be written as 3 y x β τ ε τ where y y1 y2 yk t represents the explained variable in our study the monthly total ssi in the model x 1 x1 x2 xk t is the explanatory variable in our study the monthly total precipitation and monthly total potential evapotranspiration βτ β0 β1 βk is the parameter vector ετ ε1τ ε2τ εkτ t is the error vector 0 τ 1 represents a specific quantile and the estimated parameter is mainly calculated by weighted residuals and minimum values in this study the explanatory variables monthly total precipitation and monthly total potential evapotranspiration are standardized by z scores to have zero mean and unit standard deviation this type of standardization allows us to quantify the impact of one unit standard deviation on the regression in the explained variable which makes it feasible to compare the relative importance of each variable 4 results 4 1 era5 soil moisture evaluation the gauged soil moisture at different depths is adopted to verify that obtained from era5 the spatial patterns of the 22 year 1992 2011 averaged soil moisture for the observations and era5 product at four different soil layer depths were analyzed during june august jja fig 3 the observed soil moisture which is considered real soil moisture data is larger in northeast and southwest china and smaller in northwest china at four depths the observed soil moisture values decrease from southeast to northwest generally era5 can capture the overall spatial distribution of the observed soil moisture at the four different depths era5 shows positive biases for drier regions and negative biases for wetter regions since the observed data are too limited especially for southern and northwestern china this comparison is only used to get a rough insight into the similar spatial pattern of era5 and gauged soil moisture data the era5 data have been widely used in china to investigate soil moisture drought zhang et al 2021a we then investigate the temporal correlation of soil moisture between observations and era5 fig 4 generally the temporal correlation is reasonably good between observed and era5 data in northeast north and northwest china with correlation coefficients being higher than 0 5 and the stations with high correlation and passing the significance test p 0 1 are distributed all over the country which is consistent with li et al 2021 the significant correlations are found on 27 23 66 20 51 and 16 67 of the stations with correlation coefficients larger than 0 45 0 44 0 43 0 46 at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 50 cm and 50 70 cm depths respectively with the deepening of soil layer depths the correlation coefficient shows a downward trend overall it can be concluded that the era5 can capture the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of observed soil moisture at different depths in china 4 2 spatial variation of soil moisture droughts at different depths fig 5 plots the spatial distribution of all drought centroids at different depths here circles of different colors represent different durations while circles of various sizes represent varying severities during 1950 2021 soil moisture droughts with greater severity and longer duration at 0 10 cm soil layer depth mainly cluster over northwest north and central china than other regions fig 5a generally the distribution patterns of drought event severities at 0 20 cm 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm depths are similar to that at the depth of 0 10 cm however with the increase of soil layer depth the total drought count decreases while drought duration increases in total 661 614 529 and 462 droughts events were identified at 0 10 cm 0 20 cm 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm respectively of those the durations of 116 17 5 119 19 4 130 24 6 and 121 26 2 droughts are longer than 3 months at four depths which indicates the proportion of long duration droughts is greater when the soil layer is deeper 4 3 impacts of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on droughts 4 3 1 overall climate impacts on ssi at different depths soil moisture drought is affected by a changing and interacting set of extrinsic climatic forcing factors and hydrological properties we select four different soil layer depths to show the driving factors response to soil moisture droughts at different soil layer depths over china fig 6 the path analysis models are considered acceptable according to table s1 the water supply and demand can well explain the change in ssi the direct effect of precipitation on ssi is consistently positive and larger than the negative direct effect of potential evapotranspiration on ssi at different depths which means precipitation deficits dominate the interannual variation of soil moisture drought with standardized path coefficients larger than 0 7 however with the increase of the depth the variance explanation rate r2 of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for soil moisture drought decreases which indicates that there are other hydrological factors such as runoff that affected soil moisture drought for 0 10 cm soil moisture drought precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explain 77 7 of the change in ssi while for 0 20 cm 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm the values are 73 2 63 2 and 56 7 tcwv negatively affects soil moisture drought by having a positive effect on precipitation and a negative effect on potential evapotranspiration moreover divq positively affects soil moisture drought through the enhancement of potential evapotranspiration and attenuation of precipitation temperature exacerbates drought by intensifying potential evapotranspiration some of the paths are not statistically significant owing to the calculation at the national scale especially for deep soil layers from 0 to 10 cm to 0 70 cm soil depth the absolute value of the standardized potential evapotranspiration path coefficient decreases mainly from 0 37 to 0 23 in addition the effect of potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought is not significant at 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm and so does the tcwv divq and temperature it indicates that at the depth of 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm only precipitation has a statistically significant effect on soil moisture drought 4 3 2 climate impacts on ssi in different regions the path analysis results of soil moisture drought in different regions humid sub humid sub arid and arid are presented in fig 7 the model results show that precipitation and atmospheric vapor movement are the main influencing factors for soil moisture drought in different regions however the effects of atmospheric vapor movement and temperature on soil moisture drought are in contrast between humid and arid regions in other words the effects are more significant in humid regions than in arid regions the number of insignificant pathways is increasing mainly from 1 to 4 and the proportion of explained variation in precipitation decreases in these models mainly from 90 to 45 from the humid to the arid regions in humid sub humid and sub arid areas precipitation positively affects soil moisture drought and potential evapotranspiration negatively affects soil moisture drought significantly while in the arid area the effect of potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought is not significant the negative effect of precipitation on soil moisture drought is gradually increasing from the humid area to the arid area especially in the arid region where the effect of potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought is very small fig s2 by analyzing the range of the standardized direct effect of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought in different regions we find that the effect changes smoothly for 0 50 and 0 70 cm from humid to arid areas while for 0 10 and 0 20 cm the effect shows a larger turnaround between sub humid and sub arid areas mainly from 0 75 to 0 9 shallow soil moisture drought has a rapid response to different climate anomaly patterns while deep soil moisture drought has a strong persistence in the soil layer and its response to climate anomaly needs a longer time to accumulate 4 3 3 climate impacts on ssi at different seasons after investigating the spatial patterns of driving mechanisms of soil moisture drought we also probe into the temporal disciplines of the main mechanism of soil moisture drought fig 8 we use 0 10 cm drought for demonstration for other depths the seasonal effect pattern is similar to 0 10 cm fig s3 we do not analyze soil moisture drought in winter due to freezing in northern and frigid zones soil moisture shows little change in addition the seasonal path analysis in the arid area is either not analyzed because precipitation dominates the drought in the arid area with standardized path coefficients larger than 0 89 at different depths section 4 3 1 the results show that summer soil moisture drought is mainly dominated by potential evapotranspiration with a standardized effect of about 0 9 while spring and autumn droughts are mainly affected by the deficiency of precipitation further analysis shows that drought severity dominated by potential evapotranspiration is higher while that dominated by precipitation is relatively lower when drought occurs lower soil moisture and higher temperature in summer contribute to the increase of potential evapotranspiration which has an increasing impact on soil moisture drought 4 3 4 impacts change with drought severity of main factors in section 4 2 we find that potential evapotranspiration effects on soil moisture drought are larger in summer when soil moisture drought is more severe to further compare the relative influence of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on different drought groups based on severity the quantile regression method is used to measure the impact of different quantiles of soil moisture drought on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from 1950 to 2021 at different depths over different regions fig 9 it can be seen that the parameter estimates of the same variable under various quantiles are different on the whole the precipitation coefficient is greater than potential evapotranspiration in absolute value for most cases for droughts at 0 10 cm and 0 20 cm the regression coefficient of precipitation ranges from 0 75 to 1 05 from 1950 to 2021 and that of potential evapotranspiration ranges from 1 0 to 0 4 for droughts at 0 50 cm and 0 60 cm the regression coefficient of precipitation ranges from 0 75 to 0 9 the regression coefficient of potential evapotranspiration ranges from 0 9 to 0 5 at different depths the influence of precipitation on ssi increases first and then decreases at the national scale but the influence of potential evapotranspiration on ssi decreases with the increase of quantile the absolute value of the regression coefficient reaches the maximum at 0 1 quantiles indicating that with the increase of soil moisture drought severity the potential evapotranspiration effect is enhanced which means that the potential evapotranspiration contributes relatively more to severe droughts fig 9 a fig 9b shows the changes in the regression coefficients of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in different quantiles of drought corresponding to different zones taking the quantile regression method for 0 10 cm soil moisture drought as an example the regression coefficients of potential evapotranspiration in different zones show similar changes to that in the whole country and the absolute values increase with the severity of soil drought the change in the regression coefficient of precipitation in different regions does not show a definite trend the effects on other soil depths drought are similar to that on 0 10 cm fig s4 this suggests that potential evapotranspiration is a better indicator of soil moisture drought severity than precipitation 5 discussions 5 1 soil moisture drought at different depths soil moisture drought determines the available water resources for crop growth and influences agricultural production the root depth of plants increases during the growing seasons thus enlarging the main soil moisture depth and extent where plants can extract water cao et al 2019 the reductions in soil moisture are typically associated with water stress for vegetation in this study soil moisture droughts at four different depths 0 10 cm 0 20 cm 0 50 cm and 0 70 cm were analyzed by a three dimensional drought identification method we found that the duration of drought in deep layer was higher than that of soil moisture drought in surface layer this was related to the length of time that soil water existed in different water layer depths xu et al 2021 with the increase of soil layer depth the total number of drought counts decreases these findings demonstrate that significant variation exists among different soil moisture drought at different depths they help us to understand the characteristics and mechanisms of droughts at different development stages and provide a reference for the future analysis of soil depth selection of different agricultural droughts 5 2 response patterns of soil moisture drought the path analysis model was used to quantify the response of ssi to the changes in atmospheric water vapor movement tcwv divq temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration tcwv divq and temperature were considered to be extrinsic climatic forcing factors while precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were considered to be the most direct factors affecting soil moisture drought other factors such as relative humidity and wind speed were also used in existing studies to explain the change in soil moisture drought karimi et al 2020 trnka et al 2015 the use of relative humidity wind speed precipitation minus evapotranspiration and atmosphere net inflow moisture flux in the path analysis models were also tested in this study we found these variables bring limited improvement in the ability of the path model in terms of the variance explanation rate of the soil moisture drought this is expected since these variables indirectly affect soil moisture by influencing precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and they have high similarity with the selected factors in our study moreover the use of a more complex path model would bring larger uncertainty in the results in this study precipitation and potential evapotranspiration explained more than 50 of ssi at different soil depths in different seasons and regions thus it is quite feasible to select them as the main factors affecting ssi table s1 generally the path analysis model proposed in this study in investigating climate effects on soil moisture drought performed reasonably well for both the surface and deep soil layers in different regions although the climate effects were mostly larger for the surface than for the deep layers and in the humid areas than in the arid areas this is expected since the climate effect on soil is a top down process jobbagy and jackson 2000 the surface soil moisture is more related to the change in climate factors while the deep soil moisture tends to have a thermal lag effect on climate factors change in addition the climate effects on soil moisture drought in humid areas being more significant than that in arid areas are also expected since the land atmosphere interaction is more obvious in humid areas than in arid areas in the process of soil moisture drought in the arid areas in the process periods of soil moisture drought the soil moisture will be too dry to evaporate and the evapotranspiration would be too weak to affect the atmospheric water vapor which will confine the land atmosphere water circulation gao et al 2019 zeng and yuan 2018 the land atmosphere coupling over humid areas can be also strong during relatively dry periods 5 3 increasing effect of potential evapotranspiration on soil moisture drought both the negative anomaly of precipitation and the positive anomaly of potential evapotranspiration have extensive effects on soil moisture drought precipitation has been found to play a major role in drought fig 9 however under the context of global warming and changing water demand in the atmosphere the importance of potential evapotranspiration in drought cannot be ignored dai 2013 in this study we found that there were different trends in the effect of the deficiency of precipitation on soil moisture drought with the drought severity in different regions and at different depths fig 9 it indicated that the impact of precipitation on drought does not show an obvious increase or decrease pattern we also found that the effect of potential evapotranspiration on drought increases with increasing drought severity fig 8 and fig 9 and these results cannot be found in previous studies using the conventional linear regression analysis further potential evapotranspiration is mainly dominated by temperature in most cases when drought occurred and temperature could explain 70 or more of the change of potential evapotranspiration in many cases the temperature is also higher in the period of severe drought fig s5 and the effect of temperature on drought decreased with the increase of soil moisture drought severity the increase in temperature further aggravates the increase of potential evapotranspiration promotes soil evapotranspiration and aggravates soil moisture drought miralles et al 2014 yin et al 2014 in other words the high temperature situation increases the potential evapotranspiration and the atmosphere needs more water from the soil to reach saturation further aggravating the soil moisture drought meanwhile the continuous reduction of soil moisture and limited water vapor available for evaporation have weakened land atmosphere interaction and water cycle processes the reduction of water vapor in the atmosphere inhibits precipitation further leading to a smaller contribution of precipitation this shows that in extreme drought situations soil moisture drought is mainly caused by the continuous increase of potential evapotranspiration due to the increase in temperature wang and yuan 2022 5 4 uncertain effect of precipitation on soil moisture drought the tcwv and divq s proportion of explained variation in precipitation varies with regions and seasons fig 7 and fig 8 since atmospheric evaporation in humid regions is greater than that in arid regions and the air atmosphere is more likely to saturate to form precipitation it is therefore expected that the proportion of explained variation in precipitation decreases from the humid to arid areas moreover in different seasons summer has the lowest variance explanation rate for precipitation compared with spring and autumn this is because the temperature is the highest in summer and the continued warm temperature makes it difficult for air to saturate and thus hard for precipitation to form lu et al 2011 the anomaly of precipitation is closely related to the dynamic evolution of water vapor structure guan et al 2019 kingston et al 2015 in this study the change in the impact of precipitation on ssi was regulated by tcwv and divq in section 5 3 we found that the effect of tcwv on soil moisture drought decreases with the aggravation of soil moisture drought but the effect of divq fluctuates which further leads to uncertainty in the effect of precipitation on soil moisture drought by quantifying the effects of divq and tcwv on precipitation fig s6 we found that the influence of divq gradually increases with the decrease of precipitation in different depths and regions during the dry period of soil moisture and the change of tcwv is uncertain which shows that the divq can explain the precipitation better than tcwv to some extent the definite effect of divq and the ambiguous effect of tcwv on precipitation further enlarge the uncertainty of the effect of precipitation on soil moisture drought 6 conclusions this study first identified soil moisture drought at different depths in china from 1950 to 2021 by using a three dimensional drought identification method and then established a path analysis model based on atmospheric water vapor change and water vapor circulation to investigate the synergistic effects of water supply and demand on soil moisture droughts at different depths and regions the primary conclusions are as follows 1 generally the distribution patterns of drought event severities at different depths were similar however with the increase of soil layer depth the number of drought events decreased and averaged drought duration increased 2 precipitation deficits due to the change of atmospheric movement dominated the interannual variation of soil moisture drought while increasing potential evapotranspiration due to the increased temperature less exacerbated drought independent of the climatic zone and soil depth 3 the impact of potential evapotranspiration to drought increased with the severity of drought the magnitude of the response of soil moisture drought to potential evapotranspiration was exacerbated by the deterioration of drought at high temperatures and was most pronounced during extreme drought 4 the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can explain more than 50 of the change of soil moisture drought among which the explanation proportion of precipitation is larger than that of the potential evapotranspiration the total explanation proportion decreased continuously with increasing soil depth and the response of shallow soil drought to changes in climate factors was greater than that of the deep drought 5 from the spatial perspective the climate effects on soil moisture drought in humid areas are more significant than that in arid areas at the temporal scale precipitation plays the dominant role in soil moisture drought at the spring and autumn while potential evapotranspiration dominates soil moisture drought in summer data availability statement data used in this

of applied geology national central university taoyuan 32001 taiwan graduate institute of applied geology national central university taoyuan 32001 taiwan the stress dependent permeability of low permeability sedimentary rocks has seized attention because of the growing need for fossil fuels geological carbon sequestration and radioactive waste disposal the kozeny carman equation k c equation is a well known model for predicting the permeability of sedimentary rocks the kozeny carman constant k c constant c kc in the k c equation accounts for the shape of the pores and the complexity of the pore conduit geometry in rocks the pore structure of rocks varies owing to compaction at different burial depths therefore the c kc is stress dependent a key parameter for understanding the stress dependent permeability of rocks however measuring the stress dependent c kc in low permeability rocks is challenging the present study proposes a novel approach for measuring the stress dependent c kc of low permeability rocks the key elements of the proposed approach are 1 utilizing the klinkenberg slip factor to evaluate the pore structure of rocks under stress and 2 measuring rock porosity and permeability simultaneously under stress this study amended the existing apparatus to fulfill the aforementioned purpose silty sandstone and clayey siltstone were selected to illustrate the novel c kc measurement method the measured c kc values were compatible with the measurement results of documented sandstones and mudstones most stress independent interestingly the c kc increased with increasing effective confining stress but started to decrease when the applied stress exceeded a certain critical value finally we provide a synthetic case demonstrating the importance of considering stress dependent c kc for permeability prediction under stress if we neglect the stress dependence of c kc the prediction of permeability using the k c equation can induce errors up to several orders of

for fossil fuels aydin 2015 has promoted the production of petroleum and natural shale gas from unconventional reservoirs soeder 2018 on the other hand geological carbon sequestration ccs is a promising approach to reducing anthropogenic co2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption rathnaweera et al 2015 the migration of injected co2 shielded by a low permeability sedimentary layer without leaking or endangering the environment should be secured e g yuncong et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 zhao and yu 2017 li et al 2022 the presence of a tight impermeable layer to prevent dose transportation is one of the most important criteria for the disposal of radioactive waste e g marschall et al 2005 accordingly the stress dependent permeability and porosity of low permeability sedimentary rocks have gained increasing attention e g raghavan and chin 2002 davies and davies 2001 however characterizing the permeability and porosity of unconventional reservoirs is challenging because of their complex micropore structures mineral compositions and tightness vafaie et al 2021 the influence of pore structure on the relationship between permeability and porosity in unconventional reservoirs is a critical issue to be solved e g okazaki et al 2014 vafaie et al 2021 the kozeny carman equation k c equation kozeny 1927 carman 1939 is a well known model for describing the relationships among permeability porosity and pore structure kozeny s hydraulic radius equation is the most frequently used form which considers the hydraulic radius r h and it can be formulated as follows scheidegger 1974 walsh and brace 1984 okazaki et al 2014 1 k ϕ c kc r h 2 where k m2 is the permeability ϕ is the porosity and c kc is the kozeny carman constant k c constant used to quantify the shape of the pores and the complex pore conduit geometry r h is the hydraulic radius which is defined as the ratio of the pore volume to the wetted area 2 r h v p s where v p m3 is the total pore volume and s m2 is the total surface area of the pores there are six premises scheidegger 1974 for using eq 2 including i no pores are sealed off ii the pores are distributed randomly iii the pores are reasonably uniform in size iv the porosity is not too high v diffusion slip phenomena are absent and vi fluid motion occurs as motion through a batch of capillaries equation 1 has been widely used for soils and clastic sedimentary rocks to assess permeability k e g de lima and niwas 2000 bernabé et al 2010 okazaki et al 2014 chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 teng et al 2021 yin et al 2022 this equation relates the permeability to the porosity and specific surface area to predict the permeability of porous media this convenient method does not solve the governing equations for complex geometries of porous media mostaghimi et al 2013 however this equation can induce errors in the permeability prediction because it does not sufficiently account for naturally complex tortuous and poorly connected pore spaces mostaghimi et al 2013 moreover the assumption that the kozeny carman constant c kc remains unchanged during consolidation can overestimate the permeability as the pore microstructure including porosity and hydraulic radius changes during deformation okazaki et al 2014 several previous studies simply assumed that the c kc is stress independent and few studies focused on the stress dependent c kc of soils or rocks singh and wallender 2008 conducted a pioneering study that states that the c kc of clays is stress dependent okazaki et al 2014 were the first to measure the stress dependent c kc of low permeability rocks in the laboratory wei et al 2018 suggested that the stress dependent c kc of rocks particularly in unconventional reservoirs is a critical variable for predicting the production of petroleum or natural gas in addition the stress dependent c kc is important for understanding the hydromechanical coupling behaviors of reservoirs therefore it is essential to develop a method to measure the stress dependent c kc of unconventional reservoirs such as clayey sandstones siltstones or shales is therefore essential the measurement of the k c constant c kc of sandy aggregations and sandstones under atmospheric pressure has been well documented fair et al 1933 suggested that the c kc of sandy grains has different shapes spherical 6 0 rounded 6 1 worst 6 4 sharp 7 0 and angular 7 7 loudon 1952 also proposed that the c kc equals to 6 6 and 8 4 for rounded and angular sands respectively mostaghimi et al 2013 and zakirov et al 2016 measured the c kc of sandstones using micro ct images for fontainebleau sandstone a pure clean sandstone composed of 100 quartz bourbie and zinszner 1985 the c kc range from 12 19 to 93 97 and the c kc of the berea sandstone composed of mainly well sorted and well rounded quartz and minor amounts of feldspar dolomite and clays churcher et al 1991 was 14 65 mostaghimi et al 2013 zakirov et al 2016 found the fine to medium grained sandstones ranged from 4 0 to 8 3 which are quite diverse due to the complex pore structures of the sandstones the pores of unconventional reservoirs e g clayey sandstones or argillaceous rocks usually range on the nanometer scale clarkson et al 2012 although micro ct is a powerful technique for investigating the microstructures of sedimentary rocks e g peng et al 2014 ferreira et al 2022 its resolution is currently on the order of several microns kong et al 2018 in addition the micro ct apparatus used to penetrate the triaxial cells in rock tests is expensive therefore micro ct is not a good solution for measuring the c kc of tight clastic sedimentary rocks under stress conditions alternatively okazaki et al 2014 measured the surface area of pore s of mudstones using a belsorp mini bel japan inc based on the gas absorption theory brunauer et al 1938 nakai et al 2005 togo and shimamoto 2012 combined with the measured pore volume under stress the hydraulic radius r h under stress can be determined using eq 2 therefore the stress dependent c kc of mudstones can be evaluated using eq 1 and the measured stress dependent permeability and porosity okazaki et al 2014 found that c kc of tested mudstones changed from 0 0115 to 6 09 whereas the effective confining stress σ eff increased from 3 mpa to 100 mpa it should be noted that the method proposed by okazaki et al 2014 assumes that the surface area of pore s is stress independent in addition the sample size for measuring a specific surface is small and the sample representativeness can be problematic if the particle size distribution of the rock sample is not homogeneous okazaki et al 2014 measured the permeability and porosity under stress using two different samples the value of c kc can be determined using eq 1 owing to possible heterogeneity between the two samples the k c constant c kc in eq 1 for low permeability rocks under stress and exploring the mechanisms influencing the stress dependent c kc remain challenging issues as previously mentioned one of the difficulties in determining c kc using eq 1 is measuring the stress dependent permeability k and porosity ϕ simultaneously using one single sample usually k and ϕ are measure separately using different samples subjected to stress e g dong et al 2010 okazaki et al 2014 if these two physical quantities are not measured simultaneously using one single sample the heterogeneity between the two samples could distort their relationship especially for the unconventional reservoirs e g cui et al 2010 sander et al 2017 and induce errors in the determined c kc although some apparatuses e g cms 300 can be used to measure the permeability k and porosity ϕ of unconventional reservoirs simultaneously using one single sample simultaneously e g metwally and sondergeld 2011 teklu et al 2017 these apparatuses are too expensive for most rock laboratories this study proposes a novel approach to conquer the aforementioned challenges in determining the stress dependent k c constant c kc of low permeability clastic sedimentary rocks using eq 1 the proposed approach has two key elements a use the relationship between the hydraulic radius r h and the klinkenberg slip factor b proposed by hooman et al 2014 to obtain r h measurement of s the pore surface area s under stress was not required b the porosity permeability measurement system yoko2 dong et al 2010 was modified following haskett et al 1988 the pulse decay and gas expansion methods were used to evaluate the permeability k and porosity ϕ simultaneously using one single sample accordingly the determined stress dependent c kc of low permeability clastic sedimentary rocks excludes the influence of sample heterogeneity compared to okazaki et al 2014 when k and ϕ are incorporated into eq 1 low permeability silty sandstone and clayey siltstone were selected to illustrate the novel c kc measurement method the test results of the stress dependent c kc were compared with those documented for sandstone and mudstone most were stress independent the stress dependence of c kc and the possible mechanisms dominating the variation trends are discussed in detail finally we provide a synthetic case demonstrating the significance of considering stress dependent c kc for predicting permeability under stress based on the k c equation 2 methodology this study proposes a novel approach for determining the stress dependent k c constant c kc based on eq 1 the c kc is a function of k ϕ and r h as follows 3 c kc ϕ k r h 2 the proposed novel approach comprises two parts a determining the stress dependent hydraulic radius r h using measured slip factor b under stresses b measuring the permeability k and porosity ϕ under different effective confining stress σ eff we modified the existing apparatus yoko2 to simultaneously measure permeability and porosity using one single sample the influence of sample heterogeneity on determining the c kc which is encountered when two different samples are used for measuring porosity and permeability separately as usually adopted in previous studies can be removed 2 1 determination of hydraulic radius r h from slip factor b klinkenberg correction the klinkenberg gas slippage effect klinkenberg 1941 accounts for the overestimated permeability of rocks especially for low permeability rocks such as unconventional reservoirs using gas as the flow median k g instead of liquid k the slip factor b is a parameter used to quantify the klinkenberg effect e g tanikawa and shimamoto 2009 this depends on the pore structure e g pore diameter and pore geometry the hydraulic radius r h is considered a characteristic length for hydraulics in porous media which is also related to the pore structures based on a theoretical model describing the gas slip flow through a hexagonal prism hooman et al 2014 proposed the following relationship between the slip factor b and hydraulic radius r h which must occur through a porous medium 4 r h 3 95 b κ t 4 2 π r 2 where r m is molecular radius of gas κ jk 1 is boltzmann s constant t k is temperature in this study helium was used for permeability and porosity measurements and r 0 13 nm κ 1 38 10 23 jk 1 t 300 k the klinkenberg correction uses the relationship between k g gas permeability and k liquid or intrinsic permeability as follows klinkenberg 1941 5 k g k 1 b p p where p p pa is the pore pressure and b pa is the klinkenberg slip factor the klinkenberg slip factor b and permeability k can be computed using linear regression with plots of k g y axis and 1 p p x axis 2 2 the stress dependent permeability k and porosity ϕ power law many empirical laws have been used to describe the stress dependent porosity and permeability of sedimentary rocks such as exponential laws athy 1930 david et al 1994 and power laws shi and wang 1986 dong et al 2010 su et al 2022 this study adopted the power law to depict the stress dependent porosity and permeability as follows 6 ϕ ϕ 0 σ eff σ 0 q 7 k k 0 σ eff σ 0 p where σ eff pa is the effective confining stress σ 0 pa is a reference effective stress we assume its value equals to 0 1 mpa ϕ 0 and k 0 is initial porosity and permeability under σ 0 q and p are stress sensitivity exponents of porosity and permeability respectively 2 3 measurement of the permeability k and porosity ϕ simultaneously using one single sample the pulse decay method is suitable for unconventional reservoirs to measure stress dependent permeability brace et al 1968 hsieh et al 1981 following hsieh et al 1981 haskett et al 1988 used the pulse decay method associated with the gas expansion method to simultaneously measure permeability and porosity using one sample under stress the methods described by haskett et al 1988 were followed fig 1 a and b illustrate the concept of simultaneously measuring rock permeability and porosity using the pulse decay and gas expansion methods via a closed system haskett et al 1988 the rock sample dotted part in fig 1a with a pore volume v p connected to two empty reservoirs the volumes of the upstream and downstream reservoirs are v u and v d respectively before the test the pressure within the system p at equal to atmospheric pressure 0 1 mpa the initial pulse gas pressure p u t 0 in the upstream reservoirs is given and this given pressure p u decays with time see fig 1b with increasing time to t f the balanced pressure p f was reached see fig 1b the decay curve can be used to determine rock permeability using pulse decay method hsieh et al 1981 haskett et al 1988 the value of the balanced pressure p f can help determine rock porosity based on boyle s law gas expansion method e g haskett et al 1988 dong et al 2010 2 3 1 the pulse decay method for measuring permeability k hsieh et al 1981 first proposed the general analytical solution of the pressure decay method the time dependent pressure decay p u in the upstream reservoir follows eq 8 8 p u p u t 0 p at 1 1 β γ 2 m 1 β γ 2 ψ m 2 β e ψ m 2 γ 2 ψ m 4 β 2 γ 2 β γ 2 γ β ψ m 2 β β 2 β γ β where 9 tan ψ 1 γ ψ γ ψ 2 β β 10 k g t μ g c w l 2 ϕ 11 β v p v u and 12 γ v d v u the p at pa is the initial system pressure 0 1 mpa μ g pa s is the viscosity of pore fluid c w pa 1 is the volume compressibility of pore fluid k g m2 is gas permeability t s is the time and l m is the length of the sample the gas permeability k g can be calibrated via the recorded data of the time dependent p u pulse decay using eq 8 it should be noted that determining the gas permeability required porosity ϕ eq 10 based on fig 1b the porosity ϕ could be determined when the system reached balance the only unknown factor is gas permeability k g in eq 10 using several values of t at different match points on the experimental decay curve an arbitrary k g is first assumed to determine the in eq 10 then take this into eq 8 to compare the recorded time dependent p u and simulated time dependent p u a history matching routine method haskett et al 1988 ning et al 1993 and the well known bisection method matlab were used to determine the best fit of k g for various parameters this process was repeated several times to compare the measured pressure decay curve and the analytical solution with a given k g until the best fit k g was obtained 2 3 2 the gas expansion method for measuring porosity ϕ before the test the pressure within the system p at equal to atmospheric pressure 0 1 mpa after providing a pulse pressure in the upstream volume v u the upstream pressure decreased from p u t 0 to p f balanced gas pressure see fig 1b whereas the pressure within the pore volume v p and downstream volume v d increased from p at to p f the relationship between gas pressure and reservoir volume follows boyle s law 13 p u t 0 v u p at v p v d p f v u v p v d there is only one unknown value v p in eq 13 the porosity ϕ can thus be determined using pore volume v p divided by the sample volume 3 apparatus and samples initially the yoko2 system dong et al 2010 nguyen et al 2022 was used to measure permeability via the steady state flow method under an open system however the gas expansion method adopted for porosity measurements requires a closed system in this study we modified a permeability measurement system into a closed system and used a pulse decay method a spacer with an extra volume on the downstream side was added the modified yoko2 can measure permeability and porosity simultaneously using one sample under stress the confining stress ranged from 3 to 80 mpa and the pore pressure was generally lower than 1 mpa the samples used for study were obtained from the pleistocene cholan formation that outcropped at the hushan dam yunlin county taiwan site prior to water pounding in 2016 the cholan formation belongs to the western foothill geological province of taiwan and consists of a series of upward coarsening successions of sediments each succession is characterized by claystone at its base graded upward into siltstone and very thick sandstone beds at its top lin et al 2007 based on the sedimentary structures and fragment composition the cholan formation can be interpreted as having been deposited in a deltaic environment song et al 2007 3 1 modify yoko2 system to measure permeability porosity simultaneously in a close system fig 2 a illustrates the sample assembly of modified yoko2 the tests were performed using an intravessel oil pressure apparatus at room temperature a pressure generator with an oil apparatus was used to enhance the confining pressure the samples were jacketed in two shrinkable polyolefin tubes with a thickness of 1 mm fig 2b shows a schematic of modified yoko2 the volume of the dashed red line v s between valves 1 and 2 is 4 25 ml the dashed red line was also connected to a pressure gauge to record the time dependent pressure the volume of the dashed blue line v l between valve 2 and the upper end of the sample is 0 845 ml the v l is the inner volume of the piston element 1 and porous spacer element 4 as shown in fig 2a the v u in fig 1a equals to v s v l the v d in fig 1a is equal to the volume of the porous gasket beneath the lower end of the sample denoted as v g with a value of 0 162 ml the pore volume of the sample is denoted as v p the same as that in fig 1a the details of the confining and pore pressure systems of yoko2 can be found in dong et al 2010 details of the modified yoko2 system incorporating the pulse decay and gas expansion methods in a closed system can be found in nguyen et al 2023 the permeability hydraulic aperture measurement of the modified yoko2 system was validated using the steady state method nguyen et al 2023 because the porosity measurement method used by the modified yoko2 was identical to that used by the original yoko2 gas expansion method no extra validation was required 3 1 1 determining the permeability using pulse decay method before the pulse decay test the pressure within the whole system v s v l v p and v g is p at 0 1 mpa we added pressure p u 0 always lower than 1 mpa through valve 1 into v s red dashed line in fig 2 by closing valve 2 and then closing valve 1 the experiment started from the opening of valve 2 at time t 0 the pressure in v s dropped suddenly from p u 0 to p u t 0 when valve 2 opened and v l and v s were connected the p u t 0 can be expressed as jones 1997 14 p u t 0 p u 0 v s p at v l v s v l the volume of the upper reservoir v u in fig 1a is equal to the total volume of the red and blue dashed lines v s v l in our yoko2 system the gasket volume v g can be represented as the downstream reservoir v d in fig 1a the general analytical solutions to eq 8 can be used to determine gas permeability k g helium was used as the pore fluid in this study the viscosity of helium μ g in eq 10 is 1 96 10 5 pa s the volume compressibility c w in eq 10 is the reciprocal of the balanced pressure 1 p f for an ideal gas at constant temperature 3 1 2 determining the porosity using gas expansion method after the pressure pulse decayed to a balanced pressure p f the gas expansion method eq 14 can be used to determine the pore volume v p for the modified yoko2 system eq 14 is modified as follows 15 p u 0 v s p at v l v p v g p f v s v l v p v g the porosity ϕ can thus be determined using pore volume v p divided by the sample volume the definitions of v s v l v p v g please refer to fig 2 in this study we offered three different pressure pulses to measure gas permeability k g and three different balanced pressures p f were obtained under a constant confining stress three points of gas permeability were used for the klinkenberg correction to calibrate permeability k and slip factor b the mean value of the three balanced pressures was used to represent the pore pressure p p in eq 5 the effective confining stress σ eff is defined as the difference between the confining stress and mean value of the balanced pressure it should be noted that the effective confining stress varied across the sample similar to the porosity as there was a pressure gradient the mean value of the balanced pressure is an approximation and its influence is minimized given the small sample size another issue is the assumption that the effective stress coefficient equals one which is not necessarily true for clayey sandstones tai and dong 2022 but this issue is beyond the scope of this study the results of the gas permeability measurements are provided in supplementary file a 3 2 samples silty sandstone and clayey siltstone used for determining c k c two late pliocene to early pleistocene clastic sedimentary rock samples cholan formation s1 and s2 were used to measure the k c constant c kc figs 3 and 4 show images of the two samples the diameter and height of the two samples were 25 and 20 mm respectively the samples were from a thrust and fold belt western foothill province central taiwan indicating that they underwent significant erosion according to wu and dong 2012 the eroded effective stresses of rocks in similar geological settings range between 30 61 and 64 91 mpa this indicated that the samples from the outcrops were highly over consolidated a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls13320 was used to determine the grain size distribution of the two samples fig 5 shows the results of particle size analysis table 1 lists the sand silt and clay proportions of the two tested samples according to the classification method proposed by picard 1971 s1 is silty sandstone and s2 is clayey siltstone 4 results 4 1 the effective confining stress dependent porosity ϕ fig 6 reveals the effective confining stress σ eff dependency of porosity for s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone when σ eff was 4 86 mpa and the porosity of the silty sandstone red circles was 19 39 with the increasing σ eff up to 79 68 mpa the mean porosity of silty sandstone decreased from 19 39 to 15 61 the porosity of clayey siltstone blue squares ranged from 10 37 to 7 40 while the σ eff changed from 2 61 mpa to 59 62 mpa the data points shown in fig 6 are used to calibrate the parameters in eq 6 for s1 silty sandstone the initial porosity was 0 269 and its q 0 080 for s2 clayey siltstone the initial porosity was 0 155 and its q 0 111 it is worth noting that elastoplastic behavior is commonly observed in fine grained sedimentary rocks and the stress history influences porosity wu and dong 2012 because the thick pleistocene formation was eroded where the outcrop samples originated the measured porosity and permeability of the highly over consolidated samples could mainly be elastic 4 2 the effective confining stress dependent slip factor b and hydraulic radius r h fig 7 a shows the klinkenberg correction for s1 silty sandstone the y axis represents the gas permeability k g measured under three different balanced pressures p f the x axis represents the reciprocal of the three balanced pressures 1 p f based on eq 5 we can calibrate the gas permeability k g and slip factor b for s1 under 10 mpa of confining stress the permeability k is 3 92 10 15 m2 the intercept of the dashed red line and the klinkenberg slip factor b 0 107 mpa using the slope of the dashed red line divided by the permeability k fig 7b illustrates the klinkenberg correction for s2 clayey siltstone when the confining stress equals to 20 mpa the permeability is 2 71 10 16 m2 and the klinkenberg slip factor b 0 208 mpa all results of klinkenberg corrections for the two samples under all stress conditions are shown in supplementary file b only good quality data were used linear regression results with determination coefficient r 2 0 83 supplementary file b to further analyze the effective stress dependent b two additional data points were excluded from further analysis of the abnormally high slip factor b b 1 49 mpa under 5 mpa and negative permeability under 15 mpa of confining stress for s2 fig 8 shows the effective confining stress σ eff dependence of the slip factor b for s1 and s2 red circles denote the results for s1 silty sandstone and blue squares denote the results for s2 clayey siltstone the slip factor b of silty sandstone s1 is smaller than that of clayey siltstone s2 which is reasonable because the pore size of s1 is larger than that of s2 and the slip effect is less significant generally the b increased with increasing confining stress although some scatter was observed to evaluate the stress dependent hydraulic radius r h and k c constant c kc we used an exponential model to fit the experimental data on a semi log scale the stress dependent exponential model of the slip factor can be expressed as 16 ln b ξ σ eff c the calibrated ξ and c of s1 are 0 0063 and 2 5445 respectively the ones for s2 are 0 0161 and 1 6785 respectively fig 9 presents the stress dependent hydraulic radius r h calculated using eq 4 which is associated with the stress dependent model of the slip factor b eq 16 for s1 silty sandstone the hydraulic radius r h decreased from 0 69 μ m to 0 42 μ m when σ eff increased from 0 1 mpa to 80 mpa for s2 clayey siltstone the hydraulic radius r h changed from 0 29 μ m to 0 11 μ m during the σ eff ranged from 0 1 mpa to 60 mpa the decreasing trend of r h with increasing confining stress was due to the increasing trend of b with increasing confining stress as expected the hydraulic radius r h of the silty sandstone s1 was larger than that of the clayey siltstone s2 a stronger stress dependency of r h was observed for the clayey siltstone s2 which was due to the stronger stress dependency of the slip factor b 4 3 the effective confining stress dependent permeability k fig 10 shows the effective confining stress dependent permeabilities of s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone all data points red circles for s1 and blue squares for s2 were obtained after klinkenberg correction the permeabilities of both samples decreased with increasing σ eff as expected the stress sensitivity of the permeability for clayey siltstone s2 was stronger than that of silty sandstone s1 for s1 silty sandstone permeability ranges from 5 66 10 15 m2 to 1 52 10 15 m2 when the σ eff changes from 4 86 mpa to 79 68 mpa for s2 clayey siltstone permeability was changed from 3 74 10 16 m2 to 5 00 10 17 m2 when the σ eff increased from 9 63 mpa to 59 62 mpa the results of σ eff dependent permeability k for each sample under all stress conditions were included in supplementary file a the data points shown in fig 10 were used to calibrate the parameters in eq 7 for s1 silty sandstone the initial permeability k 0 3 66 10 14 m2 and p 0 465 for s2 clayey siltstone the initial permeability k 0 7 46 10 14 m2 and p 1 110 4 4 the determined effective confining stress dependent k c constant c k c fig 11 shows stress dependent k c constant c kc model calculated from porosity ϕ fig 6 hydraulic radius r h fig 9 permeability k fig 10 and eq 1 the red and blue curves represent the s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone models respectively the c kc of s1 ranged from approximately 3 53 to 21 77 under the effective confining stress σ eff for s2 the c kc ranged from 0 18 to 20 08 it is interesting to note that c kc first increased with increasing σ eff but started to decline when σ eff went beyond certain values the critical σ eff was approximately 30 mpa 5 discussions 5 1 comparison of determined stress dependent c k c with previous documented ones the previously documented stress independent dependent c kc values for sandstone and mudrock were compared with our stress dependent c kc models the red and blue curves in fig 12 show the stress dependent c kc models of s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone respectively the c kc value of s1 ranged from 3 53 to 21 77 the data for the stress independent c kc of sandstones measured under atmospheric pressure are denoted by the horizontal dashed straight lines in fig 12 the dashed blue lines denote the c kc of the fontainebleau sandstone measured by mostaghimi et al 2013 a pure clean sandstone composed of 100 quartz bourbie and zinszner 1985 the values ranged from 12 19 to 93 97 the dashed green line denotes the c kc of the berea sandstone composed of well sorted and well rounded quartz with minor amounts of feldspar dolomite and clays churcher et al 1991 measured by mostaghimi et al 2013 its value was 14 65 the dashed black lines denote fine to medium grained sandstone as measured by zakirov et al 2016 its values ranged from 4 0 to 8 3 according to fig 12 the measured c kc of s1 silty sandstone was consistent with the measurement results of previous studies the c kc value of s2 ranged from 0 18 to 20 08 the data for the stress dependent c kc of mudstones measured by okazaki et al 2014 are denoted by the dashed gray straight lines in fig 12 the c kc for mudstones ranged from 0 18 to 0 0148 under low σ eff and the c kc would increase up to 2 01 and 6 09 with increasing σ eff respectively okazaki et al 2014 found the c kc of mudstones would rise suddenly when the σ eff reached beyond a critical value 5 2 the role of r h 2 square hydraulic radius and ϕ k on stress dependent k c constant c k c according to eq 3 the k c constant c kc is the product of r h 2 the square hydraulic radius and ϕ k porosity divided by permeability fig 13 a and 13b illustrates the stress dependent c kc r h 2 and ϕ k in fig 13a the dotted and dashed red curves denote the stress dependent r h 2 and ϕ k of s1 in fig 13b the dotted and dashed blue curves represent the stress dependent r h 2 and ϕ k of s2 respectively for s1 silty sandstone in fig 13a the r h 2 dotted red curve reduced about 40 from 0 69 to 0 42 μ m 2 when effective confining stress σ eff increased from 0 1 to 80 mpa the ϕ k dashed red curve increased more than on order of magnitude from 7 35 to 96 37 μ m 2 for s2 clayey siltstone in fig 13b the r h 2 dotted blue curve reduced about 60 from 0 29 to 0 11 μ m 2 when σ eff increased from 0 1 mpa to 60 mpa the ϕ k dashed blue curve increased more the 500 times from 2 08 to 1 238 70 μ m 2 according to the trend of stress dependent k c constant c kc in fig 13 we can find that the stress dependent c kc of two samples are mainly dominated by ϕ k however the influence of r h 2 gradually becomes significant with increasing σ eff particularly for s2 clayey siltstone it is interesting to find that the c kc of samples s1 and s2 starts to decrease when the σ eff turns beyond 30 mpa which the increase rate of ϕ k with σ eff start to reduce than the decrease rate of r h 2 the influence of r h 2 and ϕ k on stress dependent k c constant c kc is obviously and the stress dependent conduits shape and tortuosity walsh 1981 walsh and brace 1984 wentong et al 2018 should play a key role how the conduit shape and tortuosity vary with stress could be critical in understanding the mechanisms of c kc stress dependency and deserves in depth study in the future 5 3 the permeability prediction error due to neglect the stress dependent c k c we evaluated the influence of neglecting the stress dependent c kc on permeability prediction using a synthetic case of clayey siltstone according to fig 11 the c kc of the clayey siltstone ranged from 0 18 to 15 27 when the effective confining stress σ eff increased from 0 1 to 60 mpa fig 14 illustrates the prediction of permeability red curve using the determined stress dependent porosity dashed blue curve in fig 6 stress dependent hydraulic radius r h blue curve in fig 9 and stress dependent c kc blue curve in fig 11 if we assume a constant c kc of 0 18 5 00 and 15 27 the predicted c kc values are illustrated as the blue black and green curves in fig 14 if the stress dependency of c kc is neglected the prediction error of the stress dependent permeability will be significant we argue that some of the documented results showing that the k c equation is invalid for the permeability prediction of unconventional reservoirs e g carrier 2003 xu and yu 2008 wu et al 2022 could simply be due to overlooking the stress dependency of c kc 5 4 prospects and limitations of the proposed method the most important advantage of the proposed method is its ability to measure c kc under stress the pore structures of permeable media can be easily determined without much difficulties using micro ct under stress and the stress dependent c kc can be evaluated directly using eq 3 however it is expensive and difficult to measure the microstructures of tight rocks using micro ct in other words the proposed method is superior to any existing method for determining c kc of unconventional reservoirs another prospect of the proposed method is to explore the stress history effect on c kc although we did not illustrate this feature in our results eqs 6 and 7 can be readily expanded to consider normally consolidated and overconsolidated sedimentary rocks dong et al 2010 and the stress history dependent c kc can be potentially determined however the proposed method had some limitations this method is suitable for medium to low permeability rocks because of the difficulties in determining the permeability of permeable rocks using the pulse decade method meanwhile because the klinkenberg slip factor b is used to determine the hydraulic radius r h a gas medium should be used as the flow fluid for permeability and porosity measurements 6 conclusions this study proposes a novel method for determining the stress dependent k c constant c kc of rocks from unconventional reservoirs this novel method consists of two parts a evaluating the stress hydraulic radius r h using the klinkenberg slip factor b measured under confining stresses b determining the ϕ k using simultaneously measured porosity and permeability under confining stresses we modified the existing apparatus yoko2 to simultaneously measure porosity and permeability under confining stresses the proposed novel method is superior to existing approaches in several aspects a the stress dependent c kc can be measured without much difficulty b it is applicable to unconventional reservoirs that encounter fine grained low permeability rocks c the step for specific surface measurements is skipped and d the influence of sample heterogeneity can be minimized for demonstration the stress dependent c kc values of silty sandstone and clayey siltstone under confining stress were determined the k c constant c kc of s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone ranged from 3 53 to 21 77 and from 0 18 to 20 08 under confining stress the results of the determinations of the c kc are compatible with the measurement results of documented sandstones and mudstones although most of the previously documented c kc is stress independent based on our experimental results we found that the c kc values of s1 and s2 increased with increasing σ eff but the rate of increase decreased when s2 was subjected to a certain critical σ eff the measured c kc began to decrease we speculate that the pore shape and tortuosity account for the observed trend of the stress dependent c kc and the mechanisms require further study finally the stress dependence of c kc is critical for predicting the permeability of unconventional reservoirs if we assume c kc is constant the prediction error of the stress dependent permeability using the k c equation is significant we argue that some of the documented results that show that the k c equation is invalid for the permeability prediction of unconventional reservoirs could simply be due to overlooking the stress dependence of c kc credit authorship contribution statement pin lun tai conceptualization methodology

of applied geology national central university taoyuan 32001 taiwan graduate institute of applied geology national central university taoyuan 32001 taiwan the stress dependent permeability of low permeability sedimentary rocks has seized attention because of the growing need for fossil fuels geological carbon sequestration and radioactive waste disposal the kozeny carman equation k c equation is a well known model for predicting the permeability of sedimentary rocks the kozeny carman constant k c constant c kc in the k c equation accounts for the shape of the pores and the complexity of the pore conduit geometry in rocks the pore structure of rocks varies owing to compaction at different burial depths therefore the c kc is stress dependent a key parameter for understanding the stress dependent permeability of rocks however measuring the stress dependent c kc in low permeability rocks is challenging the present study proposes a novel approach for measuring the stress dependent c kc of low permeability rocks the key elements of the proposed approach are 1 utilizing the klinkenberg slip factor to evaluate the pore structure of rocks under stress and 2 measuring rock porosity and permeability simultaneously under stress this study amended the existing apparatus to fulfill the aforementioned purpose silty sandstone and clayey siltstone were selected to illustrate the novel c kc measurement method the measured c kc values were compatible with the measurement results of documented sandstones and mudstones most stress independent interestingly the c kc increased with increasing effective confining stress but started to decrease when the applied stress exceeded a certain critical value finally we provide a synthetic case demonstrating the importance of considering stress dependent c kc for permeability prediction under stress if we neglect the stress dependence of c kc the prediction of permeability using the k c equation can induce errors up to several orders of

for fossil fuels aydin 2015 has promoted the production of petroleum and natural shale gas from unconventional reservoirs soeder 2018 on the other hand geological carbon sequestration ccs is a promising approach to reducing anthropogenic co2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption rathnaweera et al 2015 the migration of injected co2 shielded by a low permeability sedimentary layer without leaking or endangering the environment should be secured e g yuncong et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 zhao and yu 2017 li et al 2022 the presence of a tight impermeable layer to prevent dose transportation is one of the most important criteria for the disposal of radioactive waste e g marschall et al 2005 accordingly the stress dependent permeability and porosity of low permeability sedimentary rocks have gained increasing attention e g raghavan and chin 2002 davies and davies 2001 however characterizing the permeability and porosity of unconventional reservoirs is challenging because of their complex micropore structures mineral compositions and tightness vafaie et al 2021 the influence of pore structure on the relationship between permeability and porosity in unconventional reservoirs is a critical issue to be solved e g okazaki et al 2014 vafaie et al 2021 the kozeny carman equation k c equation kozeny 1927 carman 1939 is a well known model for describing the relationships among permeability porosity and pore structure kozeny s hydraulic radius equation is the most frequently used form which considers the hydraulic radius r h and it can be formulated as follows scheidegger 1974 walsh and brace 1984 okazaki et al 2014 1 k ϕ c kc r h 2 where k m2 is the permeability ϕ is the porosity and c kc is the kozeny carman constant k c constant used to quantify the shape of the pores and the complex pore conduit geometry r h is the hydraulic radius which is defined as the ratio of the pore volume to the wetted area 2 r h v p s where v p m3 is the total pore volume and s m2 is the total surface area of the pores there are six premises scheidegger 1974 for using eq 2 including i no pores are sealed off ii the pores are distributed randomly iii the pores are reasonably uniform in size iv the porosity is not too high v diffusion slip phenomena are absent and vi fluid motion occurs as motion through a batch of capillaries equation 1 has been widely used for soils and clastic sedimentary rocks to assess permeability k e g de lima and niwas 2000 bernabé et al 2010 okazaki et al 2014 chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 teng et al 2021 yin et al 2022 this equation relates the permeability to the porosity and specific surface area to predict the permeability of porous media this convenient method does not solve the governing equations for complex geometries of porous media mostaghimi et al 2013 however this equation can induce errors in the permeability prediction because it does not sufficiently account for naturally complex tortuous and poorly connected pore spaces mostaghimi et al 2013 moreover the assumption that the kozeny carman constant c kc remains unchanged during consolidation can overestimate the permeability as the pore microstructure including porosity and hydraulic radius changes during deformation okazaki et al 2014 several previous studies simply assumed that the c kc is stress independent and few studies focused on the stress dependent c kc of soils or rocks singh and wallender 2008 conducted a pioneering study that states that the c kc of clays is stress dependent okazaki et al 2014 were the first to measure the stress dependent c kc of low permeability rocks in the laboratory wei et al 2018 suggested that the stress dependent c kc of rocks particularly in unconventional reservoirs is a critical variable for predicting the production of petroleum or natural gas in addition the stress dependent c kc is important for understanding the hydromechanical coupling behaviors of reservoirs therefore it is essential to develop a method to measure the stress dependent c kc of unconventional reservoirs such as clayey sandstones siltstones or shales is therefore essential the measurement of the k c constant c kc of sandy aggregations and sandstones under atmospheric pressure has been well documented fair et al 1933 suggested that the c kc of sandy grains has different shapes spherical 6 0 rounded 6 1 worst 6 4 sharp 7 0 and angular 7 7 loudon 1952 also proposed that the c kc equals to 6 6 and 8 4 for rounded and angular sands respectively mostaghimi et al 2013 and zakirov et al 2016 measured the c kc of sandstones using micro ct images for fontainebleau sandstone a pure clean sandstone composed of 100 quartz bourbie and zinszner 1985 the c kc range from 12 19 to 93 97 and the c kc of the berea sandstone composed of mainly well sorted and well rounded quartz and minor amounts of feldspar dolomite and clays churcher et al 1991 was 14 65 mostaghimi et al 2013 zakirov et al 2016 found the fine to medium grained sandstones ranged from 4 0 to 8 3 which are quite diverse due to the complex pore structures of the sandstones the pores of unconventional reservoirs e g clayey sandstones or argillaceous rocks usually range on the nanometer scale clarkson et al 2012 although micro ct is a powerful technique for investigating the microstructures of sedimentary rocks e g peng et al 2014 ferreira et al 2022 its resolution is currently on the order of several microns kong et al 2018 in addition the micro ct apparatus used to penetrate the triaxial cells in rock tests is expensive therefore micro ct is not a good solution for measuring the c kc of tight clastic sedimentary rocks under stress conditions alternatively okazaki et al 2014 measured the surface area of pore s of mudstones using a belsorp mini bel japan inc based on the gas absorption theory brunauer et al 1938 nakai et al 2005 togo and shimamoto 2012 combined with the measured pore volume under stress the hydraulic radius r h under stress can be determined using eq 2 therefore the stress dependent c kc of mudstones can be evaluated using eq 1 and the measured stress dependent permeability and porosity okazaki et al 2014 found that c kc of tested mudstones changed from 0 0115 to 6 09 whereas the effective confining stress σ eff increased from 3 mpa to 100 mpa it should be noted that the method proposed by okazaki et al 2014 assumes that the surface area of pore s is stress independent in addition the sample size for measuring a specific surface is small and the sample representativeness can be problematic if the particle size distribution of the rock sample is not homogeneous okazaki et al 2014 measured the permeability and porosity under stress using two different samples the value of c kc can be determined using eq 1 owing to possible heterogeneity between the two samples the k c constant c kc in eq 1 for low permeability rocks under stress and exploring the mechanisms influencing the stress dependent c kc remain challenging issues as previously mentioned one of the difficulties in determining c kc using eq 1 is measuring the stress dependent permeability k and porosity ϕ simultaneously using one single sample usually k and ϕ are measure separately using different samples subjected to stress e g dong et al 2010 okazaki et al 2014 if these two physical quantities are not measured simultaneously using one single sample the heterogeneity between the two samples could distort their relationship especially for the unconventional reservoirs e g cui et al 2010 sander et al 2017 and induce errors in the determined c kc although some apparatuses e g cms 300 can be used to measure the permeability k and porosity ϕ of unconventional reservoirs simultaneously using one single sample simultaneously e g metwally and sondergeld 2011 teklu et al 2017 these apparatuses are too expensive for most rock laboratories this study proposes a novel approach to conquer the aforementioned challenges in determining the stress dependent k c constant c kc of low permeability clastic sedimentary rocks using eq 1 the proposed approach has two key elements a use the relationship between the hydraulic radius r h and the klinkenberg slip factor b proposed by hooman et al 2014 to obtain r h measurement of s the pore surface area s under stress was not required b the porosity permeability measurement system yoko2 dong et al 2010 was modified following haskett et al 1988 the pulse decay and gas expansion methods were used to evaluate the permeability k and porosity ϕ simultaneously using one single sample accordingly the determined stress dependent c kc of low permeability clastic sedimentary rocks excludes the influence of sample heterogeneity compared to okazaki et al 2014 when k and ϕ are incorporated into eq 1 low permeability silty sandstone and clayey siltstone were selected to illustrate the novel c kc measurement method the test results of the stress dependent c kc were compared with those documented for sandstone and mudstone most were stress independent the stress dependence of c kc and the possible mechanisms dominating the variation trends are discussed in detail finally we provide a synthetic case demonstrating the significance of considering stress dependent c kc for predicting permeability under stress based on the k c equation 2 methodology this study proposes a novel approach for determining the stress dependent k c constant c kc based on eq 1 the c kc is a function of k ϕ and r h as follows 3 c kc ϕ k r h 2 the proposed novel approach comprises two parts a determining the stress dependent hydraulic radius r h using measured slip factor b under stresses b measuring the permeability k and porosity ϕ under different effective confining stress σ eff we modified the existing apparatus yoko2 to simultaneously measure permeability and porosity using one single sample the influence of sample heterogeneity on determining the c kc which is encountered when two different samples are used for measuring porosity and permeability separately as usually adopted in previous studies can be removed 2 1 determination of hydraulic radius r h from slip factor b klinkenberg correction the klinkenberg gas slippage effect klinkenberg 1941 accounts for the overestimated permeability of rocks especially for low permeability rocks such as unconventional reservoirs using gas as the flow median k g instead of liquid k the slip factor b is a parameter used to quantify the klinkenberg effect e g tanikawa and shimamoto 2009 this depends on the pore structure e g pore diameter and pore geometry the hydraulic radius r h is considered a characteristic length for hydraulics in porous media which is also related to the pore structures based on a theoretical model describing the gas slip flow through a hexagonal prism hooman et al 2014 proposed the following relationship between the slip factor b and hydraulic radius r h which must occur through a porous medium 4 r h 3 95 b κ t 4 2 π r 2 where r m is molecular radius of gas κ jk 1 is boltzmann s constant t k is temperature in this study helium was used for permeability and porosity measurements and r 0 13 nm κ 1 38 10 23 jk 1 t 300 k the klinkenberg correction uses the relationship between k g gas permeability and k liquid or intrinsic permeability as follows klinkenberg 1941 5 k g k 1 b p p where p p pa is the pore pressure and b pa is the klinkenberg slip factor the klinkenberg slip factor b and permeability k can be computed using linear regression with plots of k g y axis and 1 p p x axis 2 2 the stress dependent permeability k and porosity ϕ power law many empirical laws have been used to describe the stress dependent porosity and permeability of sedimentary rocks such as exponential laws athy 1930 david et al 1994 and power laws shi and wang 1986 dong et al 2010 su et al 2022 this study adopted the power law to depict the stress dependent porosity and permeability as follows 6 ϕ ϕ 0 σ eff σ 0 q 7 k k 0 σ eff σ 0 p where σ eff pa is the effective confining stress σ 0 pa is a reference effective stress we assume its value equals to 0 1 mpa ϕ 0 and k 0 is initial porosity and permeability under σ 0 q and p are stress sensitivity exponents of porosity and permeability respectively 2 3 measurement of the permeability k and porosity ϕ simultaneously using one single sample the pulse decay method is suitable for unconventional reservoirs to measure stress dependent permeability brace et al 1968 hsieh et al 1981 following hsieh et al 1981 haskett et al 1988 used the pulse decay method associated with the gas expansion method to simultaneously measure permeability and porosity using one sample under stress the methods described by haskett et al 1988 were followed fig 1 a and b illustrate the concept of simultaneously measuring rock permeability and porosity using the pulse decay and gas expansion methods via a closed system haskett et al 1988 the rock sample dotted part in fig 1a with a pore volume v p connected to two empty reservoirs the volumes of the upstream and downstream reservoirs are v u and v d respectively before the test the pressure within the system p at equal to atmospheric pressure 0 1 mpa the initial pulse gas pressure p u t 0 in the upstream reservoirs is given and this given pressure p u decays with time see fig 1b with increasing time to t f the balanced pressure p f was reached see fig 1b the decay curve can be used to determine rock permeability using pulse decay method hsieh et al 1981 haskett et al 1988 the value of the balanced pressure p f can help determine rock porosity based on boyle s law gas expansion method e g haskett et al 1988 dong et al 2010 2 3 1 the pulse decay method for measuring permeability k hsieh et al 1981 first proposed the general analytical solution of the pressure decay method the time dependent pressure decay p u in the upstream reservoir follows eq 8 8 p u p u t 0 p at 1 1 β γ 2 m 1 β γ 2 ψ m 2 β e ψ m 2 γ 2 ψ m 4 β 2 γ 2 β γ 2 γ β ψ m 2 β β 2 β γ β where 9 tan ψ 1 γ ψ γ ψ 2 β β 10 k g t μ g c w l 2 ϕ 11 β v p v u and 12 γ v d v u the p at pa is the initial system pressure 0 1 mpa μ g pa s is the viscosity of pore fluid c w pa 1 is the volume compressibility of pore fluid k g m2 is gas permeability t s is the time and l m is the length of the sample the gas permeability k g can be calibrated via the recorded data of the time dependent p u pulse decay using eq 8 it should be noted that determining the gas permeability required porosity ϕ eq 10 based on fig 1b the porosity ϕ could be determined when the system reached balance the only unknown factor is gas permeability k g in eq 10 using several values of t at different match points on the experimental decay curve an arbitrary k g is first assumed to determine the in eq 10 then take this into eq 8 to compare the recorded time dependent p u and simulated time dependent p u a history matching routine method haskett et al 1988 ning et al 1993 and the well known bisection method matlab were used to determine the best fit of k g for various parameters this process was repeated several times to compare the measured pressure decay curve and the analytical solution with a given k g until the best fit k g was obtained 2 3 2 the gas expansion method for measuring porosity ϕ before the test the pressure within the system p at equal to atmospheric pressure 0 1 mpa after providing a pulse pressure in the upstream volume v u the upstream pressure decreased from p u t 0 to p f balanced gas pressure see fig 1b whereas the pressure within the pore volume v p and downstream volume v d increased from p at to p f the relationship between gas pressure and reservoir volume follows boyle s law 13 p u t 0 v u p at v p v d p f v u v p v d there is only one unknown value v p in eq 13 the porosity ϕ can thus be determined using pore volume v p divided by the sample volume 3 apparatus and samples initially the yoko2 system dong et al 2010 nguyen et al 2022 was used to measure permeability via the steady state flow method under an open system however the gas expansion method adopted for porosity measurements requires a closed system in this study we modified a permeability measurement system into a closed system and used a pulse decay method a spacer with an extra volume on the downstream side was added the modified yoko2 can measure permeability and porosity simultaneously using one sample under stress the confining stress ranged from 3 to 80 mpa and the pore pressure was generally lower than 1 mpa the samples used for study were obtained from the pleistocene cholan formation that outcropped at the hushan dam yunlin county taiwan site prior to water pounding in 2016 the cholan formation belongs to the western foothill geological province of taiwan and consists of a series of upward coarsening successions of sediments each succession is characterized by claystone at its base graded upward into siltstone and very thick sandstone beds at its top lin et al 2007 based on the sedimentary structures and fragment composition the cholan formation can be interpreted as having been deposited in a deltaic environment song et al 2007 3 1 modify yoko2 system to measure permeability porosity simultaneously in a close system fig 2 a illustrates the sample assembly of modified yoko2 the tests were performed using an intravessel oil pressure apparatus at room temperature a pressure generator with an oil apparatus was used to enhance the confining pressure the samples were jacketed in two shrinkable polyolefin tubes with a thickness of 1 mm fig 2b shows a schematic of modified yoko2 the volume of the dashed red line v s between valves 1 and 2 is 4 25 ml the dashed red line was also connected to a pressure gauge to record the time dependent pressure the volume of the dashed blue line v l between valve 2 and the upper end of the sample is 0 845 ml the v l is the inner volume of the piston element 1 and porous spacer element 4 as shown in fig 2a the v u in fig 1a equals to v s v l the v d in fig 1a is equal to the volume of the porous gasket beneath the lower end of the sample denoted as v g with a value of 0 162 ml the pore volume of the sample is denoted as v p the same as that in fig 1a the details of the confining and pore pressure systems of yoko2 can be found in dong et al 2010 details of the modified yoko2 system incorporating the pulse decay and gas expansion methods in a closed system can be found in nguyen et al 2023 the permeability hydraulic aperture measurement of the modified yoko2 system was validated using the steady state method nguyen et al 2023 because the porosity measurement method used by the modified yoko2 was identical to that used by the original yoko2 gas expansion method no extra validation was required 3 1 1 determining the permeability using pulse decay method before the pulse decay test the pressure within the whole system v s v l v p and v g is p at 0 1 mpa we added pressure p u 0 always lower than 1 mpa through valve 1 into v s red dashed line in fig 2 by closing valve 2 and then closing valve 1 the experiment started from the opening of valve 2 at time t 0 the pressure in v s dropped suddenly from p u 0 to p u t 0 when valve 2 opened and v l and v s were connected the p u t 0 can be expressed as jones 1997 14 p u t 0 p u 0 v s p at v l v s v l the volume of the upper reservoir v u in fig 1a is equal to the total volume of the red and blue dashed lines v s v l in our yoko2 system the gasket volume v g can be represented as the downstream reservoir v d in fig 1a the general analytical solutions to eq 8 can be used to determine gas permeability k g helium was used as the pore fluid in this study the viscosity of helium μ g in eq 10 is 1 96 10 5 pa s the volume compressibility c w in eq 10 is the reciprocal of the balanced pressure 1 p f for an ideal gas at constant temperature 3 1 2 determining the porosity using gas expansion method after the pressure pulse decayed to a balanced pressure p f the gas expansion method eq 14 can be used to determine the pore volume v p for the modified yoko2 system eq 14 is modified as follows 15 p u 0 v s p at v l v p v g p f v s v l v p v g the porosity ϕ can thus be determined using pore volume v p divided by the sample volume the definitions of v s v l v p v g please refer to fig 2 in this study we offered three different pressure pulses to measure gas permeability k g and three different balanced pressures p f were obtained under a constant confining stress three points of gas permeability were used for the klinkenberg correction to calibrate permeability k and slip factor b the mean value of the three balanced pressures was used to represent the pore pressure p p in eq 5 the effective confining stress σ eff is defined as the difference between the confining stress and mean value of the balanced pressure it should be noted that the effective confining stress varied across the sample similar to the porosity as there was a pressure gradient the mean value of the balanced pressure is an approximation and its influence is minimized given the small sample size another issue is the assumption that the effective stress coefficient equals one which is not necessarily true for clayey sandstones tai and dong 2022 but this issue is beyond the scope of this study the results of the gas permeability measurements are provided in supplementary file a 3 2 samples silty sandstone and clayey siltstone used for determining c k c two late pliocene to early pleistocene clastic sedimentary rock samples cholan formation s1 and s2 were used to measure the k c constant c kc figs 3 and 4 show images of the two samples the diameter and height of the two samples were 25 and 20 mm respectively the samples were from a thrust and fold belt western foothill province central taiwan indicating that they underwent significant erosion according to wu and dong 2012 the eroded effective stresses of rocks in similar geological settings range between 30 61 and 64 91 mpa this indicated that the samples from the outcrops were highly over consolidated a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls13320 was used to determine the grain size distribution of the two samples fig 5 shows the results of particle size analysis table 1 lists the sand silt and clay proportions of the two tested samples according to the classification method proposed by picard 1971 s1 is silty sandstone and s2 is clayey siltstone 4 results 4 1 the effective confining stress dependent porosity ϕ fig 6 reveals the effective confining stress σ eff dependency of porosity for s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone when σ eff was 4 86 mpa and the porosity of the silty sandstone red circles was 19 39 with the increasing σ eff up to 79 68 mpa the mean porosity of silty sandstone decreased from 19 39 to 15 61 the porosity of clayey siltstone blue squares ranged from 10 37 to 7 40 while the σ eff changed from 2 61 mpa to 59 62 mpa the data points shown in fig 6 are used to calibrate the parameters in eq 6 for s1 silty sandstone the initial porosity was 0 269 and its q 0 080 for s2 clayey siltstone the initial porosity was 0 155 and its q 0 111 it is worth noting that elastoplastic behavior is commonly observed in fine grained sedimentary rocks and the stress history influences porosity wu and dong 2012 because the thick pleistocene formation was eroded where the outcrop samples originated the measured porosity and permeability of the highly over consolidated samples could mainly be elastic 4 2 the effective confining stress dependent slip factor b and hydraulic radius r h fig 7 a shows the klinkenberg correction for s1 silty sandstone the y axis represents the gas permeability k g measured under three different balanced pressures p f the x axis represents the reciprocal of the three balanced pressures 1 p f based on eq 5 we can calibrate the gas permeability k g and slip factor b for s1 under 10 mpa of confining stress the permeability k is 3 92 10 15 m2 the intercept of the dashed red line and the klinkenberg slip factor b 0 107 mpa using the slope of the dashed red line divided by the permeability k fig 7b illustrates the klinkenberg correction for s2 clayey siltstone when the confining stress equals to 20 mpa the permeability is 2 71 10 16 m2 and the klinkenberg slip factor b 0 208 mpa all results of klinkenberg corrections for the two samples under all stress conditions are shown in supplementary file b only good quality data were used linear regression results with determination coefficient r 2 0 83 supplementary file b to further analyze the effective stress dependent b two additional data points were excluded from further analysis of the abnormally high slip factor b b 1 49 mpa under 5 mpa and negative permeability under 15 mpa of confining stress for s2 fig 8 shows the effective confining stress σ eff dependence of the slip factor b for s1 and s2 red circles denote the results for s1 silty sandstone and blue squares denote the results for s2 clayey siltstone the slip factor b of silty sandstone s1 is smaller than that of clayey siltstone s2 which is reasonable because the pore size of s1 is larger than that of s2 and the slip effect is less significant generally the b increased with increasing confining stress although some scatter was observed to evaluate the stress dependent hydraulic radius r h and k c constant c kc we used an exponential model to fit the experimental data on a semi log scale the stress dependent exponential model of the slip factor can be expressed as 16 ln b ξ σ eff c the calibrated ξ and c of s1 are 0 0063 and 2 5445 respectively the ones for s2 are 0 0161 and 1 6785 respectively fig 9 presents the stress dependent hydraulic radius r h calculated using eq 4 which is associated with the stress dependent model of the slip factor b eq 16 for s1 silty sandstone the hydraulic radius r h decreased from 0 69 μ m to 0 42 μ m when σ eff increased from 0 1 mpa to 80 mpa for s2 clayey siltstone the hydraulic radius r h changed from 0 29 μ m to 0 11 μ m during the σ eff ranged from 0 1 mpa to 60 mpa the decreasing trend of r h with increasing confining stress was due to the increasing trend of b with increasing confining stress as expected the hydraulic radius r h of the silty sandstone s1 was larger than that of the clayey siltstone s2 a stronger stress dependency of r h was observed for the clayey siltstone s2 which was due to the stronger stress dependency of the slip factor b 4 3 the effective confining stress dependent permeability k fig 10 shows the effective confining stress dependent permeabilities of s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone all data points red circles for s1 and blue squares for s2 were obtained after klinkenberg correction the permeabilities of both samples decreased with increasing σ eff as expected the stress sensitivity of the permeability for clayey siltstone s2 was stronger than that of silty sandstone s1 for s1 silty sandstone permeability ranges from 5 66 10 15 m2 to 1 52 10 15 m2 when the σ eff changes from 4 86 mpa to 79 68 mpa for s2 clayey siltstone permeability was changed from 3 74 10 16 m2 to 5 00 10 17 m2 when the σ eff increased from 9 63 mpa to 59 62 mpa the results of σ eff dependent permeability k for each sample under all stress conditions were included in supplementary file a the data points shown in fig 10 were used to calibrate the parameters in eq 7 for s1 silty sandstone the initial permeability k 0 3 66 10 14 m2 and p 0 465 for s2 clayey siltstone the initial permeability k 0 7 46 10 14 m2 and p 1 110 4 4 the determined effective confining stress dependent k c constant c k c fig 11 shows stress dependent k c constant c kc model calculated from porosity ϕ fig 6 hydraulic radius r h fig 9 permeability k fig 10 and eq 1 the red and blue curves represent the s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone models respectively the c kc of s1 ranged from approximately 3 53 to 21 77 under the effective confining stress σ eff for s2 the c kc ranged from 0 18 to 20 08 it is interesting to note that c kc first increased with increasing σ eff but started to decline when σ eff went beyond certain values the critical σ eff was approximately 30 mpa 5 discussions 5 1 comparison of determined stress dependent c k c with previous documented ones the previously documented stress independent dependent c kc values for sandstone and mudrock were compared with our stress dependent c kc models the red and blue curves in fig 12 show the stress dependent c kc models of s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone respectively the c kc value of s1 ranged from 3 53 to 21 77 the data for the stress independent c kc of sandstones measured under atmospheric pressure are denoted by the horizontal dashed straight lines in fig 12 the dashed blue lines denote the c kc of the fontainebleau sandstone measured by mostaghimi et al 2013 a pure clean sandstone composed of 100 quartz bourbie and zinszner 1985 the values ranged from 12 19 to 93 97 the dashed green line denotes the c kc of the berea sandstone composed of well sorted and well rounded quartz with minor amounts of feldspar dolomite and clays churcher et al 1991 measured by mostaghimi et al 2013 its value was 14 65 the dashed black lines denote fine to medium grained sandstone as measured by zakirov et al 2016 its values ranged from 4 0 to 8 3 according to fig 12 the measured c kc of s1 silty sandstone was consistent with the measurement results of previous studies the c kc value of s2 ranged from 0 18 to 20 08 the data for the stress dependent c kc of mudstones measured by okazaki et al 2014 are denoted by the dashed gray straight lines in fig 12 the c kc for mudstones ranged from 0 18 to 0 0148 under low σ eff and the c kc would increase up to 2 01 and 6 09 with increasing σ eff respectively okazaki et al 2014 found the c kc of mudstones would rise suddenly when the σ eff reached beyond a critical value 5 2 the role of r h 2 square hydraulic radius and ϕ k on stress dependent k c constant c k c according to eq 3 the k c constant c kc is the product of r h 2 the square hydraulic radius and ϕ k porosity divided by permeability fig 13 a and 13b illustrates the stress dependent c kc r h 2 and ϕ k in fig 13a the dotted and dashed red curves denote the stress dependent r h 2 and ϕ k of s1 in fig 13b the dotted and dashed blue curves represent the stress dependent r h 2 and ϕ k of s2 respectively for s1 silty sandstone in fig 13a the r h 2 dotted red curve reduced about 40 from 0 69 to 0 42 μ m 2 when effective confining stress σ eff increased from 0 1 to 80 mpa the ϕ k dashed red curve increased more than on order of magnitude from 7 35 to 96 37 μ m 2 for s2 clayey siltstone in fig 13b the r h 2 dotted blue curve reduced about 60 from 0 29 to 0 11 μ m 2 when σ eff increased from 0 1 mpa to 60 mpa the ϕ k dashed blue curve increased more the 500 times from 2 08 to 1 238 70 μ m 2 according to the trend of stress dependent k c constant c kc in fig 13 we can find that the stress dependent c kc of two samples are mainly dominated by ϕ k however the influence of r h 2 gradually becomes significant with increasing σ eff particularly for s2 clayey siltstone it is interesting to find that the c kc of samples s1 and s2 starts to decrease when the σ eff turns beyond 30 mpa which the increase rate of ϕ k with σ eff start to reduce than the decrease rate of r h 2 the influence of r h 2 and ϕ k on stress dependent k c constant c kc is obviously and the stress dependent conduits shape and tortuosity walsh 1981 walsh and brace 1984 wentong et al 2018 should play a key role how the conduit shape and tortuosity vary with stress could be critical in understanding the mechanisms of c kc stress dependency and deserves in depth study in the future 5 3 the permeability prediction error due to neglect the stress dependent c k c we evaluated the influence of neglecting the stress dependent c kc on permeability prediction using a synthetic case of clayey siltstone according to fig 11 the c kc of the clayey siltstone ranged from 0 18 to 15 27 when the effective confining stress σ eff increased from 0 1 to 60 mpa fig 14 illustrates the prediction of permeability red curve using the determined stress dependent porosity dashed blue curve in fig 6 stress dependent hydraulic radius r h blue curve in fig 9 and stress dependent c kc blue curve in fig 11 if we assume a constant c kc of 0 18 5 00 and 15 27 the predicted c kc values are illustrated as the blue black and green curves in fig 14 if the stress dependency of c kc is neglected the prediction error of the stress dependent permeability will be significant we argue that some of the documented results showing that the k c equation is invalid for the permeability prediction of unconventional reservoirs e g carrier 2003 xu and yu 2008 wu et al 2022 could simply be due to overlooking the stress dependency of c kc 5 4 prospects and limitations of the proposed method the most important advantage of the proposed method is its ability to measure c kc under stress the pore structures of permeable media can be easily determined without much difficulties using micro ct under stress and the stress dependent c kc can be evaluated directly using eq 3 however it is expensive and difficult to measure the microstructures of tight rocks using micro ct in other words the proposed method is superior to any existing method for determining c kc of unconventional reservoirs another prospect of the proposed method is to explore the stress history effect on c kc although we did not illustrate this feature in our results eqs 6 and 7 can be readily expanded to consider normally consolidated and overconsolidated sedimentary rocks dong et al 2010 and the stress history dependent c kc can be potentially determined however the proposed method had some limitations this method is suitable for medium to low permeability rocks because of the difficulties in determining the permeability of permeable rocks using the pulse decade method meanwhile because the klinkenberg slip factor b is used to determine the hydraulic radius r h a gas medium should be used as the flow fluid for permeability and porosity measurements 6 conclusions this study proposes a novel method for determining the stress dependent k c constant c kc of rocks from unconventional reservoirs this novel method consists of two parts a evaluating the stress hydraulic radius r h using the klinkenberg slip factor b measured under confining stresses b determining the ϕ k using simultaneously measured porosity and permeability under confining stresses we modified the existing apparatus yoko2 to simultaneously measure porosity and permeability under confining stresses the proposed novel method is superior to existing approaches in several aspects a the stress dependent c kc can be measured without much difficulty b it is applicable to unconventional reservoirs that encounter fine grained low permeability rocks c the step for specific surface measurements is skipped and d the influence of sample heterogeneity can be minimized for demonstration the stress dependent c kc values of silty sandstone and clayey siltstone under confining stress were determined the k c constant c kc of s1 silty sandstone and s2 clayey siltstone ranged from 3 53 to 21 77 and from 0 18 to 20 08 under confining stress the results of the determinations of the c kc are compatible with the measurement results of documented sandstones and mudstones although most of the previously documented c kc is stress independent based on our experimental results we found that the c kc values of s1 and s2 increased with increasing σ eff but the rate of increase decreased when s2 was subjected to a certain critical σ eff the measured c kc began to decrease we speculate that the pore shape and tortuosity account for the observed trend of the stress dependent c kc and the mechanisms require further study finally the stress dependence of c kc is critical for predicting the permeability of unconventional reservoirs if we assume c kc is constant the prediction error of the stress dependent permeability using the k c equation is significant we argue that some of the documented results that show that the k c equation is invalid for the permeability prediction of unconventional reservoirs could simply be due to overlooking the stress dependence of c kc credit authorship contribution statement pin lun tai conceptualization methodology

1872,flood is one of the most devastating natural hazards and is responsible for sizeable social economic losses and substantial fatalities flood events with diverse behavior characteristics vary greatly in spatial patterns and bring great challenges for flood management in this study the peak over threshold pot approach coupled with an event start and end detecting approach was proposed to separate flood events during 2008 2018 across the yangtze river basin ten flood behavior metrics comprehensively characterizing magnitude duration timing rate of change and flood forms of flood events were used to fully describe flood events and then to identify flood event classes subsequently the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was revealed based on behavior similarity classification of numerous events furthermore a contribution based impact factor analysis cbifa method was constructed to investigate the contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors to flood event variations results show that 1 six flood event classes were identified including long duration and small rate of change flood events class 1 31 00 sharp thin and short tail flood events class 2 20 58 sharp thin and early peak flood events class 3 5 12 dwarf fat flood events class 4 18 37 small and sharp thin flood events class 5 4 24 and conventional events class 6 20 67 2 class 1 and class 4 characterized by small rate of change long duration and large magnitude occurred across the whole yangtze river basin and mainly in the middle lower yangtze plains class 2 with small magnitude and short duration was mainly distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau class 3 class 5 and class 6 mainly occurred in mountainous areas and hills in the middle and upper reaches wherein class 3 and class 5 were characterized by large rate of change and short duration 3 the meteorological factors were the most important impact factors and explained 30 23 68 10 of the total flood event variations followed by

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are among the severest and the most recurring natural hazards which threaten the safety of human lives hinder social development and cause substantial economic losses throughout the world ahani et al 2020 kam et al 2021 oppel and fischer 2020 whipple et al 2017 in 2016 floods affected more than 78 million people and caused about economic loss of 56 billion worldwide chao et al 2022 costache et al 2020 a sequence of floods hit southern germany in may and june of 2016 and caused total losses of 2 2 billion kron et al 2019 the no 5 flood peak of the 2020 yangtze river flood caused some urban areas in chongqing city flooded affected 0 26 million people and caused a direct economic loss of 2 45 billion yuan xia and chen 2021 the costs associated with floods can be reduced by implementing adequate flood management measures which require reliable flood prediction on flood magnitude and flood processes however flood events show diverse behavior characteristics and vary greatly in spatial patterns due to large variations in both natural and anthropogenic conditions which bring great challenges to flood management gu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 therefore it is important to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of flood events with diverse behavior characteristics which supports the implementation of adequate flood management measures for loss reduction accurate flood event separation is the basis and the first critical step for flood analyses fischer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 although many studies have used separated flood events for hydrological applications such as flood event classification flood statistics and rainfall runoff modeling zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 there are only a few flood event separation methods a common method is based on the peak over threshold pot approach mangini et al 2018 the fixed quantile jeong et al 2014 the mean number of over threshold events brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b and the smallest annual maximum fischer and schumann 2016 are often used as thresholds a baseflow separation method or a conceptual graphical approach to identify the flood event start and end dates is often coupled with the pot approach to separate flood events bezak et al 2015 koskelo et al 2012 however the baseflow separation methods originally designed for runoff events separation may lead to the inability of flood event separation during low baseflow or dry conditions without additional information fischer et al 2021 tarasova et al 2018 in addition a certain degree of subjectivity exists in the conceptual graphical approach zhang et al 2021 these limitations may result in inaccuracy in following flood analyses various climate patterns large topographic variations and uneven social development have led to flood events with great spatial heterogeneity wang et al 2020a xiong et al 2021 these flood events show considerable variations in their occurrence time duration extent magnitude frequency and rate of change due to a wide variety of physical processes tarasova et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the flood typology is an effective way to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of flood events yang et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the metrics describing the flood events can be grouped into three main categories hydroclimatic hydrological and hydrograph based nied et al 2014 tarasova et al 2019 yang et al 2020 both hydroclimatic metrics and hydrological metrics focus on the spatial temporal physical causes of flood events such as hydrological pre conditions meteorological conditions climatic conditions and catchment state nied et al 2014 tarasova et al 2019 applying hydroclimatic or hydrological metrics is based on a hypothesis that physiographical and climatological catchment similarity may correspond to hydrological similarity while the assumption is not always correct brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b zhai et al 2021 the hydrograph based perspective describes flood events based on their behavior characteristics assuming that diverse generating mechanisms could result in flood events showing distinct behaviors tarasova et al 2019 thus the hydrograph based perspective ensures that flood events with similar flood behaviors are hydrologically similar and using these flood behavior metrics to classify flood events is hydrologically meaningful brunner et al 2017 2018a b 2020 employed the functional data approach to export flood hydrograph metrics for the identification of representative flood processes fischer and schumann 2020 chose the peak volume relationship as a metric to describe flood events and classify flood events into three groups zhai et al 2021 employed seven flash flood behavior metrics to identify flash flood types however present studies only focus on partial flood behavior characteristics such as peak discharge duration and occurrence time while other unadopted characteristics including characteristics of flood hydrographs and the rate of changes of flood discharges in the rising stage and the recession process are also important for describing flood event hence it is necessary to construct a comprehensive flood behavior metric system for flood event classification to recognize the spatial heterogeneity of flood events the need for revealing major impact factors of flood event variations for deepening understanding of spatial patterns of flood events catalyzed a wealth of studies that uncover the important roles of natural factors e g precipitation and topography in controlling floods sun et al 2022 revealed the controls of rainfall properties to flash floods by comparing the spatio temporal variation of flash floods and changes in precipitation liu et al 2019a investigated the impact of antecedent precipitation multiple climatic anomalies and vegetation coverage on floods berghuijs et al 2016 found that soil moisture snowmelt and rain on snow events rather than only rainfall characteristics can better explain the seasonality and interannual variabilities of floods for most catchments however in recent decades the anthropogenic impacts on flood events have been gradually increasing with urbanization and intensification of human activities many studies show that urbanization leads to a tremendous transition in land use that could limit water infiltration and increase yield du et al 2015 jodar abellan et al 2019 papagiannaki et al 2015 wan mohtar et al 2020 the massive construction and operation of dams and reservoirs also have great impacts on flood events dams can store floodwaters temporarily and reduce the peak flow directly to provide flood control nakamura and shimatani 2021 and also have important impacts on groundwater evaporation and precipitation to exert influences on flood events chen et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 yet the mismatch between limited understandings of anthropogenic impacts and increasing intensification of human activities has limited our ability to implement flood management the yangtze river basin is an important economic focus and densely inhabited basin in china and suffers massive economic losses caused by floods wang et al 2021 due to the uneven social development and the great natural condition changes across the whole basin flood events vary greatly in spatial temporal characteristics dai et al 2021 gu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a yang et al 2021 this study aims to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of flood events and its impact factors across the yangtze river basin we first coupled the peak over threshold approach with an approach detecting the flood event start and end dates to separate flood events during 2008 2018 then a comprehensive flood behavior metric system including ten metrics of magnitude duration timing rate of change and flood forms was constructed to fully describe flood events and then to identify flood event classes the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was explored subsequently according to behavior similarity classification of numerous events further a contribution based impact factor analysis cbifa method was constructed to investigate the contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors to flood event variations the specific objectives are to 1 separate flood events from daily runoff series using the modified flood event separation method 2 cluster flood events based on the behavior similarity by the k means clustering algorithm 3 reveal the spatial heterogeneity of individual flood events classes and 4 reveal impact factors of individual flood event classes using the cbifa method 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yangtze river 24 36 n 90 122 5 e area of approximately 1 8 106 km2 originates from tanggula mountain in qinghai province and finally flows into the east china sea fig 1 most sections of the basin situated within the subtropical monsoon region while the source region is located in the dry frigid high altitude zone annual precipitation varies between 300 and 2000 mm and exhibits strong spatial temporal variations due to the east asian monsoon liu et al 2020 influenced by the east asian monsoon rainfall concentrates in wet seasons between april and october and as a result floods mainly occur during this period zhang et al 2008 the whole yangtze river basin is geographically divided into the upstream the midstream and the downstream by yichang station and hukou station chen et al 2016 respectively the upstream has a high relief and is mountainous while the midstream and the downstream consist of vast fluvial plains several tributaries scatter in the yangtze river basin the yalong river the min and tuo river the jialing river and the han river are located on the north bank the wu river the dongting lake and the poyang lake are located on the south bank strong precipitation seasonality large topographic variability complex river tributaries lake relationship and uneven social development have led to great spatial heterogeneity of flood events in the yangtze river basin which bring great challenges to flood management measures wang et al

research framework is shown in fig 2 this framework consists of five parts including flood event separation flood behavior metric system construction cluster analysis spatial heterogeneity analysis and impact factor analysis the specific methods flood behavior metrics and impact factors were presented below in detail fig 2 can be inserted here 3 1 flood event separation method in this study the peak over threshold pot approach council 1981 coupled with an approach detecting the flood event start and end dates were constructed to separate flood events from daily runoff series the threshold of the pot approach was chosen iteratively to fulfill a target condition of about maximum 30 flood events per station fig 3 a ammar et al 2020 measures to ensure the independence of flood peaks can be described as follows council 1981 fig 3a 1 θ 5 ln a q min 0 75 min q 1 q 2 where θ days donates the interval time between two adjacent peaks a km2 is the basin area qmin m3 s is the minimum intermediate flow and q1 and q2 m3 s are two adjacent peaks the approach detecting the flood event start and end dates followed the concept that the discharge at the start or end date should fall below a threshold and the width of the interval between the peak and the start or end date should be as short as possible to keep two consecutive peaks independent it can be described as follows fig 3b 2 q s a q p d s d r and 3 q e a q p d e d r where qs qe and qp are the discharge of the start date end date and flood peak respectively a is the empirical parameter dr is the detection range ds and de are the time between the start date and the flood peak and the time between the end date and the flood peak respectively according to previous studies and vast practical attempts claps and laio 2003 vittal et al 2015 yue 2000 zhang et al 2021 a was set as 0 5 and the dr was set as 1 5 times θ another separation method fischer et al 2021 was employed to verify the flood event separation results for separated flood events with large differences between the two methods we manually selected the appropriate separated flood events incorporated with hydrological expert knowledge fig 3 can be inserted here 3 2 flood behavior metrics in this study ten flood behavior metrics table 1 were selected to fully describe flood events which belonged to five categories of magnitude duration timing rate of change and flood forms specifically flood duration fd flood volume fv and flood peak fp were commonly used to reflect temporal and magnitude characteristics of a flood event zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 timing of flood peak tfp was the time between the start date and the flood peak of a flood event rates of positive change and negative change rpc and rnc measured the mean rates of flood rising and recession processes larger rpc and rnc mean steeper flood hydrographs which bring difficulty to reservoir regulation coefficient of variation cv rate of flood rising time rfr normalized flood peak nfp and rate of discharge over 75 peak discharge rdo were used to describe the shape of flood hydrographs rfr was the ratio of time of flood rising processes to flood event duration and was used to identify early peaked or late peaked events nfp was defined as the ratio between fp and fv rdo was the proportion of the flood process with large discharge during a flood event detailed information is given in table 1 table 1 can be inserted here 3 3 cluster analysis the unsupervised k means clustering algorithm landuyt et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 was used to divide flood events into several classes davies bouldin index dbi and silhouette coefficient sc were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of resulting clusters the algorithm was applied for k 3 up to k 10 and this operation was repeated 10 000 times in each operation dbi and sc were calculated to detect the best clustering results the dbi and sc are calculated as follows 4 dbi 1 n i 1 n max j i σ i σ j d c i c j 5 sc b a max a b where ci is the cluster center of the ith cluster σi is the average distance between each point in cluster i and its center d is the distance between the cluster center ci and cj a is the average distance between the sample and other samples in the same cluster b is the average distance between the sample and other samples in a different cluster 3 4 flood influencing

sl elevation el drainage area da normalized difference vegetation index ndvi sand fraction sd silt fraction st clay fraction cy human regulatory capacity hrc and intensity of human activities iha were employed to investigate the impacts on individual flood event classes the factors cp and mdp were calculated on a daily scale and from the start day to the end day of the flood event the factor aw was also calculated at the daily scale but was calculated as the cumulative precipitation in the antecedent three days the values of other impact factors were the average values within the station controlled basins table 2 can be inserted here 3 5 correlation analysis and contribution identification spearman s rank correlation was used to analyze the correlations between the flood behavior metrics and the impact factors then the contribution based impact factor analysis cbifa method was proposed to identify the contributions of impact factors to individual flood event classes the cbifa method consisted of the variation contribution analysis and the shapley value in the variation contribution analysis the variance was adopted to assess information of flood events contained in the flood behavior metrics the contribution of a flood behavior metric to the flood event variations was calculated as follows li et al 2018 6 r i va r i i 1 m va r i 100 and 7 r r 1 r 2 r m where ri is the contribution of the ith flood behavior metric vari is the variance of the ith flood behavior metric m is the number of flood event metrics r is the contribution matrix of m flood behavior metrics the shapley value heuillet et al 2022 štrumbelj and kononenko 2014 originating from the n person game theory was used to partition the contributions of the impact factors to the flood behavior characteristics 8 ϕ i s n i p n p 1 n v s i v s and 9 φ ϕ 1 1 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 1 n ϕ 2 1 ϕ 2 2 ϕ 2 n ϕ m 1 ϕ m 2 ϕ m n where n is the number of impact factors v is the gain function s is a coalition of impact factors impact factors 1 p ϕ i is the contributions added by the new impact factor i based on the coalition s φ is the contribution matrix of n impact factors to m flood behavior metrics lastly the contributions of impact factors to the flood event variations were identified as follows 10 c r φ where c is the contribution matrix of impact factors to the flood event variations 4 results 4 1 flood event separation and classification 1132 flood events were separated from daily runoff series across the yangtze river basin fig 4 shows five representative hydrographs of flood events e g the single peak flood event the double peak flood event the multi peak flood event the sharp thin flood event and the dwarf fat flood event these hydrographs were selected from stations wanx yic baih xiant and dat respectively it can be found that the detected start dates of flood events were generally consistent with the runoff rising point and the detected end dates generally corresponded to our understanding of recession processes the five representative hydrographs of flood events were separated satisfactorily these results suggest that the flood event separation method can effectively capture flood hydrographs and can further obtain accurate flood behavior characteristics fig 5 shows the dbi and sc values of different class numbers the dbi results indicated that flood events in the yangtze river basin were well clustered into six classes increasing the number of clusters did not further improve this representation and even led to worse clustering results the sc results showed that the three flood event classes had the smallest sc value however significant differences still existed between flood events belonging to the same flood event class when flood events were divided into three classes while the differences were inconspicuous when flood events were divided into six classes hence based on the clustering results dbi and sc the flood events were clustered into six classes 4 2 flood behavior characteristics of individual flood event classes there were 351 233 58 208 48 and 234 flood events in class 1 6 respectively accounting for 31 00 20 58 5 12 18 37 4 24 and 20 67 of the total flood events fig 6 shows normalized hydrographs of these six classes of flood events and the black hydrograph represents the median of hydrographs in each class the hydrographs were similar in the same class but inter cluster dissimilarity was large flood events mainly occurred in the summer followed by autumn class 1 3 and 5 6 or spring class 4 besides obvious differences in magnitude existed among various flood event classes fig 7 fig 8 shows flood behavior characteristics and their standard deviations of individual flood event classes it can be found that standard deviations of most flood behavior metrics within the same flood event class were less than 0 1 in addition only rdo and fp in class 4 were larger than 0 2 which indicated that these two metrics of class 4 changed greatly class 1 was referred to as the long duration and small rate of change flood event type ldsct flood hydrographs were characterized by elongated falling limbs the metrics fv fp fd and tfp were the second largest among all classes while the metrics rpc and rnc were the second smallest class 2 was referred to as the sharp thin and short tail flood event type ststt the flood events showed steep rising limbs and relatively steep falling limbs of the flood hydrographs the metric fp was the smallest among all classes and the metric fv was the second smallest the metrics tfp and fd were small with an average of 4 70 days and 7 75 days class 3 and class 5 had similar flood hydrographs and were characterized by rather steep rising and falling limbs of flood hydrographs and large summits specifically in class 3 the metrics tfp and fd were the smallest among all classes with an average of 2 59 days and 5 34 days the metric rpc was the largest and the metric rnc was the second largest of which average values were 1 98 10 1 d 1 and 6 87 10 2 d 1 respectively the metric rfr was the smallest which meant that class 3 were early peaked events for class 5 the metrics cv rpc and nfp were the largest among all classes with an average of 0 92 1 16 10 1 d 1 and 0 41 the metric rnc was the second largest and only smaller than class 3 the metric fp was the second smallest and the metric fv was the smallest among all classes therefore we referred to class 3 and class 5 as the sharp thin and early peak flood event type stept and the small and sharp thin flood event type sstt respectively class 4 represented the flood events with large magnitude small variable long duration and small rate of changes and was referred to as the dwarf fat flood event type dft these flood events were characterized by both elongated rising and falling limbs and small summits the magnitude metrics i e fp and fv and the temporal metrics i e tfp and fd were the largest among all classes while the metrics describing rate of change i e rpc and rnc were the smallest in addition the metric rfr was the largest but the metric nfp was the smallest flood hydrographs of class 6 were characterized by steep rising limbs relatively elongated falling limbs and medium summits except for rdo rfr and tfp the remainder flood behavior metrics were the third or fourth largest among all classes therefore class 6 represented flood events with intermediate behavior characteristics and here was referred to as the conventional type ct 4 3 spatial heterogeneity of individual flood event classes fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of individual flood event classes ldsct class 1 occurred throughout the whole yangtze river basin except the stations guangy quanz and dat this class was mainly distributed in the midstream and downstream with flat terrain specifically flood events occurring in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin here refers to the region down the yibin city in the yangtze river basin the han river basin and the two lakes region accounted for 11 97 17 66 15 38 and 16 52 of ldsct in the min and tuo river basin and the wu river basin the proportions reached 13 39 and 11 11 respectively while in the jinsha river basin the yalong river basin and the jialing river basin the proportions were 5 13 5 98 and 2 85 respectively ststt class 2 mainly occurred in qinghai tibet plateau specifically 89 flood events occurred in the min and tuo river basin accounting for 38 20 of ststt and followed by the yalong river basin 27 04 and the jinsha river basin 25 75 only 5 58 and 2 15 of ststt occurred in the wu river basin and the han river basin while there was only one flood event occurring in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin the jialing river basin and the dongting lake basin it was worth noting that there were fewer ststt occurring in the station zhimd than in other stations in the jinsha river basin the spatial distribution of stept class 3 was similar to that of sstt class 5 and ct class 6 they mainly occurred in mountainous areas and hills in the middle and upper reaches 31 03 of stept occurred in the dongting river basin followed by the min and tuo river basin 29 31 the jialing river basin 18 97 the han river basin 10 34 the wu river basin 5 17 the poyang river basin 3 45 and the yalong river basin 1 72 sstt mainly occurred in the han river basin the dongting lake basin and the jialing river basin accounting for 37 50 27 08 and 25 00 of sstt only 6 25 and 4 17 of flood events occurred in the wu river basin and the poyang lake basin respectively different from stept and sstt 40 60 of ct occurred in the dongting lake basin followed by the jialing river basin 23 93 the poyang river basin 17 09 the han river basin 8 97 the wu river basin 6 41 and the min and tuo river basin 2 14 there was only one flood event occurring in the yalong river basin and the mainstream of the yangtze river basin there was no ct occurred in the jinsha river basin in the two lake area the number of ct increased from the downstream to the upstream dft class 4 was mainly distributed in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin and the downstream of the tributaries which was similar to ldsct different from ldsct few dft occurred in the upstream of the tributaries specifically 36 54 of dft occurred in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin followed by the han river basin 18 27 the dongting lake basin 12 02 the poyang lake basin 10 58 the wu river basin 8 17 the min and tuo river basin 6 73 the jinsha river basin 5 77 and the yalong river basin 1 92 no dft occurred in the jialing river basin it was worth noting that all flood events occurring in the dat station belonged to dft in addition the number of dft decreased from the downstream to the upstream across the whole yangtze river basin 4 4 impact factors of individual flood event classes fig 10 shows the correlation coefficients between flood behavior metrics and potential impact factors although there were correlations between flood behavior metrics and potential impact factors most of these correlations were not strong and were less than 0 4 for ldsct cp and mdp had positive correlations with cv np was positively correlated with rpc but negatively with tfp da hrc and iha showed positive correlations with fp and fv and particularly the correlation coefficients of da reached 0 83 for stsst cp was positively correlated with tfp but negatively with rdo np had a positive correlation with rpc and a negative correlation with tfp and fd da and hrc showed positive correlations with fp and fv and the correlation coefficients of da exceeded 0 7 particularly for stept only da and hrc showed positive correlations with rfr tfp fp and fv and negative correlations with cv and rpc the correlations between these two impact factors and the flood behavior metrics were also found in sstt and ct but the correlation coefficients were less than the coefficients of stept for sstt cp mdp and aw showed positive correlations with fp and fv np had a positive correlation with rpc but negative correlations with rfr and tfp for dft da showed a positive correlation with fp and fv and the correlation coefficients exceeded 0 8 the above analysis revealed that most impact factors had no significant correlations with flood behavior metrics in all flood event classes except for the geographic factor da the four meteorological factors and the human activities factor hrc fig 11 shows the contributions of impact factors to flood event variations fig 12 shows the triggering precipitation events and the antecedent wetness conditions of individual flood event classes for all flood event classes the meteorological factors were the most important impact factors which explained 30 23 68 10 of the total flood event variations especially for ststt and sstt the contributions of meteorological factors reached 68 10 and 58 56 which meant that meteorological factors were the dominant driver factors of these two flood event classes except for stept and dft np was the most important factor of the other four flood event classes accounting for 16 20 26 46 19 15 and 14 19 of flood event variations respectively one would expect that two sharp thin flood events i e stept and sstt were triggered by precipitation events with large np whereas dft and ldsct were triggered by precipitation events with small np cp was also an important factor and corresponded well with fv explaining 8 85 22 23 of the flood event variations flood events with large fv such as dft were triggered by precipitation events with large cp on the contrary ststt and sstt characterized by small fv were triggered by precipitation events with small cp however mdp did not correspond well with fp for example dft was characterized by very large fp while its triggering precipitation events were characterized by medium mdp this meant that except for precipitation basin attributes e g geographical soil vegetation factors and human activities also played important roles in flood events geographical factors were also important impact factors and accounted for 9 19 32 10 of the total flood event variations among the three geographical factors da was the most important factor and explained 3 15 22 85 of flood event variations especially for stept and dft da rather than meteorological factors was the most important factor and explained 15 14 and 22 85 of the total variations human activities factors were also important and explained 6 56 23 17 of the total flood event variations the two factors i e hrc and iha explained 11 36 and 11 81 of flood event variations in stept while their contributions did not exceed 10 in other flood event classes soil factors explained 9 19 19 34 of flood event variations the contributions of each soil factor were smaller than 10 vegetation factors only accounted for 2 56 5 31 of the flood event variations 5 discussion 5 1 flood event classification based on flood behavior metrics flood events classification based on various flood behavior metrics is an effective method to investigate spatial patterns of flood events and seek understanding of their controls different from the hydroclimatic and hydrological metrics brunner et al 2017 brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b sikorska et al 2015 stein et al 2020 tarasova et al 2020a tarasova et al 2020b the employed flood hydrographs based metrics in this study ensure that flood events with similar behavior metrics are hydrologically similar brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b zhai et al 2021 a novelty of our study lies in the construction of a comprehensive flood behavior metrics system describing the characteristics of magnitude duration timing rate of change and flood forms of flood events previous studies only adopted partial flood behavior characteristics to classify flood events which might lead to large intra class dissimilarity while some unadopted metrics e g rate of change flood forms have been proven important for flood event classification and flood hazards zhang et al 2020 in the present study the metrics tfp rpc and rfr were used to describe the characteristics of flood rising stages which can provide information for flood warning and reservoir operation karbasi et al 2018 tu et al 2020 combined with fd and rnc the characteristics of flood recession processes can be also outlined the metric rdo namely rate of discharge over 75 peak discharge was also included in the metric system which can help to describe the shape of the flood hydrograph nearby the peak in addition the common metrics e g fp fv cv and nfp describing flood behavior characteristics of magnitude and flood forms were still used the flood behavior metric system which describes both flood hydrography shapes and hydrological features comprehensively ensures that the subdivision of flood events into six flood event classes differs not only in their hydrograph forms but also in their magnitude and timing the results of flood event classification have large agreements and some inconsistencies with previous studies brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b nied et al 2014 zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in line with previous studies brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b zhai et al 2021 flood events in the yangtze river basin were also divided into fast intermediate and slow events it is clear that ststt stept and sstt belong to fast events while ldsct and ct belong to intermediate events and dft belongs to slow events however the identified flood event classes go beyond previous reports showing that a comprehensive flood behavior metric system can improve classification accuracy and reduce classification uncertainty even if ststt stept and sstt belong to fast events there are still significant differences between flood events of these classes the differences in the metrics rpc rnc rfr nfp and rdo can characterize the differences in flood hydrographs between these three flash floods similarly although ldsct and ct belonged to intermediate events there are still obvious differences in their hydrograph shapes and hydrological features the constructed flood behavior metric system captures these differences and helps to divide intermediate floods more finely the clustered six flood event classes show the existence of diverse flood generating mechanisms across the yangtze river basin resulting in diverse flood behavior characteristics and bringing great challenges for flood management however it is still feasible to implement unified flood management measures in the dry frigid high altitude zone due to the high concentration of ststt in the qinghai tibet plateau 5 2 contributions of impact factors to flood event variations distinct flood event classes result from different flood generating mechanisms archfield et al 2016 huang et al 2022 tarasova et al 2020a tarasova et al 2020b previous studies focused on the spatial patterns of flood generation mechanisms to guide regional flood management berghuijs et al 2019 berghuijs et al 2016 hall and blöschl 2018 nied et al 2014 but they did not go further to explore the control factors on these patterns which can deepen our understanding of flood generation mechanisms and make the achievement more flexible and applicable to other regions most impact factor analysis studies used meteorological factors especially precipitation snowmelt and antecedent wetness and geographical factors e g slope and elevation to explain the flood event variations sikorska et al 2015 stein et al 2020 yang et al 2020 which suggests that meteorological and geographical factors have been deemed the most important impact factors of flood events in advance jehn et al 2020 kuentz et al 2017 however the intensity of human activities has been gradually increasing with urbanization and economic development across the yangtze river basin and the great impacts of land use transition dam construction and reservoir operation on the hydrological cycle process have been proven wan mohtar et al 2020 jodar abellan et al 2019 du et al 2015 papagiannaki et al 2015 nakamura and shimatani 2021 the mismatch between limited understandings of anthropogenic impacts and increasing intensification of human activities has limited effective flood management to close this gap two impact factors i e hrc and iha were applied to investigate the impacts of human activities on flood events and we finally investigated contributions of thirteen natural and anthropogenic factors to the flood event variations in this study the results of impact factor identification tie well with previous studies brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b wu et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 where the dominance of meteorological factors geographical factors and human activities factors are also revealed there is no doubt about the obvious influence of meteorological factors on flood events supported by multitudinous achievements huang et al 2022 jehn et al 2020 wu et al 2021 which identify the meteorological factors as the major controls but other impact factors as minor factors here a noticeable difference is that the drainage area also contributes significantly to the flood event variations and in stept and dft even the drainage area was the most important impact factor this is likely linked to the regulation of the drainage area on the confluence time and flood magnitude smith et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 the contributions of human activities ranged from 6 56 to 23 17 verifying the non ignorable impacts of human activities although urbanization has resulted in tremendous transition of land use the contributions of vegetation change are small and this finding is in accordance with findings reported by blöschl et al 2015 bronstert et al 2008 and merz et al 2021 the salient features of the source region of the yangtze river basin and the two lakes area namely the widespread distribution of glaciers snow and frozen soil and the existence of large lakes i e the dongting lake and the poyang lake respectively have resulted in complex flood processes here insights from yan et al 2019 vormoor et al 2015 2016 and szolgay et al 2016 which suggested that two types of floods i e rainfall induced and snowmelt induced floods existed in the seasonally snow covered regions help to explain the occurrences of ststt ldsct and dft in the source region although snowmelt can only cause a small number of flood events merz and blöschl 2003 yang et al 2020 the role of snowmelt in flood events is amplifying flood duration which could interpret the difference i e the short tail between ststt and the other two sharp thin flood event classes morán tejeda et al 2019 owing to the impermeability of the frozen soil layer bayard et al 2005 iwata et al 2018 ling and zhang 2007 runoff responds quickly to precipitation shanley and chalmers 1999 which contributes to the occurrence of sttst however due to the large drainage area and small precipitation fewer ststt occurred in the source region than in other regions of the qinghai tibet plateau both ldsct and ct were precipitation dominated classes and were the dominant flood event classes in the two lakes area this result demonstrates the significant impacts of precipitation on flood events in the eastern monsoon region lai and wang 2017 the transitions of dominant flood event class from ct in the upstream to ldsct dft in the downstream can be attributed to the changes in natural and anthropogenic conditions across the two lakes area hu et al 2007 jiahu et al 2007 liu et al 2019b the relative timing of peak flows between major recharging tributaries to a lake can significantly influence flood development li et al 2017 the huge flood regulation capacity of large lakes can store floodwaters temporarily to reduce the peak flow directly dai et al 2021 sun et al 2020 which contributes to the occurrences of ldsct dft the construction and operation of the three gorges dam have also been proven to change the flood regime of the river connected lakes but these impacts gradually weaken due to the increasing distance from the dam and the downstream interval inflow yang et al 2022 zhan et al 2015 diverse natural and anthropogenic conditions result in complex flood properties in the two lakes area and their comprehensive impacts need further study 5 3 limitations and uncertainties flood events with diverse behavior characteristics are complex physical processes with a high level of self organization arising from the co evolution of climate and underlying surface conditions jehn et al 2020 wu et al 2021 although the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was revealed by constructing a comprehensive flood behavior metric system to fully describe flood events and then to identify flood event classes our study still has the following limitations 1 assessing the impacts of glaciers snow and frozen soil is important for revealing flood generating mechanisms in the frigid and high altitude zone akstinas et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 while these impact factors such as snow coverage keller et al 2018 su et al 2020 and depth to the permafrost table rogger et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 were not included in this study due to limited data and difficulty in quantification 2 the combined impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors have increased with the intensification of human activities the undisclosed complex interaction mechanisms have limited accurate quantification of the contributions of individual natural and anthropogenic factors 3 eastern monsoons or global climate change also have influenced flood behaviors and these impacts need to be further revealed wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022b yun et al 2020 given the limitations highlighted future studies into the flood properties of the yangtze river basin should start with obtaining more detailed monitoring data particularly in basins with special climate or geomorphological attributes further research on the influence of natural anthropogenic interaction on flood events should be implemented to expand present achievements of spatial patterns of flood events 6 conclusion this study was conducted to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of flood events with diverse behavior characteristics across the yangtze river basin and further detect its impact factors for this purpose ten flood behavior metrics in five categories were used to comprehensively characterize flood events and then to identify flood event classes subsequently the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was analyzed according to behavior similarity classification of numerous events we further investigated the impacts of thirteen natural and anthropogenic factors on flood events using the cbifa method the major findings are listed as follows 1 1132 flood events were separated across the yangtze river basin these flood events were clustered into six flood event classes i e the long duration and small rate of change flood event type class 1 the sharp thin and short tail flood event type class 2 the sharp thin and early peak flood event type class 3 the dwarf fat flood event type class 4 the small and sharp thin flood event type class 5 and the conventional type class 6 there were 351 233 58 208 48 and 234 flood events in class 1 6 accounting for 31 00 20 58 5 12 18 37 4 24 and 20 67 of the total flood events 2 ldsct occurred throughout the whole yangtze river basin and mainly occurred in the midstream and downstream with flat terrain ststt mainly occurred in the qinghai tibet plateau stept sstt and ct mainly occurred in the mountainous areas and hills in the middle and upper reaches dft was mainly distributed in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin and the downstream of the tributaries 3 the meteorological factors cp mdp aw and np were the most important impact factors for all flood event classes and explained 30 23 68 10 of the total flood event variations followed by geographical 9 19 32 10 human activities 6 56 23 17 soil 9 19 19 34 and vegetation

1872,flood is one of the most devastating natural hazards and is responsible for sizeable social economic losses and substantial fatalities flood events with diverse behavior characteristics vary greatly in spatial patterns and bring great challenges for flood management in this study the peak over threshold pot approach coupled with an event start and end detecting approach was proposed to separate flood events during 2008 2018 across the yangtze river basin ten flood behavior metrics comprehensively characterizing magnitude duration timing rate of change and flood forms of flood events were used to fully describe flood events and then to identify flood event classes subsequently the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was revealed based on behavior similarity classification of numerous events furthermore a contribution based impact factor analysis cbifa method was constructed to investigate the contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors to flood event variations results show that 1 six flood event classes were identified including long duration and small rate of change flood events class 1 31 00 sharp thin and short tail flood events class 2 20 58 sharp thin and early peak flood events class 3 5 12 dwarf fat flood events class 4 18 37 small and sharp thin flood events class 5 4 24 and conventional events class 6 20 67 2 class 1 and class 4 characterized by small rate of change long duration and large magnitude occurred across the whole yangtze river basin and mainly in the middle lower yangtze plains class 2 with small magnitude and short duration was mainly distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau class 3 class 5 and class 6 mainly occurred in mountainous areas and hills in the middle and upper reaches wherein class 3 and class 5 were characterized by large rate of change and short duration 3 the meteorological factors were the most important impact factors and explained 30 23 68 10 of the total flood event variations followed by

accurate flood prediction and will finally provide essential information for reliable flood management keywords flood events flood behavior spatial heterogeneity impact factors the yangtze river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are among the severest and the most recurring natural hazards which threaten the safety of human lives hinder social development and cause substantial economic losses throughout the world ahani et al 2020 kam et al 2021 oppel and fischer 2020 whipple et al 2017 in 2016 floods affected more than 78 million people and caused about economic loss of 56 billion worldwide chao et al 2022 costache et al 2020 a sequence of floods hit southern germany in may and june of 2016 and caused total losses of 2 2 billion kron et al 2019 the no 5 flood peak of the 2020 yangtze river flood caused some urban areas in chongqing city flooded affected 0 26 million people and caused a direct economic loss of 2 45 billion yuan xia and chen 2021 the costs associated with floods can be reduced by implementing adequate flood management measures which require reliable flood prediction on flood magnitude and flood processes however flood events show diverse behavior characteristics and vary greatly in spatial patterns due to large variations in both natural and anthropogenic conditions which bring great challenges to flood management gu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 therefore it is important to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of flood events with diverse behavior characteristics which supports the implementation of adequate flood management measures for loss reduction accurate flood event separation is the basis and the first critical step for flood analyses fischer et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 although many studies have used separated flood events for hydrological applications such as flood event classification flood statistics and rainfall runoff modeling zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 there are only a few flood event separation methods a common method is based on the peak over threshold pot approach mangini et al 2018 the fixed quantile jeong et al 2014 the mean number of over threshold events brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b and the smallest annual maximum fischer and schumann 2016 are often used as thresholds a baseflow separation method or a conceptual graphical approach to identify the flood event start and end dates is often coupled with the pot approach to separate flood events bezak et al 2015 koskelo et al 2012 however the baseflow separation methods originally designed for runoff events separation may lead to the inability of flood event separation during low baseflow or dry conditions without additional information fischer et al 2021 tarasova et al 2018 in addition a certain degree of subjectivity exists in the conceptual graphical approach zhang et al 2021 these limitations may result in inaccuracy in following flood analyses various climate patterns large topographic variations and uneven social development have led to flood events with great spatial heterogeneity wang et al 2020a xiong et al 2021 these flood events show considerable variations in their occurrence time duration extent magnitude frequency and rate of change due to a wide variety of physical processes tarasova et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the flood typology is an effective way to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of flood events yang et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the metrics describing the flood events can be grouped into three main categories hydroclimatic hydrological and hydrograph based nied et al 2014 tarasova et al 2019 yang et al 2020 both hydroclimatic metrics and hydrological metrics focus on the spatial temporal physical causes of flood events such as hydrological pre conditions meteorological conditions climatic conditions and catchment state nied et al 2014 tarasova et al 2019 applying hydroclimatic or hydrological metrics is based on a hypothesis that physiographical and climatological catchment similarity may correspond to hydrological similarity while the assumption is not always correct brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b zhai et al 2021 the hydrograph based perspective describes flood events based on their behavior characteristics assuming that diverse generating mechanisms could result in flood events showing distinct behaviors tarasova et al 2019 thus the hydrograph based perspective ensures that flood events with similar flood behaviors are hydrologically similar and using these flood behavior metrics to classify flood events is hydrologically meaningful brunner et al 2017 2018a b 2020 employed the functional data approach to export flood hydrograph metrics for the identification of representative flood processes fischer and schumann 2020 chose the peak volume relationship as a metric to describe flood events and classify flood events into three groups zhai et al 2021 employed seven flash flood behavior metrics to identify flash flood types however present studies only focus on partial flood behavior characteristics such as peak discharge duration and occurrence time while other unadopted characteristics including characteristics of flood hydrographs and the rate of changes of flood discharges in the rising stage and the recession process are also important for describing flood event hence it is necessary to construct a comprehensive flood behavior metric system for flood event classification to recognize the spatial heterogeneity of flood events the need for revealing major impact factors of flood event variations for deepening understanding of spatial patterns of flood events catalyzed a wealth of studies that uncover the important roles of natural factors e g precipitation and topography in controlling floods sun et al 2022 revealed the controls of rainfall properties to flash floods by comparing the spatio temporal variation of flash floods and changes in precipitation liu et al 2019a investigated the impact of antecedent precipitation multiple climatic anomalies and vegetation coverage on floods berghuijs et al 2016 found that soil moisture snowmelt and rain on snow events rather than only rainfall characteristics can better explain the seasonality and interannual variabilities of floods for most catchments however in recent decades the anthropogenic impacts on flood events have been gradually increasing with urbanization and intensification of human activities many studies show that urbanization leads to a tremendous transition in land use that could limit water infiltration and increase yield du et al 2015 jodar abellan et al 2019 papagiannaki et al 2015 wan mohtar et al 2020 the massive construction and operation of dams and reservoirs also have great impacts on flood events dams can store floodwaters temporarily and reduce the peak flow directly to provide flood control nakamura and shimatani 2021 and also have important impacts on groundwater evaporation and precipitation to exert influences on flood events chen et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 yet the mismatch between limited understandings of anthropogenic impacts and increasing intensification of human activities has limited our ability to implement flood management the yangtze river basin is an important economic focus and densely inhabited basin in china and suffers massive economic losses caused by floods wang et al 2021 due to the uneven social development and the great natural condition changes across the whole basin flood events vary greatly in spatial temporal characteristics dai et al 2021 gu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a yang et al 2021 this study aims to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of flood events and its impact factors across the yangtze river basin we first coupled the peak over threshold approach with an approach detecting the flood event start and end dates to separate flood events during 2008 2018 then a comprehensive flood behavior metric system including ten metrics of magnitude duration timing rate of change and flood forms was constructed to fully describe flood events and then to identify flood event classes the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was explored subsequently according to behavior similarity classification of numerous events further a contribution based impact factor analysis cbifa method

the modified flood event separation method 2 cluster flood events based on the behavior similarity by the k means clustering algorithm 3 reveal the spatial heterogeneity of individual flood events classes and 4 reveal impact factors of individual flood event classes using the cbifa method 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yangtze river 24 36 n 90 122 5 e area of approximately 1 8 106 km2 originates from tanggula mountain in qinghai province and finally flows into the east china sea fig 1 most sections of the basin situated within the subtropical monsoon region while the source region is located in the dry frigid high altitude zone annual precipitation varies between 300 and 2000 mm and exhibits strong spatial temporal variations due to the east asian monsoon liu et al 2020 influenced by the east asian monsoon rainfall concentrates in wet seasons between april and october and as a result floods mainly occur during this period zhang et al 2008 the whole yangtze river basin is geographically divided into the upstream the midstream and the downstream by yichang station and hukou station chen et al 2016 respectively the upstream has a high relief and is mountainous while the midstream and the downstream consist of vast fluvial plains several tributaries scatter in the yangtze river basin the yalong river the min and tuo river the jialing river and the han river are located on the north bank the wu river the dongting lake and the poyang lake are located on the south bank strong precipitation seasonality large topographic variability complex river tributaries lake relationship and uneven social development have led to great spatial heterogeneity of flood events in the yangtze river basin which bring great challenges to flood management measures wang et al

research framework is shown in fig 2 this framework consists of five parts including flood event separation flood behavior metric system construction cluster analysis spatial heterogeneity analysis and impact factor analysis the specific methods flood behavior metrics and impact factors were presented below in detail fig 2 can be inserted here 3 1 flood event separation method in this study the peak over threshold pot approach council 1981 coupled with an approach detecting the flood event start and end dates were constructed to separate flood events from daily runoff series the threshold of the pot approach was chosen iteratively to fulfill a target condition of about maximum 30 flood events per station fig 3 a ammar et al 2020 measures to ensure the independence of flood peaks can be described as follows council 1981 fig 3a 1 θ 5 ln a q min 0 75 min q 1 q 2 where θ days donates the interval time between two adjacent peaks a km2 is the basin area qmin m3 s is the minimum intermediate flow and q1 and q2 m3 s are two adjacent peaks the approach detecting the flood event start and end dates followed the concept that the discharge at the start or end date should fall below a threshold and the width of the interval between the peak and the start or end date should be as short as possible to keep two consecutive peaks independent it can be described as follows fig 3b 2 q s a q p d s d r and 3 q e a q p d e d r where qs qe and qp are the discharge of the start date end date and flood peak respectively a is the empirical parameter dr is the detection range ds and de are the time between the start date and the flood peak and the time between the end date and the flood peak respectively according to previous studies and vast practical attempts claps and laio 2003 vittal et al 2015 yue 2000 zhang et al 2021 a was set as 0 5 and the dr was set as 1 5 times θ another separation method fischer et al 2021 was employed to verify the flood event separation results for separated flood events with large differences between the two methods we manually selected the appropriate separated flood events incorporated with hydrological expert knowledge fig 3 can be inserted here 3 2 flood behavior metrics in this study ten flood behavior metrics table 1 were selected to fully describe flood events which belonged to five categories of magnitude duration timing rate of change and flood forms specifically flood duration fd flood volume fv and flood peak fp were commonly used to reflect temporal and magnitude characteristics of a flood event zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 timing of flood peak tfp was the time between the start date and the flood peak of a flood event rates of positive change and negative change rpc and rnc measured the mean rates of flood rising and recession processes larger rpc and rnc mean steeper flood hydrographs which bring difficulty to reservoir regulation coefficient of variation cv rate of flood rising time rfr normalized flood peak nfp and rate of discharge over 75 peak discharge rdo were used to describe the shape of flood hydrographs rfr was the ratio of time of flood rising processes to flood event duration and was used to identify early peaked or late peaked events nfp was defined as the ratio between fp and fv rdo was the proportion of the flood process with large discharge during a flood event detailed information is given in table 1 table 1 can be inserted here 3 3 cluster analysis the unsupervised k means clustering algorithm landuyt et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 was used to divide flood events into several classes davies bouldin index dbi and silhouette coefficient sc were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of resulting clusters the algorithm was applied for k 3 up to k 10 and this operation was repeated 10 000 times in each operation dbi and sc were calculated to detect the best clustering results the dbi and sc are calculated as follows 4 dbi 1 n i 1 n max j i σ i σ j d c i c j 5 sc b a max a b where ci is the cluster center of the ith cluster σi is the average distance between each point in cluster i and its center d is the distance between the cluster center ci and cj a is the average distance between the sample and other samples in the same cluster b is the average distance between the sample and other samples in a different cluster 3 4 flood influencing factors this study investigated the contributions of meteorological geographical vegetation soil and human activities factors to flood event variations thirteen factors table 2 including four precipitation characteristics i e cumulative precipitation cp maximum daily precipitation mdp antecedent wetness aw and normalized peak precipitation np and nine underlying surface factors i e slope sl elevation el drainage area da normalized difference vegetation index ndvi sand fraction sd silt fraction st clay fraction cy human regulatory capacity hrc and intensity of human activities iha were employed to investigate the impacts on individual flood event classes the factors cp and mdp were calculated on a daily scale and from the start day to the end day of the flood event the factor aw was also calculated at the daily scale but was calculated as the cumulative precipitation in the antecedent three days the values of other impact factors were the average values within the station controlled basins table 2 can be inserted here 3 5 correlation analysis and contribution identification spearman s rank correlation was used to analyze the correlations between the flood behavior metrics and the impact factors then the contribution based impact factor analysis cbifa method was proposed to identify the contributions of impact factors to individual flood event classes the cbifa method consisted of the variation contribution analysis and the shapley value in the variation contribution analysis the variance was adopted to assess information of flood events contained in the flood behavior metrics the contribution of a flood behavior metric to the flood event variations was calculated as follows li et al 2018 6 r i va r i i 1 m va r i 100 and 7 r r 1 r 2 r m where ri is the contribution of the ith flood behavior metric vari is the variance of the ith flood behavior metric m is the number of flood event metrics r is the contribution matrix of m flood behavior metrics the shapley value heuillet et al 2022 štrumbelj and kononenko 2014 originating from the n person game theory was used to partition the contributions of the impact factors to the flood behavior characteristics 8 ϕ i s n i p n p 1 n v s i v s and 9 φ ϕ 1 1 ϕ 1 2 ϕ 1 n ϕ 2 1 ϕ 2 2 ϕ 2 n ϕ m 1 ϕ m 2 ϕ m n where n is the number of impact factors v is the gain function s is a coalition of impact factors impact factors 1 p ϕ i is the contributions added by the new impact factor i based on the coalition s φ is the contribution matrix of n impact factors to m flood behavior metrics lastly the contributions of impact factors to the flood event variations were identified as follows 10 c r φ where c is the contribution matrix of impact factors to the flood event variations 4 results 4 1 flood event separation and classification 1132 flood events were separated from daily runoff series across the yangtze river basin fig 4 shows five representative hydrographs of flood events e g the single peak flood event the double peak flood event the multi peak flood event the sharp thin flood event and the dwarf fat flood event these hydrographs were selected from stations wanx yic baih xiant and dat respectively it can be found that the detected start dates of flood events were generally consistent with the runoff rising point and the detected end dates generally corresponded to our understanding of recession processes the five representative hydrographs of flood events were separated satisfactorily these results suggest that the flood event separation method can effectively capture flood hydrographs and can further obtain accurate flood behavior characteristics fig 5 shows the dbi and sc values of different class numbers the dbi results indicated that flood events in the yangtze river basin were well clustered into six classes increasing the number of clusters did not further improve this representation and even led to worse clustering results the sc results showed that the three flood event classes had the smallest sc value however significant differences still existed between flood events belonging to the same flood event class when flood events were divided into three classes while the differences were inconspicuous when flood events were divided into six classes hence based on the clustering results dbi and sc the flood events were clustered into six classes 4 2 flood behavior characteristics of individual flood event classes there were 351 233 58 208 48 and 234 flood events in class 1 6 respectively accounting for 31 00 20 58 5 12 18 37 4 24 and 20 67 of the total flood events fig 6 shows normalized hydrographs of these six classes of flood events and the black hydrograph represents the median of hydrographs in each class the hydrographs were similar in the same class but inter cluster dissimilarity was large flood events mainly occurred in the summer followed by autumn class 1 3 and 5 6 or spring class 4 besides obvious differences in magnitude existed among various flood event classes fig 7 fig 8 shows flood behavior characteristics and their standard deviations of individual flood event classes it can be found that standard deviations of most flood behavior metrics within the same flood event class were less than 0 1 in addition only rdo and fp in class 4 were larger than 0 2 which indicated that these two metrics of class 4 changed greatly class 1 was referred to as the long duration and small rate of change flood event type ldsct flood hydrographs were characterized by elongated falling limbs the metrics fv fp fd and tfp were the second largest among all classes while the metrics rpc and rnc were the second smallest class 2 was referred to as the sharp thin and short tail flood event type ststt the flood events showed steep rising limbs and relatively steep falling limbs of the flood hydrographs the metric fp was the smallest among all classes and the metric fv was the second smallest the metrics tfp and fd were small with an average of 4 70 days and 7 75 days class 3 and class 5 had similar flood hydrographs and were characterized by rather steep rising and falling limbs of flood hydrographs and large summits specifically in class 3 the metrics tfp and fd were the smallest among all classes with an average of 2 59 days and 5 34 days the metric rpc was the largest and the metric rnc was the second largest of which average values were 1 98 10 1 d 1 and 6 87 10 2 d 1 respectively the metric rfr was the smallest which meant that class 3 were early peaked events for class 5 the metrics cv rpc and nfp were the largest among all classes with an average of 0 92 1 16 10 1 d 1 and 0 41 the metric rnc was the second largest and only smaller than class 3 the metric fp was the second smallest and the metric fv was the smallest among all classes therefore we referred to class 3 and class 5 as the sharp thin and early peak flood event type stept and the small and sharp thin flood event type sstt respectively class 4 represented the flood events with large magnitude small variable long duration and small rate of changes and was referred to as the dwarf fat flood event type dft these flood events were characterized by both elongated rising and falling limbs and small summits the magnitude metrics i e fp and fv and the temporal metrics i e tfp and fd were the largest among all classes while the metrics describing rate of change i e rpc and rnc were the smallest in addition the metric rfr was the largest but the metric nfp was the smallest flood hydrographs of class 6 were characterized by steep rising limbs relatively elongated falling limbs and medium summits except for rdo rfr and tfp the remainder flood behavior metrics were the third or fourth largest among all classes therefore class 6 represented flood events with intermediate behavior characteristics and here was referred to as the conventional type ct 4 3 spatial heterogeneity of individual flood event classes fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of individual flood event classes ldsct class 1 occurred throughout the whole yangtze river basin except the stations guangy quanz and dat this class was mainly distributed in the midstream and downstream with flat terrain specifically flood events occurring in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin here refers to the region down the yibin city in the yangtze river basin the han river basin and the two lakes region accounted for 11 97 17 66 15 38 and 16 52 of ldsct in the min and tuo river basin and the wu river basin the proportions reached 13 39 and 11 11 respectively while in the jinsha river basin the yalong river basin and the jialing river basin the proportions were 5 13 5 98 and 2 85 respectively ststt class 2 mainly occurred in qinghai tibet plateau specifically 89 flood events occurred in the min and tuo river basin accounting for 38 20 of ststt and followed by the yalong river basin 27 04 and the jinsha river basin 25 75 only 5 58 and 2 15 of ststt occurred in the wu river basin and the han river basin while there was only one flood event occurring in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin the jialing river basin and the dongting lake basin it was worth noting that there were fewer ststt occurring in the station zhimd than in other stations in the jinsha river basin the spatial distribution of stept class 3 was similar to that of sstt class 5 and ct class 6 they mainly occurred in mountainous areas and hills in the middle and upper reaches 31 03 of stept occurred in the dongting river basin followed by the min and tuo river basin 29 31 the jialing river basin 18 97 the han river basin 10 34 the wu river basin 5 17 the poyang river basin 3 45 and the yalong river basin 1 72 sstt mainly occurred in the han river basin the dongting lake basin and the jialing river basin accounting for 37 50 27 08 and 25 00 of sstt only 6 25 and 4 17 of flood events occurred in the wu river basin and the poyang lake basin respectively different from stept and sstt 40 60 of ct occurred in the dongting lake basin followed by the jialing river basin 23 93 the poyang river basin 17 09 the han river basin 8 97 the wu river basin 6 41 and the min and tuo river basin 2 14 there was only one flood event occurring in the yalong river basin and the mainstream of the yangtze river basin there was no ct occurred in the jinsha river basin in the two lake area the number of ct increased from the downstream to the upstream dft class 4 was mainly distributed in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin and the downstream of the tributaries which was similar to ldsct different from ldsct few dft occurred in the upstream of the tributaries specifically 36 54 of dft occurred in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin followed by the han river basin 18 27 the dongting lake basin 12 02 the poyang lake basin 10 58 the wu river basin 8 17 the min and tuo river basin 6 73 the jinsha river basin 5 77 and the yalong river basin 1 92 no dft occurred in the jialing river basin it was worth noting that all flood events occurring in the dat station belonged to dft in addition the number of dft decreased from the downstream to the upstream across the whole yangtze river basin 4 4 impact factors of individual flood event classes fig 10 shows the correlation coefficients between flood behavior metrics and potential impact factors although there were correlations between flood behavior metrics and potential impact factors most of these correlations were not strong and were less than 0 4 for ldsct cp and mdp had positive correlations with cv np was positively correlated with rpc but negatively with tfp da hrc and iha showed positive correlations with fp and fv and particularly the correlation coefficients of da reached 0 83 for stsst cp was positively correlated with tfp but negatively with rdo np had a positive correlation with rpc and a negative correlation with tfp and fd da and hrc showed positive correlations with fp and fv and the correlation coefficients of da exceeded 0 7 particularly for stept only da and hrc showed positive correlations with rfr tfp fp and fv and negative correlations with cv and rpc the correlations between these two impact factors and the flood behavior metrics were also found in sstt and ct but the correlation coefficients were less than the coefficients of stept for sstt cp mdp and aw showed positive correlations with fp and fv np had a positive correlation with rpc but negative correlations with rfr and tfp for dft da showed a positive correlation with fp and fv and the correlation coefficients exceeded 0 8 the above analysis revealed that most impact factors had no significant correlations with flood behavior metrics in all flood event classes except for the geographic factor da the four meteorological factors and the human activities factor hrc fig 11 shows the contributions of impact factors to flood event variations fig 12 shows the triggering precipitation events and the antecedent wetness conditions of individual flood event classes for all flood event classes the meteorological factors were the most important impact factors which explained 30 23 68 10 of the total flood event variations especially for ststt and sstt the contributions of meteorological factors reached 68 10 and 58 56 which meant that meteorological factors were the dominant driver factors of these two flood event classes except for stept and dft np was the most important factor of the other four flood event classes accounting for 16 20 26 46 19 15 and 14 19 of flood event variations respectively one would expect that two sharp thin flood events i e stept and sstt were triggered by precipitation events with large np whereas dft and ldsct were triggered by precipitation events with small np cp was also an important factor and corresponded well with fv explaining 8 85 22 23 of the flood event variations flood events with large fv such as dft were triggered by precipitation events with large cp on the contrary ststt and sstt characterized by small fv were triggered by precipitation events with small cp however mdp did not correspond well with fp for example dft was characterized by very large fp while its triggering precipitation events were characterized by medium mdp this meant that except for precipitation basin attributes e g geographical soil vegetation factors and human activities also played important roles in flood events geographical factors were also important impact factors and accounted for 9 19 32 10 of the total flood event variations among the three geographical factors da was the most important factor and explained 3 15 22 85 of flood event variations especially for stept and dft da rather than meteorological factors was the most important factor and explained 15 14 and 22 85 of the total variations human activities factors were also important and explained 6 56 23 17 of the total flood event variations the two factors i e hrc and iha explained 11 36 and 11 81 of flood event variations in stept while their contributions did not exceed 10 in other flood event classes soil factors explained 9 19 19 34 of flood event variations the contributions of each soil factor were smaller than 10 vegetation factors only accounted for 2 56 5 31 of the flood event variations 5 discussion 5 1 flood event classification based on flood behavior metrics flood events classification based on various flood behavior metrics is an effective method to investigate spatial patterns of flood events and seek understanding of their controls different from the hydroclimatic and hydrological metrics brunner et al 2017 brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b sikorska et al 2015 stein et al 2020 tarasova et al 2020a tarasova et al 2020b the employed flood hydrographs based metrics in this study ensure that flood events with similar behavior metrics are hydrologically similar brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b zhai et al 2021 a novelty of our study lies in the construction of a comprehensive flood behavior metrics system describing the characteristics of magnitude duration timing rate of change and flood forms of flood events previous studies only adopted partial flood behavior characteristics to classify flood events which might lead to large intra class dissimilarity while some unadopted metrics e g rate of change flood forms have been proven important for flood event classification and flood hazards zhang et al 2020 in the present study the metrics tfp rpc and rfr were used to describe the characteristics of flood rising stages which can provide information for flood warning and reservoir operation karbasi et al 2018 tu et al 2020 combined with fd and rnc the characteristics of flood recession processes can be also outlined the metric rdo namely rate of discharge over 75 peak discharge was also included in the metric system which can help to describe the shape of the flood hydrograph nearby the peak in addition the common metrics e g fp fv cv and nfp describing flood behavior characteristics of magnitude and flood forms were still used the flood behavior metric system which describes both flood hydrography shapes and hydrological features comprehensively ensures that the subdivision of flood events into six flood event classes differs not only in their hydrograph forms but also in their magnitude and timing the results of flood event classification have large agreements and some inconsistencies with previous studies brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b nied et al 2014 zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in line with previous studies brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b zhai et al 2021 flood events in the yangtze river basin were also divided into fast intermediate and slow events it is clear that ststt stept and sstt belong to fast events while ldsct and ct belong to intermediate events and dft belongs to slow events however the identified flood event classes go beyond previous reports showing that a comprehensive flood behavior metric system can improve classification accuracy and reduce classification uncertainty even if ststt stept and sstt belong to fast events there are still significant differences between flood events of these classes the differences in the metrics rpc rnc rfr nfp and rdo can characterize the differences in flood hydrographs between these three flash floods similarly although ldsct and ct belonged to intermediate events there are still obvious differences in their hydrograph shapes and hydrological features the constructed flood behavior metric system captures these differences and helps to divide intermediate floods more finely the clustered six flood event classes show the existence of diverse flood generating mechanisms across the yangtze river basin resulting in diverse flood behavior characteristics and bringing great challenges for flood management however it is still feasible to implement unified flood management measures in the dry frigid high altitude zone due to the high concentration of ststt in the qinghai tibet plateau 5 2 contributions of impact factors to flood event variations distinct flood event classes result from different flood generating mechanisms archfield et al 2016 huang et al 2022 tarasova et al 2020a tarasova et al 2020b previous studies focused on the spatial patterns of flood generation mechanisms to guide regional flood management berghuijs et al 2019 berghuijs et al 2016 hall and blöschl 2018 nied et al 2014 but they did not go further to explore the control factors on these patterns which can deepen our understanding of flood generation mechanisms and make the achievement more flexible and applicable to other regions most impact factor analysis studies used meteorological factors especially precipitation snowmelt and antecedent wetness and geographical factors e g slope and elevation to explain the flood event variations sikorska et al 2015 stein et al 2020 yang et al 2020 which suggests that meteorological and geographical factors have been deemed the most important impact factors of flood events in advance jehn et al 2020 kuentz et al 2017 however the intensity of human activities has been gradually increasing with urbanization and economic development across the yangtze river basin and the great impacts of land use transition dam construction and reservoir operation on the hydrological cycle process have been proven wan mohtar et al 2020 jodar abellan et al 2019 du et al 2015 papagiannaki et al 2015 nakamura and shimatani 2021 the mismatch between limited understandings of anthropogenic impacts and increasing intensification of human activities has limited effective flood management to close this gap two impact factors i e hrc and iha were applied to investigate the impacts of human activities on flood events and we finally investigated contributions of thirteen natural and anthropogenic factors to the flood event variations in this study the results of impact factor identification tie well with previous studies brunner et al 2018a brunner et al 2018b wu et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 where the dominance of meteorological factors geographical factors and human activities factors are also revealed there is no doubt about the obvious influence of meteorological factors on flood events supported by multitudinous achievements huang et al 2022 jehn et al 2020 wu et al 2021 which identify the meteorological factors as the major controls but other impact factors as minor factors here a noticeable difference is that the drainage area also contributes significantly to the flood event variations and in stept and dft even the drainage area was the most important impact factor this is likely linked to the regulation of the drainage area on the confluence time and flood magnitude smith et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 the contributions of human activities ranged from 6 56 to 23 17 verifying the non ignorable impacts of human activities although urbanization has resulted in tremendous transition of land use the contributions of vegetation change are small and this finding is in accordance with findings reported by blöschl et al 2015 bronstert et al 2008 and merz et al 2021 the salient features of the source region of the yangtze river basin and the two lakes area namely the widespread distribution of glaciers snow and frozen soil and the existence of large lakes i e the dongting lake and the poyang lake respectively have resulted in complex flood processes here insights from yan et al 2019 vormoor et al 2015 2016 and szolgay et al 2016 which suggested that two types of floods i e rainfall induced and snowmelt induced floods existed in the seasonally snow covered regions help to explain the occurrences of ststt ldsct and dft in the source region although snowmelt can only cause a small number of flood events merz and blöschl 2003 yang et al 2020 the role of snowmelt in flood events is amplifying flood duration which could interpret the difference i e the short tail between ststt and the other two sharp thin flood event classes morán tejeda et al 2019 owing to the impermeability of the frozen soil layer bayard et al 2005 iwata et al 2018 ling and zhang 2007 runoff responds quickly to precipitation shanley and chalmers 1999 which contributes to the occurrence of sttst however due to the large drainage area and small precipitation fewer ststt occurred in the source region than in other regions of the qinghai tibet plateau both ldsct and ct were precipitation dominated classes and were the dominant flood event classes in the two lakes area this result demonstrates the significant impacts of precipitation on flood events in the eastern monsoon region lai and wang 2017 the transitions of dominant flood event class from ct in the upstream to ldsct dft in the downstream can be attributed to the changes in natural and anthropogenic conditions across the two lakes area hu et al 2007 jiahu et al 2007 liu et al 2019b the relative timing of peak flows between major recharging tributaries to a lake can significantly influence flood development li et al 2017 the huge flood regulation capacity of large lakes can store floodwaters temporarily to reduce the peak flow directly dai et al 2021 sun et al 2020 which contributes to the occurrences of ldsct dft the construction and operation of the three gorges dam have also been proven to change the flood regime of the river connected lakes but these impacts gradually weaken due to the increasing distance from the dam and the downstream interval inflow yang et al 2022 zhan et al 2015 diverse natural and anthropogenic conditions result in complex flood properties in the two lakes area and their comprehensive impacts need further study 5 3 limitations and uncertainties flood events with diverse behavior characteristics are complex physical processes with a high level of self organization arising from the co evolution of climate and underlying surface conditions jehn et al 2020 wu et al 2021 although the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was revealed by constructing a comprehensive flood behavior metric system to fully describe flood events and then to identify flood event classes our study still has the following limitations 1 assessing the impacts of glaciers snow and frozen soil is important for revealing flood generating mechanisms in the frigid and high altitude zone akstinas et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 while these impact factors such as snow coverage keller et al 2018 su et al 2020 and depth to the permafrost table rogger et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 were not included in this study due to limited data and difficulty in quantification 2 the combined impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors have increased with the intensification of human activities the undisclosed complex interaction mechanisms have limited accurate quantification of the contributions of individual natural and anthropogenic factors 3 eastern monsoons or global climate change also have influenced flood behaviors and these impacts need to be further revealed wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022b yun et al 2020 given the limitations highlighted future studies into the flood properties of the yangtze river basin should start with obtaining more detailed monitoring data particularly in basins with special climate or geomorphological attributes further research on the influence of natural anthropogenic interaction on flood events should be implemented to expand present achievements of spatial patterns of flood events 6 conclusion this study was conducted to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of flood events with diverse behavior characteristics across the yangtze river basin and further detect its impact factors for this purpose ten flood behavior metrics in five categories were used to comprehensively characterize flood events and then to identify flood event classes subsequently the spatial heterogeneity of flood events was analyzed according to behavior similarity classification of numerous events we further investigated the impacts of thirteen natural and anthropogenic factors on flood events using the cbifa method the major findings are listed as follows 1 1132 flood events were separated across the yangtze river basin these flood events were clustered into six flood event classes i e the long duration and small rate of change flood event type class 1 the sharp thin and short tail flood event type class 2 the sharp thin and early peak flood event type class 3 the dwarf fat flood event type class 4 the small and sharp thin flood event type class 5 and the conventional type class 6 there were 351 233 58 208 48 and 234 flood events in class 1 6 accounting for 31 00 20 58 5 12 18 37 4 24 and 20 67 of the total flood events 2 ldsct occurred throughout the whole yangtze river basin and mainly occurred in the midstream and downstream with flat terrain ststt mainly occurred in the qinghai tibet plateau stept sstt and ct mainly occurred in the mountainous areas and hills in the middle and upper reaches dft was mainly distributed in the mainstream of the yangtze river basin and the downstream of the tributaries 3 the meteorological factors cp mdp aw and np were the most important impact factors for all flood event classes and explained 30 23 68 10 of the total flood event variations followed by geographical 9 19 32 10 human activities 6 56 23 17 soil 9 19 19 34 and vegetation

1873,quantifying the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events is key in translating climate observations to planning and engineering design past efforts have mostly focused on the estimation of daily extremes using gauge observations recent development of high resolution global precipitation products now allow estimation of global extremes this research aims to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal behavior of precipitation extremes by calculating extreme precipitation return levels for multiple durations on the global domain using the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset both classical and novel extreme value distributions are used to provide insight into the spatial patterns of precipitation extremes our results show that the traditional generalized extreme value gev distribution and peak over threshold pot methods which only use the largest events to estimate precipitation extremes are not spatially coherent the recently developed metastatistical extreme value mev distribution that includes all precipitation events leads to smoother spatial patterns of local extremes for durations of 5 and 10 days however there are less events per year to fit the distribution 37 and 22 on average respectively leading to larger inter annual variability and possible overestimation of the extremes while the gev and pot methods predict a consistent shift from heavy to thin tails with increasing duration the mev method predicts a relatively constant heaviness of the tail for any precipitation duration opening up an important research question on what is the correct tail behavior of extreme precipitation for different durations the generated extreme precipitation return levels and corresponding parameters are provided as the global precipitation extremes gpex dataset these data can be useful for studying the underlying physical processes causing the spatiotemporal variations of the heaviness of extreme precipitation

contributor to natural disasters cred 2019 accurate estimates of the severity of intense precipitation events are needed for an enhanced disaster risk understanding such as that of floods and landslides the urgency of this is indicated as the first priority of the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction unsidr 2015 the accurate quantification of extremes is also necessary for infrastructure planning and design some countries already provide spatiotemporal estimates of extreme precipitation based on extreme value distributions evds for example for australia ball et al 2019 the netherlands beersma et al 2018 and the us e g perica et al 2015 2018 however many countries and regions do not have sufficient local data available gründemann et al 2018 kidd et al 2017 van de giesen et al 2014 such that spatially distributed extreme precipitation estimates are not possible several previous studies have developed global scale datasets of extreme precipitation courty et al 2019 calculated intensity duration frequency curves at the global domain and their scaling with different event durations using reanalysis data and the generalized extreme value gev distribution with fixed tail parameter dunn et al 2020 produced the hadex3 dataset which contains 29 generic precipitation and temperature indices although these indices are not based on evds furthermore this dataset has a coarse 1 25 latitudinal 1 87 5 longitudinal resolution with data gaps due to insufficient available gauge data other global studies mostly focused on examining which type of distribution is most suitable to capture the tail behavior of extreme precipitation cavanaugh and gershunov 2015 cavanaugh et al 2015 papalexiou et al 2013 in addition the spatial patterns of the parameter that controls the tail decay have been studied for the gev distribution papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 and the generalized pareto gp distribution serinaldi and kilsby 2014 however several issues remain to be addressed in order to obtain global domain extreme precipitation return levels 1 the choice of the dataset 2 the focus on daily extremes without considering sub daily extremes 3 the choice of the time blocks over which block maxima are determined and 4 the exploration of possible alternatives to the classical evds especially with respect to the tail behavior 1 several quasi global gridded precipitation datasets have been developed in recent years each with strengths weaknesses and uncertainties see sun et al 2018 beck et al 2019a and rajulapati et al 2020 for recent overviews of available datasets most of these datasets are based on gauge reanalysis or satellite sensor data notable examples of gauge based datasets include gpcc fdr becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2011 and regen contractor et al 2020 however gauges are extremely unevenly distributed across the globe kidd et al 2017 schneider et al 2014 and the number of active gauges has been declining in recent decades mishra and coulibaly 2009 satellite based products such as cmorph joyce et al 2004 gsmap ushio et al 2009 imerg huffman et al 2015 and persiann hong et al 2004 have a relatively high spatio temporal resolution however they do not cover regions outside of 60 n s and are only available from 2000 onwards which significantly hinders their use for extreme value analyses precipitation products with a true global coverage and long records are reanalyses such as era 5 hersbach et al 2020 jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 and merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 however reanalysis products tend to exhibit strong local and systematic biases in the magnitude and frequency of precipitation decker et al 2012 liu et al 2018 ménégoz et al 2013 2 global scale analyses of precipitation extremes are generally based on daily precipitation records cavanaugh et al 2015 koutsoyiannis 2004a b nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 papalexiou et al 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 in practice however multiple durations are needed for the design of infrastructure e g nissen and ulbrich 2017 or urban drainage networks e g mailhot and duchesne 2009 it is known that precipitation extremes of different durations scale differently with temperature wasko et al 2015 schleiss 2018 but little is known about the variation of evd location scale and tail parameters for different temporal resolutions studies that did derive extreme precipitation statistics for durations ranging from minutes to a few days have mostly focused on small regions zhao et al 2022a b mcgraw et al 2019 nissen and ulbrich 2017 overeem et al 2008 3 studies estimating return levels of extreme precipitation by using annual maxima typically use calendar years to delineate the annual periods from which maxima values are extracted e g de paola et al 2018 marani and zanetti 2015 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 villarini et al 2011 when the variable of interest is river discharge instead of precipitation however hydrological years are typically used instead of calendar years ward et al 2016 for discharge values this is important since peak discharge and flooding could occur during the transition from 31 december to 1 january and one event would be included in two calendar years although not often considered this could also happen for precipitation especially for longer duration extremes the annual maxima method could pick multiple values from a single rainy season that may for example be highly influenced by the el niño southern oscillation which is known to impact precipitation extremes allan and soden 2008 rasmusson and arkin 1993 4 the generalized extreme value gev distribution the most widely used evd is typically fitted through one of two approaches a using annual maximum precipitation series and maximum likelihood coles 2001 or l moment hosking 1990 estimation approaches or b using a peak over threshold pot method to fit a generalized pareto distribution to excesses above the threshold and a poisson process to the sequence of threshold exceedances coles 2001 in contrast to gev and pot the recently developed metastatistical extreme value mev distribution is fitted using all events with recorded precipitation instead of only the most severe the inclusion of more events reduces the uncertainty due to sampling effects which is important when dealing with short time series hu et al 2020 marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2018 2019a miniussi and marani 2020 zorzetto et al 2016 zorzetto and marani 2019 additionally gev parameter estimation depends heavily on a few large values which makes it very sensitive to the possible presence of outliers a relatively common occurrence in remote sensing estimates of precipitation amounts zorzetto and marani 2020 the gev tail behavior is controlled by its shape parameter which is very sensitive to sampling effects and the choice of the method used for estimation to overcome these problems some studies have suggested to use one universal value of the shape parameter that is applicable to the whole world koutsoyiannis 2004a b or a shape parameter value within a narrow range between exponential and heavy tail behavior papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 or one shape parameter per region that is similar within climate types and elevation ranges ragulina and reitan 2017 in this study we aim to overcome these issues partly by 1 using a precipitation dataset that merges gauge reanalysis and satellite data 2 estimating extremes for several event durations 3 using hydrological years in our analyses and 4 comparing results from three different extreme value methods gev pot and mev specifically we are interested in quantitatively characterizing the behavior of extreme precipitation and the spatiotemporal variation of extreme value distributional tails at the global domain 2 material and methods 2 1 data the global precipitation product used in this study is the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep v2 2 dataset mswep is particularly suited for our purpose due to its global coverage long temporal span high spatial and temporal resolution we used data from 1 january 1979 to 31 october 2017 at a 0 1 latitude 0 1 longitude resolution at 3 hourly time steps we selected all land cells between 90 n and 58 s for our analysis mswep precipitation estimates are derived by merging five different satellite and reanalysis based global precipitation datasets the dataset is one of the few precipitation products with daily as opposed to monthly gauge corrections applied using a scheme that accounts for gauge reporting times beck et al 2019b mswep has shown robust performance compared to other widely used precipitation datasets e g alijanian et al 2017 bai and liu 2018 beck et al 2017 2019a casson et al 2018 hu et al 2020 sahlu et al 2017 satgé et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 thus underlying its potential for improving the characterization of extreme precipitation worldwide we refer to beck et al 2019b for a comprehensive description of the dataset 2 1 1 quality control the integration of erroneous gauge observations into mswep v2 2 can occasionally result in implausible precipitation values therefore we implemented a three step quality control procedure on the 3 hourly data prior to the analysis we first discarded negative values which are physically impossible the second step was to discard outliers which we defined as values deviating from the mean by more than 30 standard deviations the number of 3 hourly blocks containing outliers per grid cell are included in supplementary material section 1 fig s1 we also discarded data surrounding the outliers for the same time step using a 11 11 grid cell window as erroneous gauge observations may have influenced surrounding cells in the production of the mswep dataset the 11 11 grid cell window was chosen based on the procedure used in mswep to merge gauges and other rainfall products beck et al 2019b in the third step we removed all years with 30 discarded days or 5 wet 3 hourly periods identified using a threshold of 0 2 mm 3 h 1 following wasko et al 2015 finally we only included in the analysis data from grid cells with at least 30 years of data remaining as a minimum record length of 30 years is customary and recommended for analyzing extremes arguez and vose 2011 kendon et al 2018 westra et al 2013 2 1 2 durations and identification of independent events the durations we selected for our analysis are 3 6 12 and 24 h and 2 3 5 and 10 days in order to create statistically independent precipitation events for multiple durations we first calculated the running parameter which is the minimum distance between two independent events fukutome et al 2015 to separate 3 hourly events and ensure independence for each precipitation event at each grid cell we followed the declustering method to limit the autocorrelation of the samples of marra et al 2018 in order to do so we calculated the temporal autocorrelation of the time series for each grid cell for time lags up to 10 days 10 days was deemed sufficient to allow the autocorrelation to drop to very low values and remove the correlation between two events the long lag noise for each time lag is the 75th quantile of the autocorrelation as in marra et al 2018 the resulting running parameter equals the first time lag at which the temporal autocorrelation is comparable to the long lag noise the running parameter is calculated for each grid cell for the 3 hourly duration we removed the blocks containing non zero rainfall within a correlation window and only kept the highest value for longer durations independent events satisfy two conditions 1 events are separated at least by the running parameter the length of the independence that was determined by declustering and 2 3 hourly blocks are only included once to ensure this 3 hourly blocks are summed together using moving windows to create intensities for longer durations then one of two cases arises a the running parameter is smaller than the duration then the event is already independent condition 1 we simply take the highest intensity in a moving window and remove all overlapping ones to satisfy condition 2 b the running parameter is greater than the duration we only take the highest value in the window of the running parameter condition 1 and remove all overlapping blocks condition 2 2 1 3 hydrological year a common challenge in global scale assessments is the delineation of the hydrological year given the regional variability in the climatological precipitation seasonality we therefore developed an uniform way to define the hydrological year to avoid splitting one rainy season over two different years we computed the median of the monthly precipitation for each grid cell and defined the start of the hydrological year to be the first day of the driest month supplementary material section 2 fig s2a shows the starting month of the hydrological year as determined by this method these data are also available in the gpex dataset gründemann et al 2021 as mswep v2 2 spans the interval from 1 january 1979 to 31 october 2017 we discarded the data prior to the start of the first hydrological year thus keeping 38 complete years only where the hydrological year starts in december there are just 37 complete years which occurs in 5 8 of the grid cells we also investigated whether there is a significant difference between the use of calendar and hydrological years for the estimated daily extremes for gev and mev the pot method is based on the values over a high threshold irrespective of when they occurred therefore there is by definition no difference in calculating the extremes using hydrological or calendar years for the pot method to determine the difference for gev and mev we first calculated the daily return levels for normal calendar years using the mswep data from 1979 to 2016 then we calculated the return levels for the same distributions and the same years by removing the months before the start of the hydrological year from the year 1979 and adding them to the year 2016 we did this in order to use the exact same data and ensure that the differences in the return level estimates are solely due to a different starting month 2 2 extreme value distributions three different extreme value distributions were fitted to the mswep data to calculate extreme precipitation return levels and to provide an indication of dependence of the spread in return levels as a function of the distribution used these three extreme value distributions are the gev pot and mev annual hydrological year maxima were used to estimate the three parameters of the gev using the l moments approach because of its robust performance for small samples hosking 1990 the gev cumulative distribution function cdf is given by 1 g z exp 1 ξ z μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 exp exp z μ σ ξ 0 with location parameter μ scale parameter σ 0 and shape parameter ξ the annual extremes estimated by gev are translated into those of the parent distribution following koutsoyiannis 2004a equation 3 as a second ev model we used a peaks over threshold approach describing precipitation accumulations exceeding a high threshold using a gp distribution while modeling the frequency of threshold exceedances using a poisson point process coles 2001 davison and smith 1990 this framework also yields gev as the resulting extreme value distribution which is then used to determine the quantile corresponding to a given return period the gp cdf is given by 2 h y 1 1 ξ y β 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp y β ξ 0 where y 0 are precipitation excesses over the threshold with β 0 and ξ the gp scale and shape parameters respectively a relevant aspect in applying the pot model is a suitable choice of the threshold used to define precipitation exceedances our global scale application requires studying the distribution of precipitation extremes across markedly different climatic regions thus excluding the adoption of a constant threshold value we studied the effect of the threshold choice using multiple selection methods on a global sample of grid cells see supplementary material section 3 and fig s4 our results showed that the choice of the method had a limited effect on the estimated return levels fig s4a we therefore chose to perform our global analysis by selecting for each cell a threshold value such that it is exceeded on average 3 times each hydrological year because of this choice the sample size available for fitting the gp distribution remains constant across different precipitation durations the method used to fit the parameters of the gp distributions was the probability weighted moments pwm e g see hosking and wallis 1987 the third model we used is the mev distribution hosseini et al 2020 hu et al 2020 marani and ignaccolo 2015 miniussi et al 2020a b zorzetto et al 2016 in the mev framework all ordinary precipitation events i e all events above a small threshold are used to infer the ev distribution the threshold we applied is 0 2 mm 3 h 1 coinciding with the earlier defined wet event weibull parameters were estimated for each hydrological year separately based on all wet events using the pwm method greenwood et al 1979 as done in zorzetto et al 2016 the mev weibull cdf is given by 3 ζ m x 1 m j 1 m 1 exp x c j w j n j where j is the hydrological year j 1 2 m c j 0 is the weibull scale parameter w j 0 is the weibull shape parameter and n j is the number of wet events observed in hydrological year j marani and ignaccolo 2015 2 2 1 observed return periods the mswep dataset analyzed here has 38 complete years of data therefore the empirical return period associated with the maximum value on record computed according to the weibull empirical frequency estimate is t observed 39 years however only 91 of all cells had 38 complete years of data so the maximum observed return period is sometimes lower for 7 of the cells only 37 complete years were available and for 2 of the cells 36 years or less were available however for simplicity we still refer to the corresponding maximum return level as t39 in the results 2 2 2 study areas in order to compare the three extreme value distributions we selected fourteen case study areas they collectively cover a wide range of climates and domain sizes the locations of which can be found in fig 3a within a single case study area we expect the precipitation estimates to be statistically homogeneous because of their precipitation generating mechanisms cavanaugh and gershunov 2015 cavanaugh et al 2015 elevation ragulina and reitan 2017 or average annual rainfall 2 2 3 tail behavior both the gev and mev distributions are flexible and can describe different tail behaviors the interpretation of the tail parameter of the two distributions differs as illustrated in supplementary material section 4 fig s5 for different combinations of scale and shape parameters the shape parameter ξ of the gev distribution obtained either through the annual maxima or pot approach encodes the nature of the tail of the distribution based on the value of ξ the gev can take one of three forms a positive gev shape parameter ξ 0 fréchet corresponds to a power law tail i e to a slowly decaying probability of large events this heavy tail behavior contrasts with the case of an exponential tail ξ 0 gumbel and with the case of a distribution with an upper end point which corresponds to negative values of the shape parameter ξ 0 inverse weibull the mev distribution assumes that precipitation events are weibull distributed the tail decay of this distribution is controlled by its shape parameter for w 1 its tail behavior is sub exponential i e heavier than that of an exponential recovered for w 1 albeit with a characteristic scale laherrere and sornette 1998 wilson and toumi 2005 for w 1 the weibull tail is super exponential with a fast decaying tail while still retaining an infinite upper end point hence the shape parameter of the weibull distribution encodes the propensity of a site to be subjected to large extreme events wilson and toumi 2005 zorzetto et al 2016 however the tail decay of the mev distribution is not only dependent on that of ordinary values through w but is also affected by the yearly number of events marra et al 2018 and by the inter annual variations of c j w j and n j whereas the tail behavior of gev and pot can easily be inferred from the shape parameter of their distributions for mev it depends on multiple parameters making direct comparison between mev and gev pot based on their parameters alone cumbersome in an effort to nonetheless compare these methods we have come up with a measure of heaviness that is based on the return levels themselves fig 1 it quantifies how much distributions differ from an exponential one for an exponential distribution the 100 year return level e100 is as follows e 100 t 1 b b where b blue arrows fig 1 is the difference between the 10 year t10 and 1 year t1 return level i e b t 10 t 1 for any distribution that differs from a purely exponential one the difference between the 100 year return level t100 and the 1 year return level t1 can be described as 4 t 100 t 1 b b a in this equation a red arrow in fig 1 is the additional increase caused by the heaviness of the tail a t 100 t 1 2 b fig 1 for any given extreme value distribution red dashed line in fig 1 a positive a is indicative of heavy tails and a negative a of thin tails for pure exponential tails blue dotted line in fig 1 it holds that a 0 the value for a is highly dependent on the local precipitation systems so we defined the heaviness amplification factor h t1 t10 t100 to be a normalization of a 5 h t 1 t 10 t 100 a b t 100 t 1 2 t 10 t 1 t 10 t 1 t 100 2 t 10 t 1 t 10 t 1 t 100 t 10 t 10 t 1 1 in words the meaning of h t1 t10 t100 is the fractional additional increase between t100 and t10 that is more than the increase that could be expected from a pure exponentially tailed distribution a distribution has a heavy tail for h 0 and a thin tail for h 0 here we chose a range for the heaviness metric over return periods from 1 to 100 years since these return levels are known to be mostly influenced by the underlying data rajulapati et al 2020 yet it should be noted that this metric may easily be adjusted to other return periods and other factors between the return periods for gev and pot the heaviness metric is independent of the return period range as long as the return periods are a factor 10 apart because it is solely determined by the shape parameter although for mev this heaviness metric is only valid for the return period range over which it is computed using other ranges t2 t20 t200 t5 t50 t500 and t10 t100 t1000 did not yield significant differences supplementary material section 5 6 fig s7 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological year fig 2 shows the frequency distribution of 1000 year return levels estimated using calendar and hydrological years for gev and mev the spatial distribution of the t1000 differences is presented in supplementary material fig s2b for gev and fig s2c for mev and fig s3 presents the frequency distributions of all analyzed return levels the difference between the return levels estimated using calendar or hydrological years is greatest when the hydrological year starts around april september as in the mediterranean middle east southern africa brazil indonesia and western us see supplementary material fig s2 this is the case because there are many different events included in hydrological compared to calendar years resulting in different events and annual maxima and therefore differences in the estimated extremes for mev the overall sensitivity in t1000 estimates remains lower than that of gev suggesting that regional sensitivity to the definition of block maxima can be quite significant for the gev approach on the other hand we found that in the case of gev quantiles the fraction of sites characterized by differences within 0 5 is larger than for mev when the hydrological year starts around november february it is only shifted by a few months so the annual maxima mostly stay the same between the calendar and hydrological years for gev this means that for many cells there is almost no difference in the t1000 estimates whereas for mev the difference is small 3 2 extreme precipitation estimates fig 3 shows the 100 year precipitation return levels for a 24 hour duration extreme value estimates for other durations and return periods are featured in the global precipitation extremes gpex dataset gründemann et al 2021 the spatial patterns of the extremes estimated by gev and mev are similar to zorzetto and marani 2020 their figure 9 while the spatial pattern of the underlying gev parameters are consistent with courty et al 2019 their figure 1 the global spatial pattern of return levels for the three ev methods is similar although large regional differences can be observed the gev and pot results are similar in magnitude and show similar differences when compared to mev the estimated precipitation extremes are generally lower for both gev and pot compared to mev quantiles mev estimates exhibit smooth spatial patterns whereas the spatial patterns using gev and pot are more irregular consistent with the results of zorzetto and marani 2020 for the conterminous us furthermore fig 3 reveals the presence of a large number of circular areas with heavier extremes corresponding to the location of gauges used for correcting precipitation estimates in the mswep algorithm beck et al 2019b the effect of these local corrections is much larger for traditional ev models pot and gev than for mev the reduced spatial coherence in patterns of extremes for gev and pot is particularly evident in the great plains of north america and in northern russia southeast asia and central africa in order to study the ability of the three distributions to capture the spatial coherence of precipitation extremes we calculated the coefficient of variation cv for fourteen study areas see fig 4 the cv is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is used to compare the relative variation between the study areas the higher the cv the higher the relative spread of the precipitation estimates within a spatial domain this figure shows quite similar behavior for gev and pot though pot has a slightly lower spread the cv for mev is generally lower which points to more spatially coherent t100 precipitation estimates based on single point time series with 38 years of training data the cv for all evds is higher for areas that are more arid e g bolivia mongolia namibia and oman to further investigate the global differences in magnitude between the three methods we examine the extremes for each distribution using a spatially weighted mean over the global land surface this is displayed for multiple return periods and durations as depth duration frequency curves fig 5 we first compare the maximum precipitation observed t39 observed the black dotted line in fig 5 in the dataset to the precipitation predicted from each distribution while locally the empirical t39 estimate could be very different from the true return level we expect the global average of this value to be representative of the true t39 for gev and pot we expected the estimated t39 to be close to the observed value since only the largest values are used to fit these distributions for mev we did not necessarily expect a good agreement for t39 but its performance should be better for return levels greater than the length of the observation time series marra et al 2018 2019b schellander et al 2019 zorzetto et al 2016 the results in fig 5 show that for the short duration events the observed t39 is close to the t39 for all three distributions for increasing durations the deviation between empirically observed and ev modeled t39 quantiles increases particularly for mev this could be because a smaller number of events per year is used for the fit of mev weibull whereas the number of events used for the fit of gev and pot remains constant for all durations both gev and pot show an underestimation and mev an overestimation this figure also shows again that the differences between gev and pot are small the global average estimated extremes for gev and pot are notably lower than for mev as was already visible from fig 3 this difference is more pronounced for larger return periods and longer durations one reason the quantiles estimated using mev are higher than using gev and pot is related to the increase in estimation uncertainty of weibull parameters and higher inter annual variability when the number of events per hydrological year is low miniussi and marani 2020 this is especially relevant in arid regions and for long durations figs 3 and 5 for instance for 5 and 10 day durations the average annual number of events is 37 and 22 events respectively it is therefore possible that this leads to an overestimation by mev to overcome this windows of two or more years could result in a better parameter estimation miniussi and marani 2020 3 3 tail behavior to better understand the differences between extremes estimated using the three methods we analyze their tail behavior using the heaviness amplification factor h t1 t10 t100 eq 5 fig 6 presents h t1 t10 t100 for a 24 hour duration worldwide for each of the three distributions we refer to figs s9 s15 in section 7 in the supplementary material for maps of h t1 t10 t100 for the other durations note that as expected the heaviness metric gives a near identical pattern for both gev and pot as compared to using their shape parameter directly but this is less similar for mev and its yearly mean shape parameter compare fig 6 to fig s6 both gev fig 6a and pot fig 6b exhibit a large spatial variability in addition to a low spatial coherence this makes it difficult to discern clear spatial patterns with the exception of a few notable regions for instance in the amazon h t1 t10 t100 is mostly negative suggesting a tail with an upper limit while in eastern and southern australia h t1 t10 t100 it is strongly positive denoting strong heavy tail behavior this map roughly corresponds to the spatial patterns of the gev shape parameter for daily precipitation shown by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 their figure 13 and ragulina and reitan 2017 their figure 4 as well as a metric based on the mean excess function nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 their figure 7a given the more similar results between these studies who used for a large part the same data we think that the differences with our maps are likely caused by using different underlying data rather than the particular heaviness metric we also find that for the gev and pot methods grid cells associated with heavy tails can be adjacent to cells with thin tails furthermore in 28 of the cells for daily precipitation gev and pot show a different type of tail heavy thin in the same grid cells this highlights the large uncertainty associated with estimating reliable tail parameters from short time series and the sensitivity of the gev and pot methods to sampling effects the heaviness of the mev distribution fig 6c shows a more coherent spatial pattern at virtually all grid cells the heaviness amplification factor h t1 t10 t100 eq 5 indicates heavy tail behavior and there is a high consistency within geographic regions and for all durations figures s8 s14 based on previous studies cavanaugh et al 2015 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 papalexiou et al 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 this predominantly heavy tail behavior of daily precipitation was expected and is well captured by mev there are also topographical patterns visible in the heaviness amplification factor fig 6c though they are not as clearly distinguishable as for the shape parameter itself fig s6 the heaviness tends to be higher in arid areas and lower in mountainous areas examples of arid areas with high heaviness include the sahara the namib and kalahari in africa the gobi thar and taklamakan in asia the atacama desert in south america large areas of southwestern australia and the arabian desert and other areas in the middle east this same pattern is to a lesser extent also visible for the heaviness of gev fig 6a and pot fig 6b at high elevations a small h t1 t10 t100 is usually found for mev fig 6c examples include the rocky mountains and the sierra madres in north america the northern andes and large areas of the brazilian highlands in south america the ethiopian highlands the scandinavian mountains and the tibetan plateau these spatial patterns are in contrast with what papalexiou et al 2018 their figure 6 found for hourly weibull tails in the usa where the heaviest tails are in the mountainous areas and the thin tails are in the south east however our results correspond well to ragulina and reitan 2017 their figure 4 who showed that heaviness decreases with elevation a comparison of the heaviness for different distributions and durations is presented as a boxplot in fig 7 for spatial maps of the heaviness for the different durations we refer to figures s8 s14 for gev and pot predominantly heavy tails are observed for short durations and thinner tails for long durations furthermore gev and pot both show a decreasing variability in the heaviness for longer durations indicated by both shorter whiskers and boxes the decrease of the heaviness of the tails for increasing durations is in line with the findings of cavanaugh and gershunov 2015 who found that longer duration extremes exhibit thinner tails for gev and pot the longer durations largely indicate tails with a finite upper end point in half of the cases for a duration of 10 days for gev and more than half for pot one implication of this finding is that when computing return levels for a single location see figures s4 and s15 it is possible for the largest return periods that shorter duration quantiles estimate a higher precipitation depth than the longer duration quantiles this is physically impossible see fig s16a b f and g and we should thus be extremely careful when interpreting such results mev on the other hand shows different heaviness patterns than gev and pot fig 7 and figures s8 s14 mev shows almost entirely heavy tail behavior which remains consistent across the range of durations examined furthermore also the variability for mev is constant across durations though with a slight increase for longer durations this is in line with fig 5 where the difference between the t39 observed and estimated with mev increases for the longest durations it could be that mev is overestimating these return levels of these largest durations a possible way to improve the estimations would be to group multiple years together as per miniussi and marani 2020 the mev distribution produces a spatially and temporally coherent heavy tail behavior based on a 38 years calibration sample and a single grid cell analysis this is a promising result as mev in contrast to the traditional methods analyzed provides a more spatially coherent picture of precipitation extremes without any prior hypothesis on its spatial structure for example through a spatial clustering scheme demirdjian et al 2018 in fact the spatial structure of the tail heaviness obtained through the mev analysis could be used as a measure of statistical homogeneity for regionalization studies 4 conclusions the aim of this research was to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal variation of global precipitation extremes and their associated extreme value distribution tails we have fitted three different extreme value methods gev pot and mev to a global precipitation dataset mswep v2 2 to estimate extreme precipitation return levels for eight durations in order to compare the tails of the three distributions we introduced a novel heaviness amplification factor h t1 t10 t100 eq 5 instead of using calendar years to delineate between different years we used hydrological years the start of which we defined as the driest month we demonstrated that there is a substantial difference in the extremes depending on the definition of yearly blocks used in the extreme value analysis fig 2 although there is no systematic bias we still recommend to apply the extreme value analyses for estimating extreme precipitation based on hydrological years in future studies our analysis indicates that this can be particularly relevant in the southern hemisphere and in regions characterized by marked seasonal cycles it is well known that the traditional gev and pot methods require very long data series for accurate estimation of the tail behavior and our study confirms that there is a low spatial coherence for the tail properties of both distributions fig 6a and b using just 38 years of training data the tail properties of the mev distribution are spatially more coherent fig 6c and hence the estimated return levels are more spatially coherent as well fig 3c this spatially coherent behavior consistent with previous results obtained over the conterminous us zorzetto and marani 2020 shows that the mev distribution is able to capture spatially consistent tail behavior from short time series and by a single grid cell analysis without any prior information on the spatial precipitation structures the analysis of the mev tail behavior reveals distinct spatial patterns as the heaviness appears to be controlled by climate zones and orography heavier tails are observed in arid areas and thinner tails in mountainous regions more in depth analyses are necessary to draw definite conclusions on what exactly controls the heaviness of extreme value distribution tails the performance of mev is promising for regions without long local precipitation records furthermore our study shows that the tail behavior captured by mev is coherent and heavy both spatially and temporally figs 6 7 and s8 s14 for gev and pot on the other hand the tail behavior decreases with increasing event duration resulting in a thin tail with a finite endpoint for about half of the cells for a duration of 10 days the correct relationship between heaviness and precipitation duration warrants further investigation we also conclude that both gev and pot generally underestimate the observed extremes whereas mev overestimates them fig 5 this occurs particularly for long duration extremes and large return periods for mev an explanation could be that there are fewer events per year used for the yearly distribution fits resulting in larger interannual variability and thus overestimation of extremes we do consider it likely however that the results could be improved for instance by changing the event threshold or by fitting the weibull distribution over two or more years for dry areas miniussi and marani 2020 so as to reduce inter annual variability of the parameters due to samples of limited length our results suggest that this issue is particularly relevant at the longest durations examined for gev and pot the spatial consistency of the results could also be improved by adopting spatial extreme models davison et al 2012 huser and wadsworth 2020 the data generated for this study are openly available as the gpex dataset gründemann et al 2021 these data include extreme precipitation return levels and extreme value distribution parameters for durations between 3 h and 10 days at a global gridded 0 1 resolution they could be used by engineers as a reference of precipitation extremes for data scarce regions in particular for scientific purposes all underlying parameters are also available and can be used to answer several outstanding questions such as what are the controls on the tail behavior of extremes and what is driving the different changes in tail heaviness with duration for gev pot and mev data and code availability the gpex dataset is available at the 4tu repository gründemann et al 2021 the

1873,quantifying the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events is key in translating climate observations to planning and engineering design past efforts have mostly focused on the estimation of daily extremes using gauge observations recent development of high resolution global precipitation products now allow estimation of global extremes this research aims to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal behavior of precipitation extremes by calculating extreme precipitation return levels for multiple durations on the global domain using the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset both classical and novel extreme value distributions are used to provide insight into the spatial patterns of precipitation extremes our results show that the traditional generalized extreme value gev distribution and peak over threshold pot methods which only use the largest events to estimate precipitation extremes are not spatially coherent the recently developed metastatistical extreme value mev distribution that includes all precipitation events leads to smoother spatial patterns of local extremes for durations of 5 and 10 days however there are less events per year to fit the distribution 37 and 22 on average respectively leading to larger inter annual variability and possible overestimation of the extremes while the gev and pot methods predict a consistent shift from heavy to thin tails with increasing duration the mev method predicts a relatively constant heaviness of the tail for any precipitation duration opening up an important research question on what is the correct tail behavior of extreme precipitation for different durations the generated extreme precipitation return levels and corresponding parameters are provided as the global precipitation extremes gpex dataset these data can be useful for studying the underlying physical processes causing the spatiotemporal variations of the heaviness of extreme precipitation

contributor to natural disasters cred 2019 accurate estimates of the severity of intense precipitation events are needed for an enhanced disaster risk understanding such as that of floods and landslides the urgency of this is indicated as the first priority of the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction unsidr 2015 the accurate quantification of extremes is also necessary for infrastructure planning and design some countries already provide spatiotemporal estimates of extreme precipitation based on extreme value distributions evds for example for australia ball et al 2019 the netherlands beersma et al 2018 and the us e g perica et al 2015 2018 however many countries and regions do not have sufficient local data available gründemann et al 2018 kidd et al 2017 van de giesen et al 2014 such that spatially distributed extreme precipitation estimates are not possible several previous studies have developed global scale datasets of extreme precipitation courty et al 2019 calculated intensity duration frequency curves at the global domain and their scaling with different event durations using reanalysis data and the generalized extreme value gev distribution with fixed tail parameter dunn et al 2020 produced the hadex3 dataset which contains 29 generic precipitation and temperature indices although these indices are not based on evds furthermore this dataset has a coarse 1 25 latitudinal 1 87 5 longitudinal resolution with data gaps due to insufficient available gauge data other global studies mostly focused on examining which type of distribution is most suitable to capture the tail behavior of extreme precipitation cavanaugh and gershunov 2015 cavanaugh et al 2015 papalexiou et al 2013 in addition the spatial patterns of the parameter that controls the tail decay have been studied for the gev distribution papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 and the generalized pareto gp distribution serinaldi and kilsby 2014 however several issues remain to be addressed in order to obtain global domain extreme precipitation return levels 1 the choice of the dataset 2 the focus on daily extremes without considering sub daily extremes 3 the choice of the time blocks over which block maxima are determined and 4 the exploration of possible alternatives to the classical evds especially with respect to the tail behavior 1 several quasi global gridded precipitation datasets have been developed in recent years each with strengths weaknesses and uncertainties see sun et al 2018 beck et al 2019a and rajulapati et al 2020 for recent overviews of available datasets most of these datasets are based on gauge reanalysis or satellite sensor data notable examples of gauge based datasets include gpcc fdr becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2011 and regen contractor et al 2020 however gauges are extremely unevenly distributed across the globe kidd et al 2017 schneider et al 2014 and the number of active gauges has been declining in recent decades mishra and coulibaly 2009 satellite based products such as cmorph joyce et al 2004 gsmap ushio et al 2009 imerg huffman et al 2015 and persiann hong et al 2004 have a relatively high spatio temporal resolution however they do not cover regions outside of 60 n s and are only available from 2000 onwards which significantly hinders their use for extreme value analyses precipitation products with a true global coverage and long records are reanalyses such as era 5 hersbach et al 2020 jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 and merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 however reanalysis products tend to exhibit strong local and systematic biases in the magnitude and frequency of precipitation decker et al 2012 liu et al 2018 ménégoz et al 2013 2 global scale analyses of precipitation extremes are generally based on daily precipitation records cavanaugh et al 2015 koutsoyiannis 2004a b nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 papalexiou et al 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 in practice however multiple durations are needed for the design of infrastructure e g nissen and ulbrich 2017 or urban drainage networks e g mailhot and duchesne 2009 it is known that precipitation extremes of different durations scale differently with temperature wasko et al 2015 schleiss 2018 but little is known about the variation of evd location scale and tail parameters for different temporal resolutions studies that did derive extreme precipitation statistics for durations ranging from minutes to a few days have mostly focused on small regions zhao et al 2022a b mcgraw et al 2019 nissen and ulbrich 2017 overeem et al 2008 3 studies estimating return levels of extreme precipitation by using annual maxima typically use calendar years to delineate the annual periods from which maxima values are extracted e g de paola et al 2018 marani and zanetti 2015 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 villarini et al 2011 when the variable of interest is river discharge instead of precipitation however hydrological years are typically used instead of calendar years ward et al 2016 for discharge values this is important since peak discharge and flooding could occur during the transition from 31 december to 1 january and one event would be included in two calendar years although not often considered this could also happen for precipitation especially for longer duration extremes the annual maxima method could pick multiple values from a single rainy season that may for example be highly influenced by the el niño southern oscillation which is known to impact precipitation extremes allan and soden 2008 rasmusson and arkin 1993 4 the generalized extreme value gev distribution the most widely used evd is typically fitted through one of two approaches a using annual maximum precipitation series and maximum likelihood coles 2001 or l moment hosking 1990 estimation approaches or b using a peak over threshold pot method to fit a generalized pareto distribution to excesses above the threshold and a poisson process to the sequence of threshold exceedances coles 2001 in contrast to gev and pot the recently developed metastatistical extreme value mev distribution is fitted using all events with recorded precipitation instead of only the most severe the inclusion of more events reduces the uncertainty due to sampling effects which is important when dealing with short time series hu et al 2020 marani and ignaccolo 2015 marra et al 2018 2019a miniussi and marani 2020 zorzetto et al 2016 zorzetto and marani 2019 additionally gev parameter estimation depends heavily on a few large values which makes it very sensitive to the possible presence of outliers a relatively common occurrence in remote sensing estimates of precipitation amounts zorzetto and marani 2020 the gev tail behavior is controlled by its shape parameter which is very sensitive to sampling effects and the choice of the method used for estimation to overcome these problems some studies have suggested to use one universal value of the shape parameter that is applicable to the whole world koutsoyiannis 2004a b or a shape parameter value within a narrow range between exponential and heavy tail behavior papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 or one shape parameter per region that is similar within climate types and elevation ranges ragulina and reitan 2017 in this study we aim to overcome these issues partly by 1 using a precipitation dataset that merges gauge reanalysis and satellite data 2 estimating extremes for several event durations 3 using hydrological years in our analyses and 4 comparing results from three different extreme value methods gev pot and mev specifically we are interested in quantitatively characterizing the behavior of extreme precipitation and the spatiotemporal variation of extreme value distributional tails at the global domain 2 material and methods 2 1 data the global precipitation product used in this study is the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep v2 2 dataset mswep is particularly suited for our purpose due to its global coverage long temporal span high spatial and temporal resolution we used data from 1 january 1979 to 31 october 2017 at a 0 1 latitude 0 1 longitude resolution at 3 hourly time steps we selected all land cells between 90 n and 58 s for our analysis mswep precipitation estimates are derived by merging five different satellite and reanalysis based global precipitation datasets the dataset is one of the few precipitation products with daily as opposed to monthly gauge corrections applied using a scheme that accounts for gauge reporting times beck et al 2019b mswep has shown robust performance compared to other widely used precipitation datasets e g alijanian et al 2017 bai and liu 2018 beck et al 2017 2019a casson et al 2018 hu et al 2020 sahlu et al 2017 satgé et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 thus underlying its potential for improving the characterization of extreme precipitation worldwide we refer to beck et al 2019b for a comprehensive description of the dataset 2 1 1 quality control the integration of erroneous gauge observations into mswep v2 2 can occasionally result in implausible precipitation values therefore we implemented a three step quality control procedure on the 3 hourly data prior to the analysis we first discarded negative values which are physically impossible the second step was to discard outliers which we defined as values deviating from the mean by more than 30 standard deviations the number of 3 hourly blocks containing outliers per grid cell are included in supplementary material section 1 fig s1 we also discarded data surrounding the outliers for the same time step using a 11 11 grid cell window as erroneous gauge observations may have influenced surrounding cells in the production of the mswep dataset the 11 11 grid cell window was chosen based on the procedure used in mswep to merge gauges and other rainfall products beck et al 2019b in the third step we removed all years with 30 discarded days or 5 wet 3 hourly periods identified using a threshold of 0 2 mm 3 h 1 following wasko et al 2015 finally we only included in the analysis data from grid cells with at least 30 years of data remaining as a minimum record length of 30 years is customary and recommended for analyzing extremes arguez and vose 2011 kendon et al 2018 westra et al 2013 2 1 2 durations and identification of independent events the durations we selected for our analysis are 3 6 12 and 24 h and 2 3 5 and 10 days in order to create statistically independent precipitation events for multiple durations we first calculated the running parameter which is the minimum distance between two independent events fukutome et al 2015 to separate 3 hourly events and ensure independence for each precipitation event at each grid cell we followed the declustering method to limit the autocorrelation of the samples of marra et al 2018 in order to do so we calculated the temporal autocorrelation of the time series for each grid cell for time lags up to 10 days 10 days was deemed sufficient to allow the autocorrelation to drop to very low values and remove the correlation between two events the long lag noise for each time lag is the 75th quantile of the autocorrelation as in marra et al 2018 the resulting running parameter equals the first time lag at which the temporal autocorrelation is comparable to the long lag noise the running parameter is calculated for each grid cell for the 3 hourly duration we removed the blocks containing non zero rainfall within a correlation window and only kept the highest value for longer durations independent events satisfy two conditions 1 events are separated at least by the running parameter the length of the independence that was determined by declustering and 2 3 hourly blocks are only included once to ensure this 3 hourly blocks are summed together using moving windows to create intensities for longer durations then one of two cases arises a the running parameter is smaller than the duration then the event is already independent condition 1 we simply take the highest intensity in a moving window and remove all overlapping ones to satisfy condition 2 b the running parameter is greater than the duration we only take the highest value in the window of the running parameter condition 1 and remove all overlapping blocks condition 2 2 1 3 hydrological year a common challenge in global scale assessments is the delineation of the hydrological year given the regional variability in the climatological precipitation seasonality we therefore developed an uniform way to define the hydrological year to avoid splitting one rainy season over two different years we computed the median of the monthly precipitation for each grid cell and defined the start of the hydrological year to be the first day of the driest month supplementary material section 2 fig s2a shows the starting month of the hydrological year as determined by this method these data are also available in the gpex dataset gründemann et al 2021 as mswep v2 2 spans the interval from 1 january 1979 to 31 october 2017 we discarded the data prior to the start of the first hydrological year thus keeping 38 complete years only where the hydrological year starts in december there are just 37 complete years which occurs in 5 8 of the grid cells we also investigated whether there is a significant difference between the use of calendar and hydrological years for the estimated daily extremes for gev and mev the pot method is based on the values over a high threshold irrespective of when they occurred therefore there is by definition no difference in calculating the extremes using hydrological or calendar years for the pot method to determine the difference for gev and mev we first calculated the daily return levels for normal calendar years using the mswep data from 1979 to 2016 then we calculated the return levels for the same distributions and the same years by removing the months before the start of the hydrological year from the year 1979 and adding them to the year 2016 we did this in order to use the exact same data and ensure that the differences in the return level estimates are solely due to a different starting month 2 2 extreme value distributions three different extreme value distributions were fitted to the mswep data to calculate extreme precipitation return levels and to provide an indication of dependence of the spread in return levels as a function of the distribution used these three extreme value distributions are the gev pot and mev annual hydrological year maxima were used to estimate the three parameters of the gev using the l moments approach because of its robust performance for small samples hosking 1990 the gev cumulative distribution function cdf is given by 1 g z exp 1 ξ z μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 exp exp z μ σ ξ 0 with location parameter μ scale parameter σ 0 and shape parameter ξ the annual extremes estimated by gev are translated into those of the parent distribution following koutsoyiannis 2004a equation 3 as a second ev model we used a peaks over threshold approach describing precipitation accumulations exceeding a high threshold using a gp distribution while modeling the frequency of threshold exceedances using a poisson point process coles 2001 davison and smith 1990 this framework also yields gev as the resulting extreme value distribution which is then used to determine the quantile corresponding to a given return period the gp cdf is given by 2 h y 1 1 ξ y β 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp y β ξ 0 where y 0 are precipitation excesses over the threshold with β 0 and ξ the gp scale and shape parameters respectively a relevant aspect in applying the pot model is a suitable choice of the threshold used to define precipitation exceedances our global scale application requires studying the distribution of precipitation extremes across markedly different climatic regions thus excluding the adoption of a constant threshold value we studied the effect of the threshold choice using multiple selection methods on a global sample of grid cells see supplementary material section 3 and fig s4 our results showed that the choice of the method had a limited effect on the estimated return levels fig s4a we therefore chose to perform our global analysis by selecting for each cell a threshold value such that it is exceeded on average 3 times each hydrological year because of this choice the sample size available for fitting the gp distribution remains constant across different precipitation durations the method used to fit the parameters of the gp distributions was the probability weighted moments pwm e g see hosking and wallis 1987 the third model we used is the mev distribution hosseini et al 2020 hu et al 2020 marani and ignaccolo 2015 miniussi et al 2020a b zorzetto et al 2016 in the mev framework all ordinary precipitation events i e all events above a small threshold are used to infer the ev distribution the threshold we applied is 0 2 mm 3 h 1 coinciding with the earlier defined wet event weibull parameters were estimated for each hydrological year separately based on all wet events using the pwm method greenwood et al 1979 as done in zorzetto et al 2016 the mev weibull cdf is given by 3 ζ m x 1 m j 1 m 1 exp x c j w j n j where j is the hydrological year j 1 2 m c j 0 is the weibull scale parameter w j 0 is the weibull shape parameter and n j is the number of wet events observed in hydrological year j marani and ignaccolo 2015 2 2 1 observed return periods the mswep dataset analyzed here has 38 complete years of data therefore the empirical return period associated with the maximum value on record computed according to the weibull empirical frequency estimate is t observed 39 years however only 91 of all cells had 38 complete years of data so the maximum observed return period is sometimes lower for 7 of the cells only 37 complete years were available and for 2 of the cells 36 years or less were available however for simplicity we still refer to the corresponding maximum return level as t39 in the results 2 2 2 study areas in order to compare the three extreme value distributions we selected fourteen case study areas they collectively cover a wide range of climates and domain sizes the locations of which can be found in fig 3a within a single case study area we expect the precipitation estimates to be statistically homogeneous because of their precipitation generating mechanisms cavanaugh and gershunov 2015 cavanaugh et al 2015 elevation ragulina and reitan 2017 or average annual rainfall 2 2 3 tail behavior both the gev and mev distributions are flexible and can describe different tail behaviors the interpretation of the tail parameter of the two distributions differs as illustrated in supplementary material section 4 fig s5 for different combinations of scale and shape parameters the shape parameter ξ of the gev distribution obtained either through the annual maxima or pot approach encodes the nature of the tail of the distribution based on the value of ξ the gev can take one of three forms a positive gev shape parameter ξ 0 fréchet corresponds to a power law tail i e to a slowly decaying probability of large events this heavy tail behavior contrasts with the case of an exponential tail ξ 0 gumbel and with the case of a distribution with an upper end point which corresponds to negative values of the shape parameter ξ 0 inverse weibull the mev distribution assumes that precipitation events are weibull distributed the tail decay of this distribution is controlled by its shape parameter for w 1 its tail behavior is sub exponential i e heavier than that of an exponential recovered for w 1 albeit with a characteristic scale laherrere and sornette 1998 wilson and toumi 2005 for w 1 the weibull tail is super exponential with a fast decaying tail while still retaining an infinite upper end point hence the shape parameter of the weibull distribution encodes the propensity of a site to be subjected to large extreme events wilson and toumi 2005 zorzetto et al 2016 however the tail decay of the mev distribution is not only dependent on that of ordinary values through w but is also affected by the yearly number of events marra et al 2018 and by the inter annual variations of c j w j and n j whereas the tail behavior of gev and pot can easily be inferred from the shape parameter of their distributions for mev it depends on multiple parameters making direct comparison between mev and gev pot based on their parameters alone cumbersome in an effort to nonetheless compare these methods we have come up with a measure of heaviness that is based on the return levels themselves fig 1 it quantifies how much distributions differ from an exponential one for an exponential distribution the 100 year return level e100 is as follows e 100 t 1 b b where b blue arrows fig 1 is the difference between the 10 year t10 and 1 year t1 return level i e b t 10 t 1 for any distribution that differs from a purely exponential one the difference between the 100 year return level t100 and the 1 year return level t1 can be described as 4 t 100 t 1 b b a in this equation a red arrow in fig 1 is the additional increase caused by the heaviness of the tail a t 100 t 1 2 b fig 1 for any given extreme value distribution red dashed line in fig 1 a positive a is indicative of heavy tails and a negative a of thin tails for pure exponential tails blue dotted line in fig 1 it holds that a 0 the value for a is highly dependent on the local precipitation systems so we defined the heaviness amplification factor h t1 t10 t100 to be a normalization of a 5 h t 1 t 10 t 100 a b t 100 t 1 2 t 10 t 1 t 10 t 1 t 100 2 t 10 t 1 t 10 t 1 t 100 t 10 t 10 t 1 1 in words the meaning of h t1 t10 t100 is the fractional additional increase between t100 and t10 that is more than the increase that could be expected from a pure exponentially tailed distribution a distribution has a heavy tail for h 0 and a thin tail for h 0 here we chose a range for the heaviness metric over return periods from 1 to 100 years since these return levels are known to be mostly influenced by the underlying data rajulapati et al 2020 yet it should be noted that this metric may easily be adjusted to other return periods and other factors between the return periods for gev and pot the heaviness metric is independent of the return period range as long as the return periods are a factor 10 apart because it is solely determined by the shape parameter although for mev this heaviness metric is only valid for the return period range over which it is computed using other ranges t2 t20 t200 t5 t50 t500 and t10 t100 t1000 did not yield significant differences supplementary material section 5 6 fig s7 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological year fig 2 shows the frequency distribution of 1000 year return levels estimated using calendar and hydrological years for gev and mev the spatial distribution of the t1000 differences is presented in supplementary material fig s2b for gev and fig s2c for mev and fig s3 presents the frequency distributions of all analyzed return levels the difference between the return levels estimated using calendar or hydrological years is greatest when the hydrological year starts around april september as in the mediterranean middle east southern africa brazil indonesia and western us see supplementary material fig s2 this is the case because there are many different events included in hydrological compared to calendar years resulting in different events and annual maxima and therefore differences in the estimated extremes for mev the overall sensitivity in t1000 estimates remains lower than that of gev suggesting that regional sensitivity to the definition of block maxima can be quite significant for the gev approach on the other hand we found that in the case of gev quantiles the fraction of sites characterized by differences within 0 5 is larger than for mev when the hydrological year starts around november february it is only shifted by a few months so the annual maxima mostly stay the same between the calendar and hydrological years for gev this means that for many cells there is almost no difference in the t1000 estimates whereas for mev the difference is small 3 2 extreme precipitation estimates fig 3 shows the 100 year precipitation return levels for a 24 hour duration extreme value estimates for other durations and return periods are featured in the global precipitation extremes gpex dataset gründemann et al 2021 the spatial patterns of the extremes estimated by gev and mev are similar to zorzetto and marani 2020 their figure 9 while the spatial pattern of the underlying gev parameters are consistent with courty et al 2019 their figure 1 the global spatial pattern of return levels for the three ev methods is similar although large regional differences can be observed the gev and pot results are similar in magnitude and show similar differences when compared to mev the estimated precipitation extremes are generally lower for both gev and pot compared to mev quantiles mev estimates exhibit smooth spatial patterns whereas the spatial patterns using gev and pot are more irregular consistent with the results of zorzetto and marani 2020 for the conterminous us furthermore fig 3 reveals the presence of a large number of circular areas with heavier extremes corresponding to the location of gauges used for correcting precipitation estimates in the mswep algorithm beck et al 2019b the effect of these local corrections is much larger for traditional ev models pot and gev than for mev the reduced spatial coherence in patterns of extremes for gev and pot is particularly evident in the great plains of north america and in northern russia southeast asia and central africa in order to study the ability of the three distributions to capture the spatial coherence of precipitation extremes we calculated the coefficient of variation cv for fourteen study areas see fig 4 the cv is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is used to compare the relative variation between the study areas the higher the cv the higher the relative spread of the precipitation estimates within a spatial domain this figure shows quite similar behavior for gev and pot though pot has a slightly lower spread the cv for mev is generally lower which points to more spatially coherent t100 precipitation estimates based on single point time series with 38 years of training data the cv for all evds is higher for areas that are more arid e g bolivia mongolia namibia and oman to further investigate the global differences in magnitude between the three methods we examine the extremes for each distribution using a spatially weighted mean over the global land surface this is displayed for multiple return periods and durations as depth duration frequency curves fig 5 we first compare the maximum precipitation observed t39 observed the black dotted line in fig 5 in the dataset to the precipitation predicted from each distribution while locally the empirical t39 estimate could be very different from the true return level we expect the global average of this value to be representative of the true t39 for gev and pot we expected the estimated t39 to be close to the observed value since only the largest values are used to fit these distributions for mev we did not necessarily expect a good agreement for t39 but its performance should be better for return levels greater than the length of the observation time series marra et al 2018 2019b schellander et al 2019 zorzetto et al 2016 the results in fig 5 show that for the short duration events the observed t39 is close to the t39 for all three distributions for increasing durations the deviation between empirically observed and ev modeled t39 quantiles increases particularly for mev this could be because a smaller number of events per year is used for the fit of mev weibull whereas the number of events used for the fit of gev and pot remains constant for all durations both gev and pot show an underestimation and mev an overestimation this figure also shows again that the differences between gev and pot are small the global average estimated extremes for gev and pot are notably lower than for mev as was already visible from fig 3 this difference is more pronounced for larger return periods and longer durations one reason the quantiles estimated using mev are higher than using gev and pot is related to the increase in estimation uncertainty of weibull parameters and higher inter annual variability when the number of events per hydrological year is low miniussi and marani 2020 this is especially relevant in arid regions and for long durations figs 3 and 5 for instance for 5 and 10 day durations the average annual number of events is 37 and 22 events respectively it is therefore possible that this leads to an overestimation by mev to overcome this windows of two or more years could result in a better parameter estimation miniussi and marani 2020 3 3 tail behavior to better understand the differences between extremes estimated using the three methods we analyze their tail behavior using the heaviness amplification factor h t1 t10 t100 eq 5 fig 6 presents h t1 t10 t100 for a 24 hour duration worldwide for each of the three distributions we refer to figs s9 s15 in section 7 in the supplementary material for maps of h t1 t10 t100 for the other durations note that as expected the heaviness metric gives a near identical pattern for both gev and pot as compared to using their shape parameter directly but this is less similar for mev and its yearly mean shape parameter compare fig 6 to fig s6 both gev fig 6a and pot fig 6b exhibit a large spatial variability in addition to a low spatial coherence this makes it difficult to discern clear spatial patterns with the exception of a few notable regions for instance in the amazon h t1 t10 t100 is mostly negative suggesting a tail with an upper limit while in eastern and southern australia h t1 t10 t100 it is strongly positive denoting strong heavy tail behavior this map roughly corresponds to the spatial patterns of the gev shape parameter for daily precipitation shown by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 their figure 13 and ragulina and reitan 2017 their figure 4 as well as a metric based on the mean excess function nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 their figure 7a given the more similar results between these studies who used for a large part the same data we think that the differences with our maps are likely caused by using different underlying data rather than the particular heaviness metric we also find that for the gev and pot methods grid cells associated with heavy tails can be adjacent to cells with thin tails furthermore in 28 of the cells for daily precipitation gev and pot show a different type of tail heavy thin in the same grid cells this highlights the large uncertainty associated with estimating reliable tail parameters from short time series and the sensitivity of the gev and pot methods to sampling effects the heaviness of the mev distribution fig 6c shows a more coherent spatial pattern at virtually all grid cells the heaviness amplification factor h t1 t10 t100 eq 5 indicates heavy tail behavior and there is a high consistency within geographic regions and for all durations figures s8 s14 based on previous studies cavanaugh et al 2015 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 papalexiou et al 2013 ragulina and reitan 2017 nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 this predominantly heavy tail behavior of daily precipitation was expected and is well captured by mev there are also topographical patterns visible in the heaviness amplification factor fig 6c though they are not as clearly distinguishable as for the shape parameter itself fig s6 the heaviness tends to be higher in arid areas and lower in mountainous areas examples of arid areas with high heaviness include the sahara the namib and kalahari in africa the gobi thar and taklamakan in asia the atacama desert in south america large areas of southwestern australia and the arabian desert and other areas in the middle east this same pattern is to a lesser extent also visible for the heaviness of gev fig 6a and pot fig 6b at high elevations a small h t1 t10 t100 is usually found for mev fig 6c examples include the rocky mountains and the sierra madres in north america the northern andes and large areas of the brazilian highlands in south america the ethiopian highlands the scandinavian mountains and the tibetan plateau these spatial patterns are in contrast with what papalexiou et al 2018 their figure 6 found for hourly weibull tails in the usa where the heaviest tails are in the mountainous areas and the thin tails are in the south east however our results correspond well to ragulina and reitan 2017 their figure 4 who showed that heaviness decreases with elevation a comparison of the heaviness for different distributions and durations is presented as a boxplot in fig 7 for spatial maps of the heaviness for the different durations we refer to figures s8 s14 for gev and pot predominantly heavy tails are observed for short durations and thinner tails for long durations furthermore gev and pot both show a decreasing variability in the heaviness for longer durations indicated by both shorter whiskers and boxes the decrease of the heaviness of the tails for increasing durations is in line with the findings of cavanaugh and gershunov 2015 who found that longer duration extremes exhibit thinner tails for gev and pot the longer durations largely indicate tails with a finite upper end point in half of the cases for a duration of 10 days for gev and more than half for pot one implication of this finding is that when computing return levels for a single location see figures s4 and s15 it is possible for the largest return periods that shorter duration quantiles estimate a higher precipitation depth than the longer duration quantiles this is physically impossible see fig s16a b f and g and we should thus be extremely careful when interpreting such results mev on the other hand shows different heaviness patterns than gev and pot fig 7 and figures s8 s14 mev shows almost entirely heavy tail behavior which remains consistent across the range of durations examined furthermore also the variability for mev is constant across durations though with a slight increase for longer durations this is in line with fig 5 where the difference between the t39 observed and estimated with mev increases for the longest durations it could be that mev is overestimating these return levels of these largest durations a possible way to improve the estimations would be to group multiple years together as per miniussi and marani 2020 the mev distribution produces a spatially and temporally coherent heavy tail behavior based on a 38 years calibration sample and a single grid cell analysis this is a promising result as mev in contrast to the traditional methods analyzed provides a more spatially coherent picture of precipitation extremes without any prior hypothesis on its spatial structure for example through a spatial clustering scheme demirdjian et al 2018 in fact the spatial structure of the tail heaviness obtained through the mev analysis could be used as a measure of statistical homogeneity for regionalization studies 4 conclusions the aim of this research was to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal variation of global precipitation extremes and their associated extreme value distribution tails we have fitted three different extreme value methods gev pot and mev to a global precipitation dataset mswep v2 2 to estimate extreme precipitation return levels for eight durations in order to compare the tails of the three distributions we introduced a novel heaviness amplification factor h t1 t10 t100 eq 5 instead of using calendar years to delineate between different years we used hydrological years the start of which we defined as the driest month we demonstrated that there is a substantial difference in the extremes depending on the definition of yearly blocks used in the extreme value analysis fig 2 although there is no systematic bias we still recommend to apply the extreme value analyses for estimating extreme precipitation based on hydrological years in future studies our analysis indicates that this can be particularly relevant in the southern hemisphere and in regions characterized by marked seasonal cycles it is well known that the traditional gev and pot methods require very long data series for accurate estimation of the tail behavior and our study confirms that there is a low spatial coherence for the tail properties of both distributions fig 6a and b using just 38 years of training data the tail properties of the mev distribution are spatially more coherent fig 6c and hence the estimated return levels are more spatially coherent as well fig 3c this spatially coherent behavior consistent with previous results obtained over the conterminous us zorzetto and marani 2020 shows that the mev distribution is able to capture spatially consistent tail behavior from short time series and by a single grid cell analysis without any prior information on the spatial precipitation structures the analysis of the mev tail behavior reveals distinct spatial patterns as the heaviness appears to be controlled by climate zones and orography heavier tails are observed in arid areas and thinner tails in mountainous regions more in depth analyses are necessary to draw definite conclusions on what exactly controls the heaviness of extreme value distribution tails the performance of mev is promising for regions without long local precipitation records furthermore our study shows that the tail behavior captured by mev is coherent and heavy both spatially and temporally figs 6 7 and s8 s14 for gev and pot on the other hand the tail behavior decreases with increasing event duration resulting in a thin tail with a finite endpoint for about half of the cells for a duration of 10 days the correct relationship between heaviness and precipitation duration warrants further investigation we also conclude that both gev and pot generally underestimate the observed extremes whereas mev overestimates them fig 5 this occurs particularly for long duration extremes and large return periods for mev an explanation could be that there are fewer events per year used for the yearly distribution fits resulting in larger interannual variability and thus overestimation of extremes we do consider it likely however that the results could be improved for instance by changing the event threshold or by fitting the weibull distribution over two or more years for dry areas miniussi and marani 2020 so as to reduce inter annual variability of the parameters due to samples of limited length our results suggest that this issue is particularly relevant at the longest durations examined for gev and pot the spatial consistency of the results could also be improved by adopting spatial extreme models davison et al 2012 huser and wadsworth 2020 the data generated for this study are openly available as the gpex dataset gründemann et al 2021 these data include extreme precipitation return levels and extreme value distribution parameters for durations between 3 h and 10 days at a global gridded 0 1 resolution they could be used by engineers as a reference of precipitation extremes for data scarce regions in particular for scientific purposes all underlying parameters are also available and can be used to answer several outstanding questions such as what are the controls on the tail behavior of extremes and what is driving the different changes in tail heaviness with duration for gev pot and mev data and code availability the gpex dataset is available at the 4tu repository gründemann et al 2021 the data included are the extremes estimated using the different distributions the observed extremes and the parameters to estimate the extremes these data are available for all durations included in this

1874,the green ampt model gam is a widely used infiltration model which assumes a sharp wetting front with a static effective suction head studies have shown that the suction head is related to the infiltration rate i e the dynamic effective suction head s a power law relationship describing s α c a β where c a is the capillary number and α and β are fitting parameters has been used to modify the gam and improves the simulation of the infiltration especially during the early stage however studies also have pointed out that ponding height affects the optimization of the effective suction head in the classical gam to clarify and quantify the ponding height effect on the dynamic effective suction head of the modified gam we conducted one dimensional vertical infiltration experiments by maintaining a ponding water on the top of the sand columns including 80 constant ponding height experiments and 13 falling ponding height experiments the results show that the power law relationship can be simplified to s α c a β 1 for all experiments and the optimized equilibrium suction is independent of the ponding height on the other hand decreases in the initial ponding height for the falling ponding height experiments or in the fixed ponding height for the constant ponding height experiments result in increases in optimized α to eliminate the effect of ponding height on the parameter optimization we successfully derived a new formula for the dynamic effective suction head with ponding height independent parameters keywords infiltration weitz relationship ponding height

movement with uniform water content above the front heber green and ampt 1911 is a simple and widely used infiltration model and has been incorporated in various hydrological models bouraoui and dillaha 1996 majidi and shahedi 2012 risse et al 1994 scharffenberg and feldman 2000 king et al 1999 gam and other infiltration models simplify the complex task of infiltration evaluation which is required to solve non linear physical governance equations e g richard s equation the green ampt approach provides insights when considering the influence of boundary conditions stratified soil or hydraulic properties on infiltration angulo jaramillo et al 2016 hilpert 2012 hsu and hilpert 2011 wang and wallach 2021 the green ampt approach has also been used to analyze the drainage of a water table youngs and aggelides 1976 similar to other infiltration models gam is also used for infiltration measurements in soil hydraulic characterization angulo jaramillo et al 2016 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2011 the major assumptions in the classical gam include a sharp wetting front and a static effective suction head heber green and ampt 1911 which can also be determined from the water retention curve mein and farrell 1974 ogden and saghafian 1997 however hassanizadeh and gray 1993 theoretically demonstrated that the capillary pressure in porous media is related to the saturation rate and proposed a linear approximation describing the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation rate manthey et al 2005 reviewed both simulation and experimental studies demonstrating the dynamic capillary pressure saturation relationship this dynamic effect is usually high for soil with low permeability and a quick saturation rate manthey et al 2005 stauffer 1978 alternatively stated the water retention curve is influenced by the rate of change in saturation thus the effective suction head at the wetting front should be velocity dependent during infiltration baver et al 2014 geiger and durnford 2000 hilpert 2012 the air compression affects the apparent dynamic effect of the capillary pressure saturation relationship hou et al 2012 while the non stationarity capillary pressure should not be overlooked taking the dynamic capillary into consideration is important for flows in unsaturated porous media such as modeling fingering instabilities baver et al 2014 chapwanya and stockie 2010 nieber et al 2005 infiltration hsu and hilpert 2011 hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 and other two phase flow problems camps roach et al 2010 lo et al 2017 using column experiments weitz et al 1987 concluded that the dynamic capillary pressure was proportional to α c a β where β 0 5 0 1 1 c a η v γ is the capillary number η p a s is the dynamic viscosity v m s is the average fluid velocity and γ n m is the surface tension with the same relationship annaka and hanayama 2005 studied the dynamic water entry pressure and obtained different values of α and β for different sands β 0 3 for 400 μ m glass bead sand β 0 79 for 30 50 sea sand from infiltration experiments with different constant fluxes dicarlo 2007 found that the capillary pressure at the wetting front increases with decreasing flux the weitz relationship is suitable for describing the result in dicarlo 2007 although the parameters depend on the initial water content at the pore scale the capillary pressure is determined by including the pore size surface tension and contact angle among these factors the contact angle is velocity dependent hoffman 1983 simulations that consider the dynamic contact angle better describe the experimental results of liquid imbibition in a capillary tube than those with a constant contact angle kim et al 2020 siebold et al 2000 the dynamic contact angle ϑ d can be approximated empirically using eq 2 when c a is small schäffer and wong 2000 seebergh and berg 1992 2 c o s ϑ s c o s ϑ d c o s ϑ s 1 α c a β in which ϑ s is the static contact angle i e the contact angle at c a 0 the form of eq 2 is similar to the weitz relationship which is also a power law without accounting for the dynamic capillary effect gam may inaccurately estimate the equilibrium suction head and erroneously describe the initial stage of infiltration hsu et al 2017 nonetheless the simplicity of gam makes it a useful option for modification to incorporate the effect of dynamic capillary pressure on infiltration hsu and hilpert 2011 parameterized the suction head s as the velocity dependent suction head in a power law relationship and modified the classical gam the differential form of the modified gam mgam that describes the wetting front position l m and time t s can be expressed in the form of 3 δ θ k s d l d t l h l s in which 4 s s 0 γ ρ g d α e c a β δ θ is the change in water content k s m s is the hydraulic conductivity h m is the ponding depth which was constant in hsu and hilpert 2011 s 0 m is the equilibrium suction head γ p a s is the interfacial tension ρ kg m3 is the density of water g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and d m is the grain size the grain size d was considered as the uniform grain size in hsu and hilpert 2011 the non dimensional function e is a function of the initial water content θ i and porosity and is usually merged with α due to lacking estimation method hsu and hilpert 2011 this mgam improves the description of upward and downward infiltration hsu and hilpert 2011 pellichero et al 2012 especially during the early transient stage hsu et al 2017 instead of an infinite initial infiltration rate from the classical gam a finite initial infiltration rate and zero l d l d t at l 0 can be described by the mgam hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 hsu et al 2017 showed that the effect of the dynamic suction head was small when the initial water content in the sand column was high tsai et al 2018 applied the model of hsu et al 2017 and conducted infiltration experiments with sand columns packed with sands with different mean grain sizes their results revealed a slightly smaller value of α in coarse texture sand columns by applying a similar mgam with a modification of the water content distribution zhang et al 2019 presented an analytical solution of gam for horizontal flow which was consistent with their experiments based on the model of hsu et al wang and wallach 2021 additionally considered the effect of the time dependent contact angle for subcritical water repellent soils the relationship between the infiltration rate and the effective suction head should be independent of the upper boundary condition and the ponding height during downward infiltration however freyberg et al 1980 indicated that the optimal suction head in the classical gam is influenced by the ponding head due to the gam assumptions moreover by assuming that d l d t l l 0 0 in eq 3 because of the finite d l d t l 0 hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 the initial effective suction head is strongly bonded to the ponding height the initial or fixed ponding height might influence the curve of s d l d t the optimal value of α and the estimation of s 0 a finite ponding water depth instantaneously existing on soil surface might be impractical polubarinova kochina 1962 especially for large scale events nonetheless in field infiltration tests for soil hydraulic characterization using ring infiltrometers a finite ponding depth is usually applied instantaneously at the beginning of the measurement the effect of the ponding height on the parameter estimate should be of importance to the field raindrop infiltration causes rapidly ponding water on the soil surface as the droplets hit the surface the extension of the droplets is related to infiltration properties bouchard and chandra 2020 joung and buie 2015 and considerably affects the following infiltration process the effects of the ponding height should be considered when modeling the instant infiltration process using gam it is necessary to investigate and correct the effect of the ponding height on the initial infiltration rate and s 0 on the other hand the value of the parameter β was preset as 0 3 in several studies hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 tsai et al 2018 wang and wallach 2021 wang and wallach 2021 considered 0 3 as a universal value of β nevertheless the preset β value consequently influences the fitting results of s 0 and α or γ ρ g d α e hsu and hilpert 2011 the effect of the β value on the fitted s 0 and α values has not been systematically investigated s 0 has a corresponding physical meaning of the equilibrium effective suction head although the value of s 0 is difficult to directly measure the fitted s 0 should be compared with that estimated by the pore size and measured contact angle however previous studies have rarely discussed whether the s 0 can be overestimated due to the preset β value hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 tsai et al 2018 because of the physical meaning of s 0 a proper β value should result in a good simulation result similar to the observation and also a consistent optimized s 0 value even when h 0 is different mgam improved the capability of gam in describing the early stage behavior of infiltration and avoided an infinite initial infiltration rate by incorporating the concept of velocity dependent capillary pressure nevertheless in the gam approach the effective suction head estimation is influenced by ponding height freyberg et al 1980 while the ponding height effect can be neglected in the late stage when the infiltration process reaches equilibrium it becomes significant for describing the early stage of the infiltration process therefore an understanding of the effect of ponding height on the velocity dependent suction head and related parameter estimation is crucial for mgam additionally a method to estimate parameters that are independent of the ponding height for mgam must be developed to examine the effect of the ponding height on the parameter optimization of mgam and describing the dynamic effective suction head we performed a series of downward infiltration experiments using different sand columns at different ponding heights the prescribed β value of the mgam was determined by considering both the simulation performance and the experimental results and the estimated s 0 compared to the measured values the optimized parameter values were used to investigate the influence of the ponding height on the dynamic effective suction head the investigation indicates that β 1 was suitable for all experiments whereas α was strongly related to the initial ponding height this ponding height effect can be described by considering the relationship between initial infiltration rate and initial ponding height to describe and incorporate the ponding height effect we developed a novel method with new parameters to replace α which corrects the unwanted effects from ponding height through the proposed method moreover we show a strong correlation between α and sand texture 2 methodology 2 1 mgam assuming a strong link between the dynamic suction head and the dynamic contact angle we consider an effective pore radius r e f f m and a capillary length l 0 m determined by 5 l 0 2 γ ρ g r e f f the capillary length leads to s l 0 c o s ϑ d and s 0 l 0 c o s ϑ s from eq 2 6 s s 0 s 0 l 0 α c a β comparing eq 6 with eq 4 s 0 l 0 accounts for the term γ ρ g d e in eq 4 which is influenced by the grain size porosity and initial water content although previous studies merged s 0 l 0 and α into a single parameter hsu and hilpert 2011 hsu et al 2017 the merging parameter as a function of s 0 l 0 is influenced by both s 0 and l 0 using eq 6 assists in determining the universal expression of α among different sands the effect of initial water content was not considered in this study because we conducted experiments with dry sand columns the uniform grain size d is replaced by d e f f m which refers to the effective particle size or the mean particle size of a porous medium from eq 7 it is clear that a small value of or d e f f will result in a small r e f f as proposed by glover and walker 2009 7 r e f f d e f f 2 a m 2 8 2 m where parameter m is the cementation exponent and a is a constant related to the topology of the pore space glover and walker 2009 recommend a 8 3 and m 1 5 for spherical particles the effects of grain size and porosity on the suction head considered in eq 4 can be merged into r e f f another approximation of the effective pore radius r e f f uses the permeability k m 2 and and is expressed as eq 8 glover and walker 2009 8 r e f f 8 k m the parameters k and can be obtained from the sand column experiment therefore it is more convenient to determine r e f f from eq 8 than eq 7 in our study eq 8 with m 1 5 was applied to model both the falling and constant ponding height experiments we define that 9 h h 0 c o n s t a n t h e i g h t h 0 l δ θ a 2 a 1 f a l l i n g h e i g h t where h 0 is the initial ponding height a 1 is the cross sectional area of the water bottle and a 2 is the cross sectional area of the sand column l δ θ a 2 a 1 is the loss of h when the cumulative infiltration depth is l for the falling height case by substituting eq 9 into eq 3 10 δ θ k s d l d t l h 0 λ l s where s is determined by eq 6 and the constant λ is 11 λ 1 c o n s t a n t h e i g h t 1 δ θ a 2 a 1 f a l l i n g h e i g h t to simplify the parameterization problem and reduce the search domain of the value of α and other parameters we nondimensionalized eq 10 in the form of 12 d l d t l h 0 λ l s by using l 0 and a time scaling parameter t 0 sec which is determined by 13 t 0 δ θ l 0 k s l l l 0 t t t 0 s s l 0 and h 0 h 0 l 0 the dimensionless dynamic effective suction head s in eq 12 is expressed as 14 s s 0 s 0 1 α d l d t β where 15 α α c a 0 β and 16 c a 0 η k s γ δ θ the capillary number c a c a 0 d l d t because the velocity v in eq 1 is given by d l d t with α 0 eq 12 is the classical gam eq 12 with nonzero α is the mgam used in this study for β 1 the mgam has an implicit solution that is expressed in the form of 17 l λ t s 0 h 0 λ α s 0 1 l n λ l s 0 h 0 1 the form of eq 17 is similar to the analytical solutions of the classical gam in polubarinova kochina 1962 p 489 and philip 1992 2 2 constant ponding height experiment as shown in fig 1 a a mariotte bottle was used to supply water to the connected sand column at a near constant ponding height h 0 the sand columns were glass cylinders with a length of 60 cm and a diameter of 2 58 0 04 cm the columns were separately filled with different sands the sands used in this study included ottawa sand silicon carbide sand sc b35 glass sand b60 glass sand and b150 glass sand the sand was dried before being packed into a glass cylinder a circular filter was placed at the bottom of the sand column to prevent sand from leaking out of the column porosity was calculated using the sand particle density sand solid volume and volume of the sand column v c o l the sand solid volume is the sand weight divided by the sand particle density the weight change of the mariotte bottle indicates the amount of water flowing into the sand column the time series data of the mariotte bottle weight were recorded using a digital balance per second with this weight data w t the depth of the wetting front l is calculated as 18 l t t i w t i w t ρ w δ θ a 2 t i t t e where ρ w is water density the time points t i and t e were when water entered and penetrated the column respectively the entering time t i 0 was prescribed therefore infiltration began at t 0 the mobility water content δ θ w t e w t i ρ w v c o l the hydraulic conductivity k s of each constant ponding height experiment was determined using eq 19 19 k s q w l c o l ρ w a 2 l c o l h 0 where l col is the sand column length the change rate of the weight of the water bottle q w was the slope of the linear regression line of w t after t t e the constant ponding heights h t h 0 applied in this study were 6 10 15 20 and 40 cm for each h 0 and sand column combination at least three repeated experiments were performed table 1 shows the average and standard deviations of the porosity mobility water content and hydraulic conductivity of all h 0 and sand column combinations 2 3 falling ponding height experiment falling head infiltration experiments were performed to investigate the effect of unsteady boundary conditions on the dynamic suction head fig 1b shows the experimental setup for the falling head experiment in which the mariotte bottle was replaced by a bucket with a uniform cross sectional area a 1 37 24 c m 2 the ponding height of h t declined from the initial ponding height h 0 after the valve was opened the hydraulic conductivity is determined by 20 k s a 1 l c o l d l n h t e h t d t t t e where the length l col of the filled sand column was approximately 59 5 cm the slope of l n h t e h t versus time was determined by fitting a straight line using the least squares method the falling ponding height experiments were performed with only b60 sand columns with h 0 values of 8 18 28 and 40 cm the average and standard deviations of δ θ and k s for the failing ponding height experiments are shown in table 1 the calculated δ θ was slightly less than or equal to the porosity indicating almost fully saturated conditions above the wetting front during infiltration process the average value of λ is 0 945 the pressure loss due to pipe fittings was not considered in this study supplementary 1 2 4 optimization parameters of mgam and classical gam the parameter values were optimized by fitting the solution to eq 12 to the measured wetting front depth and wetting front velocity during the experiments this fitting process was conducted using the nlinfit function in matlab when optimizing α and s 0 parameter β is fixed to determine a proper β value the values from 0 1 to 1 with an interval of 0 1 were tested with a fixed β α became the only parameter reflecting the dynamic effect on the suction head because α indicates the sensitivity of s with velocity changes on the other hand to evaluate the simulation performance using the classical gam s 0 was optimized with α 0 which results in a simulation with a constant effective suction head the simulation performances with optimized parameters were quantified using the root mean square error rmse 21 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n where o is the observation p is the simulation and n is the number of pairs of o i and p i 3 results 3 1 parameter optimization with different β values simulations with various fixed β values were optimized and fitted for each experiment where α and s 0 are the fitting parameters fig 2 a shows the rmse of the simulations for the different sand columns at various β values for most of the sand when β increased the rmse decreased moreover because the rmse values are not significantly different for β from 0 5 to 1 changing β in this range did not efficiently improve the simulation performance fig 2 b d uses the b150 sand column experiments as an example to demonstrate the optimized parameter values with different prescribed β when β decreases the optimized α and s 0 increase fig 2b and s 0 and α tend to be more related to h 0 at small β values fig 2c and d reducing β increases the variation in s 0 values at different h 0 values fig 2c further vertical capillary rise experiments were conducted to measure s 0 and determine a proper β value for estimating s 0 the measured terminal imbibition water heights indicated that s 0 were approximately 0 41 0 35 0 27 0 23 and 0 37 for the b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa experiments respectively with β 0 3 which has been recommended in previous studies hsu et al 2017 tsai et al 2018 wang and wallach 2021 the averaged optimal s 0 values were approximately 0 82 0 80 1 30 2 32 and 17 for the b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa experiments respectively the average optimal s 0 values at β 1 were approximately 0 41 0 35 0 53 0 89 and 5 for the b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa experiments respectively in this study the s 0 estimated with β 1 was closer to the measured value than that estimated with β 0 3 because of the consistency of the estimated s 0 value at various h 0 and the optimal s 0 value being closer to the measurement β 1 was applied in this study 3 2 simulation performance of mgam fig 3 shows the rmse of the simulations from mgam β 1 and the classical gam considering the dynamic suction head the rmse of the simulation is smaller than that with a constant suction head this difference shows the improvement of the mgam and implies that the effective suction head changes over the infiltration process and the evolution of s d l d t can be described by the power law expression for the constant ponding height experiments with b150 b60 and b35 fig 3 shows that the improvement is significant for the infiltration at small h 0 for instance the rmse for b150 experiments at h 0 6 cm drops from 1 5 cm to 0 2 cm after the simulation considering the dynamic effect for that at h 0 40 cm the rmse of the mgam significantly increases and the rmse difference between that of gam and mgam decreases 3 3 optimal α and s 0 at different h 0 fig 4 shows the optimal α and s 0 values for β 1 fig 4 a f show a clear tendency for α h 0 in which α decreases when h 0 increases from all experiments this decreasing trend confirms our suspicion that the ponding height can affect the estimated α fig 4 g l show that the optimized s 0 does not have a clear relationship with h 0 the ponding height did not significantly affect the estimation of the effective equilibrium suction head the comparisons between the falling and constant ponding height experiments are shown in fig 4 m and n fig 4m shows that when h 0 increases the evolutions of α at these two conditions both decrease along the black line however the optimal s 0 and h 0 values are uncorrelated fig 4n in addition both the optimal s 0 values from these two conditions were close for the experiments at the constant ponding height condition the average optimal s 0 is 0 34 and 0 4 for the experiments at the falling ponding height condition 3 4 initial ca and optimal α versus h 0 from columns with different sand textures tsai et al 2018 reported a small average α of a coarse textured sand column in this study the comparison of the analysis results from different sand textures is shown in fig 5 fig 5a illustrates the values of h 0 and the simulated initial c a obtained from the mgam simulations the simulated initial ca may be expressed as a function of h 0 as the red curve even when the textures are different fig 5b shows the optimized α versus h 0 in which α is calculated based on eq 15 the fitting result used was from the optimization considering the pressure drop in the supply tube when h 0 decreases the optimized α decreases in addition the average α is large from the fine texture sand column experiment 4 discussion 4 1 effect of β values on fitting parameters in previous literature fixing β 1 yields a good optimization result a β value of approximately 0 3 was applied and recommended hsu et al 2017 tsai et al 2018 wang and wallach 2021 however our optimization results show that the selection of β values sensitively influences the estimation of the parameters fig 2 with respect to s 0 when a small β is applied the optimized value of the equilibrium suction head s 0 is likely overestimated and presents as an initial ponding height related parameter this consequence is physically unreasonable because s 0 is considered to be the soil property caused by the pore size and equilibrium contact angle and this is independent of the ponding height in hsu et al 2017 an optimal s 0 of approximately 1 m was obtained from sand columns with θ i 0 k s of approximately 2 10 4 m s and ranging between 0 35 and 0 4 with these k s and values r e f f estimated using eq 8 is approximately 30 μ m which results in a maximum s 0 of approximately 0 5 m the optimal s 0 in hsu et al 2017 was likely overestimated compared with the texture of the sand column nevertheless although the application of β 1 improves the consistency of s 0 values among the experiments at different h 0 as shown in fig 2c and fig 4g l the optimal α value still decreases as h 0 decreases fig 2d and fig 4a f the inconsistency of α cannot be corrected by changing β value 4 2 optimal s 0 and optimal α versus h 0 considering a suction head in a capillary tube the suction head is determined physically by the inner radius surface tension and contact angle the contact angle changes due to the movement of the liquid interface baver et al 2014 geiger and durnford 2000 hilpert 2012 siebold et al 2000 or with time wang and wallach 2021 based on this concept of the velocity dependent or time variant contact angle the suction head should have no relation with h 0 however our results show that h 0 influences the s d l d t curve the optimal α decreased as h 0 increased fig 4a f the optimal s 0 shows no relationship with h 0 fig 4g l because of the applied β value the parameter α determines the slope of the s d l d t curve a small α reflects that s is insensitive to the infiltration rate and a weak dynamic effect of the effective suction head as shown in fig 4a f for a high h 0 the effective suction head presented a weak dynamic effect at which the velocity dependent suction head may be ignored in particular for the b150 experiments at h 0 40 cm the near zero α values imply that the corresponding effective suction heads are almost constant at a small h 0 a large α indicates that the suction head is strongly dependent on the infiltration rate thus the dynamic effect decreased as the initial ponding height increased to show the effect of h 0 on describing the dynamic suction with mgam fig 6 demonstrates the s d l d t curves for b150 sand column experiments with different h 0 the dots indicate the s calculated from eq 12 with the given and measured h 0 l and d l d t fig 6 shows that s d l d t varies with h 0 the curves of s d l d t decrease rapidly at a low h 0 and slower as h 0 increases when d l d t 1 although at different h 0 s approaches the same value of approximately 0 4 which is close to the capillary rise experiment result of 0 41 the optimal s 0 and α values fig 4 satisfy the properties of the experimental s d l d t the solid curves in fig 6 are drawn with the same s 0 of 0 4 but with different α values large α for small h 0 therefore in the mgam simulation with the same sand s 0 can and should be a fixed value but different α values for different h 0 our findings raise the problem that α becomes a parameter that depends on the boundary condition i e ponding height we regard this problem as a result of the mathematical constraint in the gam at the beginning of infiltration there is a zero cumulative infiltration depth and finite infiltration rate which have been reported in the literature pellichero et al 2012 whereby the initial suction head based on the green ampt analysis equals h 0 the relationship between s and h 0 was studied as early as 1980 freyberg et al 1980 indicated that s is related to the ponding height in the gam by reason of the transition zone of the wetting area the equation 18 in freyberg et al 1980 implies that the initial s will equal h 0 when the initial infiltration rate is finite the effective suction head term in the gam is directly related to the transition zone development and the ponding height the association between the initial ponding height and the suction head is inherent in the gam but has been largely ignored the physical mechanism beyond the initial s h 0 could be as a result of the h 0 effect of dynamic capillary pressure as a high h 0 results in a fast l 0 or due to the development of the transition zone at the very early stage of infiltration nevertheless it is still difficult to directly determine the contact angle or measure the capillary pressure at an early stage in sand columns further techniques such as micro fluid studies by high speed 3 d x ray micro ct or micro fluid chips are required to investigate the change in contact angle when water enters the sand column to satisfy the finite initial d l d t denoted by l 0 22 s l 0 h 0 is inevitable in the mgam eq 12 the red dashed line in fig 6 shows that the measured first points of the s d l d t i e s l 0 followed eq 22 and supports the finite initial d l d t assumption therefore the power law relationship eq 7 or 14 indeed describes the s d l d t relationship and significantly improves the simulation performance but the curves s d l d t as well as α are related to h 0 instead of the mgam parameter α should be expressed as a function of h 0 and account for the effect of h 0 on s 4 3 new parameterization for h 0 related α as shown in appendix a based on eq 22 and experimental results we derived a new parameterization for h 0 related α 23 α h 0 s 0 h 0 1 β c s 0 1 v s β where the parameters c and v s are used to parameterize l 0 in the form of l 0 v s s 0 h 0 1 c empirically c c 0 c a 0 a 1 and v s v 0 c a 0 a 2 appendix a as c and v s are functions of c a 0 α also α is related to the permeability and texture according to eq 23 d α d h 0 is negative when c is smaller than β which is supported by the c values listed in table a 1 a small c value indicates a small increase in h 0 resulting in a considerable increase in the initial velocity therefore d α d h 0 0 indicates that an increase in h 0 drastically enhances the initial infiltration rate eq 23 and the values of a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 could be universal for different boundary conditions and soil textures the curves of case a in fig 7 show the α h 0 using the optimal α from the constant head experiments the optimal a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 were 0 39 17 23 2 24 and 1 32e 9 respectively fig 7 shows that the predicted α from eq 23 are consistent with the optimized α values from the measured data the optimal a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 of eq 23 can be used for estimating α for the falling head experiment fig 7f moreover the parameter values of a 1 0 43 c 0 24 47 a 2 2 34 and v 0 4 96 10 9 calibrated by using the α data from the constant head experiments with glass sands are able to describe α h 0 for the sc ottawa sand and falling head experiments fig 7d f the curves of case b the parameter values a 1 c 0 a 2 v 0 and s 0 could also be estimated by applying the new mgam which replaces α in eq 17 by eq 23 to fit measured l t with the measured l t from all constant head experiments we obtained a 1 0 20 c 0 3 24 a 2 1 61 and v 0 3 8 10 7 and calculated α h 0 which are demonstrated by the curves of case c in fig 7 the estimated s 0 were 0 33 0 40 0 56 0 74 and 1 52 for b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa sand respectively these estimated s 0 were similar to our previous fitting result in which the average fitted s 0 values β 1 were 0 41 0 35 0 53 0 89 and 5 for the b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa experiments using new mgam with the parameter values from case c fig 8 a demonstrates a portion of the simulated l t for the falling head experiment b60 sand column the simulations based on the new mgam result in rmses 1 6 0 9 1 0 and 2 1 cm for an h 0 of 8 18 28 and 40 cm while an rmse of less than 0 2 cm is obtained using the simulations obtained from the original mgam fitted to each individual experiment fig 3 since α from eq 23 is not specific for a particular experiment the resulting rmse of the new mgam was not as good as that of the original mgam with an optimal α value nevertheless fig 8a shows that the new mgam with parameter values from the constant head experiments case c can approximate the falling ponding head infiltration experiments with different h 0 values on the other hand a lower α for a higher h 0 might be a consequence of that l t is less sensitive to the value of α for a larger h 0 to test the sensitivity of l t to α for high h 0 fig 8b illustrates that α 0 089 the averaged optimized α value for the experiments at h 0 8 cm is not suitable for describing infiltration at the other h 0 values the simulations with α 0 089 significantly underestimated the experimental l at a given t without adjusting α according to h 0 the simulated l t would deviate from the experimental l t therefore the h 0 related α does not result from the parameter sensitivity otherwise α 0 089 should be suitable for simulating infiltration with a high h 0 the original mgam by hsu and hilpert 2011 incorporated the concept of dynamic contact angle into gam based on mgam other properties of the contact angle have been discussed by wang and wallach 2021 however the mgam requires more fitting parameters α and β than the classical gam previous studies hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 tsai et al 2018 have not presented an approach to determine the parameter value except for parameter fitting to experiments also the issue of case specific parameters which are dependent on the ponding height in this study still exists in gam and the original mgam our experimental results show that β 1 is acceptable and leads to the analytical solution eq 17 in addition α can be approximated using eq 23 with given a 1 c 0 a 2 v 0 h 0 and s 0 if the values of a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 could be universal for different boundary conditions and soil textures s 0 would be the only fitting parameter of the new mgam which has the same number of the fitting parameters as the classic gam the most important aspect is that an estimated s 0 from the new mgam was not affected by the ponding height and should be related to only the material itself this study considered only dry homogeneous porous media and conducted the experiment with sand the influence of initial water content hsu et al 2017 has not been incorporated into the new mgam the assumed relationships l 0 v s s 0 h 0 1 c c c 0 c a 0 a 1 and v s v 0 c a 0 a 2 are influenced by k s and δ θ in which δ θ ranged between 0 38 and 0 43 additional studies with boarder δ θ and k s ranges are needed to validate the assumptions for the initial velocity the optimized a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 values may not be valid for other sand or soil to expand the universality of the new mgam further theoretical and experimental studies are needed to modify or replace the empirical relationship l 0 v s s 0 h 0 1 c 4 4 α as a function of h 0 fig 5 demonstrates that both α and the initial c a vary with h 0 as the initial c a is dominated by and can be expressed as a function of h 0 eq b 3 α presents as a function of h 0 appendix b as shown in appendix b another α model is obtained 24 α s 0 h 0 s 0 1 8 40 10 4 h 0 1 39 β fig 5b presents α modeling using eq 24 with s 0 0 4 β 1 and optimized α the modeled α was similar to the optimized α the derivation in appendix b illustrates the sand texture and ponding height dominating the initial ca as well as the fitted α values nevertheless fig 5b shows that eq 24 seems to be a universal relationship describing the dynamic effect on the effective suction head for different sand columns and the initial ca in our experiments ranged from 0 05 to 4 when ca is out of this range eq b 3 and eq 24 are unknown eq b 3 may be inappropriate when h 0 is small or the suction head dominates and at a very small or zero ponding height the prediction α or α will be unreasonably large or patently infinite when h 0 decreases the initial ca should not drop as rapidly as that predicted by eq b 3 and α should consequently decline slightly more than that in eq 24 an investigation of the dynamic suction head at small ponding heights is required 4 5 effect of sand texture on dynamic suction head fig 9 depicts the initial ca and α calculated using eq 24 and the curves from eq 23 with an h 0 of between 1 and 40 cm eq 24 provides a straightforward relationship between α and h 0 where an increased h 0 results in an increased initial ca resulting in a small α this result explains the negative correlation between α and the mean particle size found by tsai et al 2018 at the same ponding height infiltration in a coarse sand texture column large mean particle size with a high k s leads to a larger initial ca than that in a low k s sand column the large h 0 and initial ca values for the high k s sand column result in the small α in average however as shown in fig 9 b at h 0 0 4 α for the b150 sand column is smaller than others this indicates that for the same h 0 α may not decrease as k s increases 5 conclusions the gam is simple but useful and provides insightful first order principle information gam based models for which tediously measured soil characteristic curves are not needed are applicable in describing infiltration under field conditions however the gam is unsuitable to describe the early stage of infiltration and has ponding height affected optimal parameter values mgam incorporates the concept of a velocity dependent capillary pressure into gam and improves the capability of the gam to describe the early stage of infiltration whereas the properties of the mgam parameters α and β require further examination particularly when examining the ponding height effect analysis of our experimental results shows that incorporation of a dynamic suction head into gam improves model performance the dynamic suction parameterized by the power law formula provides a good fitting result as indicated in the literature while the exponent β of 1 was suitable for this study and larger than the suggested value in previous studies hsu et al 2017 tsai et al 2018 wang and wallach 2021 the equilibrium suction head estimation is sensitive to the selection of β values reducing β dramatically increases both the optimized α and non dimensional equilibrium suction head a small β easily results in an overestimated equilibrium suction head by selecting the β of 1 the non dimensional equilibrium suction head non dimensionalized by the capillary length can be independent of the ponding height meanwhile the fitted α is a function of the ponding height for all β the ponding height dependency of α is caused by a mathematical constraint from the formula of gam where the initial suction head must equal the negative ponding height when a finite initial infiltration rate is assumed we proposed a novel formula in which the parameters are independent of the ponding height to replace the ponding height dependent α the simulated l t based on the modified mgam with the new formula was close to the experimental value we also provided a universal parameter approximation showing that α is a function of ponding height equilibrium suction head and sand texture and resolving the issue of case specific parameters in mgam in addition among sand columns with different hydraulic conductivities the non dimensional ponding height and initial c a can be well fitted by a power law relationship based on this relationship and the approximation for the parameters we show that an increase in non dimensional ponding height h 0 leads to a decrease in α because the non dimensional ponding height is small with a large capillary length which is corresponding to a small permeability α is usually small for the coarse textured sand column when the non dimensional ponding height is the same the increase in permeability does not necessarily reduce the value of α this study provides a new direction for dealing with dynamic suction head and initial conditions in gam the proposed universal relationships lead the new mgam to simulate the infiltration at different initial ponding heights for different texture samples using the same set of parameter values moreover the new mgam includes the effect of ponding height on the effective suction head which is a major challenge in the gam based model but has been ignored for a long time this improves the ability of the gam based model to estimate the equilibrium suction head and describe the early stages of infiltration a better understanding of the basic properties of mgam should improve its applicability in future applications from our findings mgam can be applied in the falling head test to estimate soil properties when simulating the infiltration into a horizontal stratified layer α in mgam could be modified based on the initial velocity in each layer we also found that α is minimal at a high h 0 and the dynamic effect on effective suction during high ponding or long term infiltration events could be neglected however it is important for small spatial or temporal scale studies e g raindrop infiltration and shallow ponding height water infiltration e g infiltration test of hydrological characterization flooding irrigation and border irrigation moreover the new mgam can be used to study the influences of physical properties on infiltration without the interference of the ponding height the new formula should be considered in transient wettability studies nevertheless the relationship

science and technology taiwan appendix a derivation of new parameterization for h 0 related α the mathematical constraint in eq 22 provides a way to calculate the dynamic effective suction head based on l 0 and h 0 when β is fixed and given α can be determined by giving two points of s d l d t in which s at d l d t 0 and initial s can be conveniently obtained in other words the s d l d t can be determined when the s d l d t 0 and s d l d t l 0 are known the value of s d l d t 0 is s 0 which is not affected by h 0 the value of s l 0 is h 0 eq 22 by substituting l 0 and eq 22 into eq 14 and rearranging the equation α can be expressed as a1 α s 0 h 0 l 0 β s 0 1 the initial infiltration rate l 0 is then strongly connected with the driving forces s 0 and h 0 the experimental l 0 which can be described by a2 l 0 v s s 0 h 0 1 c as shown in fig a 1 the parameters v s and c are listed in table a 1 the empirical relationships between the fitted c and v s and c a 0 are c 0 28 c a 0 8 2 and

1874,the green ampt model gam is a widely used infiltration model which assumes a sharp wetting front with a static effective suction head studies have shown that the suction head is related to the infiltration rate i e the dynamic effective suction head s a power law relationship describing s α c a β where c a is the capillary number and α and β are fitting parameters has been used to modify the gam and improves the simulation of the infiltration especially during the early stage however studies also have pointed out that ponding height affects the optimization of the effective suction head in the classical gam to clarify and quantify the ponding height effect on the dynamic effective suction head of the modified gam we conducted one dimensional vertical infiltration experiments by maintaining a ponding water on the top of the sand columns including 80 constant ponding height experiments and 13 falling ponding height experiments the results show that the power law relationship can be simplified to s α c a β 1 for all experiments and the optimized equilibrium suction is independent of the ponding height on the other hand decreases in the initial ponding height for the falling ponding height experiments or in the fixed ponding height for the constant ponding height experiments result in increases in optimized α to eliminate the effect of ponding height on the parameter optimization we successfully derived a new formula for the dynamic effective suction head with ponding height independent parameters keywords infiltration weitz relationship ponding height dependent suction head ponding height independent parameters data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the green ampt model gam which assumes a piston wetting front movement with uniform water content above the front heber green and ampt 1911 is a simple and widely used infiltration model and has been incorporated in various hydrological models bouraoui and dillaha 1996 majidi and shahedi 2012 risse et al 1994 scharffenberg and feldman 2000 king et al 1999 gam and other infiltration models simplify the complex task of infiltration evaluation which is required to solve non linear physical governance equations e g richard s equation the green ampt approach provides insights when considering the influence of boundary conditions stratified soil or hydraulic properties on infiltration angulo jaramillo et al 2016 hilpert 2012 hsu and hilpert 2011 wang and wallach 2021 the green ampt approach has also been used to analyze the drainage of a water table youngs and aggelides 1976 similar to other infiltration models gam is also used for infiltration measurements in soil hydraulic characterization angulo jaramillo et al 2016 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2011 the major assumptions in the classical gam include a sharp wetting front and a static effective suction head heber green and ampt 1911 which can also be determined from the water retention curve mein and farrell 1974 ogden and saghafian 1997 however hassanizadeh and gray 1993 theoretically demonstrated that the capillary pressure in porous media is related to the saturation rate and proposed a linear approximation describing the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation rate manthey et al 2005 reviewed both simulation and experimental studies demonstrating the dynamic capillary pressure saturation relationship this dynamic effect is usually high for soil with low permeability and a quick saturation rate manthey et al 2005 stauffer 1978 alternatively stated the water retention curve is influenced by the rate of change in saturation thus the effective suction head at the wetting front should be velocity dependent during infiltration baver et al 2014 geiger and durnford 2000 hilpert 2012 the air compression affects the apparent dynamic effect of the capillary pressure saturation relationship hou et al 2012 while the non stationarity capillary pressure should not be overlooked taking the dynamic capillary into consideration is important for flows in unsaturated porous media such as modeling fingering instabilities baver et al 2014 chapwanya and stockie 2010 nieber et al 2005 infiltration hsu and hilpert 2011 hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 and other two phase flow problems camps roach et al 2010 lo et al 2017 using column experiments weitz et al 1987 concluded that the dynamic capillary pressure was proportional to α c a β where β 0 5 0 1 1 c a η v γ is the capillary number η p a s is the dynamic viscosity v m s is the average fluid velocity and γ n m is the surface tension with the same relationship annaka and hanayama 2005 studied the dynamic water entry pressure and obtained different values of α and β for different sands β 0 3 for 400 μ m glass bead sand β 0 79 for 30 50 sea sand from infiltration experiments with different constant fluxes dicarlo 2007 found that the capillary pressure at the wetting front increases with decreasing flux the weitz relationship is suitable for describing the result in dicarlo 2007 although the parameters depend on the initial water content at the pore scale the capillary pressure is determined by including the pore size surface tension and contact angle among these factors the contact angle is velocity dependent hoffman 1983 simulations that consider the dynamic contact angle better describe the experimental results of liquid imbibition in a capillary tube than those with a constant contact angle kim et al 2020 siebold et al 2000 the dynamic contact angle ϑ d can be approximated empirically using eq 2 when c a is small schäffer and wong 2000 seebergh and berg 1992 2 c o s ϑ s c o s ϑ d c o s ϑ s 1 α c a β in which ϑ s is the static contact angle i e the contact angle at c a 0 the form of eq 2 is similar to the weitz relationship which is also a power law without accounting for the dynamic capillary effect gam may inaccurately estimate the equilibrium suction head and erroneously describe the initial stage of infiltration hsu et al 2017 nonetheless the simplicity of gam makes it a useful option for modification to incorporate the effect of dynamic capillary pressure on infiltration hsu and hilpert 2011 parameterized the suction head s as the velocity dependent suction head in a power law relationship and modified the classical gam the differential form of the modified gam mgam that describes the wetting front position l m and time t s can be expressed in the form of 3 δ θ k s d l d t l h l s in which 4 s s 0 γ ρ g d α e c a β δ θ is the change in water content k s m s is the hydraulic conductivity h m is the ponding depth which was constant in hsu and hilpert 2011 s 0 m is the equilibrium suction head γ p a s is the interfacial tension ρ kg m3 is the density of water g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and d m is the grain size the grain size d was considered as the uniform grain size in hsu and hilpert 2011 the non dimensional function e is a function of the initial water content θ i and porosity and is usually merged with α due to lacking estimation method hsu and hilpert 2011 this mgam improves the description of upward and downward infiltration hsu and hilpert 2011 pellichero et al 2012 especially during the early transient stage hsu et al 2017 instead of an infinite initial infiltration rate from the classical gam a finite initial infiltration rate and zero l d l d t at l 0 can be described by the mgam hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 hsu et al 2017 showed that the effect of the dynamic suction head was small when the initial water content in the sand column was high tsai et al 2018 applied the model of hsu et al 2017 and conducted infiltration experiments with sand columns packed with sands with different mean grain sizes their results revealed a slightly smaller value of α in coarse texture sand columns by applying a similar mgam with a modification of the water content distribution zhang et al 2019 presented an analytical solution of gam for horizontal flow which was consistent with their experiments based on the model of hsu et al wang and wallach 2021 additionally considered the effect of the time dependent contact angle for subcritical water repellent soils the relationship between the infiltration rate and the effective suction head should be independent of the upper boundary condition and the ponding height during downward infiltration however freyberg et al 1980 indicated that the optimal suction head in the classical gam is influenced by the ponding head due to the gam assumptions moreover by assuming that d l d t l l 0 0 in eq 3 because of the finite d l d t l 0 hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 the initial effective suction head is strongly bonded to the ponding height the initial or fixed ponding height might influence the curve of s d l d t the optimal value of α and the estimation of s 0 a finite ponding water depth instantaneously existing on soil surface might be impractical polubarinova kochina 1962 especially for large scale events nonetheless in field infiltration tests for soil hydraulic characterization using ring infiltrometers a finite ponding depth is usually applied instantaneously at the beginning of the measurement the effect of the ponding height on the parameter estimate should be of importance to the field raindrop infiltration causes rapidly ponding water on the soil surface as the droplets hit the surface the extension of the droplets is related to infiltration properties bouchard and chandra 2020 joung and buie 2015 and considerably affects the following infiltration process the effects of the ponding height should be considered when modeling the instant infiltration process using gam it is necessary to investigate and correct the effect of the ponding height on the initial infiltration rate and s 0 on the other hand the value of the parameter β was preset as 0 3 in several studies hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 tsai et al 2018 wang and wallach 2021 wang and wallach 2021 considered 0 3 as a universal value of β nevertheless the preset β value consequently influences the fitting results of s 0 and α or γ ρ g d α e hsu and hilpert 2011 the effect of the β value on the fitted s 0 and α values has not been systematically investigated s 0 has a corresponding physical meaning of the equilibrium effective suction head although the value of s 0 is difficult to directly measure the fitted s 0 should be compared with that estimated by the pore size and measured contact angle however previous studies have rarely discussed whether the s 0 can be overestimated due to the preset β value hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 tsai et al 2018 because of the physical meaning of s 0 a proper β value should result in a good simulation result similar to the observation and also a consistent optimized s 0 value even when h 0 is different mgam improved the capability of gam in describing the early stage behavior of infiltration and avoided an infinite initial infiltration rate by incorporating the concept of velocity dependent capillary pressure nevertheless in the gam approach the effective suction head estimation is influenced by ponding height freyberg et al 1980 while the ponding height effect can be neglected in the late stage when the infiltration process reaches equilibrium it becomes significant for describing the early stage of the infiltration process therefore an understanding of the effect of ponding height on the velocity dependent suction head and related parameter estimation is crucial for mgam additionally a method to estimate parameters that are independent of the ponding height for mgam must be developed to examine the effect of the ponding height on the parameter optimization of mgam and describing the dynamic effective suction head we performed a series of downward infiltration experiments using different sand columns at different ponding heights the prescribed β value of the mgam was determined by considering both the simulation performance and the experimental results and the estimated s 0 compared to the measured values the optimized parameter values were used to investigate the influence of the ponding height on the dynamic effective suction head the investigation indicates that β 1 was suitable for all experiments whereas α was strongly related to the initial ponding height this ponding height effect can be described by considering the relationship between initial infiltration rate and initial ponding height to describe and incorporate the ponding height effect we developed a novel method with new parameters to replace α which corrects the unwanted effects from ponding height through the proposed method moreover we show a strong correlation between α and sand texture 2 methodology 2 1 mgam assuming a strong link between the dynamic suction head and the dynamic contact angle we consider an effective pore radius r e f f m and a capillary length l 0 m determined by 5 l 0 2 γ ρ g r e f f the capillary length leads to s l 0 c o s ϑ d and s 0 l 0 c o s ϑ s from eq 2 6 s s 0 s 0 l 0 α c a β comparing eq 6 with eq 4 s 0 l 0 accounts for the term γ ρ g d e in eq 4 which is influenced by the grain size porosity and initial water content although previous studies merged s 0 l 0 and α into a single parameter hsu and hilpert 2011 hsu et al 2017 the merging parameter as a function of s 0 l 0 is influenced by both s 0 and l 0 using eq 6 assists in determining the universal expression of α among different sands the effect of initial water content was not considered in this study because we conducted experiments with dry sand columns the uniform grain size d is replaced by d e f f m which refers to the effective particle size or the mean particle size of a porous medium from eq 7 it is clear that a small value of or d e f f will result in a small r e f f as proposed by glover and walker 2009 7 r e f f d e f f 2 a m 2 8 2 m where parameter m is the cementation exponent and a is a constant related to the topology of the pore space glover and walker 2009 recommend a 8 3 and m 1 5 for spherical particles the effects of grain size and porosity on the suction head considered in eq 4 can be merged into r e f f another approximation of the effective pore radius r e f f uses the permeability k m 2 and and is expressed as eq 8 glover and walker 2009 8 r e f f 8 k m the parameters k and can be obtained from the sand column experiment therefore it is more convenient to determine r e f f from eq 8 than eq 7 in our study eq 8 with m 1 5 was applied to model both the falling and constant ponding height experiments we define that 9 h h 0 c o n s t a n t h e i g h t h 0 l δ θ a 2 a 1 f a l l i n g h e i g h t where h 0 is the initial ponding height a 1 is the cross sectional area of the water bottle and a 2 is the cross sectional area of the sand column l δ θ a 2 a 1 is the loss of h when the cumulative infiltration depth is l for the falling height case by substituting eq 9 into eq 3 10 δ θ k s d l d t l h 0 λ l s where s is determined by eq 6 and the constant λ is 11 λ 1 c o n s t a n t h e i g h t 1 δ θ a 2 a 1 f a l l i n g h e i g h t to simplify the parameterization problem and reduce the search domain of the value of α and other parameters we nondimensionalized eq 10 in the form of 12 d l d t l h 0 λ l s by using l 0 and a time scaling parameter t 0 sec which is determined by 13 t 0 δ θ l 0 k s l l l 0 t t t 0 s s l 0 and h 0 h 0 l 0 the dimensionless dynamic effective suction head s in eq 12 is expressed as 14 s s 0 s 0 1 α d l d t β where 15 α α c a 0 β and 16 c a 0 η k s γ δ θ the capillary number c a c a 0 d l d t because the velocity v in eq 1 is given by d l d t with α 0 eq 12 is the classical gam eq 12 with nonzero α is the mgam used in this study for β 1 the mgam has an implicit solution that is expressed in the form of 17 l λ t s 0 h 0 λ α s 0 1 l n λ l s 0 h 0 1 the form of eq 17 is similar to the analytical solutions of the classical gam in polubarinova kochina 1962 p 489 and philip 1992 2 2 constant ponding height experiment as shown in fig 1 a a mariotte bottle was used to supply water to the connected sand column at a near constant ponding height h 0 the sand columns were glass cylinders with a length of 60 cm and a diameter of 2 58 0 04 cm the columns were separately filled with different sands the sands used in this study included ottawa sand silicon carbide sand sc b35 glass sand b60 glass sand and b150 glass sand the sand was dried before being packed into a glass cylinder a circular filter was placed at the bottom of the sand column to prevent sand from leaking out of the column porosity was calculated using the sand particle density sand solid volume and volume of the sand column v c o l the sand solid volume is the sand weight divided by the sand particle density the weight change of the mariotte bottle indicates the amount of water flowing into the sand column the time series data of the mariotte bottle weight were recorded using a digital balance per second with this weight data w t the depth of the wetting front l is calculated as 18 l t t i w t i w t ρ w δ θ a 2 t i t t e where ρ w is water density the time points t i and t e were when water entered and penetrated the column respectively the entering time t i 0 was prescribed therefore infiltration began at t 0 the mobility water content δ θ w t e w t i ρ w v c o l the hydraulic conductivity k s of each constant ponding height experiment was determined using eq 19 19 k s q w l c o l ρ w a 2 l c o l h 0 where l col is the sand column length the change rate of the weight of the water bottle q w was the slope of the linear regression line of w t after t t e the constant ponding heights h t h 0 applied in this study were 6 10 15 20 and 40 cm for each h 0 and sand column combination at least three repeated experiments were performed table 1 shows the average and standard deviations of the porosity mobility water content and hydraulic conductivity of all h 0 and sand column combinations 2 3 falling ponding height experiment falling head infiltration experiments were performed to investigate the effect of unsteady boundary conditions on the dynamic suction head fig 1b shows the experimental setup for the falling head experiment in which the mariotte bottle was replaced by a bucket with a uniform cross sectional area a 1 37 24 c m 2 the ponding height of h t declined from the initial ponding height h 0 after the valve was opened the hydraulic conductivity is determined by 20 k s a 1 l c o l d l n h t e h t d t t t e where the length l col of the filled sand column was approximately 59 5 cm the slope of l n h t e h t versus time was determined by fitting a straight line using the least squares method the falling ponding height experiments were performed with only b60 sand columns with h 0 values of 8 18 28 and 40 cm the average and standard deviations of δ θ and k s for the failing ponding height experiments are shown in table 1 the calculated δ θ was slightly less than or equal to the porosity indicating almost fully saturated conditions above the wetting front during infiltration process the average value of λ is 0 945 the pressure loss due to pipe fittings was not considered in this study supplementary 1 2 4 optimization parameters of mgam and classical gam the parameter values were optimized by fitting the solution to eq 12 to the measured wetting front depth and wetting front velocity during the experiments this fitting process was conducted using the nlinfit function in matlab when optimizing α and s 0 parameter β is fixed to determine a proper β value the values from 0 1 to 1 with an interval of 0 1 were tested with a fixed β α became the only parameter reflecting the dynamic effect on the suction head because α indicates the sensitivity of s with velocity changes on the other hand to evaluate the simulation performance using the classical gam s 0 was optimized with α 0 which results in a simulation with a constant effective suction head the simulation performances with optimized parameters were quantified using the root mean square error rmse 21 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n where o is the observation p is the simulation and n is the number of pairs of o i and p i 3 results 3 1 parameter optimization with different β values simulations with various fixed β values were optimized and fitted for each experiment where α and s 0 are the fitting parameters fig 2 a shows the rmse of the simulations for the different sand columns at various β values for most of the sand when β increased the rmse decreased moreover because the rmse values are not significantly different for β from 0 5 to 1 changing β in this range did not efficiently improve the simulation performance fig 2 b d uses the b150 sand column experiments as an example to demonstrate the optimized parameter values with different prescribed β when β decreases the optimized α and s 0 increase fig 2b and s 0 and α tend to be more related to h 0 at small β values fig 2c and d reducing β increases the variation in s 0 values at different h 0 values fig 2c further vertical capillary rise experiments were conducted to measure s 0 and determine a proper β value for estimating s 0 the measured terminal imbibition water heights indicated that s 0 were approximately 0 41 0 35 0 27 0 23 and 0 37 for the b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa experiments respectively with β 0 3 which has been recommended in previous studies hsu et al 2017 tsai et al 2018 wang and wallach 2021 the averaged optimal s 0 values were approximately 0 82 0 80 1 30 2 32 and 17 for the b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa experiments respectively the average optimal s 0 values at β 1 were approximately 0 41 0 35 0 53 0 89 and 5 for the b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa experiments respectively in this study the s 0 estimated with β 1 was closer to the measured value than that estimated with β 0 3 because of the consistency of the estimated s 0 value at various h 0 and the optimal s 0 value being closer to the measurement β 1 was applied in this study 3 2 simulation performance of mgam fig 3 shows the rmse of the simulations from mgam β 1 and the classical gam considering the dynamic suction head the rmse of the simulation is smaller than that with a constant suction head this difference shows the improvement of the mgam and implies that the effective suction head changes over the infiltration process and the evolution of s d l d t can be described by the power law expression for the constant ponding height experiments with b150 b60 and b35 fig 3 shows that the improvement is significant for the infiltration at small h 0 for instance the rmse for b150 experiments at h 0 6 cm drops from 1 5 cm to 0 2 cm after the simulation considering the dynamic effect for that at h 0 40 cm the rmse of the mgam significantly increases and the rmse difference between that of gam and mgam decreases 3 3 optimal α and s 0 at different h 0 fig 4 shows the optimal α and s 0 values for β 1 fig 4 a f show a clear tendency for α h 0 in which α decreases when h 0 increases from all experiments this decreasing trend confirms our suspicion that the ponding height can affect the estimated α fig 4 g l show that the optimized s 0 does not have a clear relationship with h 0 the ponding height did not significantly affect the estimation of the effective equilibrium suction head the comparisons between the falling and constant ponding height experiments are shown in fig 4 m and n fig 4m shows that when h 0 increases the evolutions of α at these two conditions both decrease along the black line however the optimal s 0 and h 0 values are uncorrelated fig 4n in addition both the optimal s 0 values from these two conditions were close for the experiments at the constant ponding height condition the average optimal s 0 is 0 34 and 0 4 for the experiments at the falling ponding height condition 3 4 initial ca and optimal α versus h 0 from columns with different sand textures tsai et al 2018 reported a small average α of a coarse textured sand column in this study the comparison of the analysis results from different sand textures is shown in fig 5 fig 5a illustrates the values of h 0 and the simulated initial c a obtained from the mgam simulations the simulated initial ca may be expressed as a function of h 0 as the red curve even when the textures are different fig 5b shows the optimized α versus h 0 in which α is calculated based on eq 15 the fitting result used was from the optimization considering the pressure drop in the supply tube when h 0 decreases the optimized α decreases in addition the average α is large from the fine texture sand column experiment 4 discussion 4 1 effect of β values on fitting parameters in previous literature fixing β 1 yields a good optimization result a β value of approximately 0 3 was applied and recommended hsu et al 2017 tsai et al 2018 wang and wallach 2021 however our optimization results show that the selection of β values sensitively influences the estimation of the parameters fig 2 with respect to s 0 when a small β is applied the optimized value of the equilibrium suction head s 0 is likely overestimated and presents as an initial ponding height related parameter this consequence is physically unreasonable because s 0 is considered to be the soil property caused by the pore size and equilibrium contact angle and this is independent of the ponding height in hsu et al 2017 an optimal s 0 of approximately 1 m was obtained from sand columns with θ i 0 k s of approximately 2 10 4 m s and ranging between 0 35 and 0 4 with these k s and values r e f f estimated using eq 8 is approximately 30 μ m which results in a maximum s 0 of approximately 0 5 m the optimal s 0 in hsu et al 2017 was likely overestimated compared with the texture of the sand column nevertheless although the application of β 1 improves the consistency of s 0 values among the experiments at different h 0 as shown in fig 2c and fig 4g l the optimal α value still decreases as h 0 decreases fig 2d and fig 4a f the inconsistency of α cannot be corrected by changing β value 4 2 optimal s 0 and optimal α versus h 0 considering a suction head in a capillary tube the suction head is determined physically by the inner radius surface tension and contact angle the contact angle changes due to the movement of the liquid interface baver et al 2014 geiger and durnford 2000 hilpert 2012 siebold et al 2000 or with time wang and wallach 2021 based on this concept of the velocity dependent or time variant contact angle the suction head should have no relation with h 0 however our results show that h 0 influences the s d l d t curve the optimal α decreased as h 0 increased fig 4a f the optimal s 0 shows no relationship with h 0 fig 4g l because of the applied β value the parameter α determines the slope of the s d l d t curve a small α reflects that s is insensitive to the infiltration rate and a weak dynamic effect of the effective suction head as shown in fig 4a f for a high h 0 the effective suction head presented a weak dynamic effect at which the velocity dependent suction head may be ignored in particular for the b150 experiments at h 0 40 cm the near zero α values imply that the corresponding effective suction heads are almost constant at a small h 0 a large α indicates that the suction head is strongly dependent on the infiltration rate thus the dynamic effect decreased as the initial ponding height increased to show the effect of h 0 on describing the dynamic suction with mgam fig 6 demonstrates the s d l d t curves for b150 sand column experiments with different h 0 the dots indicate the s calculated from eq 12 with the given and measured h 0 l and d l d t fig 6 shows that s d l d t varies with h 0 the curves of s d l d t decrease rapidly at a low h 0 and slower as h 0 increases when d l d t 1 although at different h 0 s approaches the same value of approximately 0 4 which is close to the capillary rise experiment result of 0 41 the optimal s 0 and α values fig 4 satisfy the properties of the experimental s d l d t the solid curves in fig 6 are drawn with the same s 0 of 0 4 but with different α values large α for small h 0 therefore in the mgam simulation with the same sand s 0 can and should be a fixed value but different α values for different h 0 our findings raise the problem that α becomes a parameter that depends on the boundary condition i e ponding height we regard this problem as a result of the mathematical constraint in the gam at the beginning of infiltration there is a zero cumulative infiltration depth and finite infiltration rate which have been reported in the literature pellichero et al 2012 whereby the initial suction head based on the green ampt analysis equals h 0 the relationship between s and h 0 was studied as early as 1980 freyberg et al 1980 indicated that s is related to the ponding height in the gam by reason of the transition zone of the wetting area the equation 18 in freyberg et al 1980 implies that the initial s will equal h 0 when the initial infiltration rate is finite the effective suction head term in the gam is directly related to the transition zone development and the ponding height the association between the initial ponding height and the suction head is inherent in the gam but has been largely ignored the physical mechanism beyond the initial s h 0 could be as a result of the h 0 effect of dynamic capillary pressure as a high h 0 results in a fast l 0 or due to the development of the transition zone at the very early stage of infiltration nevertheless it is still difficult to directly determine the contact angle or measure the capillary pressure at an early stage in sand columns further techniques such as micro fluid studies by high speed 3 d x ray micro ct or micro fluid chips are required to investigate the change in contact angle when water enters the sand column to satisfy the finite initial d l d t denoted by l 0 22 s l 0 h 0 is inevitable in the mgam eq 12 the red dashed line in fig 6 shows that the measured first points of the s d l d t i e s l 0 followed eq 22 and supports the finite initial d l d t assumption therefore the power law relationship eq 7 or 14 indeed describes the s d l d t relationship and significantly improves the simulation performance but the curves s d l d t as well as α are related to h 0 instead of the mgam parameter α should be expressed as a function of h 0 and account for the effect of h 0 on s 4 3 new parameterization for h 0 related α as shown in appendix a based on eq 22 and experimental results we derived a new parameterization for h 0 related α 23 α h 0 s 0 h 0 1 β c s 0 1 v s β where the parameters c and v s are used to parameterize l 0 in the form of l 0 v s s 0 h 0 1 c empirically c c 0 c a 0 a 1 and v s v 0 c a 0 a 2 appendix a as c and v s are functions of c a 0 α also α is related to the permeability and texture according to eq 23 d α d h 0 is negative when c is smaller than β which is supported by the c values listed in table a 1 a small c value indicates a small increase in h 0 resulting in a considerable increase in the initial velocity therefore d α d h 0 0 indicates that an increase in h 0 drastically enhances the initial infiltration rate eq 23 and the values of a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 could be universal for different boundary conditions and soil textures the curves of case a in fig 7 show the α h 0 using the optimal α from the constant head experiments the optimal a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 were 0 39 17 23 2 24 and 1 32e 9 respectively fig 7 shows that the predicted α from eq 23 are consistent with the optimized α values from the measured data the optimal a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 of eq 23 can be used for estimating α for the falling head experiment fig 7f moreover the parameter values of a 1 0 43 c 0 24 47 a 2 2 34 and v 0 4 96 10 9 calibrated by using the α data from the constant head experiments with glass sands are able to describe α h 0 for the sc ottawa sand and falling head experiments fig 7d f the curves of case b the parameter values a 1 c 0 a 2 v 0 and s 0 could also be estimated by applying the new mgam which replaces α in eq 17 by eq 23 to fit measured l t with the measured l t from all constant head experiments we obtained a 1 0 20 c 0 3 24 a 2 1 61 and v 0 3 8 10 7 and calculated α h 0 which are demonstrated by the curves of case c in fig 7 the estimated s 0 were 0 33 0 40 0 56 0 74 and 1 52 for b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa sand respectively these estimated s 0 were similar to our previous fitting result in which the average fitted s 0 values β 1 were 0 41 0 35 0 53 0 89 and 5 for the b150 b60 b35 sc and ottawa experiments using new mgam with the parameter values from case c fig 8 a demonstrates a portion of the simulated l t for the falling head experiment b60 sand column the simulations based on the new mgam result in rmses 1 6 0 9 1 0 and 2 1 cm for an h 0 of 8 18 28 and 40 cm while an rmse of less than 0 2 cm is obtained using the simulations obtained from the original mgam fitted to each individual experiment fig 3 since α from eq 23 is not specific for a particular experiment the resulting rmse of the new mgam was not as good as that of the original mgam with an optimal α value nevertheless fig 8a shows that the new mgam with parameter values from the constant head experiments case c can approximate the falling ponding head infiltration experiments with different h 0 values on the other hand a lower α for a higher h 0 might be a consequence of that l t is less sensitive to the value of α for a larger h 0 to test the sensitivity of l t to α for high h 0 fig 8b illustrates that α 0 089 the averaged optimized α value for the experiments at h 0 8 cm is not suitable for describing infiltration at the other h 0 values the simulations with α 0 089 significantly underestimated the experimental l at a given t without adjusting α according to h 0 the simulated l t would deviate from the experimental l t therefore the h 0 related α does not result from the parameter sensitivity otherwise α 0 089 should be suitable for simulating infiltration with a high h 0 the original mgam by hsu and hilpert 2011 incorporated the concept of dynamic contact angle into gam based on mgam other properties of the contact angle have been discussed by wang and wallach 2021 however the mgam requires more fitting parameters α and β than the classical gam previous studies hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 tsai et al 2018 have not presented an approach to determine the parameter value except for parameter fitting to experiments also the issue of case specific parameters which are dependent on the ponding height in this study still exists in gam and the original mgam our experimental results show that β 1 is acceptable and leads to the analytical solution eq 17 in addition α can be approximated using eq 23 with given a 1 c 0 a 2 v 0 h 0 and s 0 if the values of a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 could be universal for different boundary conditions and soil textures s 0 would be the only fitting parameter of the new mgam which has the same number of the fitting parameters as the classic gam the most important aspect is that an estimated s 0 from the new mgam was not affected by the ponding height and should be related to only the material itself this study considered only dry homogeneous porous media and conducted the experiment with sand the influence of initial water content hsu et al 2017 has not been incorporated into the new mgam the assumed relationships l 0 v s s 0 h 0 1 c c c 0 c a 0 a 1 and v s v 0 c a 0 a 2 are influenced by k s and δ θ in which δ θ ranged between 0 38 and 0 43 additional studies with boarder δ θ and k s ranges are needed to validate the assumptions for the initial velocity the optimized a 1 c 0 a 2 and v 0 values may not be valid for other sand or soil to expand the universality of the new mgam further theoretical and experimental studies are needed to modify or replace the empirical relationship l 0 v s s 0 h 0 1 c 4 4 α as a function of h 0 fig 5 demonstrates that both α and the initial c a vary with h 0 as the initial c a is dominated by and can be expressed as a function of h 0 eq b 3 α presents as a function of h 0 appendix b as shown in appendix b another α model is obtained 24 α s 0 h 0 s 0 1 8 40 10 4 h 0 1 39 β fig 5b presents α modeling using eq 24 with s 0 0 4 β 1 and optimized α the modeled α was similar to the optimized α the derivation in appendix b illustrates the sand texture and ponding height dominating the initial ca as well as the fitted α values nevertheless fig 5b shows that eq 24 seems to be a universal relationship describing the dynamic effect on the effective suction head for different sand columns and the initial ca in our experiments ranged from 0 05 to 4 when ca is out of this range eq b 3 and eq 24 are unknown eq b 3 may be inappropriate when h 0 is small or the suction head dominates and at a very small or zero ponding height the prediction α or α will be unreasonably large or patently infinite when h 0 decreases the initial ca should not drop as rapidly as that predicted by eq b 3 and α should consequently decline slightly more than that in eq 24 an investigation of the dynamic suction head at small ponding heights is required 4 5 effect of sand texture on dynamic suction head fig 9 depicts the initial ca and α calculated using eq 24 and the curves from eq 23 with an h 0 of between 1 and 40 cm eq 24 provides a straightforward relationship between α and h 0 where an increased h 0 results in an increased initial ca resulting in a small α this result explains the negative correlation between α and the mean particle size found by tsai et al 2018 at the same ponding height infiltration in a coarse sand texture column large mean particle size with a high k s leads to a larger initial ca than that in a low k s sand column the large h 0 and initial ca values for the high k s sand column result in the small α in average however as shown in fig 9 b at h 0 0 4 α for the b150 sand column is smaller than others this indicates that for the same h 0 α may not decrease as k s increases 5 conclusions the gam is simple but useful and provides insightful first order principle information gam based models for which tediously measured soil characteristic curves are not needed are applicable in describing infiltration under field conditions however the gam is unsuitable to describe the early stage of infiltration and has ponding height affected optimal parameter values mgam incorporates the concept of a velocity dependent capillary pressure into gam and improves the capability of the gam to describe the early stage of infiltration whereas the properties of the mgam parameters α and β require further examination particularly when examining the ponding height effect analysis of our experimental results shows that incorporation of a dynamic suction head into gam improves model performance the dynamic suction parameterized by the power law formula provides a good fitting result as indicated in the literature while the exponent β of 1 was suitable for this study and larger than the suggested value in previous studies hsu et al 2017 tsai et al 2018 wang and wallach 2021 the equilibrium suction head estimation is sensitive to the selection of β values reducing β dramatically increases both the optimized α and non dimensional equilibrium suction head a small β easily results in an overestimated equilibrium suction head by selecting the β of 1 the non dimensional equilibrium suction head non dimensionalized by the capillary length can be independent of the ponding height meanwhile the fitted α is a function of the ponding height for all β the ponding height dependency of α is caused by a mathematical constraint from the formula of gam where the initial suction head must equal the negative ponding height when a finite initial infiltration rate is assumed we proposed a novel formula in which the parameters are independent of the ponding height to replace the ponding height dependent α the simulated l t based on the modified mgam with the new formula was close to the experimental value we also provided a universal parameter approximation showing that α is a function of ponding height equilibrium suction head and sand texture and resolving the issue of case specific parameters in mgam in addition among sand columns with different hydraulic conductivities the non dimensional ponding height and initial c a can be well fitted by a power law relationship based on this relationship and the approximation for the parameters we show that an increase in non dimensional ponding height h 0 leads to a decrease in α because the non dimensional ponding height is small with a large capillary length which is corresponding to a small permeability α is usually small for the coarse textured sand column when the non dimensional ponding height is the same the increase in permeability does not necessarily reduce the value of α this study provides a new direction for dealing with dynamic suction head and initial conditions in gam the proposed universal relationships lead the new mgam to simulate the infiltration at different initial ponding heights for different texture samples using the same set of parameter values moreover the new mgam includes the effect of ponding height on the effective suction head which is a major challenge in the gam based model but has been ignored for a long time this improves the ability of the gam based model to estimate the equilibrium suction head and describe the early stages of infiltration a better understanding of the basic properties of mgam should improve its applicability in future applications from our findings mgam can be applied in the falling head test to estimate soil properties when simulating the infiltration into a horizontal stratified layer α in mgam could be modified based on the initial velocity in each layer we also found that α is minimal at a high h 0 and the dynamic effect on effective suction during high ponding or long term infiltration events could be neglected however it is important for small spatial or temporal scale studies e g raindrop infiltration and shallow ponding height water infiltration e g infiltration test of hydrological characterization flooding irrigation and border irrigation moreover the new mgam can be used to study the influences of physical properties on infiltration without the interference of the ponding height the new formula should be considered in transient wettability studies nevertheless the relationship between the initial wetting front velocity suction heads initial water content sand texture and boundary conditions requires further theoretical and experimental studies declaration of competing

science and technology taiwan appendix a derivation of new parameterization for h 0 related α the mathematical constraint in eq 22 provides a way to calculate the dynamic effective suction head based on l 0 and h 0 when β is fixed and given α can be determined by giving two points of s d l d t in which s at d l d t 0 and initial s can be conveniently obtained in other words the s d l d t can be determined when the s d l d t 0 and s d l d t l 0 are known the value of s d l d t 0 is s 0 which is not affected by h 0 the value of s l 0 is h 0 eq 22 by substituting l 0 and eq 22 into eq 14 and rearranging the equation α can be expressed as a1 α s 0 h 0 l 0 β s 0 1 the initial infiltration rate l 0 is then strongly connected with the driving forces s 0 and h 0 the experimental l 0 which can be described by a2 l 0 v s s 0 h 0 1 c as shown in fig a 1 the parameters v s and c are listed in table a 1 the empirical relationships between the fitted c and v s and c a 0 are c 0 28 c a 0 8 2 and v s 1 57 c a 0 exp 14 2 the trend lines imply that the 10 fitted values of c and l s 0 for the 5 sand textures can be reduced to 4 parameters by the assumed relationships moreover the α is related to the sand texture substituting eq a 2 into eq a 1 α can be expressed as a function of h 0 a3 α h 0 s 0 h 0 1 β c s 0 1 v s β appendix b another α model based on relationship between initial ca and h 0
